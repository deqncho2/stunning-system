The Underlying Science
Genetic inheritance living systems conveyed through naturally occurring information storage system
known deoxyribonucleic acid DNA DNA stores information linear chains the chemical bases
adenine cytosine guanine and thymine represented the symbols and respectively Inside living
cells these chains usually exist pairs bound together double helix complementary bases with one
strand always binding the other strand and always binding
humans there are approximately three billion DNA base pairs the molecular blueprint life called
the genome These three billion bases are divided into chromosomes ranging size from million
million bases Normally there are two complete copies the genome contained each cell one
maternal origin and the other paternal origin When cells divide the genomes are replicated enzyme
called DNA polymerase which visits each base the sequence creating complementary copy each
chromosome using building blocks called nucleotides Contained within these chromosomes are approximately
smaller regions called genes each one containing the recipe for protein group related proteins
The natural process protein production takes place steps simplified model the first step
transcription process which enzyme called RNA polymerase uses DNA template synthesize new
strands messenger RNA mRNA The mRNAs are then translated into proteins ribosomes The resulting
proteins play crucial roles cellular structure and function and thus the operation biological systems
Numerous scientific approaches have evolved adapt the emerging awareness the magnitude
complexity embedded biological systems The field genomics developed study the interactions among
components the genome and the massive quantities associated data Subsequently proteomics
transcriptomics and number other related fields emerged
Advances biology over the next decade are expected shaped more detailed understanding the
fundamental complexity biological systems These systems vary among individuals previously
unrecognized ways and are influenced factors including time molecular interactions and cell type
Importantly for the future genomics the first few whole genome sequencing studies disease have
shown that rare mutations play critical role human disease These mutations would not have been detected
earlier studies because too few people perhaps only one person carry the specific mutation addition
now understood that structural changes the genome which whole sections are deleted inverted copied
moved may responsible for significant fraction variation among individuals The scope these structural
changes challenges the very idea reference genome
Recent discoveries have highlighted additional complexities the building blocks DNA and RNA
including the presence modified bases has long been known that humans and many other organisms the
cytosine bases can chemically modified through the addition methyl group process called
methylation resulting modified bases such methylcytosine and methylcytosine These
chemical modifications have been shown play role embryonic development have important impacts
diseases such cancer and can even affect the characteristics offspring for multiple generations More
recently has been discovered that other modified bases such hydroxymethylcytosine oxoguanine and
many others play important physiological roles For example bacteria methyladenine has been
shown play important role pathogenicity
Another source complexity derives from the processing RNA molecules after being transcribed from
the genome The majority all genes code for different forms protein that can made depending the
structure the RNA molecule referred splice variants detailed understanding both the expression
pattern and regulation these variants believed play important role number critical biological
processes
Recent advances our understanding biological complexity have highlighted the need for advanced tools
such the PacBio System and the Sequel System study DNA RNA and proteins the field
DNA sequencing incremental technological advances have provided novel insights into the structure and
function the genome Despite these advances scientists have not been able fully characterize the human
genome and the genomes other living organisms because inherent limitations these tools
Evolution Sequencing
order understand the limitations current DNA sequencing technologies important understand
the sequencing process This consists three phases sample preparation physical sequencing and analysis The
first step sample preparation either break the target genome into multiple small fragments depending
the amount sample DNA available amplify the target region using variety molecular methods the
physical sequencing phase the individual bases each fragment are identified order creating individual
reads The number individual bases identified contiguously defined read length the analysis phase
bioinformatics software used align overlapping reads which allows the original genome assembled
into contiguous sequence The longer the read length the easier assemble the genome
Sanger Sequencing
The first automated sequencing methodology often referred Sanger sequencing was developed
Frederick Sanger With this technology during sample preparation scientists first make different sized
fragments DNA each starting from the same location Each fragment ends with particular base that labeled
with one four fluorescent dyes corresponding that particular base Then all the fragments are distributed
order their length driving them through gel Information regarding the last base used determine the
original sequence Under standard conditions this method results read length that approximately bases
average but may extended bases These are relatively long read lengths compared with many
next generation sequencing methods However Sanger sequencing limited the small amounts data that
can processed per unit time referred throughput
Short read Sequencing
Several commercial DNA sequencing tools emerged response the low throughput Sanger
sequencing Now commonly referred short read sequencing these methods achieve much higher
throughput sequencing large number DNA molecules parallel but with the tradeoff shorter read
lengths
most short read sequencing methodologies tens thousands identical strands are anchored given
location read process consisting successive flushing and scanning operations The flush and scan
sequencing process involves sequentially flushing reagents such labeled nucleotides incorporating
nucleotides into the DNA strands stopping the incorporation reaction washing out the excess reagent scanning
identify the incorporated base and finally treating that base that the strand ready for the next flush and
scan cycle This cycle repeated until the reaction longer viable
Due the large number flushing scanning and washing cycles required the time result for short read
sequencing methods can longer sometimes taking days This repetitive process also limits the average read
length produced most these systems under standard sequencing conditions approximately
bases
The short read sequencing technologies require large number DNA molecules during the sequencing
process generate enough DNA molecules copying method called PCR amplification required during
sample preparation This amplification process can introduce errors known amplification bias The effect
this bias that resulting copies are not uniformly representative the original template DNA cases where
the original template DNA contains regions relatively high content relatively high content the
PCR amplification process tends under represent these regions result these regions which may contain
entire genes can completely missed
summary while short read sequencing methods can offer very high throughput and low cost per
identified base their disadvantages can include limited read length variation sequence coverage with regard
representation bias and accuracy dependence amplification long time result and need for many
samples justify machine operation
The PacBio Solution Single Molecule Real Time Technology
have developed our SMRT technology which enables single molecule real time detection biological
processes address many the limitations previous sequencing technologies providing long read
lengths elimination the dependence amplification during sample preparation which can result
amplification bias very high consensus accuracy and the ability detect DNA base modifications the PacBio
System and the Sequel System provide more comprehensive and higher quality information DNA and
RNA sequence well epigenetic regulation and DNA damage
Pacific Biosciences SMRT Technology
SMRT technology enables the observation DNA synthesis occurs real time harnessing the
natural process DNA replication which nature highly efficient and accurate process actuated the
DNA polymerase The DNA polymerase attaches itself strand DNA replicated examines the
individual base the point attached and then determines which four building blocks nucleotides
required complement that individual base After determining which nucleotide required the polymerase
incorporates that nucleotide into the growing strand being produced After incorporation the enzyme advances
the next base replicated and the process repeated
overcome the challenges inherent real time observation the natural activity the DNA polymerase
enzyme measuring approximately nanometers diameter offer and support three key
innovations
The SMRT Cell
Phospholinked nucleotides
The PacBio and Sequel instruments
The SMRT Cell
One the fundamental challenges with observing single DNA polymerase molecule working real time
the ability detect the incorporation single nucleotide taken from large pool potential nucleotides
during DNA synthesis resolve this problem utilize our nanoscale innovation the zero mode waveguide
ZMW
The ZMWs our SMRT Cells consist holes opaque layer measuring only tens nanometers
diameter forming nanoscale wells The small size the ZMW causes the intensity visible laser light which
has wavelength approximately decay exponentially the ZMW Therefore laser light shined into
the ZMW from below blocked from reaching the sequencing solution above the ZMW providing selective
illumination only the bottom portion the nanoscale well DNA polymerases are anchored the bottom
the glass surface the nanoscale wells using proprietary techniques Nucleotides each type labeled with
different colored fluorophore are then flooded above array ZMWs the required concentration When the
labeled nucleotides diffuse into the bottom portion the nanoscale wells which contain the anchored DNA
polymerases their fluorescence can monitored When the correct nucleotide detected the polymerase
incorporated into the growing DNA strand process that takes milliseconds contrast simple diffusion
which takes microseconds This difference time results higher signal intensity for incorporated versus
unincorporated nucleotides which creates high signal noise ratio Thus the ZMW provides the ability
detect single incorporation event against the background fluorescently labeled nucleotides biologically
relevant concentrations Our DNA sequencing performed proprietary SMRT Cells each having array
ZMWs The SMRT Cells for the PacBio System each contain approximately ZMWs whereas the
SMRT Cells for the Sequel System each contain approximately one million ZMWs Each ZMW capable
containing DNA polymerase molecule bound single DNA template Currently our immobilization process
randomly distributes polymerases into ZMWs across the SMRT Cell typically resulting approximately
one third two thirds the ZMWs having single template
Phospholinked Nucleotides
Our proprietary phospholinked nucleotides have fluorescent dye attached the phosphate chain the
nucleotide rather than the base natural step the synthesis process the phosphate chain cleaved when
the nucleotide incorporated into the DNA strand Thus upon incorporation phospholinked nucleotide the
DNA polymerase naturally frees the dye molecule from the nucleotide when cleaves the phosphate chain Upon
cleaving the label quickly diffuses away leaving natural piece DNA without evidence labeling
The PacBio and Sequel Instruments
The PacBio and Sequel instruments conduct monitor and analyze single molecule biochemical
reactions real time longer manufacture the PacBio instrument however continue service
and support installed PacBio instruments The instruments use extremely sensitive imaging systems
collect the light pulses emitted fluorescent reagents allowing the observation biological processes
Computer algorithms are used translate the information that captured the optics system Using the
recorded information light pulses are converted into either base call with associated quality
metrics Once sequencing started the real time data delivered the system primary analysis pipeline
which outputs base identity and quality values QVs generate consensus sequence from the data
assembly process assembles the different fragments from each ZMW based common sequences
SMRT Sequencing Advantages
Sequencing based our SMRT technology offers the following key benefits
Longer read lengths
SMRT technology has been demonstrated produce read lengths that are significantly longer than
those previous sequencing technologies Long read lengths are necessary span repetitive regions
efficiently assemble genomes Long read lengths are important factor enabling
comprehensive view the genome they can reveal multiple types genetic variation such
structural variants
High consensus accuracy
Users SMRT technology can achieve very high consensus accuracy due the attributes SMRT
sequencing including long read lengths lack reliance amplification during sample preparation
which can result amplification bias and lower systematic bias Users short read sequencing
technologies often cannot achieve comparable results due their shorter read lengths and systematic
bias
More uniformity and less systematic error
The sample preparation step for SMRT sequencing compatible with but does not require
amplification when amplification not used during sample preparation the reads are not subject
amplification bias Importantly this allows for uniform identification all bases present DNA
sample and uniform sequence coverage result SMRT sequencing can detect and identify regions
and entire genes that may missed short read sequencing technologies addition SMRT
sequencing can achieve high accuracy when sequencing through complex and highly repetitive regions
whereas other sequencing methods are unable resolve such regions which can often result poor
accuracy
Ability observe and capture kinetic information
The ability observe the activity DNA polymerase real time enables the PacBio and
Sequel Systems collect measure and assess the dynamics and timing nucleotides being added
growing DNA strand referred kinetics well established the scientific community that
chemical modification DNA such the addition methyl group known methylation can alter
the biological activity the affected nucleotide The PacBio and Sequel Systems detect changes
kinetics automatically capturing and recording changes the duration and time period
between each the fluorescent pulses during typical sequencing analysis Integrated software can
then translate these kinetic signatures into uniquely characterized modified bases such
and Other sequencing systems which rely sample preparation amplification step are
limited signal resolution are unable directly measure this type kinetic data
Flexibility
Our sequencing systems have the ability scale the throughput and cost sequencing across range
small large projects They can used with variety sample types and can output range
DNA lengths

The risks noted above especially with respect the marketing sales and commercialization our
products including into the markets that Roche would have addressed under our agreement with Roche may
heightened the termination our agreement with Roche which became effective the first quarter
addition high percentage our expenses and will continue fixed Accordingly not
generate revenue and when anticipated our losses may greater than expected and our operating results will
suffer
have incurred losses date and expect continue incur significant losses develop our
business and may never achieve profitability
have incurred net losses since inception and cannot certain when will produce sufficient
revenue from our operations support our costs While achieved profitability for the quarter ended
September this result was largely due one time gain lease amendments have incurred net
losses for all other fiscal periods and even profitability achieved the future may not able sustain

accordance with customer expectations
These markets are new and dynamic and there can assurance that they will develop quickly
anticipate that they will reach their full potential that they will receptive any our products result
may required refocus our marketing efforts and may have make changes the specifications
our products enhance our ability enter particular markets more quickly may also need delay fullscale commercial deployment new products develop them order perform quality control and early
access user testing Even are able implement our technology successfully and our sales and
distribution partners may fail achieve sustain market acceptance our current future products across the
full range our intended life science and other applications Given the loss Roche partner need
continue expand and update our internal capabilities collaborate with other partners both order
successfully expand sales our products the markets that seek reach including the markets that Roche
would have addressed under our agreement with Roche which may unable the scale required
support our business
the market for our products grows more slowly than anticipated are unable successfully scale
otherwise ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity for new products meet demand are not able
successfully market and sell our products competitors develop better more cost effective products our
product launches and commercialization are not successful are unable further grow our customer base
not realize the growth with existing customers that are expecting our current and future sales and
revenue would materially harmed and our business may not succeed

defects during the further development manufacturing process instruments consumables related our
products including any delays defects software development product functionality the timing and
success the continued rollout and scaling our products may significantly impacted which may materially
and negatively impact our revenue and gross margin The ability our customers successfully utilize our
products will also depend our ability deliver high quality SMRT Cells and reagents have designed
SMRT Cells and other consumables specifically for the Sequel System and are developing and may need
develop the future other customized SMRT Cells and consumables for our future products have
transferred production the Sequel System SMRT Cells from prototype chip vendor high volume
manufacturer Our production the SMRT Cells for the Sequel System has been and may the future below
desired levels and have experienced and may experience the future manufacturing delays product
quality defects SMRT Cell variability and other issues including unanticipated delays and other issues
connection with our transition the high volume manufacturer The performance our consumables critical
our customers successful utilization our products and any defects performance issues with our
consumables would adversely affect our business All the foregoing could negatively impact our ability sell
our products result other material adverse effects our business financial condition and results
operations
The development our products complex and costly Problems the design quality our products
may have material and adverse effect our brand business financial condition and operating results and
could result losing our certifications from the International Organization for Standardization ISO
were lose ISO certification then our customers might choose not purchase products from and this could
adversely impact our ability develop products approved for clinical uses Unanticipated problems with our
products could divert substantial resources which may impair our ability support our new and existing
products and could substantially increase our costs encounter development challenges discover errors
our products late our development cycle may forced delay product shipments the scaling
manufacturing supply particular the continued rollout our current and future products delayed
not successful less successful than anticipated then may not able achieve acceptable return any
our substantial research and development efforts and our business may materially and adversely affected
The expenses losses associated with delayed unsuccessful product development lack market
acceptance our existing and new products could materially and adversely affect our business financial
condition and results operations
Our research and development efforts may not result the benefits that anticipate and our failure
successfully market sell and commercialize our current and future products could have material adverse

termination became effective the first quarter therefore need expand our internal capabilities
seek new partnerships collaborations both order successfully market sell and commercialize our
products the markets seek reach including the markets that Roche would have addressed under the
Roche Agreement
must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions may incur significant costs
during these transitions and they may not result the benefits anticipate
our products and services fail deliver the performance scalability results expected our current and
future customers are not delivered timely basis our reputation and credibility may suffer our current and
future sales and revenue may materially harmed and our business may not succeed For instance are not
able realize the benefits anticipate from the development and commercialization the Sequel System
our future products including those that may developed for clinical uses could have material adverse
effect our business financial condition and results operations addition the introduction future
products may lead our limiting ceasing development further enhancements our existing products
focus our resources new products and could result reduced marketplace acceptance and loss sales our
existing products materially adversely affecting our revenue and operating results The introduction new
products may also have negative impact our revenue the near term our current and future customers
may delay cancel orders existing products anticipation new products and may also pressured
decrease prices for our existing products Further have experienced and may the future experience
difficulty managing forecasting customer reactions purchasing decisions transition requirements with
respect newly launched products have incurred and may continue incur significant costs completing
the transitions including costs write downs our products current future customers transition new
products not successfully manage these product transitions our business reputation and financial
condition may materially and adversely affected
rely other companies for the manufacture certain components and sub assemblies and intend
outsource additional sub assemblies the future may not able successfully scale the manufacturing
process necessary build and test multiple products full commercial basis which could materially harm
our business
Our products are complex and involve large number unique components many which require
precision manufacturing The nature our products requires customized components that are currently
available only from limited number sources and some cases single sources have chosen source
certain critical components from single source including suppliers for our SMRT Cells reagents and
instruments Furthermore have transferred production the SMRT Cells for our Sequel System from
prototype chip vendor high volume manufacturer and have experienced and may the future
experience unanticipated delays and other issues connection with such transition are required
purchase these components from alternative sources could take several months longer qualify the
alternative sources are unable secure sufficient supply these product components timely basis
these components not meet our expectations specifications for quality and functionality our operations
and manufacturing will materially and adversely affected could unable meet customer demand and
our business and results operations may materially and adversely affected
The operations our third party manufacturing partners and suppliers could disrupted conditions
unrelated our business operations that are beyond our control including but not limited international
trade restrictions our manufacturing partners suppliers are unable fail fulfill their obligations for
any reason may not able manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand our obligations
under sales agreements timely manner and our business could harmed result Our current
manufacturing process characterized long lead times between the placement orders for and delivery
our products have received insufficient components manufacture our products timely basis meet
customer demand our sales and our gross margin may adversely affected and our business could materially
harmed are unable reduce our manufacturing costs and establish and maintain reliable high volume
manufacturing suppliers scale our operations our business could materially harmed
may unable consistently manufacture our instruments and consumable kits including SMRT Cells
the necessary specifications quantities necessary meet demand acceptable cost

anticipated demand may experience downtime our manufacturing facilities inability manufacture
products and components that consistently meet specifications necessary quantities and commercially
acceptable costs will have negative impact and may have material adverse effect our business financial
condition and results operations
Rapidly changing technology life sciences and diagnostics could make our products obsolete unless
continue develop manufacture and commercialize new and improved products and pursue new market
opportunities
Our industry characterized rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product
introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards Our future success depends our ability
continually improve our products develop and introduce new products that address the evolving needs our
customers timely and cost effective basis and pursue new market opportunities These new market
opportunities may outside the scope our proven expertise areas where the market demand unproven
and new products and services developed may not gain market acceptance may not adequately perform
order capture market share Our inability develop and introduce new products and gain market
acceptance our existing and new products could harm our future operating results Unanticipated difficulties
delays replacing existing products with new products commercializing our existing new products
sufficient quantities and acceptable quality meet customer demand could diminish future demand for our
products and materially harm our future operating results
Increased market adoption our products customers may depend the availability sample preparation

customers make large purchases purchase order basis rather than pursuant long term contracts
consequence the concentrated nature our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly
revenue and results operations may fluctuate from quarter quarter and are difficult estimate For example
any cancellation orders any acceleration delay anticipated product purchases the acceptance
shipped products our larger customers could materially affect our revenue and results operations any
quarterly period may unable sustain increase our revenue from our larger customers offset any
discontinuation decrease purchases our larger customers with purchases new other existing
customers the extent one more our larger customers experience significant financial difficulty
bankruptcy insolvency this could have material adverse effect our sales and our ability collect
receivables which could harm our financial condition and results operations
addition certain customers including some our larger customers have negotiated may the future
negotiate volume based discounts other more favorable terms from our sales and distribution partners
which can and have had negative effect our gross margins revenue
expect that such concentrated purchases will continue contribute materially our revenue for the
foreseeable future and that our results operations may fluctuate materially result such larger customers

could harmed and may unable achieve our goals
Our success depends upon the continuing services members our senior management team and
scientific and engineering personnel particular our scientists and engineers are critical our technological
and product innovations and will need hire additional qualified personnel Our industry particularly the
San Francisco Bay Area characterized high demand and intense competition for talent and the turnover
rate can high compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science
companies academic institutions and research institutions particularly those focusing genomics Our
employees could leave our company with little prior notice and would free work for competitor
addition changes immigration policies particularly and other visa programs could restrain the
flow technical and professional talent into the and may inhibit our ability hire qualified personnel
one more our senior executives other key personnel were unable unwilling continue their present
positions may not able replace them easily all and other senior management may required
divert attention from other aspects the business addition not have key person life insurance
policies covering any member our management team other key personnel The loss any these
individuals any inability attract retain qualified personnel including scientists engineers and others
could prevent from pursuing collaborations and materially and adversely affect our support existing
products product development and introductions business growth prospects results operations and financial
condition
significant portion our sales depends customers spending budgets that may subject significant
and unexpected variation which could have negative effect the demand for our products
Our instruments represent significant capital expenditures for our customers Current and potential
customers for our current future products include academic and government institutions genome centers
medical research institutions clinical laboratories pharmaceutical agricultural biotechnology diagnostic and
chemical companies Their spending budgets can have significant effect the demand for our products
Spending budgets are based wide variety factors including the allocation available resources make
purchases funding from government sources which highly uncertain and subject change the spending
priorities among various types research equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during
economically uncertain periods Any decrease capital spending change spending priorities our current
and potential customers could significantly reduce the demand for our products Any delay reduction
purchases current potential customers our inability forecast fluctuations demand could harm our
future operating results
Our business could negatively impacted changes the United States political environment
There significant ongoing uncertainty with respect potential legislation regulation and government
policy the federal level well the state and local levels Any such changes could significantly impact our
business well the markets which compete Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed
during election campaigns and more recently that might materially impact include but are not limited
changes spending priorities and potential reductions research funding Uncertainty about government
funding has posed and may continue pose risk customers may choose postpone reduce spending
response actual anticipated restraints funding the extent changes the political environment have
negative impact our markets our business results operation and financial condition could
materially and adversely impacted the future
may not able convert our orders backlog into revenue
Our backlog represents product orders from our customers that have confirmed and for which have
not yet recognized revenue may not receive revenue from these orders and any order backlog report may
not indicative our future revenue
Many events can cause order delayed not completed all some which may out our
control delay fulfilling customer orders customers reconsider their orders those customers may seek
cancel modify their orders with Customers may otherwise seek cancel delay their orders even
are prepared fulfill them our orders backlog not result sales our operating results may suffer
Delivery our products could delayed disrupted factors beyond our control and could lose
customers result
rely third party carriers for the timely delivery our products result are subject carrier
disruptions and increased costs that are beyond our control Any failure deliver products our customers
safe and timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause lose customers our
relationship with any these third party carriers terminated impaired any these carriers are unable
deliver our products the delivery and acceptance our products our customers may delayed which
could harm our business and financial results The failure deliver our products safe and timely manner
may harm our relationship with our customers increase our costs and otherwise disrupt our operations
are and may become subject governmental regulations that may impose burdens our operations
and the markets for our products may narrowed
are subject both directly and indirectly the adverse impact government regulation our
operations and markets For example export our instruments may subject strict regulatory control
number jurisdictions have expanded and are continuing expand the international jurisdictions into
which supply products which increase the risks surrounding governmental regulations relating our
business The failure satisfy export control criteria obtain necessary clearances could delay prevent
shipment products which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability Moreover the
life sciences industry which expected continue one the primary markets for our technology has
historically been heavily regulated There are for example laws several jurisdictions restricting research
genetic engineering which may narrow our markets Given the evolving nature this industry legislative
bodies regulatory authorities may adopt additional regulations that may adversely affect our market
opportunities Additionally ethical and other concerns surrounding the use genetic information diagnostics
therapies become widespread there may less demand for our products
Our business also directly affected wide variety government regulations applicable business
enterprises generally and companies operating the life science industry particular Failure comply with
government regulations obtain maintain necessary permits and licenses could result variety fines
other censures interruption our business operations which may have negative impact our ability
generate revenue and the cost operating our business addition changes laws and government regulations
could cause material adverse effect our business will need adapt our business comply with such
changes For example governmental prohibition the use human vitro diagnostics would adversely
impact our commercialization products which have expended significant research and development
resources which would turn have material adverse impact our business and prospects
Our products could become subject regulation the Food and Drug Administration other domestic
and international regulatory agencies which could increase our costs and impede delay our
commercialization efforts thereby materially and adversely affecting our business and results operations
Our products are not currently subject Food and Drug Administration FDA clearance approval
since they are not intended for use the diagnosis treatment disease However the future certain our
products related applications such those that may developed for clinical uses could subject FDA
regulation the FDA regulatory jurisdiction could expanded include our products Even where product
exempted from FDA clearance approval the FDA may impose restrictions the types customers
which our partners can market and sell our products Such regulation and restrictions may materially and
adversely affect our business financial condition and results operations the event that fail obtain and
maintain necessary regulatory clearances approvals for products that develop for clinical uses
clearances approvals for future products and indications are delayed not issued our commercial operations
may materially harmed Furthermore even are granted regulatory clearances approvals they may
include significant limitations the indicated uses for the product which may limit the market for the product
not have experience obtaining FDA approvals and assurance can given that will able
obtain maintain such approvals Furthermore any approvals that may obtain can revoked safety
efficacy problems develop
Many countries have laws and regulations that could affect our products such clearances
premarket approvals Mark requirements and failure adhere applicable statutory regulatory
requirements our business partners would have material adverse effect our operations and financial
condition The number and scope these requirements are increasing Unlike many our competitors this
area where not have expertise our other third party sales and distribution partners may not able
obtain regulatory approvals such countries may incur significant costs obtaining maintaining our
foreign regulatory approvals addition the export certain our products which have not yet been
cleared for domestic commercial distribution may subject FDA other export restrictions Any action
brought against for violations these laws regulations even successfully defended could cause
incur significant legal expenses and divert our management attention from the operation our business
Doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business
currently conduct operations various countries and jurisdictions and continue expand new
international jurisdictions sell directly and through distribution partners throughout Europe the Asia Pacific
region Mexico and South Africa result our distribution partners may subject additional
regulations and increased diversion management time and efforts Conducting and launching operations
international scale requires close coordination activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and
consumes significant management resources fail coordinate and manage these activities effectively our
business financial condition results operations could materially and adversely affected and failure
comply with laws and regulations applicable business operations foreign jurisdictions may also subject
significant liabilities and other penalties International operations entail variety other risks including
without limitation

activities such the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act well foreign laws relating our activities
other countries such the United Kingdom Bribery Act Failure comply with these laws may subject
claims financial and other penalties the United States and foreign countries that could materially
and adversely impact our operations financial condition These risks have become increasingly prevalent
have expanded our sales into countries that are generally recognized having higher risk corruption
face risks related the current global economic environment which could delay prevent our
customers from purchasing our products which could turn harm our business financial condition and results
operations The state the global economy continues uncertain The current global economic conditions
and uncertain credit markets and concerns regarding the availability credit pose risk that could impact
customer demand for our products well our ability manage normal commercial relationships with our
customers suppliers and creditors including financial institutions the current global economic environment
deteriorates our business could negatively affected
Moreover changes the value the relevant currencies may affect the cost certain items required our
operations Changes currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices which are able sell
products the same market Our revenue from international customers may negatively impacted increases
the dollar relative our international customers local currencies could make our products more
expensive impacting our ability compete result financial other instability such locations which
could result decreased sales our products Our costs materials from international suppliers may also
increase the value the dollar decreases relative their local currency Foreign policies and actions
regarding currency valuation could result actions the United States and other countries offset the effects
such fluctuations Such actions may materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results
operations
Violations complex foreign and laws and regulations could result fines and penalties criminal
sanctions against our officers our employees prohibitions the conduct our business and our
ability offer our products and services one more countries and could also materially affect our brand our
international growth efforts our ability attract and retain employees our business and our operating results
Even implement policies procedures designed ensure compliance with these laws and regulations
there can assurance that our distribution partners our employees contractors agents will not violate our
policies and subject potential claims penalties
Our international sales and international operations subject additional risks that can adversely affect our
results operations and financial condition
are continuing expand our international operations part our growth strategy and have
experienced increasing concentration sales certain regions outside the currently have
significant portion our sales and customer support personnel Europe and the Asia Pacific region However
rely more third party sales and distribution partners for non sales Our ability convince customers
adopt our platform and expand usage our platform often requires our direct engagement with customers
the extent are unable engage with non customers may struggle grow sales international
markets which could harm our business financial condition results operations and prospects
fail comply with healthcare and other governmental regulations could face substantial penalties
and our business results operations and financial condition could adversely affected
The products that may develop for clinical uses may highly regulated and there can assurance
that the regulatory environment which would operate will not change significantly and adversely the
future Any arrangements with physicians hospitals and clinics may expose broadly applicable fraud and
abuse and other laws and regulations that may restrict the financial arrangements and relationships through which
market sell and distribute our products and services Our employees consultants and commercial partners
may engage misconduct other improper activities including non compliance with regulatory standards and
requirements Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability conduct business
include without limitation
federal and state laws and regulations regarding billing and claims payment applicable products that
may develop for clinical uses and regulatory agencies enforcing those laws and regulations
the federal Anti Kickback Statute which prohibits among other things any person from knowingly
and willfully offering soliciting receiving providing remuneration directly indirectly
exchange for induce either the referral individual for the purchase order

circumstances many which differ from each other significant ways and often are not preempted
HIPAA thus complicating compliance efforts
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the Health Care and Education
Affordability Reconciliation Act Affordable Care Act was enacted The Affordable Care Act among
other things amends the intent requirement the federal Anti Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud
statutes person entity longer needs have actual knowledge this statute specific intent violate
addition the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that claim including items
services resulting from violation the federal Anti Kickback Statute constitutes false fraudulent claim for
purposes the False Claims Act
Because the breadth these laws and the narrowness available statutory and regulatory exemptions
possible that some our activities could subject challenge under one more such laws Any action
brought against for violations these laws regulations even successfully defended could cause incur
significant legal expenses and divert our management attention from the operation our business may
subject private qui tam actions brought individual whistleblowers behalf the federal state
governments with potential liability under the federal False Claims Act including mandatory treble damages and
significant per claim penalties
The growth our business and sales organization and our expansion outside the United States may
increase the potential violating these laws The risk our being found violation these other laws and
regulations further increased the fact that many have not been fully interpreted the regulatory authorities
the courts and their provisions are open variety interpretations Any action brought against for
violation these other laws regulations even successfully defend against could cause incur
significant legal expenses and divert our management attention from the operation our business our
operations are found violation any the federal state and foreign laws described above any other
current future fraud and abuse other healthcare laws and regulations that apply may subject
penalties including significant criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines imprisonment for
individuals exclusion from participation government programs such Medicare and Medicaid and could
required curtail cease certain our operations Any the foregoing consequences could seriously harm
our business and our financial results
fail maintain proper and effective internal controls our ability produce accurate financial
statements timely basis could impaired which would adversely affect our business and our stock price
Ensuring that have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures place
produce accurate financial statements timely basis costly and time consuming effort that needs
evaluated frequently may the future discover areas our internal financial and accounting controls and
procedures that need improvement Operating public company requires sufficient resources within the
accounting and finance functions order produce timely financial information ensure the level segregation
duties and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting customary for public company
Our management responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability our financial reporting and the preparation
financial statements for external purposes accordance with accounting principles generally accepted the
United States GAAP Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting
will prevent detect all errors and all fraud control system matter how well designed and operated can
provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system objectives will met Because the
inherent limitations all control systems evaluation controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due error fraud will not occur that all control issues and instances fraud any within
our company will have been detected
Pursuant Section the Sarbanes Oxley Act perform periodic evaluations our internal control
over financial reporting While have the past performed this evaluation and concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was operating effectively there can assurance that the future material
weaknesses significant deficiencies will not exist otherwise discovered addition are unable
produce accurate financial statements timely basis investors could lose confidence the reliability our
financial statements which could cause the market price our common stock decline and make more
difficult for finance our operations and growth
Our ability use net operating losses offset future taxable income may subject substantial limitations
and changes tax laws may cause make adjustments our financial statements
Under Section the Internal Revenue Code corporation that undergoes ownership change
subject limitations its ability utilize its pre change net operating losses NOLs offset future taxable
income believe that have had one more ownership changes result which our existing NOLs are
currently subject limitation Future changes our stock ownership could result additional ownership
changes under Section may not able utilize material portion our NOLs even attain
profitability
Furthermore the changes deductions credits and expense recognition resulting the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act the Tax Act enacted December will have material impact the value our
deferred tax assets and liabilities which could turn adversely affect our future taxable income and effective tax
rate addition result the Tax Act have had make significant adjustments and expect continue
make adjustments for future periods the provisional amounts for income taxes and effective tax rates The
total provisional adjustments our tax provision for the year ended December non cash impact
million
Our sales cycle unpredictable and lengthy which makes difficult forecast revenue and may increase the
magnitude quarterly annual fluctuations our operating results
The sales cycle for our sequencing instruments lengthy because they represent major capital expenditure
and generally require the approval our customers senior management This may contribute substantial
fluctuations our quarterly annual operating results particularly during the periods which our sales volume
low Factors that may cause fluctuations our quarterly operating results include without limitation
market acceptance for our products our ability attract new customers publications studies
competitors third parties the timing and success new product introductions our competitors
other changes the competitive dynamics our industry such consolidation the amount and timing our
costs and expenses changes our pricing policies those our competitors general economic industry and
market conditions the effects seasonality the regulatory environment expenses associated with warranty
costs unforeseen product quality issues the hiring training and retention key employees including our
ability grow our sales organization litigation other claims against for intellectual property infringement
otherwise our ability obtain additional financing necessary and changes trends new technologies
and industry standards Because these fluctuations likely that some future quarters our operating results
will fall below the expectations securities analysts investors that happens the market price our stock
would likely decrease Past fluctuations our quarterly and annual operating results have resulted decreases
our stock price Such fluctuations also mean that investors may not able rely our operating results
any particular period indication future performance Sales existing customers and the establishment
business relationship with other potential customers lengthy process generally taking several months and
sometimes longer Following the establishment the relationship the negotiation purchase terms can timeconsuming and potential customer may require extended evaluation and testing period anticipation
product orders may incur substantial costs before the sales cycle complete and before receive any
customer payments result the event that sale not completed canceled delayed may have
incurred substantial expenses making more difficult for become profitable otherwise negatively
impacting our financial results Furthermore because our lengthy sales cycle the realization revenue from
our selling efforts may substantially delayed our ability forecast our future revenue may more limited
and our revenue may fluctuate significantly from quarter quarter
Seasonality may cause fluctuations our revenue and results operations
operate December year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may
cause sales our products and particularly our sequencing instruments vary quarterly yearly basis
contribute the lengthy sales cycle for our sequencing instruments and increase the magnitude quarterly
annual fluctuations our operating results believe that this seasonality results from number factors
including the procurement and budgeting cycles many our customers especially government funded
customers which cycles often coincide with government fiscal year ends For example the government
fiscal year end occurs our third quarter and may result increased sales our products during this quarter
government funded customers have unused funds that may forfeit future budgets that may reduced
such funds remain unspent such fiscal year end Furthermore celebrations the Lunar New Year which
occurs during our first quarter may last for week longer during which time many our customers offices
China and elsewhere the Asia Pacific region may closed due the holiday and may cause decreased
sales our consumables during such quarter These factors may contribute substantial fluctuations our
quarterly operating results Because these fluctuations possible that some quarters our operating results
will fall below the expectations securities analysts investors that happens the market price our stock
would likely decrease These fluctuations among other factors also mean that our operating results any
particular period may not relied upon indication future performance Seasonal cyclical variations
our sales may become more less pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial
condition results operations and prospects
Our operations involve the use hazardous materials and must comply with environmental health and
safety laws which can expensive and may adversely affect our business operating results and financial
condition
Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the use hazardous materials
including chemicals and biological materials and some our products include hazardous materials
Accordingly are subject federal state local and foreign laws regulations and permits relating
environmental health and safety matters including among others those governing the use storage handling
exposure and disposal hazardous materials and wastes the health and safety our employees and the
shipment labeling collection recycling treatment and disposal products containing hazardous materials
Liability under environmental laws and regulations can joint and several and without regard fault
negligence For example under certain circumstances and under certain environmental laws could held
liable for costs relating contamination our our predecessors past present facilities and third party
waste disposal sites could also held liable for damages arising out human exposure hazardous
materials There can assurance that violations environmental health and safety laws will not occur
result human error accident equipment failure other causes The failure comply with past present
future laws could result the imposition substantial fines and penalties remediation costs property damage
and personal injury claims investigations the suspension production product sales loss permits
cessation operations Any these events could harm our business operating results and financial condition
also expect that our operations will affected new environmental health and safety laws and regulations
ongoing basis more stringent enforcement existing laws and regulations New laws changes
existing laws may result additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations require
change the content our products how manufacture them which could have material adverse effect
our business operating results and financial condition
Our facilities California are located near earthquake faults and the occurrence earthquake other
catastrophic disaster could cause damage our facilities and equipment which could require cease
curtail operations
Our facilities the San Francisco Bay Area are located near earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable
damage from earthquakes are also vulnerable damage from other types disasters including fire floods
power loss communications failures and similar events any disaster were occur our ability operate our
business our facilities would seriously potentially completely impaired addition the nature our
activities could cause significant delays our research programs and commercial activities and make difficult
for recover from disaster The insurance maintain may not adequate cover our losses resulting
from disasters other business interruptions Accordingly earthquake other disaster could materially and
adversely harm our ability conduct business
Ethical legal privacy and social concerns governmental restrictions surrounding the use genetic
information could reduce demand for our technology
Our products may used provide genetic information about humans agricultural crops and other living
organisms The information obtained from our products could used variety applications which may
have underlying ethical legal privacy and social concerns including the genetic engineering modification
agricultural products testing for genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions Governmental
authorities could for safety social other purposes call for limits regulation the use genetic testing
Such concerns governmental restrictions could limit the use our products which could have material
adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations
Disruption critical information technology systems material breaches the security our systems could
harm our business customer relations and financial condition
Information technology IT helps operate efficiently interface with customers maintain financial
accuracy and efficiently and accurately produce our financial statements systems are used extensively
virtually all aspects our business including sales forecast order fulfillment and billing customer service
logistics and management data from running samples our products Our success depends part the
continued and uninterrupted performance our systems systems may vulnerable damage from
variety sources including telecommunications network failures power loss natural disasters human acts
computer viruses computer denial service attacks unauthorized access customer employee data
company trade secrets and other attempts harm our systems Certain our systems are not redundant and our
disaster recovery planning not sufficient for every eventuality Despite any precautions may take such
problems could result among other consequences disruption our operations which could harm our
reputation and financial results
not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary build and sustain the proper
infrastructure could subject transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss customers business
disruptions loss damage intellectual property through security breach our data management systems
not effectively collect store process and report relevant data for the operation our business whether due
equipment malfunction constraints software deficiencies human error our ability effectively plan
forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will impaired
perhaps materially Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial
condition results operations cash flows and the timeliness with which report our internal and external
operating results
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose liability which
would cause our business and reputation suffer
the ordinary course our business collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property
our proprietary business information and that our customers suppliers and business partners and personally
identifiable information our customers and employees our data centers and our networks The secure
processing maintenance and transmission this information critical our operations Despite our security
measures our infrastructure may vulnerable attacks hackers computer viruses malicious codes
unauthorized access attempts and cyber phishing attacks breached due employee error malfeasance
faulty password management other disruptions Third parties may attempt fraudulently induce employees
other persons into disclosing user names passwords other sensitive information which may turn used
access our systems commit identity theft carry out other unauthorized illegal activities Any such breach
could compromise our networks and the information stored there could accessed publicly disclosed lost
stolen Any such access disclosure other loss information could result legal claims proceedings
liability under laws that protect the privacy personal information disruption our operations and damage
our reputation which could divert our management attention from the operation our business and materially
and adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position Moreover may need increase our
efforts train our personnel detect and defend against cyber phishing attacks which are becoming more
sophisticated and frequent and may need implement additional protective measures reduce the risk
potential security breaches which could cause incur significant additional expenses
Regulations related conflict minerals has caused incur and will continue cause incur
additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs certain materials used the
manufacture our products
are subject requirements under the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
that require conduct diligence and report whether not our products contain conflict minerals The
implementation these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing the
materials used the manufacture components used our products Furthermore the complex nature our
products requires components and materials that may available only from limited number sources and
some cases from only single source have incurred and will continue incur additional costs comply
with the disclosure requirements including costs related conducting diligence procedures determine the
sources conflict minerals that may used necessary the production our products and applicable
potential changes components processes sources supply consequence such verification activities
may face reputational harm determine that certain our products contain minerals that are not
determined conflict free are unable alter our processes sources supply avoid using such
materials Reputational harm could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results

Risks Related Our Intellectual Property
Failure secure patent other intellectual property protection for our products and improvements our
products may reduce our ability maintain any technological competitive advantage over our current and
potential competitors
Our ability protect and enforce our intellectual property rights uncertain and depends complex legal
and factual questions Our ability establish maintain technological competitive advantage over our
competitors may diminished because these uncertainties For example
our licensors might not have been the first make the inventions covered each our
pending patent applications issued patents
our licensors might not have been the first file patent applications for these inventions
possible that neither our pending patent applications nor the pending patent applications our
licensors will result issued patents
the scope the patent protection our licensors obtain may not sufficiently broad prevent
others from practicing our technologies developing competing products designing around our patented
technologies independently developing similar alternative technologies
our and our licensors patent applications patents have been are and may the future subject
interference opposition similar administrative proceedings which could result those patent
applications failing issue patents those patents being held invalid the scope those patents
being substantially reduced
our partners may not adequately protect our trade secrets
may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable
the patents others may limit our freedom operate and prevent from commercializing our
technology accordance with our plans
The occurrence any these events could impair our ability operate without infringing upon the
proprietary rights others prevent from establishing maintaining competitive advantage over our
competitors
Variability intellectual property laws may adversely affect our intellectual property position
Intellectual property laws and patent laws and regulations particular have been subject significant
variability either through administrative legislative changes such laws regulations changes
differences judicial interpretation and expected that such variability will continue occur Additionally
intellectual property laws and regulations differ country Variations the patent laws and regulations
interpretations patent laws and regulations the United States and other countries may diminish the value
our intellectual property and may change the impact third party intellectual property Accordingly
cannot predict the scope the patents that may granted with certainty the extent which will
able enforce our patents against third parties the extent which third parties may able enforce their
patents against
Some the intellectual property that important our business owned other companies institutions
and licensed and changes the rights have licensed may adversely impact our business
license from third parties some the intellectual property that important our business fail
meet our obligations under these licenses have dispute regarding the terms the licenses these third
parties could terminate the licenses the third parties who license intellectual property fail maintain the
intellectual property that have licensed lose rights that intellectual property the rights have licensed
may reduced eliminated which could subject claims intellectual property infringement
Termination these licenses reduction elimination our licensed rights may result our having
negotiate new reinstated licenses with less favorable terms could subject claims intellectual
property infringement contract breach litigation other administrative proceedings that could result
damage awards against and injunctions that could prohibit from selling our products addition some
our licenses from third parties limit the field which can use the licensed technology Therefore order for
use such licensed technology potential future applications that are outside the licensed field use
may required negotiate new licenses with our licensors expand our rights under our existing licenses
cannot assure you that will able obtain such licenses expanded rights reasonable terms all
the event dispute with our licensors were occur our licensors may seek renegotiate the terms our
licenses increase the royalty rates that pay obtain and maintain those licenses limit the field scope
the licenses terminate the license agreements addition have limited rights participate the
prosecution and enforcement the patents and patent applications that have licensed result cannot
certain that these patents and applications will prosecuted and enforced manner consistent with the best
interests our business Further because the rapid pace technological change our industry may need
rely key technologies developed licensed third parties and may not able obtain licenses and
technologies from these third parties all reasonable terms The occurrence these events may have
material adverse effect our business financial condition results operations
The measures that use protect the security and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary
rights may not adequate which could result the loss legal protection for and thereby diminish the
value such intellectual property and other rights
addition patents also rely upon trademarks trade secrets copyrights and unfair competition laws
well license agreements and other contractual provisions protect our intellectual property and other
proprietary rights Despite these measures any our intellectual property rights could challenged
invalidated circumvented misappropriated addition attempt protect our intellectual property and
proprietary information requiring our employees and consultants enter into confidentiality and assignment
inventions agreements and entering into confidentiality agreements with our third party development
manufacturing sales and distribution partners who may also acquire develop and commercialize alternative
competing products provide services our competitors For example Roche had certain access our trade
secrets and other proprietary information pursuant our agreement with Roche subject the confidentiality
provisions thereof certain which provisions survive the termination the agreement however Roche
developing potentially competing sequencing products There can assurance that our measures will provide
adequate protection for our intellectual property and proprietary information These agreements may
breached and may not have adequate remedies for any such breach addition our trade secrets and other
proprietary information may disclosed others others may gain access disclose our trade secrets and
other proprietary information Enforcing claim that third party illegally obtained and using our trade secrets
expensive and time consuming and the outcome unpredictable Additionally others may independently
develop proprietary information and techniques that are substantially equivalent ours The occurrence these
events may have material adverse effect our business financial condition results operations
Our intellectual property may subject challenges the United States foreign jurisdictions that could
adversely affect our intellectual property position
Our pending issued and granted and foreign patents and patent applications have been are and may
the future subject challenges third parties asserting prior invention others invalidity various
grounds through proceedings such interferences reexaminations opposition proceedings Addressing these
challenges our intellectual property has been and any future challenges can costly and distract
management attention and resources For example previously incurred significant legal expenses litigate
and settle complaint seeking review patent interference decision the Patent and Trademark Office
Additionally result these challenges our patents pending patent applications may determined
unpatentable invalidated unenforceable whole part Accordingly adverse rulings these
proceedings may negatively impact the scope our intellectual property protection for our products and
technology and may materially and adversely affect our business
Some our technology subject march in rights the government
Some our patented technology was developed with federal government funding When new
technologies are developed with government funding the government obtains certain rights any resulting
patents including nonexclusive license authorizing the government use the invention for non commercial
purposes These rights may permit the government disclose our confidential information third parties and
exercise march in rights use allow third parties use our patented technology The government can
exercise its march rights determines that such action necessary achieve practical application the
government funded technology alleviate health safety needs iii meet requirements federal
regulations give preference industry addition government funded inventions must
reported the government and such government funding must disclosed any resulting patent applications
Furthermore our rights such inventions are subject government license rights and foreign manufacturing
restrictions
are involved legal proceedings enforce our intellectual property rights
Our intellectual property rights involve complex factual scientific and legal questions operate
industry characterized significant intellectual property litigation Even though may believe that have
valid patent particular technology other companies have from time time taken and may the future
take actions that believe violate our patent rights For example are involved several legal proceedings
for patent infringement with ONT Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd and Harvard University several United
States and European jurisdictions have received adverse rulings against with respect our complaint
with the USITC one these proceedings and there are assurances that can successful appealing
otherwise overturning any such rulings Legal actions enforce our patent rights have been and will continue
expensive and may divert significant management time and resources Adverse parties from previous legal
actions have brought and may the future bring claims against and our intellectual property Litigation
significant ongoing expense recognized sales general and administrative expense with uncertain
outcome and has been and may the future material expense for the Company Our enforcement actions
may not successful have given rise legal claims against and could result some our intellectual
property rights being determined invalid not enforceable Furthermore adverse determination
judgement could lead award damages against the issuance injunction against that could
prevent from selling any products found infringing the intellectual property rights another party
have been are currently and could the future subject legal proceedings with third parties who
may claim that our products infringe misappropriate their intellectual property rights
Our products are based complex rapidly developing technologies may not aware issued
previously filed patent applications that belong third parties that mature into issued patents that cover some
aspect our products their use addition because patent litigation complex and the outcome inherently
uncertain our belief that our products not infringe third party patents which are aware that such
third party patents are invalid and unenforceable may determined incorrect result third parties
have claimed and may the future claim that infringe their patent rights and have filed and may the
future file lawsuits engage other proceedings against enforce their patent rights For example ONT
and Harvard University have filed claims against the High Court England and Wales and the District
Court Mannheim Germany for patent infringement are aware other issued patents and patent
applications owned third parties that could construed read our products and services Although
not believe that our products services infringe any valid issued patents the third party owners these patents
and applications may the future claim that infringe their patent rights and file lawsuits against
addition enter new markets our competitors and other third parties may claim that our products infringe
their intellectual property rights part business strategy impede our successful entry into those markets
Furthermore parties making claims against may able obtain injunctive other relief which effectively
could block our ability develop further commercialize sell products services and could result the
award substantial damages against Patent litigation between competitors our industry common
Additionally have certain obligations many our customers and suppliers indemnify and defend them
against claims third parties that our products their use infringe any intellectual property these third
parties defending ourselves against any these claims have the past incurred and could the future
incur substantial costs and the attention our management and technical personnel could diverted For
example previously incurred significant legal expenses litigate and settle complaint alleging patent
infringement Even have agreement that indemnifies against such costs the indemnifying party may
unable uphold its contractual obligations avoid settle legal claims may necessary desirable
the future obtain licenses relating one more products relating current future technologies which
could negatively affect our gross margins may not able obtain these licenses commercially
reasonable terms all may unable modify our products that they not infringe the intellectual
property rights third parties some situations the results litigation settlement claims may require
cease allegedly infringing activities which could prevent from selling some all our products The
occurrence these events may have material adverse effect our business financial condition results
operations
addition the course our business may from time time have access alleged have access
confidential proprietary information others which though not patented may protected trade
secrets Others could bring claims against asserting that improperly used their confidential proprietary
information that misappropriated their technologies and incorporated those technologies into our products
determination that illegally used the confidential proprietary information misappropriated
technologies others our products could result paying substantial damage awards being prevented
from selling some all our products which could materially and adversely affect our business
have not yet registered some our trademarks all our potential markets and failure secure those
registrations could adversely affect our business
Some our trademark applications may not allowed for registration and our registered trademarks may
not maintained enforced addition the Patent and Trademark Office and comparable agencies
many foreign jurisdictions third parties are given opportunity oppose pending trademark applications
and seek cancel registered trademarks Opposition cancellation proceedings may filed against our
trademarks and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings
Our use open source software could adversely affect our ability sell our products and subject
possible litigation
portion the products technologies developed and distributed incorporate open source
software and may incorporate open source software into other products technologies the future Some
open source software licenses require that disclose the source code for any modifications such open source
software that make and distribute one more third parties and that license the source code for such
modifications third parties including our competitors cost monitor the use open source software
our products avoid uses manner that would require disclose grant licenses under our source
code that wish maintain proprietary however there can assurance that such efforts have been
will successful some circumstances distribution our software that includes linked with open source
software could require that disclose and license some all our proprietary source code that software
which could include permitting the use such software and source code cost the user Open source
license terms are often ambiguous and there little legal precedent governing the interpretation these licenses
Successful claims made the licensors open source software that have violated the terms these licenses
could result unanticipated obligations including being subject significant damages being enjoined from
distributing products that incorporate open source software and being required make available our proprietary
source code pursuant open source license which could substantially help our competitors develop products
that are similar better than ours otherwise materially and adversely affect our business

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition and Results Operations based upon our
Consolidated Financial Statements which have prepared accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP The preparation these financial statements requires management
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities revenue cost revenue
and operating expenses and related disclosure contingent assets and liabilities Management based its
estimates historical experience and various other assumptions that believes reasonable under the
circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ materially from these
estimates under different assumptions conditions
accounting policy deemed critical requires accounting estimate made based
assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain the time the estimate made different estimates
reasonably could have been used changes the estimate that are reasonably likely occur could
materially impact the financial statements
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue generated primarily from the sale products and services addition revenue from
collaboration agreements Product revenue consists sales our instruments and related consumables Service
and other revenue primarily consist revenue earned from product maintenance agreements instrument lease
agreements and grant revenue Contractual revenue relates revenue recognized from the collaboration
agreement under which received upfront fee and may receive contingent milestone payments Our
deliverables under the arrangement includes licenses intellectual property rights and research and development
services
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery has occurred services
have been rendered the price fixed determinable and collectability reasonably assured For instances
where final acceptance the product system required revenue deferred until all acceptance criteria have
been met Revenue for product sales generally recognized upon customer acceptance For certain qualified
distributors revenue recognized based upon shipment terms Revenue for product maintenance agreements
recognized when earned which generally ratably over the service period order assess whether the price
fixed determinable evaluate whether refund rights exist refund rights exist payment terms are based
future performance defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed determinable assess
collectability based number factors including customer creditworthiness determine that collection
amounts due not reasonably assured revenue recognition deferred until receipt payment
regularly enter into arrangements comprised one more contracts from which revenue derived
from multiple deliverables including mix products and services Revenue recognition for contracts with
multiple deliverables based the individual units accounting determined exist the contract
delivered item considered separate unit accounting when the delivered item has value the customer
stand alone basis and general right return exists the delivery performance undelivered
item considered probable and under our control Items are considered have stand alone value when they are
sold separately any vendor when the customer could resell the item stand alone basis Our revenue
arrangements generally not have general right return When deliverable does not meet the criteria
considered separate unit accounting group with other deliverables that when combined meet the
criteria and the appropriate allocation arrangement consideration and revenue recognition determined
Consideration allocated the inception the contract all deliverables based their relative selling price
order determine the relative selling price deliverable apply order vendor specific objective
evidence VSOE third party evidence VSOE not available and lastly our best estimate selling price
for the deliverable neither VSOE nor third party evidence available
order establish VSOE must regularly sell the product service standalone basis with
substantial majority sales priced within relatively narrow range insufficient number standalone sales
exist and VSOE cannot determined then consider whether third party evidence can used establish
selling price Due the lack similar products and services sold other companies within our industry
have not established selling price using third party evidence neither VSOE nor third party evidence selling
price exists determine our best estimate selling price using combination prices set our pricing
committee adjusted for applicable discounts and customer orders received date
Deferred service revenue primarily represents product maintenance agreement revenue that expected
recognized over the related service period generally one three years
For instrument lease agreements entered into with our customers they are classified operating type
leases and revenue from these leases recognized straight line basis over the respective lease term once the
lessee takes has the right take control possession the property under the lease Effectively this occurs
once installation complete and acceptance has been obtained
Cost Revenue
Cost revenue reflects the direct cost product components third party manufacturing services and our
internal manufacturing overhead and customer service infrastructure costs incurred produce deliver maintain
and support our instruments consumables and services There are incremental costs associated with our
contractual revenue all product development costs are reflected research and development expense
Manufacturing overhead predominantly comprised labor and facility costs determine and
capitalize manufacturing overhead into inventory based standard cost model that approximates actual costs
Service costs include the direct costs components used support repair and maintenance customer
instruments well the cost personnel materials shipping and support infrastructure necessary support
the installed customer base
Stock Based Compensation
Stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards based the grant date fair
value estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model have limited historical information available
support the underlying estimates certain assumptions required value stock options The expected term
options estimated based the simplified method not have sufficient trading history solely rely
the volatility our own common stock for establishing expected volatility Therefore based our expected
volatility the historical stock volatilities our common stock well several comparable publicly listed
companies over period equal the expected term the options The risk free interest rate based the
Treasury yield curve effect the time grant for the expected term the stock option estimate our
forfeiture rate based analysis our actual forfeitures and will continue evaluate the adequacy the
forfeiture rate based actual forfeiture experience analysis employee turnover behavior and other factors
The impact from forfeiture rate adjustment will recognized full the period adjustment and the
actual number future forfeitures differs from that estimated may required record adjustments
stock based compensation expense future periods recognize compensation expense straight line basis
over the requisite service period elected use the simplified method calculate the beginning pool
excess tax benefits
The assumptions used calculating the fair value share based payment awards represent management
best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application management judgement
result factors change and use different assumptions our stock based compensation expense could
materially different the future addition our actual forfeiture rate materially different from our estimate
the stock based compensation expense could significantly different from what have recorded the current
period
Impairment Long lived Assets
assess impairment long lived assets which include property and equipment least annual
basis and when events changes circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not recoverable
Circumstances which could trigger review include but are not limited significant decreases the market
price the asset significant adverse changes the business climate legal factors accumulation costs
significantly excess the amount originally expected for the acquisition construction the asset current
period cash flow operating losses combined with history losses forecast continuing losses
associated with the use the asset expectations that the asset will more likely than not sold disposed
significantly before the end its estimated useful life date have not recorded any impairment charges
Inventories
early adopted the Accounting Standards Update ASU Simplifying the Measurement
Inventory the year ended December effective January result our inventories are stated
the lower average cost net realizable value Cost determined using the first first out FIFO
method Cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process
technology costs while determining net realizable value inventories involves numerous judgements including
projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs complete products work process
inventories The adoption this update did not have material impact our consolidated financial statements
enter into inventory purchases and commitments that can meet future shipment schedules based
forecasted demand for our products The business environment which operate subject rapid
changes technology and customer demand perform detailed assessment inventory each period which
includes review among other factors demand requirements product life cycle and development plans
component cost trends product pricing product expiration and quality issues Based our analysis record
adjustments inventory for potentially excess obsolete impaired goods when appropriate order report
inventory net realizable value Inventory adjustments may required actual demand component costs
supplier arrangements product life cycles differ from our estimates Any such adjustments would result
charge our results operations
Leases
categorize leases their inception either operating capital leases certain our lease
agreements received tenant improvement allowances rent holidays and other incentives Rent expense
recorded straight line basis over the term the lease The difference between rent expense accrued and
amounts paid under the lease agreement recorded deferred rent the accompanying balance sheets
Leasehold improvements are capitalized cost and depreciated over the shorter their expected useful life
the life the lease the extent leasehold improvement allowances are afforded the Prior Landlord
record the tenant improvements leasehold improvement assets with corresponding deferred rent liability
establish assets and liabilities for the construction costs incurred under build suit lease arrangements the
extent are involved the construction structural improvements take some level financial
construction risk prior commencement lease
For build suit lease arrangements evaluate the extent our financial and operational involvement
the tenant improvements determine whether are considered the owner the construction project under
GAAP When are considered the owner project record the shell the facility its fair value
the date construction commences with corresponding facility financing obligation Improvements the facility
during the construction project are capitalized and the extent funded lessor afforded incentives with
corresponding increases the facility financing obligation Payments make under leases which are
considered the owner the facility are allocated land rental expense based the relative values the land
and building the commencement construction reductions the facility financing obligation and interest
expense recognized the outstanding obligation the extent gross future payments not equal the recorded
liability the liability settled upon return the facility the lessor Any difference between the book value
the assets and remaining facility obligation are recorded other income expense net For existing
arrangements the differences are expected immaterial
Income Taxes
are subject income taxes the United States and certain states which operate and use
estimates determining our provisions for income taxes Significant management judgement required
determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances recorded
against net deferred tax assets accordance with GAAP These estimates and judgements occur the
calculation tax credits benefits and deductions and the calculation certain tax assets and liabilities
which arise from differences the timing recognition revenue and expense for tax and financial statement
purposes well the interest and penalties related uncertain tax positions Significant changes these
estimates may result increase decrease our tax provision the current subsequent period
December maintained full valuation allowance against all our deferred tax assets which
totaled million including net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits
million and million respectively Our deferred tax assets include federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards approximately million and million respectively and federal and state
research and development credit carryforwards approximately million and million respectively
The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring the state net operating loss carryforwards
have expirations and beyond the federal research and development credits begin expiring and
the California tax research and development credits can carried forward indefinitely
assess all material positions taken any income tax return including all significant uncertain positions
all tax years that are still subject assessment challenge relevant taxing authorities Assessing
uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination the position sustainability and measured the
largest amount benefit that greater than likely being realized upon ultimate settlement each
balance sheet date unresolved uncertain tax positions must reassessed and will determine whether the
factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and the amount the recognized tax benefit still
appropriate
December the Tax Act was signed into law The Tax Act contains significant changes
corporate taxation including reduction the corporate tax rate from additional limitations the
tax deductibility interest substantial changes the taxation foreign earnings immediate deductions for
certain new investments instead deductions for depreciation expense over time and modification repeal
many business deductions and credits These changes have material impact the value our deferred tax
assets and liabilities and could affect our future taxable income and effective tax rate

ITEM QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate and Market Risk
Our exposure market risk confined our cash cash equivalents and our investments The goals our
investment policy are preservation capital fulfillment liquidity needs and fiduciary control cash and cash
equivalents and investments also seek maximize income from our investments without assuming
significant risk achieve our goals maintain portfolio cash equivalents and investments variety
securities high credit quality The securities our investment portfolio are not leveraged are classified
available for sale and are due their short term nature subject minimal interest rate risk currently not
hedge interest rate exposure Because the short term maturities our investments not believe that
increase market rates would have any material negative impact the value our investment portfolio
Foreign Exchange Risk
The majority our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted dollars
However portion our operations consists development and sales activities outside the United States
therefore have foreign exchange exposures relating non dollar revenue operating expense accounts
receivable accounts payable and currency balances Our primary exposure with the Euro
strengthening the dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which have exposure after taking
into account offsetting positions December would have resulted million decrease the
carrying amounts those net assets Actual gains and losses the future may differ materially from the
hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based changes the timing and amount foreign currency
exchange rate movements and our actual exposure
Our international operations are subject risks typical international operations including but not limited
differing economic conditions changes political climate differing tax structures other regulations and
restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility

Fair Value Financial Instruments
The carrying amount our accounts receivable prepaid expenses other current assets accounts payable
accrued expenses and other liabilities current approximate fair value due their short maturities The carrying
value our other liabilities non current approximates fair value due the time maturity and prevailing
market rates
The fair value hierarchy established under GAAP requires entity maximize the use observable
inputs and minimize the use unobservable inputs when measuring fair value financial instrument
categorization within the fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level input that significant the fair
value measurement The three levels inputs that may used measure fair value are follows
Level quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities
Level inputs other than Level that are observable either directly indirectly such quoted
prices active markets for similar assets liabilities quoted prices for identical similar assets
liabilities markets that are not active other inputs that are observable can corroborated
observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities and
Level unobservable inputs that are supported little market activity and that are significant
the fair value the assets liabilities
consider active market one which transactions for the asset liability occurs with sufficient
frequency and volume provide pricing information ongoing basis Conversely view inactive
market one which there are few transactions for the asset liability the prices are not current price
quotations vary substantially either over time among market makers Where appropriate our non performance
risk that our counterparty considered determining the fair values liabilities and assets respectively
classify our cash deposits and money market funds within Level the fair value hierarchy because
they are valued using bank balances quoted market prices classify our investments Level instruments
based market pricing and other observable inputs did not classify any our investments within Level
the fair value hierarchy
Assets and liabilities measured fair value are classified their entirety based the lowest level input that
significant the fair value measurement Our assessment the significance particular input the entire fair
value measurement requires management make judgements and consider factors specific the asset liability
