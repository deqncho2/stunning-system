ITEM RISK FACTORS
Our operating results and financial condition could harmed the markets into which sell our products decline
not grow anticipated
Visibility into our markets limited Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent the volume and
timing orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult forecast and may cancelled our customers
addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based the expected seasonality our markets
However the markets serve not always experience the seasonality that expect customer spending policies and budget
allocations particularly for capital items may change Any decline our customers markets general economic conditions
would likely result reduction demand for our products and services Also our customers markets decline may not
able collect outstanding amounts due Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results
operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability Also such environment pricing pressures could
intensify Since significant portion our operating expenses relatively fixed nature due sales research and development
and manufacturing costs were unable respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating
margins
not introduce successful new products and services timely manner address increased competition through
frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products
and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer
generally sell our products industries that are characterized increased competition through frequent new product
and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards Without the timely introduction new
products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time which case
our revenue and operating results could suffer The success our new products and services will depend several factors
including our ability
properly identify customer needs and predict future needs
innovate and develop new technologies services and applications
appropriately allocate our research and development spending products and services with higher growth
prospects
successfully commercialize new technologies timely manner
manufacture and deliver new products sufficient volumes and time
differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings
price our products competitively
anticipate our competitors development new products services technological innovations and
control product quality our manufacturing process
addition fail accurately predict future customer needs and preferences fail produce viable technologies
may invest research and development products and services that not lead significant revenue which would adversely
affect our profitability Even successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services may incur
substantial costs doing and our operating results may suffer addition promising new products may fail reach the market
realize only limited commercial success because real perceived concerns our customers Furthermore collaborate
with pharmaceutical customers develop drugs such companion diagnostics assays providing drug components like active
pharmaceutical ingredients face risks that those drug programs may cancelled upon clinical trial failures
General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition
Our business sensitive negative changes general economic conditions both inside and outside the United States
Slower global economic growth and uncertainty the markets which operate may adversely impact our business resulting
reduced demand for our products delays the shipment orders increases order cancellations
increased risk excess and obsolete inventories
increased price pressure for our products and services and
greater risk impairment the value and detriment the liquidity our investment portfolio
Failure adjust our purchases due changing market conditions failure accurately estimate our customers demand
could adversely affect our income
Our income could harmed are unable adjust our purchases reflect market fluctuations including those caused
the seasonal nature the markets which operate The sale our products and services are dependent large degree
customers whose industries are subject seasonal trends the demand for their products During market upturn may
not able purchase sufficient supplies components meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our
results the past have experienced shortage parts for some our products addition some the parts that require
custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due their unique design the length time necessary for
design work Should supplier cease manufacturing such component would forced reengineer our product addition
discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies increase prices due capacity constraints other
factors order secure components for the production products may continue enter into non cancelable purchase
commitments with vendors times make advance payments suppliers which could impact our ability adjust our inventory
declining market demands demand for our products less than expect may experience additional excess and obsolete
inventories and forced incur additional expenses
Demand for some our products and services depends the capital spending policies our customers research and
development budgets and government funding policies
Our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies
and public and private research institutions Many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers
and consolidations spending priorities institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles have
significant effect the capital spending policies these entities Fluctuations the research and development budgets these
organizations could have significant effect the demand for our products and services Research and development budgets
fluctuate due changes available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional
and governmental budgetary policies The timing and amount revenue from customers that rely government funding
research may vary significantly due factors that can difficult forecast including changes spending authorizations and
budgetary priorities for our products and services demand for our products and services adversely affected our revenue and
operating results would suffer
Economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely
affect our results operations
Because sell our products worldwide our business subject risks associated with doing business internationally
anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue represent majority our total revenue International revenue
and costs are subject the risk that fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results
when translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes The unfavorable effects changes foreign currency exchange
rates has decreased revenues approximately percentage points the year ended October addition many our
employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside
the United States Accordingly our future results could harmed variety factors including
interruption transportation flows for delivery parts and finished goods our customers
changes specific country region political economic other conditions
trade protection measures and import export licensing requirements
negative consequences from changes tax laws
difficulty staffing and managing widespread operations
differing labor regulations
differing protection intellectual property
unexpected changes regulatory requirements and
geopolitical uncertainty turmoil including terrorism and war
centralized most our accounting and tax processes two locations India and Malaysia These processes include
general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions conditions change those
countries may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability pay our suppliers and collect our receivables Our
results operations well our liquidity may adversely affected and possible delays may occur reporting financial
results
addition although the majority our products are priced and paid for dollars significant amount certain
types expenses such payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid local currencies Our hedging programs
reduce but not always entirely eliminate within any given twelve month period the impact currency exchange rate
movements and therefore fluctuations exchange rates including those caused currency controls could impact our business
operating results and financial condition resulting lower revenue increased expenses For expenses beyond that twelvemonth period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure addition our currency hedging programs involve third party
financial institutions counterparties The weakening failure financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our
hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things reduction available counterparties increasingly
unfavorable terms and the failure the counterparties perform under hedging contracts
Our strategic initiatives adjust our cost structure could have long term adverse effects our business and may not
realize the operational financial benefits from such actions
have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses adjust our cost structure and may engage
similar activities the future These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract
management could slow improvements our products and services and limit our ability increase production quickly demand
for our products increases addition delays implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs failure meet targeted
improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits realize from such actions Any the above circumstances
could have adverse effect our business and operating results and financial condition
Our business will suffer are not able retain and hire key personnel
Our future success depends partly the continued service our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing
executive and administrative personnel fail retain and hire sufficient number these personnel will not able
maintain expand our business The markets which operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue respond with
reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that
operate However there intense competition for certain highly technical specialties geographic areas where continue
recruit and may become more difficult hire and retain our key employees
Our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting businesses and divestitures may result
financial results that are different than expected
the normal course business frequently engage discussions with third parties relating possible acquisitions
strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect complete several transactions per year
addition may decide exit particular business within our product portfolio result such transactions our financial
results may differ from our own the investment community expectations given fiscal quarter over the long term
may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products newly acquired company way that enhances
the performance our combined businesses product lines Acquired businesses may also expose new risks and new
markets and may have difficulty addressing these risks cost effective and timely manner Transactions such acquisitions
have resulted and may the future result unexpected significant costs and expenses the future may required
record charges earnings during the period determine there impairment goodwill intangible assets the full
amount the value the assets the case strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses
third parties write down investment values loans and convertible notes related the strategic investment
Integrating the operations acquired businesses within Agilent could difficult costly and time consuming process
that involves number risks Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require integrate and collaborate
with different company culture management team business models business infrastructure and sales and distribution
methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel Depending the size
and complexity acquisition our successful integration the entity depends variety factors including introducing
new products and meeting revenue targets expected the retention key employees and key customers increased exposure
certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use resources Further the integration
acquired businesses likely result our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult
manage Any difficulties the assimilation acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results
cause fail meet our financial reporting obligations
Even are able successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent may not able realize the revenue
and other synergies and growth that anticipated from the acquisition the time frame that expected and the costs
achieving these benefits may higher than what expected result the acquisition and integration acquired businesses
may not contribute our earnings expected may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected all and
may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits this transaction
successful divestiture depends various factors including our ability effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities
and employees the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property divested from the intellectual property that
wish keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets business addition customers the
divested business not receive the same level service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses

Inventory Valuation assess the valuation our inventory periodic basis and make adjustments the value for
estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage Such estimates are difficult
make under most economic conditions The excess balance determined this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory
charge Our excess inventory review process includes analysis sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with
manufacturing maximize recovery excess inventory actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
management additional write downs may required actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory
previously written down may sold customers resulting lower cost sales and higher income from operations than expected
that period
Share Based Compensation account for share based awards accordance with the authoritative guidance Under
the authoritative guidance share based compensation expense primarily based estimated grant date fair value and recognized
straight line basis The fair value share based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the BlackScholes option pricing model Stock options were granted years prior fiscal year Shares granted under the Long Term
Performance Program based Total Shareholders Return LTPP TSR were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model
The estimated fair value restricted stock unit awards LTPP based Operating Margin LTPP OM and LTPP based
Earnings per share LTPP EPS determined based the market price Agilent common stock the date grant adjusted
for expected dividend yield The compensation cost for LTPP and LTPP EPS reflects the cost awards that are probable
vest the end the performance period the case LTPP the performance targets for all the three years performance
period set the time grant The performance targets for LTPP EPS grants for year and year the performance period
will set the first quarter year and year respectively The probable shares vest are estimated based the forecasted
and EPS the time the grant and updated every quarter with latest forecast and actual information The Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP allows eligible employees purchase shares our common stock percent the fair market value
the purchase date All awards granted and our senior management employees have one year post vest holding
restriction The estimated discount associated with post vest holding restrictions calculated using the Finnerty model
Both the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use highly subjective and complex
assumptions including the option expected life and the price volatility the underlying stock For the stock option grants
and LTPP TSR grants and used the year average historical stock price volatility group our peer
companies believed our historical volatility prior the separation Keysight was longer relevant use For the
LTPP TSR grants and calculation the post vest discount using the Finnerty model used our own post separation
historical stock price volatility See Note Share based Compensation the consolidated financial statements for more
information
The assumptions used calculating the fair value share based awards represent our best estimates but these estimates
involve inherent uncertainties and the application management judgment Although believe the assumptions and estimates
have made are reasonable and appropriate changes assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results
Retirement and Post Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions Retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are
significant cost doing business They represent obligations that will ultimately settled sometime the future and therefore
are subject estimation Pension accounting intended reflect the recognition future benefit costs over the employees
average expected future service Agilent based the terms the plans and investment and funding decisions estimate the
impact these future payments and our decisions concerning funding these obligations are required make assumptions
using actuarial concepts within the framework accounting principles generally accepted the Two critical assumptions
are the discount rate and the expected long term return plan assets Other important assumptions include expected future salary
increases expected future increases benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates
and portfolio composition evaluate these assumptions least annually
The discount rate used determine the present value future benefit payments the measurement date October
for both and non plans For and the discount rates were based the results matching expected plan
benefit payments with cash flows from hypothetically constructed bond portfolio discount rates for the plans were
the same the previous year For and the discount rate for non plans was generally based published rates for
high quality corporate bonds and were approximately the same the previous year changed our discount rate
percent the impact would less than million pension expense and million non pension expense Lower
discount rates increase present values the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates
decrease present values the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense
The company uses alternate methods amortization allowed the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial
gains and losses consistent basis for the years presented For Plans gains and losses are amortized over the average
future lifetime participants using the corridor method For most Non Plans and Post Retirement Benefit Plans gains
and losses are amortized using separate layer for each year gains and losses The expected long term return plan assets
estimated using current and expected asset allocations well historical and expected returns Plan assets are valued fair
value changed our estimated return assets percent the impact would million pension expense and
million non pension expense For actual return assets was above expectations which along with contributions
during the year decreased next year pension cost well resulting improvement the funded status year end The
net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs recorded were million benefit million expense

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Under the authoritative guidance have the option perform qualitative
assessment determine whether further impairment testing necessary The accounting standard gives entity the option
first assess qualitative factors determine whether performing the two step test necessary entity believes result
its qualitative assessment that more likely than not greater than chance that the fair value reporting unit less
than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will required Otherwise further testing will required
The guidance includes examples events and circumstances that might indicate that reporting unit fair value less

industry market considerations entity specific events such increasing costs declining financial performance loss key
personnel other events such expectation that reporting unit will sold sustained decrease the stock price

measures the amount impairment applying fair value based tests the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting
unit defined the authoritative guidance reporting unit operating segment one level below operating segment
aggregate components operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units
fiscal year assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted three segments life
sciences and applied markets diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab performed qualitative test for goodwill
impairment the three reporting units September Based the results our qualitative testing believe that
more likely than not that the fair value these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values Each quarter
review the events and circumstances determine goodwill impairment indicated There was impairment goodwill
during the years ended October and
Purchased intangible assets consist primarily acquired developed technologies proprietary know how trademarks and
customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate the asset useful life that reflect the pattern which the
economic benefits are consumed used straight line method ranging from months years process research and
development IPR initially capitalized fair value intangible asset with indefinite life and assessed for impairment
thereafter When the IPR project complete reclassified amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized
over its estimated useful life IPR project abandoned will record charge for the value the related intangible
asset our consolidated statement operations the period abandoned
Our indefinite lived intangible assets are IPR intangible assets The accounting guidance allows qualitative approach
for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment similar the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and
allows the option first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used
determining the fair value the indefinite lived intangible asset determine whether more likely than not greater
than chance that the indefinite lived intangible asset impaired organization may choose bypass the qualitative
assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset any period and proceed directly calculating its fair value performed
qualitative test for impairment indefinite lived intangible assets September Based the results our qualitative
testing believe that more likely than not that the fair value these indefinite lived intangible assets greater than their
respective carrying values Each quarter review the events and circumstances determine impairment indefinite lived

assets Based triggering events the years ended October and recorded impairment million and
million respectively due the cancellation certain IPR projects
Accounting for Income Taxes must make certain estimates and judgments determining income tax expense for
financial statement purposes These estimates and judgments occur the calculation tax credits benefits and deductions and
the calculation certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences the timing recognition revenue and
expense for tax and financial statement purposes well interest and penalties related uncertain tax positions Significant
changes these estimates may result increase decrease our tax provision subsequent period
Significant management judgment also required determining whether deferred tax assets will realized full
part When more likely than not that all some portion specific deferred tax assets such net operating losses foreign
tax credit carryforwards will not realized valuation allowance must established for the amount the deferred tax assets
that cannot realized consider all available positive and negative evidence jurisdiction jurisdiction basis when
assessing whether more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable consider evidence such our past operating
results the existence losses recent years and our forecast future taxable income October continue
recognize valuation allowance for certain and state and foreign deferred tax assets intend maintain valuation
allowance these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists support its reversal
have not provided for all federal income and foreign withholding taxes the undistributed earnings some
our foreign subsidiaries because intend reinvest such earnings indefinitely Should decide remit this income the
future period there tax law change with respect taxation accumulated foreign earnings our provision
for income taxes may increase materially that period
The calculation our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties the application complex tax law and regulations
multitude jurisdictions Although the guidance the accounting for uncertainty income taxes prescribes the use
recognition and measurement model the determination whether uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue
require significant judgment management accordance with the guidance the accounting for uncertainty income
taxes for all and other tax jurisdictions recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based our estimate
whether and the extent which additional taxes and interest will due The ultimate resolution tax uncertainties may
differ from what currently estimated which could result material impact income tax expense our estimate income

Valuation Assumptions
For all periods presented the fair value share based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the
Black Scholes option pricing model For all periods presented shares granted under the LTPP TSR were valued using Monte
Carlo simulation The ESPP allows eligible employees purchase shares our common stock percent the fair market
value the purchase date
The estimated fair value restricted stock unit awards LTPP and LTPP EPS was determined based the market
price Agilent common stock the date grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and appropriate discount related
the one year post vesting The compensation cost for LTPP and LTPP EPS awards reflect the cost awards that are
probable vest the end the performance period
The following assumptions were used estimate the fair value employee stock options and LTPP grants

Both the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use highly subjective and complex
assumptions including the option expected life and the price volatility the underlying stock For the stock option grants
and LTPP TSR grants and used the year average historical stock price volatility group our peer
companies believed our historical volatility prior the separation Keysight was longer relevant use For
LTPP TSR grants used our own historical stock price volatility
All LTPP awards granted and our executives have one year post vest holding restriction The estimated
discount associated with post vest holding restrictions calculated using the Finnerty model The model calculates the potential
lost value the employee were able sell the shares during the lack marketability period instead being required hold
the shares For the model used the year average historical stock price volatility group our peer companies and
expected dividend yield compute the discount For the model used Agilent own post separation historical stock price

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The authoritative guidance defines fair value the price that would received from selling asset paid transfer
liability orderly transaction between market participants the measurement date When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities required permitted recorded fair value consider the principal most
advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset liability
Fair Value Hierarchy
The guidance establishes fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use inputs used valuation techniques into three
levels financial instrument categorization within the fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level input that significant
the fair value measurement There are three levels inputs that may used measure fair value
Level applies assets liabilities for which there are quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities
Level applies assets liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are
observable either directly indirectly for the asset liability such quoted prices for similar assets liabilities active
markets quoted prices for identical similar assets liabilities less active markets other inputs that can derived principally
from corroborated observable market data
Level applies assets liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs the valuation methodology that are
significant the measurement the fair value the assets liabilities
