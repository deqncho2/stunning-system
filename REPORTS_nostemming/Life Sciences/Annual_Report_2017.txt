especially well Driven strong demand for products that have been
areas investment for Bio Rad over the
past few years
this segment
our business grew percent excluding the impact currency
Included this result are sales from our acquisition RainDance
Technologies company acquired early somewhat offset
slowness our process chromatography business This slowness does
not represent fundamental problem but rather characteristic the
business itself where customers order large quantities these products
cycles which can greater than one year The year was good
case point
Our Clinical Diagnostics business achieved somewhat more modest
growth for the year posting percent currency neutral increase
While most geographies around the world performed well the
market proved more challenging for When look back the
reasons for this appears largely the result one time events
opposed systemic issue
The last few years have been period investment for the company
products technologies and operations These investments have been
signi cant and may categorized four key areas New Markets New

kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories the global diagnostics market Our products
currently address specific niches within the vitro diagnostics IVD test market and seek focus the
higher margin higher growth segments this market
supply more than different products that cover more than clinical diagnostic tests the IVD test
market estimate that the worldwide sales for products the markets serve were approximately billion
IVD tests are conducted outside the human body and are used identify and measure substances patient
tissue blood urine Our products consist reagents instruments and software typically provided our
customers integrated package allow them generate reproducible test results Revenue this business
highly recurring laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent particular
supplier equipment reagents and consumable products installed base diagnostic test systems therefore
typically creates ongoing source revenue through the sale test kits for each sample analyzed installed
system Our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion
laboratories and physician office laboratories
Raw Materials and Components
utilize wide variety chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical
parts computing and peripheral devices Most these materials and components are available from numerous
sources and generally have not experienced difficulty securing adequate supplies However certain
instances acquire components and materials from sole supplier Due the regulatory environment which
operate may unable quickly establish additional replacement sources for some components
materials
Patents Trademarks and Licenses
own numerous and international patents and trademarks also pay royalties the sales certain
products under several patent license agreements view these patents trademarks and license agreements
valuable assets however believe that our ability develop and manufacture our products depends primarily
our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions
Seasonal Operations and Backlog

and any further violations the FCPA could harm our reputation with these customers which could materially
adversely affect our business results operations and financial condition Any further violations the FCPA also
could result more punitive actions the SEC and DOJ which also could materially adversely affect our
business results operations and financial condition
Our international operations expose additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have
material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition
have significant international operations have direct distribution channels over countries outside the
United States and our foreign subsidiaries generated our net sales Compliance with complex
foreign and laws and regulations that apply our international operations increases our cost doing business
These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements
including with respect the invalidation the European Union safe harbor the European Court Justice
October compliance with the Privacy Shield adopted the European Commission July
and the requirements for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation which takes effect May
labor relations laws tax laws anti competition regulations import and trade restrictions export
requirements laws such the FCPA and other federal laws and regulations established the office
Foreign Asset Control foreign laws such the Bribery Act other foreign laws which prohibit corrupt
payments governmental officials certain payments remunerations customers
Given the high level complexity these laws there risk that may inadvertently breach some provisions
for example through fraudulent negligent behavior individual employees our failure comply with certain
formal documentation requirements otherwise Our success depends part our ability anticipate these
risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls However have
dispersed international sales organization and use distributors and agents many our international

government regulations below
The industries and market segments which operate are highly competitive and may not able
compete effectively
The life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive Some our competitors have
merged and some our competitors have greater financial resources than and are less leveraged than
are making them better equipped license technologies and intellectual property from third parties fund
research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts Moreover competitive and regulatory conditions
many markets which operate restrict our ability fully recover through price increases higher costs
acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers cost increases Many public tenders have
become more competitive due governments lengthening the commitments their public tenders multiple
years which reduce the number tenders which can participate annually Because the value these
multiple year tenders high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing Our failure
compete effectively and pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results
operations and financial condition
may not able grow our business because our failure develop new improved products
Our future growth depends part our ability continue improve our product offerings and develop and
introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances particular may not able
keep with changes the clinical diagnostics industry such the trend toward molecular diagnostics pointof care tests are unable integrate technological advances into our product offerings design develop
manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and timely manner our business results
operations and financial condition will adversely affected have experienced product launch delays the
past and may the future cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will
successful that new products introduce will achieve market acceptance Failure launch successful new
products improvements existing products may cause our products become obsolete which could harm our
business results operations and financial condition
are subject foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have material adverse effect our
results operations and financial condition
stated above significant portion our operations and sales are outside the United States When make
purchases and sales currencies other than the dollars are exposed fluctuations foreign currencies
relative the dollar that may adversely affect our results operations and financial condition Our
international sales are largely denominated local currencies result the strengthening the dollar
negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed dollars Conversely when the dollar weakens
our expenses our international sites increase addition the volatility other currencies such the Swiss
Franc Brazilian Real and Russian Ruble may negatively impact our operations outside the United States and
increase our costs hedge against currency fluctuations cannot assure you that future shifts currency
exchange rates will not have material adverse effect our results operations and financial condition
may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system
are engaged multi year implementation new global enterprise resource planning system ERP The
ERP designed efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important the operation
our business our management team The ERP will continue require significant investment human and
financial resources implementing the ERP may experience significant delays increased costs and other
difficulties Any significant disruption deficiency the design and implementation the ERP could adversely
affect our ability process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations
otherwise operate our business For example experienced system implementation issues our Clinical
Diagnostics segment during our first deployment that impacted invoicing and caused increase accounts
receivable our second deployment experienced delays manufacturing and logistics which adversely
impacted our sales launched our third deployment Western Europe April have experienced
system implementation issues impacting the timing payment vendor invoices and resulting delays
product availability and shipments also have experienced lower productivity levels related the April
live the ERP Western Europe which adversely impacted our sales during the second and third quarters
The third deployment was more complex than our prior deployments due its scope While invested
significant resources planning project management and training additional and significant implementation issues
may arise addition our efforts centralize various business processes and functions within our organization
connection with our ERP implementation may continue disrupt our operations and negatively impact our
business results operations and financial condition
Recent and planned changes our organizational structure and executive management team could negatively
impact our business
made significant changes our organizational structure and and continued make
significant organizational changes and functionalized our manufacturing and selling
organizations globally and separated them from our marketing and research and development organizations
Specifically combined our international selling organization with our North American selling divisions into one
global selling group and consolidated our manufacturing procurement and logistics operations into one global
supply chain group also created new management positions head each these groups addition
appointed new executives head each our Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics segments and appointed
Chief Operating Officer also restructured our Life Science segment based functional groups rather than
product line divisions began implementing the reorganization the structure our European
organization continued implement the reorganization our European organization These changes
may have unintended consequences such distraction our management and employees business disruption
attrition our workforce inability attract retain key employees and reduced employee morale
productivity
Our failure establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result material
misstatements our consolidated financial statements our failure meet our reporting obligations and cause
investors lose confidence our reported financial information which turn could cause the trading price
our common stock decline
Maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are necessary
for produce reliable financial statements During the third quarter identified two items that were
recorded the three month period ended September that should have been recorded the three month
period ended June each case the misrecorded item was due errors result data migration and
system configuration arising from our new European business structure during our ERP system conversion
Europe April Our review controls and our user acceptance testing controls were not sufficiently designed
identify these items timely basis Though there was impact the financial statements for the ninemonth period ended September concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
September and that this deficiency constituted material weakness Our management believes that
our enhanced post conversion management review control activities and augmented user acceptance testing
system changes which were designed remediate the material weakness over financial reporting disclosed
September were sufficiently implemented December
connection with our assessment the effectiveness internal control over financial reporting December
determined that did not maintain sufficient complement personnel certain European
countries with appropriate training and expertise accounting and reporting the new ERP system following the
system conversion and European reorganization that the Company undertook April including the
implementation reporting lines appropriate authorities and responsibilities within and between our accounting
and reporting function information technology and the business operations these European countries did not
conduct continuous risk assessment over changes our European business operations systems and personnel
identify and assess necessary changes internal control over financial reporting result did not design
effective control activities over the accounting for financial statement amounts including inventory and revenue
reported entities impacted the European reorganization including management review controls with
sufficient precision identify and investigate potential outliers These control deficiencies resulted immaterial
misstatements inventory revenue and cost goods sold certain which were corrected the consolidated
financial statements December prior issuance
Because the deficiencies create reasonable possibility material misstatement the annual interim
consolidated financial statements that will not prevented detected timely basis they represent material
weakness internal control over financial reporting and accordingly our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective December KPMG LLP independent registered
public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included this Annual Report Form
and part the audit has issued adverse opinion the effectiveness the Company internal control

Changes the healthcare industry could have adverse effect our business results operations and
financial condition
There have been and will continue significant changes the healthcare industry effort reduce costs
These changes include
The trend towards managed care together with healthcare reform the delivery system the United
States and efforts reform Europe has resulted increased pressure healthcare providers and other
participants the healthcare industry reduce selling prices Consolidation among healthcare providers
and consolidation among other participants the healthcare industry has resulted fewer more powerful
groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage particular there has been
consolidation laboratories and consolidation blood transfusion centers These industry trends and
competitive forces place constraints the levels overall pricing and thus could have material adverse
effect our gross margins for products sell clinical diagnostic markets
Third party payors such Medicare and Medicaid the United States have reduced their reimbursements
for certain medical products and services Our Clinical Diagnostics business impacted the level
reimbursement available for clinical tests from third party payors the United States payment for many
diagnostic tests furnished Medicare fee for service beneficiaries made based the Medicare Clinical
Laboratory Fee Schedule CLFS fee schedule established and adjusted from time time the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS Some commercial payors are guided the CLFS
establishing their reimbursement rates Clinicians may decide not order clinical diagnostic tests third
party payments are inadequate and cannot predict whether third party payors will offer adequate
reimbursement for tests utilizing our products make them commercially attractive Legislation such
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act PPACA and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act has reduced
the payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the CLFS addition the Protecting Access
Medicare Act PAMA has made significant changes the way Medicare will pay for clinical
laboratory services which has further reduced reimbursement rates
The PPACA has also imposed excise tax the sales certain medical devices the which
are required pay most our United States Clinical Diagnostic sales However the Consolidated
Appropriations Act Pub signed into law December included two year
moratorium the medical device excise tax January the moratorium the medical device
excise tax was further extended until January
the extent that the healthcare industry seeks address the need contain costs stemming from reform measures
such those contained the PPACA and the PAMA future legislation limiting the number clinical
tests being performed the amount reimbursement available for such tests our business results operations
and financial condition could adversely affected these changes the healthcare markets the United States
and Europe continue could forced alter our approach selling marketing distributing and servicing our
products
are subject substantial government regulation and any changes regulation violations regulations
could adversely affect our business prospects results operations financial condition
Some our products primarily our Clinical Diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject
federal state and local and foreign regulation including the FDA the United States and its foreign
counterparts The FDA regulates our Clinical Diagnostic products medical devices and are subject
significant regulatory clearances approvals market our Clinical Diagnostic products and other requirements
including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such the FDA medical device reporting
regulations and reporting corrections and removals The FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers
the FDA determines that have failed comply with applicable regulatory requirements can impose variety
enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties
suspension delayed issuance approvals seizure recall our products total partial shutdown
production withdrawal approvals clearances already granted and criminal prosecution
The FDA can also require repair replace refund the cost devices that manufactured distributed
addition the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations revise existing
regulations take other actions which may prevent delay approval clearance our products impact our
ability modify our currently approved cleared products timely basis Changes the FDA review
certain clinical diagnostic products referred laboratory developed tests which are tests developed single
laboratory for use only that laboratory could affect some our customers who use our Life Science instruments
for laboratory developed tests the past the FDA has chosen not enforce applicable regulations and has not
reviewed such tests for approval However the FDA has issued draft guidance that may begin enforcing its
medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements such tests Any delay failure
receive maintain clearance approval for our products could prevent from generating revenue from these
products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results Additionally the FDA and other
regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers Regulatory enforcement inquiries other increased
scrutiny could affect the perceived safety and efficacy our products and dissuade our customers from using
our products
Many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale
and use our products Such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require modify reregister products already the market otherwise impact our ability market our products those countries
For example April the European Parliament voted enact final regulations that include broad changes
its regulations regarding vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices including stricter product labeling
requirements Russia has enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations China has
enacted stricter labeling requirements and expect other countries such Brazil and India impose more
regulations that impact our product registrations Due these evolving and diverse requirements face
uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort comply reduced sales and potential fines for
noncompliance Increasing protectionism such countries also impedes our ability compete with local
companies For example may not able participate certain public tenders Russia because increasing
measures restrict access such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities Such
regulations could adversely affect our business results operations and financial condition
are also subject government regulation the use and handling number materials and controlled
substances The Drug Enforcement Administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting
storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant the Controlled Substances Act

specialized knowledge and skills addition the global nature our business also requires that have
sophisticated and experienced staff comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations
face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other
companies throughout our industry particular the job market Northern California where many our
employees are located very competitive not offer competitive compensation and benefits may fail
retain attract sufficient number qualified personnel which could impair our ability properly run our
business
some cases rely temporary personnel consultants and may the future Such temporary
personnel consultants may lack the knowledge and specific skills necessary for our business require time
train without benefiting through extended employment and increase our costs addition noted above our
strategic initiatives such our internal restructuring and ERP implementation may burdensome and disruptive
and lead employee dissatisfaction and attrition
reduction interruption the supply components and raw materials could adversely affect our
manufacturing operations and related product sales

our components and materials from many suppliers various countries work closely with our suppliers
ensure the continuity supply but cannot guarantee these efforts will always successful Further while
seek diversify our sources components and materials certain instances acquire components and
materials from sole supplier addition due the regulatory environment which operate may
unable quickly establish additional replacement sources for some components materials our supply
reduced interrupted poor quality and are unable develop alternative sources for such supply our

including calculating and supporting with primary evidence tax attributes such accumulated foreign
earnings and profits foreign taxes paid and other tax components involved foreign tax credit calculations since
The application accounting guidance for such items currently uncertain and compliance with the Tax
Act and the accounting for such provisions require collection information not previously required regularly
produced within our control result these provisional tax amounts recorded are based our reasonable

Overview are multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor our own life science research and
clinical diagnostics products Our business organized into two primary segments Life Science and Clinical
Diagnostics with the mission provide scientists with specialized products needed for biological research and
clinical diagnostics
sell more than products and services diverse client base comprised scientific research healthcare
education and government customers worldwide not disclose quantitative information about our different
products and services impractical based primarily the numerous products and services that
sell and the global markets that serve
manufacture and supply our customers with range reagents apparatus and equipment separate complex
chemical and biological materials and identify analyze and purify components Because our customers require
standardization for their experiments and test results much our revenues are recurring
are impacted the support many governments for both research and healthcare The current global
economic outlook still uncertain the need control government social spending many governments limits
opportunities for growth Adding this uncertainty was the referendum the United Kingdom withdraw from
the European Union and change the executive branch government Approximately our
consolidated net sales are derived from the United States and approximately are derived from international
locations with Europe being our largest international region The international sales are largely denominated
local currencies such the Euro Swiss Franc Japanese Yen Chinese Yuan and British Sterling result our
consolidated net sales expressed dollars benefit when the dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar
strengthens When the dollar strengthens benefit from lower cost sales from our own international
manufacturing sites well non suppliers and from lower international operating expenses regularly
discuss our changes revenue and expense categories terms both changing foreign exchange rates and
terms currency neutral basis notable explain the impact currency has our results

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The accompanying discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements which have been prepared accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP The preparation financial statements conformity with GAAP requires management
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities and contingencies the
date the financial statements and reported amounts revenues and expenses during the reporting periods
evaluate our estimates going basis base our estimates historical experience and other
assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances the results which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources
However future events may cause change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment
Actual results could differ from these estimates have determined that for the periods reported this Annual
Report Form the following accounting policies and estimates are critical understanding our financial
condition and results operations
Accounting for Income Taxes Management required make estimates related our income tax provision
each the jurisdictions which operate This process involves estimating our current tax exposures well
making judgments regarding the recoverability deferred tax assets each jurisdiction Deferred tax assets and
liabilities reflect the tax effects losses credits and temporary differences between the carrying amounts assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes Management
assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will recovered from future taxable income and the extent
management believes that recovery not likely valuation allowance must established the extent
management establishes valuation allowance increases this allowance period increase expense within
the Provision for income taxes the Consolidated Statements Income may result
have recorded valuation allowance million December and due uncertainties
related our ability utilize some the deferred tax assets primarily consisting certain foreign net operating
losses carried forward and certain state research and development credits The valuation allowance based
management current estimates taxable income for the jurisdictions which operate and the period over
which the deferred tax assets will recoverable the event that actual results differ from these estimates
these estimates are adjusted future periods additional valuation allowance may need established which
would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position Should realization these
deferred tax assets for which valuation allowance has been provided occur the provision for income taxes may
decrease raising income and positively impacting Bio Rad financial position
recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax position only more likely than not that the tax position
will sustained examination the taxing authorities based the technical merits the position The tax
benefits recognized the financial statements particular tax position are measured based the largest benefit
that has greater than likelihood being realized upon settlement The amount unrecognized tax benefits
adjusted appropriate for changes facts and circumstances such significant amendments existing tax
law new regulations interpretations the taxing authorities new information obtained during tax
examination resolution examination recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate
related unrecognized tax benefits income tax expense Our overall effective tax rate subject fluctuations
because changes the geographic mix earnings changes statutory tax rates and tax laws and because
the impact various tax audits and assessments well generation tax credits
December the enacted comprehensive tax legislation the Tax Act The new legislation
contains significant tax provisions that affect including one time mandatory deemed repatriation tax certain
unrepatriated foreign earnings Transition Tax reduction the corporate income tax rate from
effective January and change from worldwide tax system modified territorial system
are required recognize the effect the tax law changes the period enactment such the computation
the Transition Tax remeasurement our deferred tax assets and liabilities well reassessment the
net realizability our deferred tax assets and liabilities
Subsequent the enactment the Tax Act the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin Income Tax
Accounting Implications the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB which provides guidance accounting for the
tax effects the Tax Act SAB provides measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from
the Tax Act enactment date for companies complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification
ASC Income Taxes accordance with SAB company must reflect the income tax effects
those aspects the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC complete the extent that company
accounting for certain income tax effects the Tax Act incomplete but reasonable estimate can determined
the company must record provisional estimate the financial statements For the year ended December
recorded those amounts for which the accounting was complete for which were able make reasonable
estimates The provisional estimates the Transition Tax and remeasurement our deferred tax assets and
liabilities will adjusted additional information and guidance become available
Valuation Business Acquisitions Goodwill and Long lived Assets Upon the consummation business
combination use multiple analyses determine the fair market value the consideration assets acquired and
liabilities assumed Once the fair market value the acquired business determined any residual value between
fair market value and the consideration defined goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess the cost over the fair value net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired businesses which could include contingent consideration Contingent consideration obligation the
acquirer transfer additional assets equity interest the former owners acquiree part the exchange
for control the acquiree specified future events occur conditions are met Contingent consideration
reported fair value each reporting period until the contingency resolved Any changes fair value are
recognized earnings which could become volatile over time depending the facts and circumstances
Goodwill amounts are assigned reporting units the time acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent
significant transfers business between reporting units assess the impairment goodwill annually the
fourth quarter whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
recoverable perform the impairment tests goodwill our reporting unit level which one level below our
operating segments January adopted Accounting Standards Update Simplifying the Test
for Goodwill Impairment which goodwill impairment will the amount which reporting unit carrying
value exceeds its fair value not exceed the carrying amount goodwill
use projected discounted cash flow model determine the fair value reporting unit This discounted cash
flow method for determining goodwill may different from the fair value that would result from actual
transaction between willing buyer and willing seller Projections such discounted cash flow models are
inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows
Management judgment required developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model These
assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs
expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values estimate future cash flows using current
and longer term financial forecasts These forecasts take into account the current economic environment The
discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends similar businesses and other
observable market data Changes these rates might result material changes the valuation and determination
the recoverability goodwill For example increase the discount rate used discount cash flows will
decrease the computed fair value
Impairment tests are highly sensitive changes assumptions and minor changes assumptions that could result
impairment losses Our forecasts utilized our impairment test assumed among other things sales growth
from executing our sales and marketing programs new product introductions successful product development and
timely registration our products when required while controlling costs addition external factors such
currency inflation rates cost capital and forecasted tax rates could affect the determination fair value our
reporting units Aside from our Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics and AbD Serotec reporting units which reflected
carrying value that exceeded its fair value our impairment tests resulted excessive fair value over book value
ranging from more than for our various reporting units One reporting unit which consists mainly
our acquisition Biotest and our through acquisitions DiaMed Holding had excess
fair value over book value only December Goodwill the amount million allocated
this reporting unit December the initiatives mentioned above not achieve the desired results
external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur
validate the reasonableness the reporting unit fair values reconcile the aggregate fair values the
reporting units the enterprise market capitalization performing the reconciliation may depending the
volatility the market value our stock price use either the stock price the valuation date the average stock
price over range dates around the valuation date
For purposes recognition and measurement impairment loss long lived asset assets are grouped with
other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash
flows other assets and liabilities assess the impairment long lived assets including identifiable
intangibles whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not recoverable
Factors that consider important that could trigger impairment review include
significant reporting unit under performance relative expected historical projected future operating
results
significant changes the manner use the long lived assets intangible assets the strategy for our
overall business
current expectation that more likely than not long lived asset will sold otherwise disposed
before the end its previously estimated useful life and
significant negative industry legal regulatory economic trends
When management determines that the carrying value long lived assets may not recoverable based upon the
existence one more the above indicators impairment test for any impairment based projected
undiscounted cash flow method Projected future operating results and cash flows the asset asset group are
used establish the fair value used evaluating the carrying value long lived and intangible assets
estimate the future cash flows the long lived assets using current and long term financial forecasts The carrying
amount long lived asset not recoverable exceeds the sum the undiscounted cash flows expected
result from the use and eventual disposition the asset this the case impairment loss would
recognized The impairment loss recognized the amount which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value
impaired goodwill associated with our acquisition Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics and with
our acquisition AbD Serotec the amounts million and million respectively The
impairments were based upon revision our Level valuation inputs expected future cash flows
fully impaired goodwill and process research and development the amounts million and
million respectively associated with our acquisition GnuBIO Inc The impairments were based upon
revision our Level valuation inputs expected future cash flows Also impaired intellectual
property the amount million associated with the termination research and development project
There were impairment losses recorded
Valuation Inventories value inventory the lower the actual cost purchase and manufacture the
inventory the current estimated net realizable value the inventory review inventory quantities hand
and reduce the cost basis excess and obsolete inventory based primarily estimated forecast product
demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency raw materials This review done
quarterly basis warranted the circumstances more frequently addition our industry characterized
technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result increase
the amount obsolete inventory quantities hand Our estimates future product demand may prove
inaccurate and too high may have overstated the carrying value our inventory the future inventory
determined overvalued would required write down the value inventory market and recognize
such costs our cost goods sold the time such determination Therefore although make efforts
ensure the accuracy our forecasts future product demand and perform procedures safeguard overall
inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes demand technological developments regulations
storage conditions other economic environmental factors affecting biological materials could have
significant impact the value our inventory and reported results operations
adopted ASU Simplifying the Measurement Inventory January which requires
inventory measurement the lower cost and net realizable value See Note the consolidated financial
statements
Valuation Investments regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that decline the
fair value investment below its carrying value other than temporary Some factors considered evaluating
whether not decline fair value other than temporary include our ability and intent retain the investment
for period time sufficient allow for recovery value the duration and extent which the fair value has
been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects the issuer Such reviews are inherently uncertain
that the value the investment may not fully recover may decline further future periods resulting realized
losses
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the collectability our customer accounts The amount the allowance determined analyzing known
uncollectible accounts the age our receivables economic conditions the customers country industry
historical losses and our customers general credit worthiness Amounts later determined and specifically identified
uncollectible are charged written off against this allowance Uncertainty the current economic
environment prolonged could result greater amounts becoming uncollectible the future Should the
estimates losses higher than the actual uncollectible accounts would report lower profitability when the
estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable collected

Effective tax rate
December the enacted comprehensive tax legislation the Tax Act The Tax Act made broad
and complex changes the tax code that affect our financial statements including among other
changes the imposition one time mandatory deemed repatriation tax Transition Tax certain earnings
accumulated offshore since and the reduction the corporate tax rate from for taxable
income resulting one time remeasurement federal deferred tax assets and liabilities
Our effective tax rate was and and respectively Prior year effective tax rates
have been revised see note the consolidated financial statements result the Tax Act recognized

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Bio Rad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established the
markets which trade Goods are manufactured small number locations and are then shipped local
distribution facilities around the world Our product mix diversified and certain products compete largely
product efficacy while others compete price Gross margins are generally sufficient exceed normal operating
costs and funding for research and development new products well routine outflows capital
expenditures interest and taxes addition the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional
liquidity readily available via the sale short term investments and access our domestic million
unsecured Credit Agreement and lesser extent international lines credit Borrowings under the Credit
Agreement are available revolving basis and can used make permitted acquisitions for working capital
and for other general corporate purposes had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement
December however million was utilized for domestic standby letters credit that reduced our
borrowing availability The Credit Agreement matures June total under domestic and international lines
credit standby letters credit and guarantee arrangements had approximately million available for
borrowing and usage December which was reduced approximately million that was utilized
for standby letters credit and guarantee arrangements issued our banks support our obligations
Management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will adequate meet our
current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution
plant and equipment information technology systems and acquisition reasonable proportion our existing
total available capital
December had available million cash cash equivalents and short term investments
which approximately was held our foreign subsidiaries believe that our holdings cash cash
equivalents and short term investments the and our foreign subsidiaries are sufficient meet both the
current and long term needs our global operations The amount funds held the United States can fluctuate
due the timing receipts and payments the ordinary course business and due other reasons such
business development activities part our ongoing liquidity assessments regularly monitor the mix
domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows
Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject taxation under the Tax Act which also repeals taxation
the subsequent repatriation those earnings generally our intention repatriate those foreign earnings
the extent that such repatriations are not restricted local laws accounting rules and there are substantial
incremental costs While currently estimate that the repatriation those earnings would not trigger material
costs these estimates are provisional and are still evaluating the full impact these potential repatriations
accordance with SAB
Demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than previous years based activity
funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry
including diagnostic laboratories The need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits curtail
spending could lead slower growth even decline our business Sovereign nations either delaying
payment for goods and services renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity December
and December had accounts receivable net allowance for doubtful accounts Spain Italy
Greece and Portugal million and million respectively While economic growth improving
some geographical locations instability still exists some the developed nations such less dependable rate
growth the Chinese economy and emerging markets especially those oil producing countries that have been
affected decline oil prices which may adversely affect our future cash flows
Cash Flows from Operations
Net cash provided operations was million million and million and
respectively The net decrease between and million primarily resulted from
more cash paid suppliers primarily related increased inventory higher employee related costs primarily
for merit increases asset purchase for early stage diagnostic device for million million for
the RainDance preexisting condition and higher value added taxes part due the European
reorganization
higher net payments compared for forward foreign exchange contracts primarily associated
with the timing product shipments intercompany debt payments and the intercompany movement
assets and capital for the new European operating model and
lower income tax refunds compared partially offset
higher cash received from customers primarily due higher sales partially offset higher accounts
receivable balances due part implementation matters associated with the European ERP system and
higher investment income received
The net increase between and million primarily resulted from
higher cash received from customers primarily due lower collections the second half
from delays associated with the second phase ERP implementation and
higher investment income received partially offset
more cash paid suppliers and employees primarily related higher payments inventory suppliers
payments were delayed the latter part mostly associated with the second deployment the ERP
system higher annual performance based compensation payments and higher legal and other
professional fees
higher net income tax payments than and
net payments compared net cash received for forward foreign exchange contracts
regularly review past due receivables assess the allowance for doubtful accounts and believe net accounts
receivable are fully realizable also routinely review inventory for the impact obsolescence and changes
market prices caused the introduction new products technologies and government reimbursement policies
Cash flows from operations during the first quarter have historically had larger payments for royalties fourth quarter
sales commissions third parties and annual employee bonuses and expect this pattern recur the first
quarter

contingent consideration potentially payable Propel after the effects calculation revision that were
reflected the fourth quarter
continue review possible acquisitions expand both our Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics segments
routinely meet with the principals brokers the subject companies are currently discussion and assessing
few possible acquisitions which expect our current reported cash and cash equivalents sufficient for any
cash consideration for these possible acquisitions However not certain this time that any these discussions
involving material significant acquisitions will advance completion
Capital expenditures totaled million compared million and million and
respectively Capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement production machinery and
research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansion regulatory environmental and
compliance Also included capital expenditures are investments business systems and data communication
upgrades and enhancements All periods include equipment placed with Clinical Diagnostics segment customers who
then contract purchase our reagents for use implement the remaining smaller phases the ERP platform
expect capital expenditures decline over the next couple years Capital expenditures were lower than
implementation costs were higher for the third phase the ERP platform which was implemented

ITEM QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Financial Risk Management
The main goal Bio Rad financial risk management program reduce the variance expected cash flows
arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes Financial exposures are managed through
operational means and using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and
forward and spot foreign exchange contracts derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose
trading speculation Company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken manage the risks
arising from underlying business activities These derivative transactions not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment Derivative instruments used these transactions are valued fair value and changes fair value are
included reported earnings
Foreign Exchange Risk operate and conduct business many countries and are exposed movements
foreign currency exchange rates face transactional currency exposures that arise when enter into
transactions denominated currencies other than dollars Additionally our consolidated net equity
impacted the conversion the net assets our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency
not the dollar
Foreign currency exposures are managed centralized basis This allows for the netting natural offsets and
lowers transaction costs and net exposures Where possible seek manage our foreign exchange risk part
through operational means including matching same currency revenues same currency costs and same currency
assets same currency liabilities Moreover weakening one currency can often offset strengthening
another currency Foreign exchange risk also managed through the use forward foreign exchange contracts
Positions are primarily Euro Swiss Franc British Sterling Singapore Dollar Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen
The majority forward contracts are for periods days less record the change value our foreign
currency receivables and payables Foreign exchange gain loss our Consolidated Statements Income
along with the change fair market value the forward exchange contract used economic hedge those
assets liabilities
Our forward contract holdings year end were analyzed determine their sensitivity fluctuations foreign
currency exchange rates All other variables were held constant Market risk associated with derivative holdings
the potential change fair value derivative positions arising from adverse movement foreign exchange
rates decline quoted foreign exchange rates would result approximate net present value loss
million our derivative position December This impact change exchange rates
excludes the offset derived from the change value the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the
adverse effect significantly
Interest Rate Risk Debt Instruments Bio Rad centrally manages the short term cash surpluses and shortfalls
its subsidiaries Our holdings variable rate debt instruments year end were analyzed determine their
sensitivity movements interest rates Due the relatively small amount short term variable rate debt
have outstanding there would not material impact earnings cash flows interest rates moved adversely
Our long term debt consists primarily fixed rate instruments and thus insulated from interest rate
changes December the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

Concentration Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject concentration credit risk consist primarily cash and cash
equivalents investments foreign exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable Cash and cash equivalents and
investments are placed with various highly rated major financial institutions located different geographic regions
Bio Rad has not sustained significant losses from instruments held financial institutions
The forward contracts used managing our foreign currency exposures have element risk that the
counterparties may unable meet the terms the agreements attempt minimize this risk limiting the
counterparties diverse group highly rated domestic and international financial institutions the event
non performance these counterparties the carrying values our financial instruments represent the maximum
amount loss would have incurred our fiscal year end However not expect record any losses
result counterparty default
perform credit evaluation procedures related our trade receivables and with the exception certain
developing countries generally not require collateral result increased risk certain developing
countries some Bio Rad sales are subject collateral letters credit from our customers Credit risk for trade
accounts receivable generally limited due the large number customers and their dispersion across many
geographic areas However significant amount trade receivables are with national healthcare systems
countries within the European Union
Accounts Receivable
maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability our customers
make required payments The amount the allowance determined analyzing known uncollectible accounts
aged receivables economic conditions the customers country industry historical losses and our customers
credit worthiness Amounts later determined and specifically identified uncollectible are charged written
off against this allowance
Inventory
Inventories are valued the lower actual cost market net realizable value and include material labor and
overhead costs The first first out method used relieve inventory for products sold
Property Plant and Equipment
Property plant and equipment are carried cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization Included
property plant and equipment are buildings and equipment acquired under capital lease arrangements reagent
rental equipment and capitalized software including costs for software developed obtained for internal use
Property plant and equipment are assessed for impairment quarterly whenever events changes
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not recoverable
Depreciation computed straight line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets Buildings and
leasehold improvements are amortized over years the term the leases life the improvements
whichever shorter With the exception reagent rental equipment which amortized over year period
equipment and capitalized software depreciated over years
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess the cost over the fair value net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired businesses Goodwill assessed for impairment applying fair value based tests annually the fourth
quarter whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not recoverable
perform impairment tests goodwill our reporting unit level which one level below our operating
segments Our reporting units are identified components for which discrete financial information available and
regularly reviewed management Goodwill amounts are assigned reporting units the time acquisition
Effective January accordance with Accounting Standards Update Simplifying the Test for
Goodwill Impairment the goodwill impairment amount will the amount which reporting unit carrying
value exceeds its fair value not exceed the carrying amount goodwill use projected discounted cash
flow model determine the fair value reporting unit
Prior January the goodwill impairment test consisted two step process The first step the
goodwill impairment test used identify potential impairment compared the fair value reporting unit its
carrying value including goodwill used projected discounted cash flow model determine the fair value
reporting unit the fair value the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount goodwill the reporting unit
was considered not impaired and the second step the impairment test was not required The second step
required compared the implied fair value the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount that goodwill
The fair value reporting unit was allocated all the assets and liabilities that unit including any
unrecognized intangible assets the reporting unit had been acquired business combination and the fair
value the reporting unit was the price paid acquire the reporting unit the carrying amount the reporting
unit goodwill exceeded its implied fair value impairment charge recognized amount equal that
excess
Long Lived Assets
For purposes recognition and measurement impairment loss long lived asset assets are grouped with
other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash
flows other assets and liabilities assess the impairment long lived assets including identifiable intangible
assets quarterly whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
recoverable Factors that consider important that could trigger impairment review include
significant under performance relative expected historical projected future operating results
significant changes the manner use the long lived assets intangible assets the strategy for our
overall business
current expectation that more likely than not long lived asset will sold otherwise disposed
loss before the end its previously estimated useful life and
significant negative industry legal regulatory economic trends
When management determines that the carrying value long lived assets may not recoverable based upon the
existence one more the above indicators impairment test for any impairment based projected
undiscounted cash flow method Projected future operating results and cash flows the asset asset group are
used establish the fair value used evaluating the carrying value long lived and intangible assets
estimate the future cash flows the long lived assets using current and long term financial forecasts The carrying
amount long lived asset not recoverable exceeds the sum the undiscounted cash flows expected
result from the use and eventual disposition the asset this the case impairment loss would
recognized The impairment loss recognized the amount which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value
