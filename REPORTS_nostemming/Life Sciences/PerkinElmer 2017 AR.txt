Certain these risks can hedged limited degree using financial instruments other measures and
some these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always fully
successful Our ability engage such mitigation efforts has decreased become even more costly result
recent market developments
not introduce new products timely manner may lose market share and unable
achieve revenue growth targets
sell many our products industries characterized rapid technological change frequent new
product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards Many the businesses
competing with these industries have significant financial and other resources invest new technologies
substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience new product development regulatory
expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels deliver products customers Our
products could become technologically obsolete over time may invest technology that does not lead
revenue growth continue sell products for which the demand from our customers declining which case
may lose market share not achieve our revenue growth targets The success our new product offerings
will depend upon several factors including our ability
accurately anticipate customer needs
innovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications
successfully commercialize new technologies timely manner
price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products sufficient volumes
and time and
differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings
Many our products are used our customers develop test and manufacture their products must
anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products meet our customers expectations
developing new products may required make significant investments before can determine the
commercial viability the new product fail accurately foresee our customers needs and future
activities may invest heavily research and development products that not lead significant revenue
may also suffer loss market share and potential revenue are unable commercialize our
technology timely and efficient manner
addition some our licensed technology subject contractual restrictions which may limit our
ability develop commercialize products for some applications
may not able successfully execute acquisitions divestitures license technologies integrate
acquired businesses licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses
licensed technologies profitable
have the past supplemented and may the future supplement our internal growth acquiring
businesses and licensing technologies that complement augment our existing product lines such our
acquisitions EUROIMMUN and Tulip during fiscal year However may unable identify
complete promising acquisitions license transactions for many reasons such
competition among buyers and licensees
the high valuations businesses and technologies
the need for regulatory and other approval and
our inability raise capital fund these acquisitions
Some the businesses acquire may unprofitable marginally profitable may increase the
variability our revenue recognition for example are unable successfully commercialize products and
services related significant process research and development that have capitalized may have
impair the value such assets Accordingly the earnings losses acquired businesses may dilute our
earnings For these acquired businesses achieve acceptable levels profitability would have improve
their management operations products and market penetration may not successful this regard and may
encounter other difficulties integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such incompatible
management information other systems cultural differences loss key personnel unforeseen regulatory
requirements previously undisclosed liabilities difficulties predicting financial results Additionally
are not successful selling businesses seek divest the activity such businesses may dilute our earnings
and may not able achieve the expected benefits such divestitures result our financial results
may differ from our forecasts the expectations the investment community given quarter over the long
term
finance our acquisitions may have raise additional funds either through public private
financings may unable obtain such funds may able only terms unacceptable
may also incur expenses related completing acquisitions licensing technologies evaluating potential
acquisitions technologies which may adversely impact our profitability
may not successful adequately protecting our intellectual property
Patent and trade secret protection important because developing new products processes and
technologies gives competitive advantage although time consuming and expensive own many
United States and foreign patents and intend apply for additional patents Patent applications file however
may not result issued patents they the claims allowed the patents may narrower than what
needed protect fully our products processes and technologies The expiration our previously issued patents
may cause lose competitive advantage certain the products and services provide Similarly
applications register our trademarks may not granted all countries which they are filed For our
intellectual property that protected keeping secret such trade secrets and know how may not use
adequate measures protect this intellectual property
Third parties may also challenge the validity our issued patents may circumvent design around our
patents and patent applications may claim that our products processes technologies infringe their patents
addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks may incur significant
expense legal proceedings protect our intellectual property against infringement third parties defend
against claims infringement third parties Claims third parties pending future lawsuits could result
awards substantial damages against court orders that could effectively prevent from manufacturing
using importing selling our products the United States other countries
are unable renew our licenses otherwise lose our licensed rights may have stop selling
products may lose competitive advantage
may not able renew our existing licenses licenses may obtain the future terms
acceptable all lose the rights patented other proprietary technology may need stop
selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products lose
competitive advantage Potential competitors could license technologies that fail license and potentially
erode our market share
Our licenses typically subject various economic and commercialization obligations fail
comply with these obligations could lose important rights under license such the right exclusivity
market incur losses for failing comply with our contractual obligations some cases could lose all
rights under the license addition rights granted under the license could lost for reasons out our control
For example the licensor could lose patent protection for number reasons including invalidity the
licensed patent third party could obtain patent that curtails our freedom operate under one more
licenses
not compete effectively our business will harmed
encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors many areas our business may
not able compete effectively with all these competitors remain competitive must develop new
products and periodically enhance our existing products anticipate that may also have adjust the prices
many our products stay competitive addition new competitors technologies market trends may
emerge threaten reduce the value entire product lines
Our quarterly operating results could subject significant fluctuation and may not able
adjust our operations effectively address changes not anticipate which could increase the volatility
our stock price and potentially cause losses our shareholders
Given the nature the markets which participate cannot reliably predict future revenue and
profitability Changes competitive market and economic conditions may require adjust our operations
and may not able make those adjustments make them quickly enough adapt changing
conditions high proportion our costs are fixed due part our research and development and
manufacturing costs result small declines sales could disproportionately affect our operating results

could cause incur increased shipping costs that could not passed our customers negatively
impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain our customers
Disruptions the supply raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited
single source suppliers could have adverse effect the results our business operations and could
damage our relationships with customers
The production our products requires wide variety raw materials key components and other goods
that are generally available from alternate sources supply However certain critical raw materials key
components and other goods required for the production and sale some our principal products are available
from limited single sources supply generally have multi year contracts with minimum purchase
requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect from failure certain suppliers
supply critical materials from the delays inherent being required change suppliers and some cases
validate new raw materials Such raw materials key components and other goods can usually obtained from
alternative sources with the potential for increase price decline quality delay delivery prolonged
inability obtain certain raw materials key components other goods possible and could have adverse
effect our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers

satisfying those customers who require that the components used our products certified conflict free and
the potential lack availability these materials competitive prices could increase our production costs
The manufacture and sale products and services may expose product and other liability claims for

Overview Fiscal Year
During fiscal year continued see good performance from acquisitions investments our
ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives Our overall revenue fiscal year increased
million compared fiscal year reflecting increase million our

segment revenue The increase our Discovery Analytical Solutions segment during fiscal year was
primarily due increase million from our laboratory services market revenue and increase
million from our environmental food and industrial markets revenue partially offset decrease
million from our life sciences research market revenue The increase our Diagnostics segment revenue
during fiscal year was primarily driven continued expansion our newborn maternal fetal health and
infectious diseases screening solutions and applied genomics solutions
our Discovery Analytical Solutions segment experienced growth during fiscal year driven
successful new product introductions and improving macro environment also experienced strong
demand for our laboratory service offerings well our environmental and food offerings the life sciences
research market experienced continued decline sales radioactive reagents our radio nucleotide
business
our Diagnostics segment experienced growth from continued expansion our newborn and
infectious disease screening businesses particularly the emerging markets also experienced strong growth
our advanced genomics front end sample preparation business the Americas the rising cost healthcare
continues one the critical issues facing our customers anticipate that the benefits providing earlier
detection disease which can result reduction long term health care costs well create better
outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and expect see continued growth these markets During
fiscal year expanded both the extent and reach our capabilities enable earlier treatments and better
outcomes both terms diseases and geographies The acquisition EUROIMMUN has increased our
reagent mix expanded our technical capabilities and positioned more attractive markets
Our consolidated gross margins decreased basis points fiscal year compared fiscal year
primarily due unfavorable shift product mix partially offset benefits from our initiatives
improve our supply chain Our consolidated operating margin increased basis points fiscal year
compared fiscal year primarily due lower costs result cost containment and productivity
initiatives which were partially offset increased costs related investments new product development
continue believe that are well positioned take advantage the spending trends our end
markets and promote efficiencies markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain
services Overall believe that our strategic focus diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions
markets coupled with our deep portfolio technologies and applications leading market positions global scale
and financial strength will provide with foundation for growth

Statements for summary recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements
Application Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation consolidated financial statements requires make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure contingent assets
and liabilities ongoing basis evaluate our estimates including those related revenue recognition
warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions long lived assets
income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation base our
estimates historical experience and various other assumptions that believe reasonable under the
circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions conditions
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used preparation our consolidated financial statements
Revenue recognition record product revenue when persuasive evidence arrangement exists
delivery has occurred the price the buyer fixed determinable and collectability reasonably assured For
products that include installation and the installation meets the criteria considered separate element
recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition installation revenue recognized when the
installation complete For revenue that includes customer specified acceptance criteria recognize revenue
after the acceptance criteria have been met Certain our products require specialized installation Revenue for
these products deferred until installation completed defer revenue from services and recognize over
the contractual period services are rendered
limited circumstances have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered
different points time such revenue from products and services with remaining service storage
component including cord blood processing and storage For these arrangements the revenue allocated each
the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices determined selling price hierarchy
deliverable arrangement qualifies separate unit accounting the delivered item has value the
customer stand alone basis delivered item that does not qualify separate unit accounting
combined with the other undelivered items the arrangement and revenue recognized for those combined
deliverables single unit accounting The selling price used for each deliverable based upon vendorspecific objective evidence VSOE such evidence available third party evidence TPE VSOE not
available and management best estimate selling price BESP neither VSOE nor TPE are available TPE
the price our any competitor largely interchangeable products services stand alone sales
similarly situated customers BESP the price which would sell the deliverable were sold regularly
stand alone basis considering market conditions and entity specific factors
Revenue from software licenses and services was our total revenue for fiscal year and for
each fiscal years and sell our software licenses with maintenance services and some cases
also with consulting services For the undelivered elements determine VSOE fair value the price
charged when the undelivered element sold separately determine VSOE for maintenance sold
connection with software license based the stated renewal rate method determine VSOE for consulting
services reference the amount charged for similar engagements stand alone basis
recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and consulting services
upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met VSOE fair value
for the undelivered elements cannot established defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier
the point which such sufficient VSOE does exist all elements the arrangement have been delivered
the only undelivered element maintenance then recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance
period
The majority our sales relate specific manufactured products units rather than long term
customized projects therefore generally not experience significant changes original estimates Further
have not experienced any significant refunds promotional allowances that require significant estimation
Warranty costs provide for estimated warranty costs for products the time their sale Warranty
liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based historical labor and material costs incurred
during the warranty period
Allowances for doubtful accounts maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability our customers make required payments generally compute our allowance
for doubtful accounts applying specific percentage reserves accounts that are past due and deemed
uncollectible and specifically reserving for customers known financial difficulty Therefore the
financial condition our customers were deteriorate beyond our estimates may have increase our
allowance for doubtful accounts This would reduce our earnings Accounts are written off only when all
methods recovery have been exhausted
Inventory valuation value inventory the lower cost market Inventories are accounted for using
the first first out method periodically review these values ascertain that market value the inventory
continues exceed its recorded cost Generally reductions value inventory below cost are caused our
maintenance stocks products excess demand technological obsolescence the inventory
regularly review inventory quantities hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete
inventory based either our estimated forecast product demand and production requirements historical
trailing usage the product our sales not materialize planned historic levels may have
increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory This would reduce our earnings actual market
conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may sold resulting
lower costs sales and higher income from operations than expected that period
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for fair value Acquisition costs are
expensed incurred and recorded selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity
interests are valued fair value upon the acquisition controlling interest process research and
development IPR recorded fair value intangible asset the acquisition date restructuring costs
associated with business combination are expensed subsequent the acquisition date and changes deferred
tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense
Measurement period adjustments are made the period which the amounts are determined and the current
period income effect such adjustments will calculated the adjustments had been completed the
acquisition date All changes that not qualify measurement period adjustments are also included current
period earnings The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment expectations
for future cash flows the acquired business and the allocation those cash flows identifiable intangible
assets determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed The fair values
assigned tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration
are based management estimates and assumptions well other information compiled management
including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques the actual results differ from
the estimates and judgments used these estimates the amounts recorded the financial statements could result
possible impairment the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration the amortization expense
finite lived intangible assets the recognition additional consideration which would expensed The fair
value contingent consideration remeasured each period based relevant information and changes the
fair value are included the operating results for the period
Value long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles carry variety long lived
assets our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill periodically review the carrying value all these assets based part upon current
estimated market values and our projections anticipated future cash flows undertake this review
annual basis for assets such goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and periodic basis for other
long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related those assets may diminished
Any impairment charge that record reduces our earnings The goodwill impairment test consists two step
process The first step the comparison the fair value the carrying value the reporting unit determine
the carrying value exceeds the fair value The second step measures the amount impairment loss and
only performed the carrying value exceeds the fair value the reporting unit perform the annual
impairment assessment the later January the first day each fiscal year This same impairment test
will performed other times during the course the year should event occur which suggests that the
recoverability goodwill should reconsidered completed the annual goodwill impairment test using
measurement dates January and January and concluded based the first step the process
that there was goodwill impairment January the fair value exceeded the carrying value more
than for each reporting unit except for our Informatics reporting unit January and January
our Informatics reporting unit which had goodwill balance million December had
fair value that was less than but greater than more than its carrying value Informatics increased
risk impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due highly competitive industry Despite the
increased risk associated with this reporting unit not believe there will significant change the key
estimates assumptions driving the fair value this reporting unit that would lead material impairment
charge While believe that our estimates current value are reasonable actual results differ from the
estimates and judgments used including such items future cash flows and the volatility inherent markets
which serve impairment charges against the carrying value those assets could required the future
Non amortizing intangibles are also subject annual impairment test The impairment test consists
comparison the fair value the non amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount the carrying
amount non amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value impairment loss amount equal that
excess recognized addition currently evaluate the remaining useful life our non amortizing
intangible asset least annually determine whether events circumstances continue support indefinite
useful life events circumstances indicate that the useful life our non amortizing intangible asset
longer indefinite the asset will tested for impairment This intangible asset will then amortized
prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for the same manner other intangible
assets that are subject amortization
Employee compensation and benefits sponsor both funded and unfunded and non defined
benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are
significant cost doing business and represent obligations that will ultimately settled far the future and
therefore are subject estimation Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated cost

restructuring charges are estimates based our preliminary assessments severance benefits granted
employees based known benefit formulas and contractual agreements costs abandon certain
facilities based known lease costs sub rental income and iii impairment assets discussed above
under Value long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles Because these accruals are
estimates they are subject change result deviations from initial restructuring plans subsequent
information that may come our attention For example actual severance costs may less than anticipated
employees voluntarily leave prior the time which they would entitled severance anticipated legal
hurdles foreign jurisdictions prove less onerous than expected addition unanticipated successes
difficulties terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead changes estimates When such
changes estimates occur they are reflected our consolidated financial statements our consolidated

Income taxes Our business operations are global nature and are subject taxes numerous
jurisdictions Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially these jurisdictions and are subject change given the

non amortizing intangible assets the later January the first day each fiscal year addition its
annual test the Company regularly evaluates whether events circumstances have occurred that may indicate
potential impairment goodwill non amortizing intangible assets
The process testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination the fair value the
applicable reporting units The test consists two step process The first step the comparison the fair
value the carrying value the reporting unit determine the carrying value exceeds the fair value The
second step measures the amount impairment loss and only performed the carrying value exceeds the
fair value the reporting unit The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units
January its annual impairment date for fiscal year The Company concluded based the first step
the process that there was goodwill impairment and that the fair value exceeded the carrying value more
than for each reporting unit except for the Informatics reporting unit which had fair value exceeding
carrying value less than but more than The range the long term terminal growth rates for the
Company reporting units was for the fiscal year impairment analysis The range for the
discount rates for the reporting units was Keeping all other variables constant change
any one these input assumptions for the various reporting units except for the Informatics reporting unit
would still allow the Company conclude based the first step the process that there was impairment
goodwill
January and January the Informatics reporting unit which had goodwill balance
million December had fair value exceeding carrying value less than but more than
Informatics increased risk impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due highly
competitive industry Despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit the Company does not believe
there will significant change the key estimates assumptions driving the fair value this reporting unit
that would lead material impairment charge
The Company has consistently employed the income approach estimate the current fair value when
testing for impairment goodwill number significant assumptions and estimates are involved the
application the income approach forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales
volumes and prices costs produce tax rates capital spending discount rates and working capital changes
Cash flow forecasts are based approved business unit operating plans for the early years cash flows and
historical relationships later years The income approach sensitive changes long term terminal growth
rates and the discount rates The long term terminal growth rates are consistent with the Company historical
long term terminal growth rates the current economic trends are not expected affect the long term terminal
growth rates the Company The Company corroborates the income approach with market approach
The Company has consistently employed the relief from royalty model estimate the current fair value
when testing for impairment non amortizing intangible assets The impairment test consists comparison
the fair value the non amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount the carrying amount
non amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value impairment loss amount equal that excess
recognized addition the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives its non amortizing intangible assets
least annually determine whether events circumstances continue support indefinite useful life
events circumstances indicate that the useful lives non amortizing intangible assets are longer indefinite
the assets will tested for impairment These intangible assets will then amortized prospectively over their
estimated remaining useful lives and accounted for the same manner other intangible assets that are subject
amortization The Company performed its annual impairment testing January and concluded that
there was impairment non amortizing intangible assets assessment the recoverability amortizing
