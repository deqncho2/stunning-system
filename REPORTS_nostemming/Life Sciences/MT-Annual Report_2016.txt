Regulation
Our products are subject various regulatory standards and approvals weights and measures
regulatory authorities All our electrical components are subject electrical safety standards
believe that are compliance all material respects with applicable regulations
Approvals are required ensure our instruments not impermissibly influence other instruments
and are themselves not affected other instruments addition some our products are used legal
for trade applications which prices based weight are calculated and for which specific weights and
measures approvals are required Although there are large number regulatory agencies across our

Administration FDA regulations and customers food processing industries may subject Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point HACCP regulations Products used hazardous environments may
also subject special requirements
Environmental Matters
are subject environmental laws and regulations the jurisdictions which operate
own lease number properties and manufacturing facilities around the world Like many our
competitors have incurred and will continue incur capital and operating expenditures and other
costs complying with such laws and regulations
are currently involved have potential liability with respect the remediation past
contamination certain our facilities former subsidiary Mettler Toledo LLC known Speed
Checkweigher Inc was one two private parties ordered the New Jersey Department
Environmental Protection administrative consent order signed June investigate and
remediate certain ground water contamination property Landing New Jersey After the other party
under this order failed fulfill its obligations Speed became solely responsible for compliance with
the order Residual ground water contamination this site now within Classification Exception Area
which the Department Environmental Protection has approved and within which the Company oversees
monitoring the decay contaminants concern concurrent Well Restriction Area also exists for the
site The Department Environmental Protection does not view these vehicles remedial measures but
rather institutional controls that must adequately maintained and periodically evaluated
estimate that the costs compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate
total million
addition certain our present and former facilities have had been operation for many
decades and over such time some these facilities may have used substances generated and disposed
wastes that are may considered hazardous possible that these sites well disposal sites
owned third parties which have sent wastes may the future identified and become the
subject remediation Although believe that are substantial compliance with applicable
environmental requirements and date have not incurred material expenditures connection with
environmental matters possible that could become subject additional environmental liabilities
the future that could have material adverse effect our financial condition results operations
cash flows
Competition
Our markets are highly competitive Many the markets which compete are fragmented both
geographically and application particularly the industrial and food retailing markets result
face numerous regional specialized competitors many which are well established their markets
For example some our competitors are divisions larger companies with potentially greater financial
and other resources than our own addition some our competitors are domiciled emerging markets
and may have lower cost structure than ours are confronted with new competitors emerging
markets which although relatively small size today could become larger companies their home
markets Given the sometimes significant growth rates these emerging markets and light their
cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more significant
global competitors Taken together the competitive forces present our markets can impair our operating
margins certain product lines and geographic markets
expect our competitors continue improve the design and performance their products and
introduce new products with competitive prices Although believe that have technological and
other competitive advantages over many our competitors may not able realize and maintain
these advantages These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions our global brand
and reputation our track record technological innovation our comprehensive high quality solution
offering our global sales and service offering our large installed base weighing instruments and the
diversification our revenue base geographic region product range and customer remain
competitive must continue invest research and development sales and marketing and customer
service and support cannot sure that will have sufficient resources continue make these
investments that will successful identifying developing and maintaining any competitive
advantages

operate highly competitive markets and may difficult for preserve operating
margins gain market share and maintain technological advantage
Our markets are highly competitive Many are fragmented both geographically and application
particularly the industrial and food retailing markets result face numerous regional
specialized competitors many which are well established their markets addition some our
competitors are divisions larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than
our own There has also been increase the consolidation precision instrument companies recent
years Any consolidation within our market could result competitors becoming larger and having
greater financial and other resources than our own Some our competitors are domiciled operate
emerging markets and may have lower cost structure than ours are confronted with new competitors
emerging markets which although relatively small size today could become larger companies
their home markets Given the sometimes significant growth rates these emerging markets and light
their cost advantage over developed markets emerging market competitors could become more
significant global competitors Taken together the competitive forces present our markets could harm
our operating margins expect our competitors continue improve the design and performance
their products and introduce new products with competitive prices Although believe that our
products and services have advantages over our competitors may not able realize and maintain

wastes that are hazardous may considered hazardous the future These sites and disposal sites
owned others which sent waste may the future identified contaminated and require
remediation Accordingly possible that could become subject additional environmental
liabilities the future that may harm our results operations financial condition
may adversely affected regulations and market expectations related sourcing
and our supply chain including conflict minerals
The SEC has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain
certain minerals and their derivatives namely tin tantalum tungsten gold known conflict minerals
Companies must report annually whether not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic
Congo DRC and adjoining countries and some cases perform extensive due diligence their
supply chains for such minerals These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and
pricing materials used the manufacturing our products addition have incurred additional
costs comply with the disclosure requirements including cost related determining the source any
the relevant minerals used our products Since our supply chain complex the due diligence
procedures that have implemented may not enable ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins
for these minerals determine that these minerals are DRC conflict free which may harm our reputation
may also face difficulties satisfying customers who may require that our products certified
DRC conflict free which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead loss
revenue These requirements also could have the effect limiting the pool suppliers from which
source these minerals and may not unable obtain conflict free minerals prices similar the
past which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our
profitability
Future laws regulations customers may make additional demands supply chain transparency
These demands can include more transparency into the activities our suppliers with regards human
rights and sustainable sourcing have significant protections place ensure partner with
responsible suppliers but increased demands may cause incur increased supply chain costs
can satisfy customers demands may lose business and can meet new regulatory requirements

may experience impairments goodwill other intangible assets
December our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill million and
other intangible assets million
Our business acquisitions typically result goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the
amount future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense make estimates and
assumptions valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements
accordance with GAAP our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized
but are evaluated for impairment annually the fourth quarter more frequently events changes
circumstances indicate that asset might impaired The evaluation based valuation models that
estimate fair value preparing the valuation models consider number factors including
operating results business plans economic conditions future cash flows and transactions and market
data There are inherent uncertainties related these factors and our judgment applying them the
impairment analyses The significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales
growth controllable cost growth perpetual growth effective tax rates and discount rates Our
assessments date have indicated that there has been impairment these assets
Should any these estimates assumptions change should incur lower than expected
operating performance cash flows including from prolonged economic slowdown may
experience triggering event that requires new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly
prior the required annual assessment These types events and resulting analysis could result
impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value
Our amortization expense related intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should
our estimates their useful lives change

event default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders our debt declare all
amounts owed them under such agreements immediately due and payable Acceleration our
other indebtedness may cause unable make interest payments the senior notes and repay the

decisions purchase our products Furthermore can have assurance that our cost reduction
programs will generate adequate cost savings Additionally may become necessary take additional

Expanding Emerging Markets Emerging markets comprising Asia excluding Japan Eastern
Europe Latin America the Middle East and Africa account for approximately our total net sales
have two pronged strategy emerging markets first capitalize long term growth
opportunities these markets and second leverage our low cost manufacturing operations China
have almost year track record China and our sales Asia have grown more than
compound annual growth basis local currencies since have broadened our product offering
the Asian markets and benefit multinational customers shift production China India has also been
source emerging market sales growth past years due increased life science research activities
Overall market conditions emerging markets were generally favorable during experienced
increase emerging market local currency sales during versus the prior year which included
local currency sales growth China Emerging market sales can volatile and uncertain
continue experience unfavorable market conditions and reduced demand certain industrial related
end user segments China due overcapacity Within China continue redeploy resources and
sales and marketing efforts the faster growing segments pharma food safety and environment
believe the long term growth these segments will favorably impacted the Chinese government
emphasis science high value industries and product quality expect our laboratory process
analytics and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from these segments also
continue invest and add sales and marketing resources pursue growth underpenetrated emerging
markets
Extending Our Technology Lead continue focus product innovation the last three years
spent approximately net sales research and development seek drive shorter product
life cycles well improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated

Maintaining Cost Leadership continue strive improve our margins optimizing our cost
structure For example have focused reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure
support our investments market penetration initiatives higher growth areas and opportunities for
margin improvement have also initiated various restructuring programs over the past few years
response changing market conditions previously mentioned shifting production China has also
been important component our cost savings initiatives have also implemented global
procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed lowering supply
costs Our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused continuously improving our
invested capital efficiency such reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns
our expenditures
Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions seek pursue bolt acquisitions that may leverage our
global sales and service network respected brand extensive distribution channels and technological
leadership have identified life sciences product inspection and process analytics three key areas
for acquisitions For example during the third quarter acquired substantially all the assets
Henry Troemner LLC Troemner supplier lab equipment weights and weight calibration based
the United States for aggregate purchase price million that will integrated into our
laboratory product offering During the third quarter also acquired real time water purity
technology the United States that has been integrated into our process analytics product offering

obligations and commitments addition liquidity includes the ability obtain appropriate financing
Currently our financing requirements are primarily driven working capital requirements capital
expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions Global market conditions are uncertain and our ability
generate cash flows could reduced deterioration global market conditions
Cash provided operating activities totaled million compared million

the repatriation such foreign earnings will withholding taxes All other undistributed earnings are
considered permanently reinvested December had immaterial amount cash

Effect Currency Results Operations
Our earnings are affected changing exchange rates are most sensitive changes the
exchange rates between the Swiss franc euro and dollar have more Swiss franc expenses than
Swiss franc sales because develop and manufacture products Switzerland that sell
globally and have number corporate functions located Switzerland When the Swiss franc
strengthens against our other trading currencies particularly the dollar and euro our earnings
down also have significantly more sales the euro than expenses When the euro weakens
against the dollar and Swiss franc our earnings also down
entered into foreign currency forward contracts that reduce our exposure from the Swiss franc
strengthening against the euro through Absent these foreign currency forward contracts estimate
strengthening the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax
approximately million million annually also estimate strengthening the Swiss
franc against the dollar would reduce our earnings before tax approximately million annually
addition the previously mentioned strengthening the Swiss franc against the euro impact
also conduct business many geographies throughout the world including Asia Pacific the United
Kingdom Eastern Europe Latin America and Canada Fluctuations these currency exchange rates
against the dollar can also affect our operating results The most significant these currency
exposures the Chinese renminbi The impact our earnings before tax the Chinese renminbi
weakening against the dollar reduction approximately million million
annually
Over the past two years the dollar strengthened against most the major currencies throughout
the world The strength the dollar may have significant negative impact the Company
financial performance the future
addition the effects exchange rate movements operating profits our debt levels can fluctuate
due changes exchange rates particularly between the dollar and the euro Based our
outstanding debt December estimate that weakening the dollar against the
currencies which our debt denominated would result increase approximately million
the reported dollar value our debt
Taxes
are subject taxation many jurisdictions throughout the world Our effective tax rate and tax
liability will affected number factors such changes law the amount taxable income
particular jurisdictions the tax rates such jurisdictions tax treaties between jurisdictions the extent
which transfer funds between jurisdictions and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions Generally
the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group determined either non consolidated noncombined basis consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject tax
the same jurisdiction either case without regard the taxable losses non consolidated noncombined affiliated legal entities
Environmental Matters
are subject environmental laws and regulations the jurisdictions which operate
own lease number properties and manufacturing facilities around the world Like many our
competitors have incurred and will continue incur capital and operating expenditures and other
costs complying with such laws and regulations
are currently involved have potential liability with respect the remediation past
contamination certain our facilities former subsidiary Mettler Toledo LLC known Speed
Checkweigher Inc was one two private parties ordered the New Jersey Department
Environmental Protection administrative consent order signed June investigate and
remediate certain ground water contamination property Landing New Jersey After the other party
under this order failed fulfill its obligations Speed became solely responsible for compliance with
the order Residual ground water contamination this site now within Classification Exception Area
which the Department Environmental Protection has approved and within which the Company oversees
monitoring the decay contaminants concern concurrent Well Restriction Area also exists for the
site The Department Environmental Protection does not view these vehicles remedial measures but
rather institutional controls that must adequately maintained and periodically evaluated
estimate that the costs compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate
total million
addition certain our present and former facilities have had been operation for many
decades and over such time some these facilities may have used substances generated and disposed
wastes which are may considered hazardous possible that these sites well disposal sites
owned third parties which have sent wastes may the future identified and become the
subject remediation Although believe that are substantial compliance with applicable
environmental requirements and date have not incurred material expenditures connection with
environmental matters possible that could become subject additional environmental liabilities
the future that could have material adverse effect our financial condition results operations
cash flows
Inflation
Inflation can affect the costs goods and services that use including raw materials
manufacture our products The competitive environment which operate limits somewhat our ability
recover higher costs through increased selling prices
Moreover there may differences inflation rates between countries which incur the major
portion our costs and other countries which sell products which may limit our ability recover
increased costs remain committed operations China Eastern Europe India and Brazil which
have experienced inflationary conditions date inflationary conditions have not had material effect
our operating results However our presence China Eastern Europe India and Brazil increases
these inflationary conditions could have greater impact our operating results
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and not use them for
trading purposes
have entered into foreign currency forward contracts hedge certain forecasted intercompany
sales and economically hedge short term intercompany balances with our international businesses
monthly basis Such contracts limit our exposure both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations
The net fair value the foreign currency contracts hedging short term intercompany balances was
million net liability December sensitivity analysis changes the foreign currencydenominated contracts indicates that the primary currency primarily dollar Swiss franc and the
euro declined the fair value derivatives not designated hedging instruments would increase
million December Any resulting changes fair value would offset changes
the underlying economic position The sensitivity analysis assumes parallel shift foreign currency
exchange rates The assumption that exchange rates change parallel fashion may overstate the impact
changing exchange rates assets and liabilities denominated foreign currency also have other
currency risks described under Effect Currency Results Operations
have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements These contracts are more fully described
Note our audited consolidated financial statements The fair value these contracts was net loss
million December Based our agreements outstanding December point increase interest rates would result increase the net aggregate market value these
instruments million Conversely basis point decrease interest rates would result
million decrease the net aggregate market value these instruments December Any
change fair value would not affect our consolidated statement operations unless such agreements and
the debt they hedge were prematurely settled
Critical Accounting Policies
Management discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations based
upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared accordance with
GAAP The preparation these consolidated financial statements requires make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure
contingent assets and liabilities ongoing basis evaluate our estimates including those related
pensions and other post retirement benefits trade accounts receivable inventories intangible assets
income taxes and revenue base our estimates historical experience and various other
assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances the results which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
conditions
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used the preparation our audited consolidated financial statements For detailed
discussion the application these and other accounting policies see Note our audited
consolidated financial statements
Employee benefit plans
The net periodic pension cost for and projected benefit obligation December
were million and million respectively for our pension plan The net periodic cost for
and projected benefit obligation December were million and million
respectively for our international pension plans The net periodic post retirement benefit for and
expected post retirement benefit obligation December for our post retirement medical
benefit plan were million and million respectively
Pension and post retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions
utilized actuarial valuations The most significant these assumptions include the discount rate and
expected return plan assets accordance with GAAP actual results that differ from the
assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods While management believes the
assumptions used are appropriate differences actual experience changes assumptions may affect
our plan obligations and future expense
The expected rates return the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based the
asset allocation each plan and the long term projected return those assets which represent
diversified mix and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities
froze our defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for
certain current and all future employees Consequently significant future service costs will incurred
these plans For the weighted average return assets assumption was for the plan
and for the international plans change the rate return would impact annual benefit
plan expense approximately million after tax
The discount rates for defined benefit and post retirement plans are set benchmarking against
high quality corporate bonds For the average discount rate assumption was for the plan
and for the international plans representing weighted average local rates countries where
such plans exist change the discount rate would impact annual benefit plan expense
approximately million after tax
early order reduce the size and potential volatility our defined benefit pension
plan obligation offered approximately former employees who have deferred vested pension plan
benefits one time option receive lump sum distribution their benefits Based upon the eligible
participant acceptance million was paid from plan assets these former employees the second
quarter with corresponding decrease the benefit obligation The Company incurred one time
non cash settlement charge recorded other charges income net during the second quarter
approximately million which million million after tax was reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income
Equity based compensation
also have equity incentive plan that provides for the grant stock options restricted stock
units and other equity based awards which are accounted for and recognized the consolidated
statement operations based the grant date fair value the award This methodology yields
estimate fair value based part number management estimates the most significant which
include future volatility and estimated option lives Changes these assumptions could significantly
impact the estimated fair value stock options
Trade accounts receivable
December trade accounts receivable were million net million
allowance for doubtful accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded the invoiced amount and not bear interest The
allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate probable credit losses our existing trade
accounts receivable determine the allowance based upon review both specific accounts for
collection and the age the accounts receivable portfolio
Inventories
December inventories were million
record our inventory the lower cost net realizable value Cost which includes direct
materials labor and overhead generally determined using the first first out FIFO method The
estimated net realizable value based assumptions for future demand and related pricing Adjustments
the cost basis our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based usage orders and
technological obsolescence actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
management reductions the value inventory may required
Goodwill and other intangible assets
December our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill million and
other intangible assets million
Our business acquisitions typically result goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the
amount future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense The determination the
value such intangible assets requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect our
consolidated financial statements
accordance with GAAP our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized
but are evaluated for impairment annually the fourth quarter more frequently events changes
circumstances indicate that asset might impaired The annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are generally based assessment qualitative factors determine whether
more likely than not that the fair value the asset less than its carrying amount
are unable conclude that the goodwill asset not impaired after considering the totality
events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment perform the first step the two step
impairment test estimating the fair value the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value the
carrying amount the goodwill asset the carrying amount the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value
then perform the second step the impairment test measure the amount the impairment loss
any
are unable conclude that the indefinite lived intangible asset not impaired after
considering the totality events and circumstances perform impairment test measure the
amount the impairment loss any
Both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results business plans economic
conditions and market data among other factors There are inherent uncertainties related these factors
and our judgment applying them the impairment analyses Our assessments date have indicated
that there has been impairment these assets
Should any these estimates assumptions change should incur lower than expected
operating performance cash flows including from prolonged economic slowdown may
experience triggering event that requires new fair value assessment for our reporting units possibly
prior the required annual assessment These types events and resulting analysis could result
impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value
Our amortization expense related intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should
our estimates their useful lives change
Income taxes
Income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits
reflect management assessment estimated future taxes paid items the consolidated
financial statements record valuation allowance reduce our deferred tax assets the amount that
more likely than not realized While have considered future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies assessing the need for the valuation allowance the event
were determine that would able realize our deferred tax assets the future excess the
net recorded amount adjustment the deferred tax asset would increase income equity the period
such determination was made Likewise should determine that would not able realize all
part the net deferred tax asset the future adjustment the deferred tax asset would charged
income the period such determination was made
plan repatriate earnings from China Switzerland Germany Luxembourg the United
Kingdom and certain other countries future years and expect the only additional cost associated with
the repatriation such earnings outside the United States will withholding taxes All other
undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested
The significant assumptions and estimates described the preceding paragraphs are important
contributors our ultimate effective tax rate for each year addition our income mix from
geographical regions any our assumptions estimates were change should our income mix
from our geographical regions change our effective tax rate could materially affected Based
earnings before taxes million for the year ended December each increase
million tax expense would increase our effective tax rate
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognized when title product has transferred and any significant customer
obligations have been fulfilled Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point most
countries and accordingly title and risk loss transfers upon shipment countries where title cannot
legally transfer before delivery the Company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred The
Company generally maintains the right accept reject product return its terms and conditions and
also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits Shipping and handling costs charged
customers are included total net sales and the associated expense recorded cost sales for all
periods presented Other than few small software applications the Company does not sell software
products without the related hardware instrument the software embedded the instrument The
Company products typically require significant production modification customization the
hardware software that essential the functionality the products the extent the Company
solutions have significant post shipment obligation revenue deferred until the obligation has been
completed The Company defers product revenue where installation required unless such installation
deemed perfunctory The Company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the
separate delivery multiple goods and services These deliverables are accounted for separately the
deliverables have stand alone value and the performance undelivered items probable and within the
Company control The allocation revenue between the separate deliverables typically based the
relative selling price the time the sale accordance with number factors including service
technician billing rates time install and geographic location
Certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes
any further obligations the customer upon title transfer Revenue recognized these products upon
transfer title and risk loss distributors Distributor discounts are offset against revenue the time
such revenue recognized
Service revenue not under contract recognized upon the completion the service performed
Spare parts sold stand alone basis are recognized upon title and risk loss transfer which
generally the time shipment Revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the
contract period These contracts represent obligation perform repair and other services including
regulatory compliance qualification calibration certification and preventative maintenance
customer pre defined equipment over the contract period Service contracts are separately priced and
payment typically received from the customer the beginning the contract period
