Table Contents
Industry Background
intend pursue the application our Simoa technology the life science research diagnostics and precision health screening markets Our initial
commercial strategy targets the large and growing life science research market and believe that the diagnostic market and the precision health screening
market represents significant future commercial opportunities for Simoa According estimates the Third Party Research Report believe the
aggregate market opportunity for others using Simoa has the potential expand billion researchers and healthcare practitioners develop new
applications for our products that span the continuum from research through diagnosis and precision health
Proteins are versatile macromolecules and serve critical functions nearly all biological processes They are complex molecules that organisms require
for the structure function and regulation the body tissues and organs For example proteins provide immune protection generate movement transmit
nerve impulses and control cell growth and differentiation Understanding organism proteome the complete set proteins and their expression levels
can provide powerful and unique window into its health window that other types research such genomics cannot provide
The human body contains approximately genes One the core functions genes which are comprised DNA regulate protein
production which ones are produced the volume each and for how long influenced both biological and environmental factors These genes
help govern the expression over proteins approximately which are known secreted blood and fewer than which can
consistently detected healthy individuals using conventional immunoassay technologies Accordingly the study much the proteome has not been
practical given the limited level sensitivity existing technologies date have developed assays that address approximately the proteins
secreted blood estimate that the current sensitivity our Simoa technology has the potential detect and measure one third the
approximately proteins secreted blood that are not consistently detectable using conventional immunoassay technologies
While genomic research provides valuable information about the role genes health and disease proteins are both more prevalent than nucleic acids
and believe more relevant understand precisely the nuanced continuum between health and disease Genes may indicate the risk developing
certain disease later life but they are not able account for the impact environmental factors and lifestyle such diet and exercise provide insight
into what happening patient body real time For example identical twins have the same genotype but may develop different diseases over the
course their lifetime largely due environmental factors
Much like the sequencing the human genome with the Human Genome Project and the development both PCR and next generation sequencing
technologies detect nucleic acids both which accelerated biomedical genomic research believe the ability study more the proteome enabled
our more sensitive protein detection technology will have profound impact proteomic research With our ultra sensitive Simoa detection technology
researchers can assess the symptoms disease injury and compare them the presence and levels relevant proteins that are not detectable using
conventional technologies leading better understanding how proteins individually and collectively impact and influence important biological
processes and the health and well being individuals believe this research into understanding the individual characteristics and functioning proteins
will central earlier detection monitoring prognosis and ultimately prevention providing researchers with the ability assess the impact
particular proteins the progress disease and injury from the time early onset symptoms

Existing Technologies and Their Limitations
Protein Analysis
The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA has been the most widely used method sensitive detection proteins for over years simple
terms ELISA unknown amount antigen protein peptide antibody hormone affixed solid surface usually polystyrene multiwell plate
either directly indirectly through use conjugated secondary capture antibody sandwich ELISA specific detection antibody applied over
the surface bind the antigen This detection antibody linked enzyme and the final step substance called enzyme substrate added and
the enzyme converts colored fluorescent product molecules which are detected plate reader Sandwich ELISA depicted the graphic below
Aside from ELISA there are other technologies available for protein analysis today such Western blotting mass spectrometry chromatography
surface plasmon resonance Raman enhanced signal detection immune PCR and biobarcode assay However the proteins detectable these conventional
analog immunoassay technologies represent mere fraction what estimated approximately secreted proteins circulation human blood
While number techniques have been used attempt increase sensitivity detection believe all these approaches have limitations including
dilution colored fluorescent product molecules due large volume liquid traditional sized wells limiting sensitivity
narrow dynamic range the range concentration proteins being detected that may require sample dilution diluting molecules and
increasing sample volume requiring additional enzymes reach detection limit
low detection limit readers restrict sensitivity and ability detect low abundance proteins particularly when proteins are normal
physiological levels and
limited success increasing sensitivity detection due procedural complexity and length
Genomic Analysis
Over the past few decades scientists have developed variety genomic analysis methods measure increasing number genomic biomarkers
aimed more effectively detecting diseases The most widely used method for genetic testing PCR which involves amplifying generating billions
copies the DNA sequence question and then detecting the DNA with the use fluorescent dyes PCR used amplify the nucleic acid through the
use enzymes and repeated heating and cooling cycles with fluorescent dyes incorporated during each amplification cycle The expression the nucleic
acid then inferred based the number amplification cycles required for the target become
Table Contents
detectable PCR sometimes referred analog technology because the number cycles amplification rather than direct measure used infer
the level gene expression The wide availability PCR chemistry makes popular approach for measuring the expression nucleic acids but the use
enzymes numerous cycles amplification can introduce distortion and bias into the data potentially compromising the reliability results
particularly low concentrations
Due the complexity susceptibility contamination and significant costs related PCR and other existing technologies the genomic testing market
generally remains limited reference laboratories research facilities and laboratories associated with large hospitals typical molecular diagnostics
laboratory hospital research laboratory setting dedicated facility that employs highly skilled technologists and supervised technician with
guard against contamination which common result target amplification typical laboratory will require least three
separate rooms isolation areas perform PCR based assay methods for genomic testing
Our Simoa Digital Technology
Our Simoa technology significantly advances conventional sandwich ELISA technology and capable unprecedented protein detection sensitivity
Simoa digital immunoassays utilize the basic principles conventional bead based sandwich ELISA and require two antibodies one for capture which
applied the beads and one for detection Unlike ELISA which runs the enzyme substrate reaction all molecules one well Simoa reactions are run
individual molecules tiny microwells trillionths milliliter that are billion times smaller than traditional ELISA wells Traditional ELISA analog
measurements increase intensity only the concentration sample increases Simoa digital technology measurements however are independent
sample concentration intensity and rely binary signal signal readout enabling detection sensitivity that was not previously possible
Our Simoa platform highly flexible designed enable practical high sensitivity protein analysis for academic researchers looking novel proteins
all the way through high throughput analysis performed large biopharmaceutical organizations The following chart describes the steps through which
our Simoa technology detects proteins
Simoa Analytic Process
Sample Preparation ELISA Sandwich
Simoa uses beads coated with capture antibodies that bind
specifically the protein being measured After enzymelinked detection antibody binds the protein the enzyme
substrate added depicted the white star the

Injection Bead Substrate Solution into Simoa Disk
This mixture beads and enzyme substrate then injected
into our proprietary Simoa disk which contains arrays
microwells arranged radially Each millimeter array
contains approximately microwells each which
large enough accommodate only single bead
Bead Substrate Solution Settles and Wells are Sealed
The bead substrate solution drawn across the array and
the beads settle gravity onto the surface the array and
fraction them fall into the microwells The remainder lie
the surface and oil introduced into the channel
displace the substrate solution and excess beads and most
importantly seal the wells
Simoa Readout
The entire array then imaged using ultrasensitive digital
imaging and the sealed wells that contain beads associated
with captured and enzyme labeled protein molecules are
identified
Our Simoa technology offers unprecedented protein detection sensitivity and enables detection low abundance and previously undetectable
biomarkers The following chart shows examples the levels detection LoD certain Simoa assays and commercially available ELISA assay
compared the median lower normal plasma clinical ranges various protein biomarkers shown below the LoD for most the assays from leading
manufacturer commercial ELISA assays above the median lower normal plasma clinical ranges making these biomarkers undetectable normal

Multiplexing Capability
The ability multiplex simultaneously measure multiple proteins other biomarkers single assay can important researchers maximize
the biological information from sample and develop more specific diagnostic tests Importantly Simoa multiplexing maintains single plex precision
while competitive platforms lose sensitivity when multiplexing used Multiplexing achieved with our Simoa technology using beads labeled with
different fluorescent dyes specific the biomarker being analyzed After the assay run the array microwells imaged across the wavelengths the
different labeled beads The results are measured for each protein captured each the different beads
have demonstrated the ability identify and differentiate different bead subpopulations the Simoa Analyzer which
prerequisite our ability develop assay with the capacity detect equivalent number proteins single sample
commercially launched Simoa neurology plex assay tau GFAP and UCH for the study traumatic brain injury and other
neurodegenerative conditions Simoa the only technology with the sensitivity detect all four these markers blood whereas other assay technologies
require cerebrospinal fluid CSF detect all four these markers due sensitivity limitations This significant advantage terms ease use
patient comfort speed and cost effectiveness

Nucleic Acid Testing
Our initial focus has been the use Simoa detect protein biomarkers However are also developing our Simoa technology detect nucleic
acids biological samples While methods for measuring nucleic acid molecules have advanced substantially currently available techniques still have
drawbacks For example polymerase chain reaction PCR sensitive method that widely used for measuring gene expression However PCR carries
the potential for data distortion and bias from the repeated addition enzymes and heating and cooling cycles needed amplify copy the nucleic acid
being measured nucleic acid analysis believe that Simoa has the potential provide the same sensitivity traditional PCR based assays with the
following benefits
need for amplification the targeted nucleic acid which can result amplification distortion and bias
reduced cross contamination because direct detection single molecules the detection large number copies the nucleic acid
and
the ability detect some samples without requiring purification the nucleic acid such environmental water
For detection nucleic acids with Simoa instead coating the beads with capture antibodies done for detecting proteins the beads are coated
with nucleic acid capture probes Samples with the target nucleic acid molecules are then added and are captured the beads Nucleic acid detection probes
instead detection antibodies are then added and attach the target nucleic acid molecules which are then labeled using enzyme substrate that
detected and counted using the Simoa disk and instrument This assay pictured below
Simoa has been used detect short sequences RNA known microRNA that are important number biological systems and are widely used
innovative therapeutic and gene editing technologies The assay was used detect microRNA miR marker liver toxicity from

For example researchers have conducted studies using Simoa that indicate that neurological biomarkers including tau and may someday able
replace diagnostic imaging diagnose traumatic brain injury TBI Our Simoa assays for tau and are fold and fold more sensitive
respectively than the leading assay platforms and are the only assays that can reliably detect these critical protein biomarkers blood Almost
patients who visit hospital emergency rooms and receive computerized tomography scan show structural brain injury addition scans
have approximately times more radiation than chest ray and are suspected causing cancer people per year underscoring the need
for development safe and accurate blood based diagnostic test for TBI which believe may enabled our Simoa technology
Simoa also has significant potential the emerging field companion diagnostics companion diagnostic test biomarker test that specifically
linked therapeutic drug that can help predict how patient will respond the drug Drug developers can use companion diagnostics stratify patients
and select only those patients study for whom drug expected most effective and safe Companion diagnostics have demonstrated the ability
both improve the probability approval and accelerate approval new drugs Not only can Simoa used develop companion diagnostics stratify
patients clinical trials and for treatment but Simoa sensitivity also enables the development companion diagnostics based protein biomarkers that
can actively and regularly monitor whether approved drug having the desired biological effect This can quickly and efficiently enable doctors adjust
the course treatment appropriate increasing decreasing dosages even switching therapies
There has been significant interest from third parties use our technology develop applications for the diagnostic market which has resulted
collaborations with leading diagnostic companies such bioM rieux addition have had discussions with lab service companies that are interested

analog immunoassay technologies will enable our technology used monitor protein biomarker levels seemingly healthy asymptomatic people
and potentially signal and provide earlier detection the onset disease This may facilitate paradigm shift healthcare from emphasis
treatment focus earlier detection monitoring prognosis and ultimately prevention enabling precision health revolution
believe there the potential for number neurological cardiovascular oncologic and other protein biomarkers associated with disease
measured with simple blood draw regular ongoing basis part patient routine health screening and for those results compared
periodically with baseline measurements predict detect the early onset disease prior the appearance symptoms
According estimates the Third Party Research Report believe that the total diagnostic and precision health screening markets addressable
and others using Simoa have the potential reach aggregate billion per year upon receipt the necessary regulatory approvals which have
not yet begun the process obtain
Our Key Focus Areas
have focused the application our Simoa technology areas high growth and high unmet need and where existing platforms have significant
shortcomings that our technology addresses particular have focused the following areas neurology oncology cardiology infectious disease and
inflammation
Neurology
believe that the ability our Simoa technology detect neurological biomarkers blood ultra low levels which have traditionally only been
detectable cerebrospinal fluid CSF has the potential rapidly advance neurology research and drug development and transform the way brain injuries
and diseases are diagnosed and treated our knowledge the brain the only organ the body for which there not currently blood based diagnostic
test The challenge with developing blood based tests for the brain that the blood brain barrier which formed endothelial cells lining the cerebral
microvasculature very tight and severely restricts the movement proteins and other substances between these endothelial cells and into blood
circulation Accordingly diagnosis brain disease and injury has traditionally required either MRI scan the brain spinal tap collect CSF both
which are costly and highly invasive for the patient The sensitivity the Simoa platform has enabled researchers discover that extremely small
amounts critical neural biomarkers diffuse through the blood brain barrier and are released into the blood during injury and connection with many
neurodegenerative brain diseases However the concentrations these neural biomarkers the blood are low that they are undetectable conventional
analog immunoassay technologies
one example have developed ultra sensitive protein assays for the neural biomarkers and tau that are approximately fold
more sensitive respectively than benchmark commercial assays Our protein assays are the only currently available assays the market capable precise
measurement these neural biomarkers blood diseased and healthy individuals
date there have been over scientific publications approximately neural biomarkers using our Simoa technology and believe that ultrasensitive digital detection neural related biomarkers the blood becoming essential research and development tool for increasing range
neurological disorders including CTE Alzheimer disease dementia Parkinson disease
Table Contents
multiple sclerosis and TBI The goal this research eventually develop accurate diagnostic tools predictive health screens and ultimately more
effective treatments
researchers using Simoa technology published paper JAMA Neurology demonstrating that simple blood test for ther neurological
biomarker exhibited the same level diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing Alzheimer disease currently established CSF biomarkers The study was
major study almost patients from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative The graph below depicts the diagnostic accuracy plasma Simoa
measurements compared with traditional CSF biomarkers The diagnostic accuracy the plasma Simoa results approached line with the
CSF biomarkers the same patients
Diagnostic Accuracy
addition Simoa plasma values were associated with cognitive deficits and neuroimaging hallmarks Alzheimer disease baseline and during
follow High plasma correlated with poor cognition and Alzheimer disease related brain atrophy and with brain hypometabolism lower neural
energy These data suggest simple Simoa blood test for may have clinical utility noninvasive biomarker Alzheimer disease
Traumatic brain injuries TBIs lead approximately five million individuals visiting emergency rooms per year the United States alone often with
broad and inconclusive diagnosis Current methods TBI diagnosis involve scans that fail diagnose approximately mild TBI Simoa has
demonstrated the sensitivity identify relevant neurological biomarkers such tau GFAP and UCHL more adequately address diagnosis
TBIs and overall brain health
Leading researchers neurology have used Simoa study biomarkers the blood athletes after concussion many high impact sports Our
platform measures critical neural biomarkers blood that correlate repeated head trauma from both concussions and subconcussive events with poor patient
outcomes including the potential development Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy CTE which currently can diagnosed after death via brain
autopsy recent publication National Institute Health researcher indicates that measuring tau the blood with Simoa may help identify concussed
individuals requiring additional rest before they can safely return play Eventually believe may possible develop mobile screen enabling
clinicians quickly and accurately determine whether safe for concussed athletes return play
Table Contents
commercially launched Simoa neurology plex assay tau GFAP and UCH for the study traumatic brain injury and other
neurodegenerative conditions Whereas other assay technologies require cerebrospinal fluid CSF detect all four these markers due its sensitivity
Simoa the only assay that can detect all these biomarkers directly from blood samples This significant advantage terms ease use patient
comfort speed and cost effectiveness
Fast Company named Quanterix one the World Most Innovative Companies for our work concussion detection also were awarded
two competitive grants from the NFL Head Health Challenge advance this work the detection and quantification mild TBI
estimate that the total addressable market for Simoa for neurology has the potential reach billion across research diagnostic and precision
health screening indications
Oncology
Our ultra sensitive Simoa technology has the potential detect increased levels oncology biomarkers during the very early stages disease
development Biomarkers can useful tools for diagnostics prognostics and predictive cancer detection However many traditional assay technologies can
only detect these biomarkers after the disease has progressed and the patient has become symptomatic Simoa highly sensitive detection capability may
result earlier detection better monitoring and treatment and improved prognoses for patients Additionally Simoa has shown early promise
alternative more invasive diagnostic procedures date there have been scientific publications approximately cancer biomarkers using our
Simoa technology
Simoa was used recent unpublished scientific study that understand indicates may possible eventually replace routine mammograms with
very sensitive more accurate low cost non invasive blood test this retrospective study researchers found that Simoa resulted significantly fewer false
positives and false negatives than mammography Inaccurate mammography results unnecessary stress additional health care costs from follow
diagnostic mammograms unnecessary biopsies and increased lifetime exposure radiation Researchers are also developing ultrasensitive assays for lung
and pancreatic cancer biomarkers using Simoa potentially replacing the need for imaging and biopsy believe our Simoa technology has the potential
lead rapid cost effective accurate blood based health screens further enabling the liquid biopsy market which estimated grow almost billion
Cancer immunotherapy promising new area that significantly affecting cancer remission rates One challenge immunotherapy approaches that
the elicited immune responses are not always predictable and can vary from person person and protocol protocol There exists significant need
develop biomarker tools monitor these drugs and their effects Serum protein biomarkers have the potential used the field immuno oncology
stratify patients predict response predict recurrence reveal mechanism action and predict side effects One technical challenge using these biomarkers
has been the development immunoassays with sufficient sensitivity measure immune modulates directly serum have developed set
ultrasensitive immune modulation assays cytokines and chemokines that can used directly monitor the immune response particular key immune
regulatory cells regs dendritic cells macrophages secrete very low amounts the protein Interferon gamma IFN gamma and these levels cannot
detected serum using conventional analog immunoassay technology however they can tracked with our Simoa IFN gamma assay Additionally
have developed ultra sensitive assay for which one the major immuno oncology targeted antigens Several studies have shown that our
ultrasensitive assays can valuable tools for monitoring immuno oncology drugs and protocols
also believe residual cancer cell detection post surgery treatment may significantly improve outcomes for variety cancer types helping
identify and segment patients greater risk
Table Contents
reoccurrence post surgery due residual cancer have developed ultra sensitive biomarker assay for Prostate Specific Antigen PSA that over
fold more sensitive than benchmark commercial PSA assays This assay the only currently available technology that can detect levels PSA
blood samples prostate cancer patients shortly following radical prostatectomy and and researchers from Johns Hopkins and NYU conducted pilot
study the utility this assay predict recurrence prostate cancer after this procedure this study the blood prostate cancer patients taken three
six months following radical prostatectomy least five years earlier was analyzed with Simoa The majority samples had PSA levels below the
detectable limits traditional PSA assays Our Simoa technology however was able detect and quantify PSA levels all samples shown the
following graph the study demonstrated that the PSA assay using our Simoa technology has the potential highly predictive prostate cancer
recurrence over five year period This has the potential powerful prognostic tool and allowing adjuvant radiation treatment targeted only
the men who actually would benefit
estimate that the total addressable market for Simoa for oncology has the potential reach billion across research diagnostic and precision
health screening indications
Cardiology
Heart disease and related cardiovascular ailments remain the leading cause death the United States contributing nearly deaths the
United States according the CDC significant need remains for early prediction heart attacks and other cardiac events Simoa highly sensitive digital
measurement capabilities have the potential used predict early cardiac disease
date there have been six scientific publications approximately cardiology biomarkers using our Simoa technology
Infectious Disease
The ability detect infectious disease biomarkers before the onset immune response where virus most contagious and multiplying rapidly
critical for controlling the spread disease believe that our Simoa technology can have significant impact reducing the spread infectious diseases
making early stage detection more specific and widely available
Table Contents
Today early detection infectious disease conducted using nucleic acid testing detect the nucleic acid the viral bacterial organism because
the levels infectious disease specific antigens are too low the early stage disease detected traditional immunoassay technology However the
sensitivity our single molecule detection capabilities enables the detection extremely low levels infectious disease specific antigens with sensitivity
that rivals the use nucleic acid testing this application without the potential biases inherent amplification technologies such PCR
have developed simple Simoa assay with more than fold greater sensitivity than benchmark commercial protein assays capable detecting
the HIV specific antigen This Simoa sensitivity matches the sensitivity more expensive and complex nucleic acid testing methods The
following graph shows comparison that conducted the Simoa assay with commercially available nucleic acid testing method well
two commercially available immunoassay methods for early detection HIV infection The Simoa assay detects infection early the nucleic
acid testing method days from initial blood draw and full week before the earliest signs infection the conventional immunoassay methods
This early detection acute HIV infection can critical for controlling the spread HIV HIV ten times more infectious the acute phase
addition believe the detection specific protein more relevant the determination the pathogenic effect than detection the organism
itself because someone may carry pathogenic organism with pathogenic effect Researchers have demonstrated that Simoa can detect Clostridium
difficile diff toxins and with sensitivities similar the PCR detection the diff organism itself Because the diff organism does not always
produce toxins PCR methods that detect the diff organism suffer from very high false positive rates which may result incorrect diagnoses and the
overuse antibiotics believe that using Simoa detect the toxins rather than the organism has the potential provide higher level sensitivity and
specificity greatly reducing false positives
will continue develop Simoa assays for pathogenic antigens that are competitive sensitivity PCR but more specific the pathogenicity
the offending organism believe that these Simoa

assays could also invaluable tools for the development anti infective drugs and treatment monitoring anti viral and anti bacterial drugs
date there have been scientific publications approximately infectious disease biomarkers using our Simoa technology
Inflammation
Inflammation underlies the response the body injury variety diseases Simoa assays can measure inflammatory and anti inflammatory
molecules serum and plasma with unprecedented sensitivity This has the potential enable new discoveries into the role inflammation the biology
health and disease Our Simoa technology measures low levels inflammatory proteins including cytokines and chemokines that characterize range
inflammatory diseases including Crohn disease asthma rheumatoid arthritis and neuro inflammation believe the sensitivity Simoa can provide
clearer picture the underlying state the immune response and disease progression
Our Simoa technology also has the potential used companies developing anti inflammatory drugs quantify the effect drug has
particular inflammatory cytokine and monitor therapeutic efficacy For example conducted study conjunction with the Mayo Clinic using our
Simoa technology patients with clinically active Crohn disease undergoing anti TNF therapy with Remicade Humira Enbrel shown the graph
below researchers were able detect and quantify the TNF levels the patients before and after treatment These levels were all below the limit
detection LoD traditional immunoassays
believe that better understanding the inflammatory response will critical future opportunities for wellness screening and disease response
monitoring Anti inflammatory drugs are expensive and can have serious side effects such increased risk infection monitoring biomarkers
indicative response clinicians may able adjust dose reduce side effects increase efficacy
date there have been scientific publications approximately inflammatory biomarkers using our Simoa technology

Government Regulation
Our products are currently intended for research use only RUO applications although our customers may use our products develop their own
products that are subject regulation the FDA Although most products intended for RUO are not currently subject clearance approval the FDA
RUO products fall under the FDA jurisdiction they are used for clinical rather than research purposes Consequently our products are labeled For
Research Use Only
November the FDA issued Final Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Distribution Vitro Diagnostic
Products Labeled for Research Use Only Investigational Use Only the RUO IUO Guidance The purpose FDA guidance document provide
the FDA current thinking when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO for IUO but with all FDA guidance documents this guidance does not
establish legally enforceable responsibilities and should viewed recommendations unless specific regulatory statutory requirements are cited The
RUO IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are
properly labeled RUO Merely including labeling statement that product intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the device from
the FDA clearance premarket approval other requirements the circumstances surrounding the distribution the product indicate that the
manufacturer intends its product used for clinical diagnostic use These circumstances may include written verbal marketing claims links
articles regarding product performance clinical applications manufacturer provision technical support for clinical validation clinical
applications solicitation business from clinical laboratories all which could considered evidence intended uses that conflict with RUO
labeling Although the RUO IUO Guidance statement the FDA thinking with respect certain RUOs and IUOs and was not intended
compliance requirement believe that our labeling and promotion our products consistent with the RUO IUO Guidance because have not
promoted our products for clinical use humans When develop products for clinical use will accordance with FDA requirements that
time
When our products are marketed for clinical diagnostic use our products will regulated the FDA medical devices The FDA defines medical
device part instrument apparatus implement machine contrivance implant vitro reagent other similar related article which intended for
the diagnosis disease other conditions the cure mitigation treatment prevention disease man This means that the FDA will regulate the
development testing manufacturing marketing post market surveillance distribution advertising and labeling our clinical products and will
required register medical device manufacturer and list our marketed products
The FDA classifies medical devices into one three classes the basis the intended use the device the risk associated with the use the device
for that indication determined the FDA and the controls deemed the FDA necessary reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness
Class devices which have the lowest level risk associated with them are subject
Table Contents
general controls Class devices are subject general controls and special controls including performance standards Class III devices which have the
highest level risk associated with them are subject general controls and premarket approval Most Class devices and some Class devices are exempt
from requirement that the manufacturer submit premarket notification and receive clearance from the FDA which otherwise premarketing
requirement for Class device Class III devices may not commercialized until premarket approval application PMA submitted and approved
the FDA
Clearance Pathway
obtain clearance sponsor must submit the FDA premarket notification demonstrating that the device substantially equivalent
device legally marketed the for which PMA was not required The FDA supposed make determination within days FDA receipt
the but often takes longer the FDA requests additional information Most not require supporting data from clinical trials but the
FDA may request such data
Premarket Approval Pathway
PMA must submitted new device cannot cleared through the process The PMA process generally more complex costly and time
consuming than the process PMA must supported extensive data including but not limited technical preclinical clinical trials
manufacturing and labeling demonstrate the FDA satisfaction the safety and effectiveness the device for its intended use After PMA sufficiently
complete the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin depth review the submitted information statute the FDA has days
review the accepted application although review the application generally can take between one and three years During this review period the FDA may
request additional information clarification information already provided Also during the review period advisory panel experts from outside the
FDA may convened review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations the FDA the approvability the device addition the
FDA will conduct preapproval inspection the manufacturing facility ensure compliance with its quality system regulations QSRs New premarket
approval applications premarket approval application supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy the
device
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are usually required support PMA and are sometimes required for the the device determined present
significant risk the manufacturer may not begin clinical trial until submits investigational device exemption application IDE and obtains
approval the IDE from the FDA These clinical trials are also subject the review approval and oversight institutional review board IRB each
clinical trial site The clinical trials must conducted accordance with the FDA IDE regulations and good clinical practices clinical trial may
suspended FDA the sponsor IRB its institution any time for various reasons including belief that the risks the study participants outweigh
the benefits participation the trial Even clinical trial completed the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy device the
satisfaction the FDA may equivocal otherwise not sufficient obtain approval device
Table Contents
After medical device placed the market numerous regulatory requirements apply These include among other things
compliance with QSRs which require manufacturers follow stringent design testing control documentation record maintenance including
maintenance complaint and related investigation files and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process
reporting device malfunctions serious injuries deaths
registration the establishments where the devices are produced
labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion products for uncleared unapproved uses and
medical device reporting obligations which require that manufacturers investigate and report the FDA adverse events including deaths
serious injuries that may have been were caused medical device and malfunctions the device that would likely cause contribute
death serious injury were recur
Failure comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result enforcement action the FDA which may include sanctions including but not
limited warning letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure the device operating restrictions partial suspension total shutdown

Europe Rest World Government Regulation
Whether not obtain FDA approval for product must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities non countries prior
the commencement clinical trials marketing our product for clinical diagnostic use those countries The regulations other jurisdictions vary from
those the and may easier more difficult satisfy and are subject change For example the European Union recently published new
regulations that will result greater regulation medical devices and IVDs The IVD Regulation significantly different from the IVD Directive that
replaces that will ensure that the new requirements apply uniformly and the same schedule across the member states include risk based
classification system and increase the requirements for conformity assessment The conformity assessment process results the receipt designation
which has been sufficient begin marketing many types IVDs That process will become more difficult and costly complete
Other Governmental Regulation
are subject laws and regulations related the protection the environment the health and safety employees and the handling transportation
and disposal medical specimens infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials For example the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration OSHA has established extensive requirements relating specifically workplace safety for healthcare employers the This includes
requirements develop and implement multi faceted programs protect workers from exposure blood borne pathogens including preventing
minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries For purposes transportation some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified
hazardous materials and are subject regulation one more the following agencies the Department Transportation the Public Health
Service the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association generally use third party vendors dispose regulated
medical waste hazardous waste and radioactive materials that may use during our research

Our success depends our ability develop and market products that are recognized and accepted reliable enabling and cost effective Most the
potential customers for our products already use expensive research systems their laboratories that they have used for many years and may reluctant
replace those systems with ours Market acceptance our Simoa technology will depend many factors including our ability convince potential
customers that our technology attractive alternative existing technologies Compared some competing technologies our Simoa technology new
and complex and many potential customers have limited knowledge experience with our products Prior adopting our systems some potential
customers may need devote time and effort testing and validating our systems Any failure our systems meet these customer benchmarks could
result potential customers choosing retain their existing systems purchase systems other than ours addition important that our Simoa

Our future success dependent upon our ability further penetrate our existing customer base and attract new customers
Our current customer base primarily composed academic and governmental research institutions well biopharmaceutical and contract research
companies Our success will depend upon our ability respond the evolving needs and increase our market share among existing customers and
additional potential customers marketing new products develop them Identifying engaging and marketing customers who are unfamiliar with our
current products requires substantial time expertise and expense and involves number risks including
our ability attract retain and manage the sales marketing and service personnel necessary expand market acceptance for our Simoa

any material component used clinical test would required confirm through additional testing that the change does not adversely affect the
reliability the test Any such additional testing may expensive and time consuming and delay our introduction new products and systems
the near term our business will depend levels research and development spending academic and governmental research institutions and
biopharmaceutical companies reduction which could limit demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating results
the near term expect that our revenue will derived primarily from sales our instruments and consumables academic and governmental
research institutions well biopharmaceutical and contract research companies worldwide for research applications The demand for our products will
depend part upon the research and development budgets these customers which are impacted factors beyond our control such

affect our operating results Our operating results may fluctuate substantially due reductions and delays research and development expenditures these
customers Any decrease customers budgets expenditures the size scope frequency capital operating expenditures could materially and
adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition
The sales cycle for our Simoa instruments can lengthy and variable which makes difficult for forecast revenue and other operating results
The sales process for our Simoa instruments generally involves numerous interactions with multiple individuals within organization and often
includes depth analysis potential customers our technology and products and lengthy review process Our customers evaluation processes often
involve number factors many which are beyond our control result these factors the capital investment required purchase our systems and
the budget cycles our customers the time from initial contact with customer our receipt purchase order can vary significantly Given the length

example introduction the Quanterix may result decrease revenue from our existing Simoa Analyzer instrument Consistent with our
strategy offering new products and product refinements expect continue use substantial amount capital for product development and
refinement may need additional capital for product development and refinement than available terms favorable all which could
adversely affect our business financial condition results operations
generally sell our products industries that are characterized rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing
industry standards not develop new products and product enhancements based technological innovation timely basis our products may
become obsolete over time and our revenues cash flow profitability and competitive position will suffer Our success will depend several factors
including our ability

enhancements may incur substantial costs doing and our profitability may suffer
Our ability develop new products based innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment significant resources
Difficulties delays research development production new products and services failure gain market acceptance new products and
technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect our competitive position
not successfully develop and introduce new assays for our technology may not generate new sources revenue and may not able
successfully implement our growth strategy
Our business strategy includes the development new assays for our Simoa instruments New assays require significant research and development and
commitment significant resources prior their commercialization Our technology complex and cannot sure that any assays may intend
develop will developed successfully proven effective offer improvements over currently available tests meet applicable standards produced
commercial quantities acceptable costs successfully marketed Moreover development particular assays may require licenses access third
party intellectual property which may not available commercially reasonable terms all addition believe that our future success will
depend part our ability develop and commercialize multiplex assays that can simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers The most robust
multiplex assay that have commercially launched date plex assay not successfully develop new assays for our Simoa instruments
including multiplex assays with the ability detect increased number biomarkers single sample could lose revenue opportunities with existing
future customers
not successfully manage the development and launch new products our financial results could adversely affected
commercially launched our Quanterix instrument December face risks associated with launching new products such the
Quanterix encounter development manufacturing challenges discover errors during our product development cycle the product launch
dates new products may delayed The expenses losses associated with unsuccessful product development launch activities lack market
acceptance our new products could adversely affect our business financial condition
Undetected errors defects our products could harm our reputation decrease market acceptance our products expose product liability

generally enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants and contractors These
agreements generally provide that inventions conceived the party the course rendering services will our exclusive property However those
agreements may not honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights For example even have consulting agreement
place with academic advisor pursuant which such academic advisor required assign any inventions developed connection with providing
services such academic advisor may not have the right assign such inventions may conflict with his her obligations assign all such
intellectual property his her employing institution
addition sometimes enter into agreements where provide services third parties such customers Under such circumstances our agreements
may provide that certain intellectual property that conceive the course providing those services assigned the customer those cases would
not able use that particular intellectual property for example our work for other customers without license
may not able protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world which could materially negatively affect our business
Filing prosecuting and defending patents current and future products all countries throughout the world would prohibitively expensive and
our intellectual property rights some countries outside the United States can less extensive than those the United States addition the laws some
foreign countries not protect intellectual property rights the same extent federal and state laws the United States Consequently regardless
whether are able prevent third parties from practicing our inventions the United States may not able prevent third parties from practicing
our inventions all countries outside the United States from selling importing products made using our inventions and into the United States
other jurisdictions Competitors may use our technologies jurisdictions where have not pursued and obtained patent protection develop their own
products and further may export otherwise infringing products territories where have patent protection but enforcement not strong the
United States These products may compete with our products and our patents other intellectual property rights may not effective sufficient
prevent them from competing Even pursue and obtain issued patents particular jurisdictions our patent claims other intellectual property rights
may not effective sufficient prevent third parties from competing Patent protection must ultimately sought country country basis
which expensive and time consuming process with uncertain outcomes Accordingly may choose not seek patent protection certain countries
and will not have the benefit patent protection such countries
Many companies have encountered significant problems protecting and defending intellectual property rights foreign jurisdictions The legal
systems certain countries particularly certain developing countries not favor the enforcement patents and other intellectual property protection
particularly those relating biotechnology which could make difficult for stop the infringement our patents marketing competing products

generally Proceedings enforce our patent rights foreign jurisdictions could result substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other
aspects our business could put our patents risk being invalidated interpreted narrowly and our patent applications risk not issuing and could
provoke third parties assert claims against may not prevail any lawsuits that initiate and the damages other remedies awarded any may
not commercially meaningful Accordingly our efforts enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may inadequate obtain
significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that develop license and may adversely impact our business
addition and our partners also face the risk that our products are imported reimported into markets with relatively higher prices from markets
with relatively lower prices which would result decrease sales and any payments receive from the affected market Recent developments
patent law have made more difficult stop these and related practices based theories patent infringement
Changes patent laws patent jurisprudence could diminish the value patents general thereby impairing our ability protect our products
the case with other life science industry companies our success heavily dependent intellectual property particularly patents Obtaining and
enforcing patents involve both technological complexity and legal complexity Therefore obtaining and enforcing patents costly time consuming and
inherently uncertain addition the America Invents Act the AIA was signed into law September and many the substantive changes
became effective March
important change introduced the AIA that March the United States transitioned first file system for deciding which
party should granted patent when two more patent applications are filed different parties claiming the same invention third party that files
patent application the USPTO after that date but before could therefore awarded patent covering invention ours even had made the
invention before was made the third party This will require cognizant going forward the time from invention filing patent application
but circumstances could prevent from promptly filing patent applications our inventions
Among some the other changes introduced the AIA are changes that limit where patent holder may file patent infringement suit and providing
additional opportunities for third parties challenge any issued patent the USPTO This applies all our owned and licensed patents even
those issued before March Because lower evidentiary standard USPTO proceedings compared the evidentiary standard federal
courts necessary invalidate patent claim third party could potentially provide evidence USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO hold
claim invalid even though the same evidence would insufficient invalidate the claim first presented district court action Accordingly third
party may attempt use the USPTO procedures invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated first challenged the third party
defendant district court action The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution our patent
applications and the enforcement defense our issued patents
Additionally the Supreme Court has ruled several patent cases recent years such Impression Products Inc Lexmark International Inc
Association for Molecular Pathology Myriad Genetics Inc Mayo Collaborative Services Prometheus Laboratories Inc and Alice Corporation
Pty Ltd CLS Bank International either narrowing the scope patent protection available certain circumstances weakening the rights patent
owners certain situations addition increasing uncertainty with regard our ability obtain patents the future this combination events has
created uncertainty with respect the value patents once obtained Depending decisions the
Table Contents
Congress the federal courts and the USPTO the laws and regulations governing patents could change unpredictable ways that could weaken our
ability obtain new patents enforce our existing patents and patents that might obtain the future
Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other
requirements imposed governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could reduced eliminated for non compliance with these
requirements
The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with number procedural documentary fee payment and other
provisions during the patent process There are situations which noncompliance can result abandonment lapse patent patent application
resulting partial complete loss patent rights the relevant jurisdiction such event competitors might able enter the market earlier than
would otherwise have been the case some cases our licensors may responsible for for example these payments thereby decreasing our control over
compliance with these requirements
our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected then may not able build name recognition our markets interest and our
business may adversely affected
Our registered unregistered trademarks trade names may challenged infringed circumvented declared generic determined infringing
other marks may not able protect our rights these trademarks and trade names which need build name recognition potential partners
customers our markets interest times competitors may adopt trade names trademarks similar ours thereby impeding our ability build
brand identity and possibly leading market confusion addition there could potential trade name trademark infringement claims brought
owners other registered trademarks Over the long term are unable establish name recognition based our trademarks and trade names then
may not able compete effectively and our business may adversely affected

Numerous factors may limit any potential competitive advantage provided our intellectual property rights
The degree future protection afforded our intellectual property rights uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not
adequately protect our business provide barrier entry against our competitors potential competitors permit maintain our competitive
advantage Moreover third party has intellectual property rights that cover the practice our technology may not able fully exercise extract

Overview
are life sciences company that has developed next generation ultra sensitive digital immunoassay platform that advances precision health for life
sciences research and diagnostics Our platform enables customers reliably detect protein biomarkers extremely low concentrations blood serum and
other fluids that many cases are undetectable using conventional analog immunoassay technologies also allows researchers define and validate the
function novel protein biomarkers that are only present very low concentrations and have been discovered using technologies such mass
spectrometry These capabilities provide our customers with insight into the role protein biomarkers human health that has not been possible with other
existing technologies and enable researchers unlock unique insights into the continuum between health and disease believe this greater insight will
enable the development novel therapies and diagnostics and facilitate paradigm shift healthcare from emphasis treatment focus earlier
detection monitoring prognosis and ultimately prevention are currently focusing our platform protein detection which believe area
significant unmet need and where have significant competitive advantages addition enabling new applications and insights protein analysis
are also developing our Simoa technology detect nucleic acids biological samples
currently sell all our products for life science research primarily laboratories associated with academic and governmental research institutions
well pharmaceutical biotechnology and contract research companies through direct sales force and support organizations North America and
Europe and through distributors sales agents other select markets including Australia China Japan India Lebanon Singapore South Korea and
Taiwan grew our revenue from million million and million
Our instruments are designed used either with assays fully developed including all antibodies and supplies required run the tests with
homebrew kits where supply some the components required for testing and the customer supplies the remaining required elements Accordingly our
installed instruments generate recurring revenue stream believe that our recurring consumable revenue driven our customers ability extract
more valuable data using our platform and process large number samples quickly with little hands preparation
While expect the Quanterix generate lower consumables revenue per instrument than the Simoa Analyzer due its lower throughput
the installed base the Simoa instruments increases total consumables revenue overall expected increase believe that consumables revenue

item considered separate unit accounting when the delivered item has value the customer stand alone basis Items are considered have standalone value when they are sold separately any vendor when the customer could resell the item stand alone basis

recognition criteria are applied each the separate units The Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within the arrangement
using vendor specific objective evidence VSOE selling price available VSOE not available the Company considers third party evidence
available third party evidence selling price VSOE not available the Company uses its best estimate selling price for the deliverable
order establish VSOE selling price the Company must regularly sell the product service standalone basis with substantial majority
priced within relatively narrow range there are not sufficient number standalone sales such that VSOE selling price cannot determined then the
Company considers whether third party evidence can used establish selling price Due the lack similar products and services sold other
companies within the industry the Company has not established selling price using third party evidence
For product and service sales the Company determines its best estimate selling price for instruments consumables services and assays using average
selling prices over rolling month period coupled with assessment market conditions VSOE and third party evidence cannot established The
