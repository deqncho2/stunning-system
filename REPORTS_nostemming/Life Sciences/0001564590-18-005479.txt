chromosome structure identify changes from patterns seen normal chromosomes Cytogenetic studies are often
utilized answer diagnostic prognostic and predictive questions the treatment hematological malignancies
Fluorescence Situ Hybridization FISH branch cancer genetics that focuses detecting and locating the
presence absence specific DNA sequences and genes chromosomes FISH helps bridge abnormality detection
between the chromosomal and DNA sequence levels The technique uses fluorescent probes that bind only those parts
the chromosome with which they show high degree sequence similarity Fluorescence microscopy used visualize
the fluorescent probes bound the chromosomes FISH can used help identify number gene alternations such
amplification deletions and translocations
Flow cytometry rapid way measure the characteristics cell populations Cells from peripheral blood bone marrow
aspirate lymph nodes and other areas are labeled with selective fluorescent antibodies and analyzed they flow fluid
stream through beam light The properties measured these antibodies include the relative size relative granularity
internal complexity and relative fluorescence intensity These fluorescent antibodies bind specific cell surface antigens
and are used identify malignant cell populations Flow cytometry typically performed diagnosing wide variety
leukemia and lymphoma neoplasms Flow cytometry also used monitor patients through therapy determine whether
the disease burden increasing decreasing otherwise known minimal residual disease monitoring
Immunohistochemistry IHC and Digital Imaging Refers the process localizing proteins cells tissue section
and relies the principle antibodies binding specifically antigens biological tissues IHC widely used the
diagnosis abnormal cells such those found cancerous tumors Specific surface cytoplasmic nuclear markers are
characteristic cellular events such proliferation cell death apoptosis IHC also widely used understand the
distribution and localization differentially expressed proteins Digital imaging allows clients see and utilize scanned
slides and perform quantitative analysis for certain stains Scanned slides are received online real time and can
previewed often full day before the glass slides can shipped back clients

Markets
The medical testing laboratory market can broken down into three primary markets
Clinical Pathology testing
Anatomic Pathology testing and
Genetic and Molecular testing
Clinical Pathology testing covers high volume highly automated lower complexity tests easily procured specimens such blood and
urine Clinical lab tests often involve testing less urgent nature for example cholesterol testing and testing associated with routine
physical exams
Anatomic Pathology testing involves evaluation tissue surgical pathology cells cytopathology The most widely performed
Anatomic Pathology procedures include the preparation and interpretation pap smears skin biopsies and tissue biopsies
Genetic and molecular testing typically involves analyzing chromosomes genes proteins and DNA RNA sequences for abnormalities
Genetic and molecular testing requires highly specialized equipment and credentialed individuals typically level certify
results and typically yields the highest reimbursement levels the three market segments
NeoGenomics operates primarily the Genetic and Molecular testing market also act reference laboratory supplying anatomic
pathology testing NeoGenomics typically does not compete the Clinical Pathology testing market
The field cancer genetics evolving rapidly and new tests are being developed accelerated pace Based medical and scientific
discoveries over the last decade cancer testing falls into one three categories diagnostic testing prognostic testing and predictive
testing the three the fastest growing area predictive testing which utilized clinicians predict patient response the
various treatment options order deliver personalized precision medicine that optimized that patient particular
circumstances Personalized precision medicine allows clinicians know patient will will not respond certain medications like
Herceptin Keytruda and Opdivo This saves the healthcare system money ensuring that expensive cancer drugs are only given those
who will benefit from them This type testing improves patient care and potentially saves lives identifying optimized therapies much
more rapidly than what was possible previous years
The United States market for genetic and molecular testing divided among numerous laboratories Many these laboratories are
attached academic institutions and primarily provide clinical services their affiliated university hospitals and associated physicians
believe several key factors are influencing the rapid growth the market for cancer testing every year more and more genes and
genomic pathways are implicated the development and clinical course cancer cancer primarily disease the elderly one

The federal laws governing Medicare Medicaid and other federal health benefits well other state and federal laws regulate certain
aspects the relationships between health care providers including clinical laboratories and their referral sources including physicians
hospitals other laboratories and other entities are subject the federal Anti Kickback Statute federal AKS well similar state
statutes and regulations which prohibit the offer payment solicitation receipt any form remuneration return for referring
ordering leasing purchasing arranging for recommending the ordering purchasing leasing items services payable

exchange for induce referrals Violations the federal AKS may result substantial civil criminal penalties including criminal
fines imprisonment five years civil penalties under the federal CMP Law for each violation
plus three times the remuneration involved civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act for each claim submitted
plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation the Medicare and Medicaid programs
Because the broad proscriptions the federal AKS subsequent federal law required the HHS publish regulations guide the health
care community structuring relationships that would not violate the law The OIG published regulations outlining certain categories
relationships between health care providers and persons entities that may have referral relationship that would deemed not violate
the federal AKS These regulations are known the Safe Harbor Regulations the Safe Harbor Regulations because persons who enter
into transactions that comply with all the criteria for applicable safe harbor will not violate the AKS The Safe Harbor Regulations are

applicable Safe Harbor Regulation not deemed illegal per rather may subject additional scrutiny The Company
endeavors comply with the Safe Harbor Regulations but there can assurance that the Company would not subject
investigation and investigated that relationships could found not comply with the Safe Harbor Regulations
Further most states have adopted similar anti kickback laws prohibiting the offer payment solicitation receipt remuneration
exchange for referrals and typically impose criminal and civil penalties well loss licenses Some these state laws apply items
and services paid for private payers well government payers addition many states have adopted laws prohibiting the splitting
sharing fees between physicians and non physicians well between treating physicians and referral sources believe our

Applicable laboratories must report data that includes the payment rate reflecting all discounts rebates coupons and other price
concessions and the volume each test that was paid each private payer including health insurance issuers group health plans
Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations The definition applicable lab may exclude certain types
laboratories that generally received more favorable pricing than other laboratories and thus the make laboratories reporting pricing
data CMS under the proposed rule may result lower overall pricing data Beginning the Medicare payment rate for each
clinical diagnostic lab test equal the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period For example
laboratories were required collect private payer data from January through June and report CMS March
The new Medicare CLFS rates based weighted median private payer rates was released November and were effective
January Also for the years through the amount reduction the Medicare rate any shall not exceed percent
from the prior year rate and for the years through any reduction shall not exceed percent from the prior year rate too
early predict the impact reimbursement for our tests reimbursed under the CLFS though believe the government goal
reduce Medicare program payments for CLFS tests Specifically CMS states that anticipates the effect the proposed rule the
Medicare program save million program payments for CLFS tests furnished and save billion over years
CMS has also proposed that laboratory failure comply with reporting obligations laboratory that makes misrepresentation
omission reporting required information would violation the Civil Monetary Penalties Law
Also under PAMA CMS required adopt temporary billing codes identify new tests and new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests
that have been cleared approved the FDA For existing test that cleared approved the FDA and for which Medicare
payment made CMS required assign unique billing code one has not already been assigned the agency Further PAMA
provides special payment status advanced diagnostic laboratory tests ADLTs allow such ADLTs paid using their actual list

CMS also adopts regulations and policies from time time revising limiting excluding coverage reimbursement for certain the
tests that perform Likewise many state governments are under budget pressures and are also considering reductions their Medicaid
fees Further Medicare Medicaid and other third party payers audit for overutilization billed services Even though all tests performed
are ordered our clients who are responsible for establishing the medical necessity for the tests ordered may subject
recoupment payments the recipient the payments for such tests the event that third party payer such CMS determines that
the tests failed meet all applicable criteria for payment When third party payers like CMS revise their coverage regulations policies
our costs generally increase due the complexity complying with additional administrative requirements Furthermore Medicaid
reimbursement and regulations vary state Accordingly are subject varying administrative and billing regulations which also
increase the complexity servicing such programs and our administrative costs Finally state budget pressures have encouraged states

recent years Medicare has encouraged beneficiaries participate managed care programs known Medicare Advantage
programs and has encouraged beneficiaries from the traditional fee for service Medicare program switch Medicare Advantage

January CMS made changes what known the day rule regarding Molecular testing Prior CMS day
rule prevented reference and independent laboratories such ours from billing Medicare directly for molecular pathology tests ordered
less than following outpatients discharge from the hospital Instead would seek reimbursement from the hospital and the
hospital would bill Medicare Certain Molecular tests that previously were not allowed billed Medicare are now once again
allowed billed laboratories directly the Medicare program these tests related patients that had testing within days
hospital stay were charged directly the referring hospital Since our client bill pricing typically higher for Molecular testing than
the Medicare fee schedule anticipate reduction revenue from this policy change Under the MolDX program there are many
policies that limit reimbursement certain tests based diagnosis codes and for certain tests there reimbursement regardless the
patient condition

implications Stark Law violation may include criminal penalties exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and potential False
Claims Act liability including via qui tam action
Further many states have promulgated self referral laws and regulations similar the federal Stark Law but these vary significantly based
the state addition services reimbursed Medicaid government payers often these state laws and regulations can encompass
services reimbursed private payers well Penalties for violating state self referral laws and regulations vary based the state but
often include civil and criminal penalties exclusion from Medicaid and loss licenses
Our financial arrangements with physicians are governed the federal Stark Law and rely certain exceptions the Stark Law with
respect such relationships While believe that our financial relationships with physicians and referral practices are compliance with
applicable laws and regulations cannot guarantee that government authorities would agree are found the government
violation the Stark Law could subject significant penalties including fines specified above exclusion from participation
government and private payer programs and requirements refund amounts previously received from government Further our
operations expand into new states and jurisdictions must continually evaluate whether our relationships with physicians comply with
that jurisdiction laws This may require structural and organizational modifications our relationships with physicians which could
adversely affect our results operations and financial condition
The failure comply with Anti Kickback laws may subject liability penalties limitation operations
are subject the federal Anti Kickback Statute the AKS well similar state statutes and regulations which prohibit the offer
payment solicitation receipt any form remuneration return for referring ordering leasing purchasing arranging for
recommending the ordering purchasing leasing items services payable Medicare Medicaid any other federally funded
healthcare program The AKS defines remuneration include anything value cash kind and thus can implicate financial
relationships including payments not commensurate with fair market value such the form space equipment leases professional
technical services anything else value
The AKS intent based statute meaning that violation occurs when one both parties intend the remuneration exchange
for induce referrals however the ACA among other things amended the intent requirement the AKS person entity
longer needs have actual knowledge this statute specific intent violate addition the ACA provides that the government may
assert that claim including items services resulting from violation the AKS constitutes false fraudulent claim for purposes
the false claims statutes There are number statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from
prosecution other regulatory sanctions however the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that not fit
squarely within exception safe harbor may subject scrutiny Violations the AKS may result substantial civil criminal
penalties including criminal fines imprisonment five years civil penalties under the federal CMP Law
for each violation plus three times the remuneration involved civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act
for each claim submitted plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation the Medicare and Medicaid
programs face these penalties the participation exclusion could significantly reduce our revenues and could have material
adverse effect our business
Further most states have adopted similar anti kickback laws prohibiting the offer payment solicitation receipt remuneration
exchange for referrals and typically impose criminal and civil penalties well loss licenses Some these state laws apply items
and services paid for private payers well government payers addition many states have adopted laws prohibiting the splitting
sharing fees between physicians and non physicians well between treating physicians and referral sources believe our
arrangements with

Some states have also adopted laws prohibiting the corporate practice medicine prohibiting business corporations from employing
physicians engaging activities considered the practice medicine these states rely service agreements with
physicians and professional associations owned physicians perform needed professional pathology services cannot assure
you that physician physician professional organization will not seek terminate agreement with any basis nor can

failure comply with governmental payer regulations could result our being excluded from participation Medicare

program imposes extensive and detailed requirements diagnostic service providers including but not limited rules that govern how
structure our relationships with physicians how and when submit claims for reimbursement and how provide specialized
diagnostic laboratory services Further are prohibited from contracting with any individuals entities who have been excluded from
participation Medicare Medicaid and are listed the OIG List Excluded Individuals and Entities List Contracting with excluded
individuals entities such hiring excluded person contracting with excluded vendor can result significant penalties
Our failure comply with applicable Medicare Medicaid and other governmental payer rules could result our inability participate
governmental payer program obligation repay funds already paid for services performed civil monetary penalties criminal
penalties False Claims Act liability and limitations the operational function our laboratory were unable receive

reporting period transaction expenses related acquisitions and potential acquisitions non cash impairments intangible assets
vii debt financing costs and viii other significant non recurring non operating income expenses
Basis for Non GAAP Adjustments
Our basis for excluding certain expenses from GAAP financial measures are outlined below
Interest expense The capital structure companies significantly affects the amount interest expense incurred This
expense can vary significantly between periods and between companies order compare performance between periods and
companies that have different capital structures and thus different levels interest obligations NeoGenomics excludes this
expense
Income tax expense benefit The tax positions companies can vary because their differing abilities take advantage
tax benefits and because the tax policies the jurisdictions which they operate result effective tax rates and the
provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies addition the income tax benefit includes onetime tax benefit specifically related the passing the Tax Cut and Jobs Act which was signed into law December
order compare performance between companies NeoGenomics excludes this expense benefit
Depreciation expense Companies utilize assets with different useful lives and use different methods both acquiring and
depreciating these assets These differences can result considerable variability the costs productive assets and the
depreciation and amortization expense among companies order compare performance between companies NeoGenomics
excludes this expense
Amortization expense The intangible assets that give rise this amortization expense relate acquisitions and the amounts
allocated such intangible assets and the terms amortization vary acquisition and type asset NeoGenomics excludes
these items provide consistent basis for comparing operating results across reporting periods pre and post acquisition
NEOGENOMICS INC

Stock based compensation expenses Although stock based compensation important aspect the compensation paid
NeoGenomics employees and consultants the related expense substantially driven changes the Company stock price
any given quarter which can fluctuate significantly from quarter quarter and result large positive negative impacts
total operating expenses The variable accounting treatment causing expense driven changes quarterly stock price
required because many the Company full time physicians reside California and are classified consultants rather than
employees due state regulations GAAP provides that variable stock based compensation treatment applied for consultants
but not for employees Without adjusting for these non cash expenses the Company believes would difficult compare
financial results from operations across reporting periods consistent basis
Transaction expenses relating acquisitions incurred significant expenses connection with our recent acquisition
Clarient The inclusion these costs consisting primarily transaction costs well outside consultants and related
services result considerable variability between periods order compare across periods consistent basis believe
useful exclude these expenses
Debt financing costs The amount and frequency debt financing costs are significantly impacted the timing and size
debt financing transactions The amount and frequency such charges are not consistent and therefore without adjusting for
these costs the Company believes would not allow for consistent comparison between reporting periods
Moving expenses These expenses include costs associated with the move our Irvine California facility into our Aliso
Viejo facility and restoring the Irvine facility back its original condition the end the lease term are adjusting for
these costs Adjusted EBITDA the move was the direct result the Clarient acquisition and will not annually
recurring item Without adjusting for these expenses the Company believes would difficult compare financial results
from operations across reporting periods consistent basis
Non cash impairments exclude these impairments our calculation Adjusted EBITDA they entail outlay
cash and reduce the comparability financial results between periods
believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide more consistent measures operating performance between entities and across
reporting periods excluding cash and non cash items expense that can vary significantly between companies addition Adjusted
EBITDA metric that used our lenders the calculation our debt covenants Adjusted EBITDA also assists investors
performing analyses that are consistent with financial models developed independent research analysts
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA defined are not measurements under GAAP and may differ from non GAAP measures used
other companies believe there are limitations inherent non GAAP financial measures such EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
because they exclude variety charges and credits that are required included GAAP presentation and not therefore present
the full measure NeoGenomics recorded costs against its net revenue Accordingly encourage investors consider both non GAAP
results together with GAAP results analyzing our financial performance

Level Quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities These are typically obtained from real time quotes for
transactions active exchange markets involving identical assets
Level Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level which are observable for the asset liability either directly
indirectly These are typically obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments
Level Unobservable inputs where there little market activity for the asset liability These inputs reflect the reporting entity
own assumptions the data that market participants would use pricing the asset liability based the best information available
the circumstances

climate unanticipated competition adverse action assessment regulator The Company first assesses qualitative factors
determine whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount including goodwill
management concludes that more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount management
conducts two step quantitative goodwill impairment test The first step the impairment test involves comparing the fair value the
applicable reporting unit with its carrying value The Company estimates the fair values its reporting units using combination the
income discounted cash flows approach and the market approach which utilizes comparable companies data the carrying amount
reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value management performs the second step the goodwill impairment test The second
step the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying
value that goodwill The amount which the carrying value the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value any recognized
impairment loss The Company evaluation goodwill completed during the fourth quarter resulted impairment losses
Recoverability and Impairment Long Lived Assets
The Company reviews the recoverability its long lived assets property and equipment and intangible assets events changes
circumstances indicate the assets may impaired Evaluation possible impairment based the Company ability recover the
asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges the related operations the expected
undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount such asset impairment loss recognized for the difference between
