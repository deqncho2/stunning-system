Our Market
The market for our integrated solutions primarily the biopharmaceutical industry that utilizes outsourced clinical drug development and
commercialization services believe are well positioned benefit from the following market trends
Trends clinical drug development Biopharmaceutical companies continue prioritize the outsourcing Phase Phase clinical trials
particularly complex high growth therapeutic areas such CNS
Table Contents
oncology and other complex diseases Additionally small and mid sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited infrastructure and
therefore are far more likely outsource their clinical development CROs estimate based industry sources including analysts reports
and management knowledge that the market for CRO services for Phase Phase clinical development services will grow average
annual rate through driven combination increased development spending and further outsourcing penetration
addition estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending drug development was approximately billion which the clinical
development market which the market for drug development following pre clinical research was approximately billion the billion
estimate our total addressable market billion after excluding billion indirect fees paid principal investigators and clinical
research sites which are not part the CRO market estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending clinical development will grow
rate annually through estimate biopharmaceutical companies outsourced approximately billion clinical
development spending CROs representing increase compared and penetration rate our total addressable market
estimate that this penetration rate will increase approximately our total addressable market
Within the overall Phase Phase market segment the Phase post approval Real World Evidence sub segment represents large area
spending where outsourcing penetration lower than traditional clinical development and pharmaceutical industry trends are creating increasing
demand
Trends commercialization outsourcing
believe that based industry sources including analysts reports and management knowledge that the market for CCO services will grow
average annual rate through driven combination increased sales and marketing spending and further outsourcing
penetration estimate that the total addressable market for commercialization services was approximately billion determined
our analysis biopharmaceutical selling general and administrative trends and related sales and marketing budgets over the past
years estimate biopharmaceutical companies outsourced approximately billion this commercialization spending CCOs
representing penetration rate approximately the total addressable commercial market estimate that this penetration rate will
increase approximately our total addressable market while the underlying biopharmaceutical sales and marketing spending will
grow rate annually during this same time period project that over time this market may follow similar outsourcing
penetration trajectory the clinical development market resulting the potential for long term revenue growth believe this potential for
growth supported significant biopharmaceutical sales and marketing budgets generally least greater than research and
development budgets large biopharmaceutical companies continuing shift toward specialty and more complex therapies requiring
more complex and integrated sales and marketing execution and experience iii robust funding environment which provides capital fuel
growth development and commercialization spending particularly with small mid sized companies that wish remain independent
significant outsourcing penetration opportunities evolving industry landscape illustrated shift longer and more strategic relationships
and significant downward pressure pharmaceutical pricing
Increasingly challenging development and commercialization environment The biopharmaceutical industry currently facing number
challenges including margin deterioration reimbursement and provider access hurdles iii the declining attractiveness non core brands
resulting fewer blockbuster and higher profitability drugs reaching the market continued pressure from generic brand exposure resulting from
expiring patents and the consolidation payers health systems providers and pharmacies These challenges are also making physicians
and patients more difficult engage making new product launches more difficult the same time the industry experiencing growing demand
for specialty drugs pressure achieve improvements productivity the transition the healthcare industry worldwide from volumebased value based reimbursement structure and growing political and pricing pressures Existing approaches address these challenges
include reducing overhead costs optimizing the deployment marketing and field assets and refocusing product portfolios around therapeutic
areas with depth presence and expanded market access capabilities

Optimization biopharmaceutical efficiency Market forces and healthcare reform including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act amended the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act the Century Cures Act and other governmental initiatives place
significant pressure biopharmaceutical companies improve cost efficiency Companies need demonstrate the relative improvement
quality safety and effectiveness new therapies compared existing approved therapies early possible the development process
CROs can help biopharmaceutical companies deploy capital more efficiently many biopharmaceutical companies not have adequate inhouse development resources response high clinical trial costs particularly therapeutic areas such CNS and oncology which
believe present the highest mean cost per patient across all clinical trials biopharmaceutical companies are streamlining operations and shifting
development external providers lower fixed costs
Globalization clinical trials Clinical trials have become increasingly global biopharmaceutical companies seek accelerate patient
recruitment particularly within protocol eligible treatment na patient populations without morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes
Biopharmaceutical companies are also increasingly seeking expand the commercial potential their products applying for regulatory
approvals multiple countries including fast growing economies that are spending more healthcare part the biopharmaceutical approval
process newer markets especially certain Asian and emerging markets regulators now often require trials include specific percentages
numbers people from local populations resulting combination multinational and domestic trials
Management increasingly complex trials The biopharmaceutical industry operates increasingly sophisticated and highly regulated
environment and has responded the demands novel therapeutics adapting efficient drug development processes Complex trial design
expertise has emerged significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have track record successfully navigating country specific
regulatory trial protocol and patient enrollment barriers including sometimes subjective evolving clinical endpoints addition the therapeutic
areas where have significant experience and expertise including CNS oncology and other complex diseases often require more complicated
testing protocols than other disease indications Many these studies have longer durations due these factors resulting demand for greater
clinical trial proficiency and expertise these therapeutic areas particularly light new methods testing such the use biomarkers and
gene therapy
Evolving commercialization outsourcing needs for large small mid sized pharma Given the increasingly challenging
commercialization environment outlined previously the needs biopharmaceutical companies are ever changing The needs large versus small
mid sized customers are developing differently based upon infrastructure and corporate commercialization goals requiring diverse approaches
and capabilities Large biopharmaceutical companies tend have more robust internal resources and are more often seeking augment these
resources with individual services brand brand basis They are also frequently looking for enterprise vendor relationships that achieve
broader cost savings based upon volume considerations their products Smaller biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited number
products and very limited internal resources and expertise for commercialization requiring the full spectrum commercialization capabilities
similar outsourced clinical development patterns Historically these commercialization considerations may have required small mid sized
companies surrender significant portion their long term economic value licensing arrangements

not generate large number new business awards new business awards are delayed terminated reduced scope
fail contract our business financial condition results operations cash flows may materially adversely affected
Our business dependent our ability generate new business awards from new and existing customers and maintain existing customer
contracts Our inability generate new business awards timely basis and subsequently enter into contracts for such awards could have
material adverse effect our business financial condition results operations cash flows
There risk cancelability both the clinical and commercial businesses The time between when clinical study awarded and when goes
contract typically several months and prior new business award going contract our customer can cancel the award without notice
Once award goes contract the majority our customers can terminate the contract with little notice many cases days less Our
contracts may delayed terminated our customers reduced scope for variety reasons beyond our control including but not limited
decisions forego terminate particular trial
budgetary limits changing priorities

production problems resulting shortages the drug being tested
failure products being tested satisfy safety requirements efficacy criteria
unexpected undesired clinical results for products

the customers decision terminate scale back the development commercialization product end particular project
shift business competitor internal resources
product withdrawal following market launch
Our commercial services contracts typically have significantly shorter wind down period than clinical contracts particularly within our selling
solutions offerings Furthermore many our communications services and consulting services projects are tied customer annual marketing
budget hoc service requests which can lead seasonal variability revenue and less predictability future revenues addition many
our biopharmaceutical selling solutions service contracts provide our customers with the opportunity internalize the resources provided under the
contract and terminate all portion the services provide under the contract Our customers may also decide shift their business
competitor Each these factors results less visibility future revenues and higher volatility future revenues
Contract terminations delays and modifications are regular part our business across each our segments For example our full service
offering within our Clinical Solutions business has been and may continue negatively impacted project delays which impact near term
revenue disproportionately

addition project delays downsizings and cancellations particularly within our selling solutions and communications offerings which are part our
Commercial Solutions business have impacted our results the past and might impact them the future The loss reduction scope delay
large project multiple projects could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition

the event termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project which include both fees incurred and actual and noncancellable expenditures and may include fee cover percentage the remaining professional fees the project These fees might not
sufficient for maintain our margins and termination may result lower resource utilization rates and therefore lower operating margins
addition cancellation contract project for the reasons noted above may result the unwillingness inability our customer satisfy its
existing obligations such payments accounts receivable which may turn result material impact our results operations and
cash flow Historically cancellations and delays have negatively impacted our operating results and they might again addition might not
realize the full benefits our backlog our customers cancel delay reduce their commitments which may occur among other things
customer decides shift its business competitor revoke our status preferred provider Thus the loss delay large business
award the loss delay multiple awards could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability Additionally change the timing
new business award could affect the period over which recognize revenue and reduce our revenue any one quarter

determinable record revenues net any tax assessments governmental authorities such value added taxes that are imposed and
concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions some cases contracts provide for consideration that contingent upon the
occurrence uncertain future events recognize contingent revenue when the contingency has been resolved and all other criteria for revenue
recognition have been met
Our arrangements are primarily service contracts and historically majority the net service revenue has been earned under contracts which
range duration from several months several years Most our contracts can terminated the customer with day notice the
event termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project which include both fees incurred and actual expenses and
non cancellable expenditures and may include fee cover percentage the remaining professional fees the project not recognize
revenue with respect start activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict interest review associated
