Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company critical accounting estimates are those that require the most subjective complex judgments often result the need make
estimates about the effect matters that are inherently uncertain The Company bases its estimates historical experience and other assumptions
that are deemed reasonable management under each applicable circumstance Actual results amounts could differ from estimates and the differences
could have material impact the consolidated financial statements discussion the Company critical accounting policies the underlying
judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would reported under different conditions
using different assumptions follows
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are generally recognized when title products and risk loss are transferred customers Additional conditions for recognition
revenue are that collection sales proceeds reasonably assured and the Company has further performance obligations
Amounts billed advance are recorded deferred revenue advance payments the balance sheet Since payments received are sometimes
non refundable the termination contract customer prior its completion could result immediate recognition deferred revenue relating
payments already received but not previously recognized revenue
Sales terms certain customers include rebates certain conditions are met Additionally sales are generally made with limited right return
under certain conditions The Company estimates these rebates and returns the time sale based the terms agreements with customers and
historical experience and estimated orders The Company recognizes revenue net these estimated costs which are classified allowances and
rebates
The Company bills portion freight cost incurred shipments customers Amounts billed customers are recorded within net revenues
Freight costs are reflected cost goods sold
Asset Valuations and Review for Potential Impairments
The review long lived assets principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles requires the Company estimate the undiscounted
future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not fully recoverable
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value the long lived assets are written down fair value
The review the carrying value goodwill conducted annually whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not fully recoverable The Company first performs qualitative assessment test goodwill for impairment after performing the
qualitative assessment the Company concludes that more likely than not that the fair value the reporting units less than its carrying value the
two step process would utilized the first step the fair value the reporting units determined using discounted cash flow model and compared
the carrying value such analysis indicates that impairment may exist the Company then estimates the fair value the other assets and liabilities
utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses calculate impairment charge
dollars thousands except per share data
The determination fair value judgmental and involves the use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows
primarily based operating plans discount rates determination appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates These estimates and
assumptions could have significant impact whether not impairment charge recognized and the magnitude any such charge
Income Taxes
The Company applies the asset and liability method accounting for income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases assets and liabilities and
net operating loss NOL and tax credit carryovers taxing jurisdiction basis using enacted tax rates effect for the year which the differences
are expected reverse the NOLs tax credit carryforwards are expected realized The recoverability deferred tax assets dependent upon the
Company assessment that more likely than not considering both positive and negative evidence that sufficient future taxable income the
appropriate type and the appropriate taxable years will generated the relevant tax jurisdictions utilize the deferred tax assets This assessment
takes into account the nature frequency and severity any financial reporting losses sources future taxable income and available prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies based the weight available evidence more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not realized the
Company records valuation allowance against all portion the deferred tax assets adjust the balance the amount considered more likely than
not realized
The Company has provided valuation allowance against state NOLs state tax credits state deferred tax assets and foreign NOLs possible that
changes the assessment could result the release valuation allowance attributable these items the future the establishment valuation
allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the Company has current reserves The Company accounting for deferred taxes represents
management best estimate those future events Changes current estimates due unanticipated events could have material impact the
Company financial condition and results operations
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions applying the more likely than not threshold recognition and recognition Tax benefits
from uncertain tax positions are recognized more likely than not that the tax position will sustained upon examination taxing authorities
with full knowledge all relevant information based the technical merits the position The calculation uncertain tax positions involves
significant judgment applying complex tax laws and resolution these matters manner inconsistent with management expectations could have
material impact the Company financial condition and results operations
Environmental and Litigation Contingencies
The Company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related any lawsuits claims brought against See Note the Company
consolidated financial statements for discussion the Company current environmental and litigation matters reserves recorded and its position with
respect any related uncertainties While typically very difficult determine the timing and ultimate outcome these actions the Company uses
its best judgment determine probable that the Company will incur expense related settlement for such matters and whether reasonable
estimation such probable loss any can made probable and estimable the Company accrues for the costs investigation remediation
settlements and legal fees Given the inherent uncertainty related the eventual outcome litigation and environmental matters possible that all
some these matters may resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the Company may have made with respect their
resolution from time time

Employee Benefit Plans
The Company provides range benefits certain employees and retired employees including pension benefits under plan that was frozen
The Company records annual amounts relating these plans based calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including
discount rates assumed rates return and turnover rates The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions annual basis and makes modifications
the assumptions based current rates and trends when deemed appropriate The effect the modifications generally recorded and
amortized over future periods The Company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable
The discount rate used measure pension liabilities and costs selected projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which are
matched yield curve high quality bonds The Company then selects the single rate that produces the same present value each cash flow were
discounted the corresponding spot rate the yield curve
