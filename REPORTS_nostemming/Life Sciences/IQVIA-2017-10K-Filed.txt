Our Market Opportunity
compete market greater than billion consisting outsourced research and development real world evidence
and connected health and technology enabled commercial operations markets for the life sciences companies and the broader
healthcare industry The following sets forth our estimates for the size our principal markets
Outsourced research and development Biopharmaceutical spending drug development totaled approximately
billion that amount estimate that our addressable opportunity clinical development spending
excluding preclinical spending was approximately billion The portion this addressable opportunity that was
outsourced based our estimates was approximately billion
Real World Evidence and connected health Total addressable market approximately billion based
sales that consists two relatively equal parts First the market for Real World Evidence approximately billion
includes traditionally defined analytic platforms and implementation medical and scientific analytic services
observation studies and market access Second the market for connected healthcare approximately billion
includes areas such revenue cycle management payer analytics and clinical decision support services and
Technology enabled commercial operations Total addressable market approximately billion based
sales that includes information data warehousing outsourcing software applications and other services the
broader market for services This addressable market also includes commercial services such recruiting training
deploying and managing global sales forces channel management patient engagement services market access
consulting brand communication advisory services and health information analytics and technology consulting
deriving estimates the size the various markets described above review third party sources which include
estimates and forecasts spending various segments combination with internal IQVIA research and analysis informed our
experience serving these segments well projected growth rates for each these segments See Industry and Market Data
above
believe there are six key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for research and development
services and commercial solutions
Growth and innovation the life sciences industry The life sciences industry large and critical part the global
healthcare system and according the latest information available from the IQVIA Market Prognosis service estimated have
generated approximately trillion revenue According our research revenue growth the life sciences industry
globally expected range from between and According the IQVIA Institute estimated that spending
pharmaceuticals emerging markets will expand compound annual growth rate CAGR through The
growth emerging markets making these geographies strategically important life sciences organizations and consistent with
their approach the developed markets expect these organizations apply high degree sophistication their commercial
operations these countries For global companies this requires highly localized knowledge and information assets the development
market access strategies and performance benchmarking addition local players are learning that they need compete the
basis improved information and analytics
Growth Research and Development Spending trends research and development are impacted result several
factors including major biopharmaceutical companies efforts replenish revenues lost from the called patent cliff increased
access capital the small and midcap biotechnology industry and recent increases pharmaceutical approvals regulatory
authorities The IQVIA Institute also estimates that approximately new molecular entities NMEs are expected approved
between and compared between and and between and believe that further research
and development spending combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape will continue
create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies particularly those with global reach and broad service offerings
help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre and post launch solutions development and commercialization needs
Increased Complexity Research and Development Biopharmaceutical companies face environments which has
become increasingly difficult operate Improved standards care many therapeutic areas and the emergence new types
therapies such biologics genetically targeted therapies gene and stem cell therapies and other treatment modalities have led
more complex development and regulatory pathways For example the United States and European countries have recently released
guidelines for the development biosimilar products believe that our global clinical development capabilities including our
expertise biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network position well help biopharmaceutical companies
manage the complexities inherent environment where this type expertise important
Regulators require clinical trials involving local populations part the process for approving new pharmaceutical products
especially certain Asian and emerging markets Understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences different ethnic
populations and being able conduct clinical trials locally certain geographies will important pharmaceutical product growth
strategies both for multinational and local regional biopharmaceutical companies believe that our global clinical development
capabilities and unmatched presence Asia and other emerging markets make strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies
managing the complexities international drug development
Financial pressures driving the need for increased efficiency Despite expected accelerating growth the global life
sciences market believe our clients will face increased operating margin pressure due their changing product mix pricing and
reimbursement challenges and rising costs compliance Product portfolios for life sciences companies have shifted toward specialty
products with lower peak market sales potential than traditional primary care medicines believe that the need for
biopharmaceutical companies maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through
commercial operations will cause them look partners they enter into outsourcing arrangements improve efficiency Further
our clients are looking for new ways simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies using automation consolidating
vendors and adopting new technology options such hosted and cloud based applications This provides opportunities for technology
services vendors capture and consolidate internal spending providing lower cost and variable cost options that lower clients
research and development selling marketing and administrative costs
Evolving need integrate and structure expanding sources data Over the past decade many health systems around the
world have focused digitizing medical records While such records theoretically enhance access data relevant information
often unintegrated unstructured siloed disparate software systems entered inconsistently addition new sources data from
the internet such social media and information limited patient pools and information resulting from enhanced diagnostic
technologies are creating new sources healthcare data
order derive valuable insights from existing and expanding sources information clients need access statistically
significant data sets organized into databases that can queried and analyzed For example real world evidence studies demonstrate
practical and clinical efficacies which believe require the aggregation and integration large clinical data sets across all care
settings types therapies and patient cohorts Longitudinal studies require analysis non identified patient diagnoses treatments
procedures and laboratory test results identify types patients that will likely best respond particular therapies Finally
manufacturers also require the ability analyze social media activity identify unmet patient needs and support for new orphan
drugs This information highly relevant all healthcare stakeholders and believe the opportunity more broadly apply
healthcare data can only realized through structuring organizing and integrating new and existing forms data conjunction with
sophisticated analytics
Need for demonstrated value healthcare Participants the healthcare industry are focused improving quality and
reducing costs both which require assessment quality and value therapies and providers result physicians longer
make prescribing decisions isolation but rather the context guidance and rules from payers integrated delivery networks and
governments believe life sciences companies are working bring alignment across constituents the value their treatments
order successfully develop and commercialize new therapies
There increasing pressure life sciences companies support and justify the value their therapies Many new drugs that
are being approved are more expensive than existing therapies and will likely receive heightened scrutiny regulators and payers
determine whether the existing treatment options would sufficient Additionally many new specialty drugs are molecular based
therapies and require more detailed understanding clinical factors and influencers that demonstrate therapeutic value result
leading life sciences companies are utilizing more sophisticated outcome research and data analytics services
believe are well positioned take advantage these global trends healthcare Beyond our proprietary information
assets have developed key capabilities assess opportunities develop and commercialize therapies support and defend the
value medicines and help our clients operate more efficiently through the application insight driven decision making and costefficient technology solutions

product withdrawal following market launch
shut down manufacturing facilities
result contract terminations delays and alterations are regular part our Research Development Solutions business
the event termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project but these fees may not sufficient for
maintain our margins and termination may result lower resource utilization rates addition will not realize the full
benefits our backlog contractually committed services our clients cancel delay reduce their commitments under our
contracts with them which may occur among other things client decides shift its business competitor revoke our status
preferred provider Thus the loss delay large contract the loss delay multiple contracts could adversely affect our
revenues and profitability believe the risk loss delay multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where are party
broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies
depend third parties for data and support services Our suppliers providers might restrict our use refuse
license data provide services which could lead our inability access certain data provide certain services and result
materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition
Each our Commercial Solutions information services derived from data collect from third parties These data suppliers
are numerous and diverse reflecting the broad scope information that collect and use our business
Although typically enter into long term contractual arrangements with many these suppliers data the time entry
into new contract renewal existing contract suppliers may increase restrictions our use such data increase the price
they charge for data refuse altogether license the data addition during the term any data supply contract suppliers
may fail adhere our data quality control standards fail deliver data Further although single individual data supplier
material our business number suppliers collectively representing significant amount data that use for one more
our services were impose additional contractual restrictions our use access data fail adhere our quality control
standards repeatedly fail deliver data refuse provide data now the future our ability provide those services our
clients could materially adversely impacted which may harm our operating results and financial condition
Additionally depend third parties for support services our business Such support services include but are not limited
third party transportation providers suppliers drugs for patients participating clinical trials suppliers kits for use our
clinical trial laboratories business suppliers reagents for use our testing equipment and providers maintenance contracts for
our equipment The failure any these third parties adequately provide the critical support services could have material
adverse effect our business
fail perform our services accordance with contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical
considerations could subject significant costs liability and our reputation could harmed
contract with biopharmaceutical companies perform wide range services assist them bringing new drugs
market Our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture patient recruitment and
other related services Such services are complex and subject contractual requirements regulatory standards and ethical
considerations For example must adhere regulatory requirements such the FDA and current GCP Good Laboratory Practice
and Good Manufacturing Practice requirements fail perform our services accordance with these requirements regulatory
agencies may take action against for failure comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials sales and marketing
practices Such actions may include sanctions such injunctions failure such regulatory authorities grant marketing approval
products delay suspension withdrawal approvals license revocation product seizures recalls operational restrictions civil
criminal penalties prosecutions damages fines Clients may also bring claims against for breach our contractual
obligations and patients the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved the basis those clinical trials may bring personal
injury claims against for negligence Any such action could have material adverse effect our results operations financial
condition and reputation
Such consequences could arise among other things the following occur
Improper performance our services The performance clinical development services complex and time consuming
For example may make mistakes conducting clinical trial that could negatively impact obviate the usefulness the clinical
trial cause the results the clinical trial reported improperly the clinical trial results are compromised could subject
significant costs liability which could have adverse impact our ability perform our services examples
non compliance generally could result the termination ongoing clinical trials sales and marketing projects
the disqualification data for submission regulatory authorities
compromise data from particular clinical trial such failure verify that informed consent was obtained from
patients could require repeat the clinical trial under the terms our contract further cost our client but
substantial cost and
breach contractual term could result liability for damages termination the contract
Large clinical trials can cost hundreds millions dollars and while endeavor contractually limit our exposure
such risks improper performance our services could have adverse effect our financial condition damage our reputation
and result the cancellation current contracts failure obtain future contracts from the affected client other clients
Investigation clients From time time one more our clients are audited investigated regulatory authorities
enforcement agencies with respect regulatory compliance their clinical trials programs the marketing and sale their drugs
these situations have often provided services our clients with respect the clinical trials programs activities being
audited investigated and are called upon respond requests for information the authorities and agencies There risk
that either our clients regulatory authorities could claim that performed our services improperly that are responsible for
clinical trial program compliance our clients regulatory authorities make such claims against and prove them could
subject damages fines penalties addition negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance our clients clinical trials
programs drugs could have adverse effect our business and reputation
Insufficient client funding complete clinical trial noted above clinical trials can cost hundreds millions dollars
There risk that may initiate clinical trial for client and then the client becomes unwilling unable fund the completion
the clinical trial such situation notwithstanding the client ability willingness pay for otherwise facilitate the
completion the clinical trial may ethically bound complete wind down the clinical trial our own expense
Security breaches and unauthorized use our systems and information the systems information the
possession our vendors could expose our clients our data suppliers others risk loss
rely upon the security our computer and communications systems infrastructure protect from cyberattacks and
unauthorized access Cyberattacks can include malware computer viruses hacking other significant disruption our computer
communications and related systems Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated Despite our
efforts ensure the integrity our systems cyber threats evolve and become more difficult detect and successfully defend
against one more cyber threats might defeat the measures that our vendors take anticipate detect avoid mitigate such
threats Certain techniques used obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable degrade service sabotage
systems may designed remain dormant until triggering event and may unable anticipate these techniques implement
adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently are not recognized until launched and because cyberattacks can
originate from wide variety sources Although take steps manage and avoid these risks and prevent their recurrence our
preventive and remedial actions may not successful Such attacks whether successful unsuccessful could result our incurring
costs related for example rebuilding internal systems defending against litigation responding regulatory inquiries actions
paying damages fines taking other remedial steps with respect third parties Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted
successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services
also store proprietary and sensitive information connection with our business which could compromised
cyberattack the extent that any disruption security breach results loss damage our data inappropriate disclosure
proprietary sensitive information inability access data sources inability process data provide our offerings our
clients could cause significant damage our reputation affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients including loss
suppliers and clients lead claims against and ultimately harm our business may required incur significant costs
alleviate remedy protect against damage caused these disruptions security breaches the future may also face inquiry
increased scrutiny from government agencies result any such disruption breach While have insurance coverage for
certain instances cyber security breach our coverage may not sufficient suffer significant attack multiple attacks
Any such breach disruption could have material adverse effect our operating results and our reputation provider
mission critical services
Some our vendors have significant responsibility for the security certain our data centers and computer based
platforms Also our data suppliers have responsibility for security their own computer and communications environments These
third parties face risks relating cyber security similar ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact
ours Accordingly are subject any flaw breaches their computer and communications systems those that they operate
for which could result material adverse effect our business operations and financial results
Failure meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our
competitiveness and harm our operating results
are pursuing business transformation initiatives update technology increase innovation and obtain operating
efficiencies part these initiatives seek improve our productivity flexibility quality functionality and cost savings
investing the development and implementation global platforms and integration our business processes and functions
achieve economies scale For example are moving local standardizing and cleaning from countries around the world Asia
and retiring local standardizing and cleaning systems These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains which may impact
our competitiveness and our ability meet our growth objectives and result materially and adversely affect our business
operating results and financial condition
are unsuccessful investing growth opportunities our business could materially and adversely affected
continue invest significantly growth opportunities including the development and acquisition new data
technologies and services meet our clients needs For example are expanding our services and technology offerings such
the development cloud based platform with growing number applications support commercial operations for life sciences
companies multi channel marketing marketing campaign management customer relationship management incentive
compensation management targeting and segmentation performance management and other applications also continue invest
significantly growth opportunities emerging markets such the development launch and enhancement services China
India Russia Turkey and other countries believe healthcare spending these emerging markets will continue grow over the
next five years and consider our presence these markets important focus our growth strategy
There assurance that our investment plans growth strategy will successful will produce sufficient any return
our investments Further are unable develop new technologies and services clients not purchase our new technologies
and services our new technologies and services not work intended there are delays the availability adoption our new
technologies and services then may not able grow our business growth may occur slower than anticipated Additionally
although expect continued growth healthcare spending emerging markets such spending may occur more slowly not all
and may not benefit from our investments these markets
plan fund growth opportunities with cash from operations from future financings There can assurance that
those sources will available sufficient amounts fund future growth opportunities when needed
Any the foregoing could have material and adverse effect our operating results and financial condition
Data protection privacy and similar laws the United States and around the world restrict access use and disclosure
personal information and failure comply with adapt changes these laws could materially and adversely harm our
business
The confidentiality collection use and disclosure personal data including individually identifiable health information and
clinical trial patient specific information are subject governmental regulation generally the country that the personal data were
collected used For example United States federal regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
HIPAA create specific requirements for the protection the privacy and security individual health information These
provisions apply both covered entities primarily health care providers and health insurers and their business associates
service providers there are some instances where are HIPAA business associate covered entity can directly
liable for mishandling protected health information Under HIPAA enforcement scheme can subject significant penalties
connection with HIPAA violations along with the potential for significant other expenditures related these activities These rules
require individuals written authorization many situations addition any required informed consent before protected health
information may used for research are both directly and indirectly affected the privacy provisions surrounding individual
authorizations because many investigators with whom are involved clinical trials are directly subject them HIPAA
covered entity and because obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject such regulations The laws
and regulations related the protection personal health information connection with research activities are under evaluation
particularly the United States and changes these regulations could have material adverse impact our ability provide some
our services their current form maintain our profitability general patient health information among the most sensitive
and highly regulated personal information and laws and regulations around the United States and the world are designed ensure
that information about individual healthcare properly protected from inappropriate access use and disclosure Laws restricting
access use and disclosure patient health information also include the European Union EU General Data Protection
Regulation Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and other data protection privacy data security
and similar national state provincial and local laws the personal data includes any information that relates identified
identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the
individual for collection use disclosure the information addition are subject rules with respect cross border
transfers such data out the along with similar data transfer requirements other countries The United States the and
its member states and other countries where have operations such Japan South Korea Malaysia the Philippines Russia and
Singapore continue issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations that relate personal data and health information
have established frameworks models processes and technologies manage privacy and security for many data types
from variety sources and under myriad privacy and data protection laws worldwide addition rely our data suppliers
deliver information form and manner that complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws These laws are
complex and there assurance that the safeguards and controls employed our data suppliers will sufficient prevent
breach these laws that claims will not filed against our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls Failure
comply with such laws certain certification registration and annual certification registration provisions associated with these data
protection and privacy regulations and similar rules various jurisdictions resolve any serious privacy complaints may result
among other things regulatory sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability negative publicity damage our reputation data
being blocked from use liability under contractual provisions For example July indictments were issued the Seoul
Central District Prosecutors Office South Korea against IMS Korea and two its employees among others alleging improper
handling sensitive health information violation applicable privacy laws See Item Legal Proceedings for additional
information
Laws and expectations relating privacy continue evolve and continue adapt changing needs For example the
definition personally identifiable information and personal data continues evolve and broaden and many new laws and
regulations are being enacted addition certain long established programs have been are risk being declared invalid such
the Safe Harbor framework that operated for many years but was struck down European courts that this
area remains state flux Changes these programs may adversely impact our ability provide services our clients
develop new products services Federal state and foreign governments are contemplating have proposed adopted additional
legislation governing the collection possession use dissemination personal data such personal health information and
personal financial data well security breach notification rules for loss theft such data Additional legislation regulation
this type might among other things require implement new security measures and processes bring within the legislation other
personal data not currently regulated each which may require substantial expenditures limit our ability offer some our
services Additionally changes these laws including newly released interpretations these laws courts and regulatory bodies
may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures may dictate that not offer certain
types services Any the foregoing may have material adverse impact our ability provide services our clients maintain
our profitability
There ongoing concern from privacy advocates regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues and the
number jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing Also there are ongoing public policy discussions
regarding whether the standards for identified anonymous pseudonymized health information are sufficient and the risk reidentification sufficiently small adequately protect patient privacy These discussions may lead further restrictions the use
such information There can assurance that these initiatives future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability access and
use data develop market current future services
Data protection privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information and although they vary jurisdiction these
laws can extend employee information business contact information provider information and other information relating
identifiable individuals Failure comply with these laws may result among other things civil and criminal liability negative
publicity damage our reputation and liability under contractual provisions addition compliance with such laws may require
increased costs may dictate that not offer certain types services
The occurrence any the foregoing could impact our ability provide the same level service our clients require
modify our offerings increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial
condition
Our success depends our ability protect our intellectual property rights
Our success depends part upon our ability develop use and protect our proprietary methodologies analytics systems
technologies and other intellectual property Existing laws the various countries which provide services solutions offer
only limited protection our intellectual property rights and the protection some countries may very limited rely upon
combination trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure invention assignment and other contractual arrangements and
patent copyright and trademark laws protect our intellectual property rights These laws are subject change any time and
certain agreements may not fully enforceable which could further restrict our ability protect our innovations Our intellectual
property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar duplicative ours Further the
steps take this regard might not adequate prevent deter infringement other misappropriation our intellectual
property competitors former employees other third parties and might not able detect unauthorized use take
appropriate and timely steps enforce our intellectual property rights
Our ability obtain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights subject general litigation third party
opposition risks well the uncertainty the scope protection registrability patentability validity and enforceability our
intellectual property rights each applicable country Governments may adopt regulations and government agencies courts may
render decisions requiring compulsory licensing intellectual property rights When seek enforce our intellectual property
rights may subject claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid unenforceable Litigation may necessary the
future enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our confidential and proprietary information Litigation brought
protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could costly time consuming and distracting management and could result
the impairment loss portions our intellectual property rights Furthermore our efforts enforce our intellectual property
rights may met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability our intellectual property
rights Our inability protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying use well any costly litigation
diversion our management attention and resources could delay further sales the implementation our solutions impair the
functionality our solutions delay introductions new solutions result our substituting inferior more costly technologies into
our solutions injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition
Depending the circumstances might need grant specific client greater rights intellectual property developed
connection with contract than otherwise generally certain situations might forego all rights the use intellectual
property create which would limit our ability reuse that intellectual property for other clients Any limitation our ability
provide service solution could cause lose revenue generating opportunities and require incur additional expenses
develop license new modified solutions for future projects
The theft unauthorized use publication our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the
differentiation our services and harm our business the value our investment development business acquisitions could
reduced and third parties might make claims against related losses their confidential proprietary information addition
may not able discover determine the extent any unauthorized use our proprietary rights Third parties that license our
proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value our proprietary rights reputation The protection our
intellectual property may require the expenditure significant financial and managerial resources Moreover the steps take
protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights prevent third parties from infringing misappropriating our
proprietary rights These incidents and claims could harm our business reduce revenue increase expenses and harm our reputation
may subject claims others that are infringing their intellectual property rights
Third parties may assert claims that our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims with
without merit could expensive litigate cause incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention
defending the claim some jurisdictions plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation our business
prevent the marketing and selling our services that infringe the plaintiff intellectual property rights resolve these claims
may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms significant fees stop selling required implement costly
redesigns the affected services pay damages satisfy contractual obligations others not resolve these claims
advance trial there guarantee that will successful court These outcomes may have material adverse impact our
business operating results and financial condition
addition certain contracts with our suppliers clients contain provisions whereby indemnify subject certain
limitations the counterparty for damages suffered result claims related intellectual property infringement and the use our
data Claims made under these provisions could expensive litigate and could result significant payments
rely licenses from third parties certain technology and intellectual property rights for some our services and the
licenses currently have could terminate expire
Some our business services rely technology intellectual property rights owned and controlled others Our licenses
this technology these intellectual property rights could terminated could expire may unable replace these licenses
timely manner Failure renew these licenses renewals these licenses less advantageous terms could harm our
operating results and financial condition
Our financial results may adversely affected underprice our contracts overrun our cost estimates fail receive
approval for experience delays documenting change orders
Most our Research Development Solutions contracts are either fee for service contracts fixed fee contracts Our past
financial results have been and our future financial results may adversely impacted initially underprice our contracts
otherwise overrun our cost estimates and are unable successfully negotiate change order Change orders typically occur when the
scope work perform needs modified from that originally contemplated our contract with the client Modifications can
occur for example when there change key clinical trial assumption parameter significant change timing Where
are not successful converting out scope work into change orders under our current contracts bear the cost the additional
work Such underpricing significant cost overruns delay documentation change orders could have material adverse effect
our business results operations financial condition cash flows
The relationship backlog revenues varies over time
Backlog represents future revenues for our Research Development Solutions business from work not yet completed
performed under signed binding commitments and signed contracts Once work begins project revenue recognized over the
duration the project Projects may terminated delayed the client delayed regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our
control the extent projects are delayed the timing our revenue could affected the event that client cancels contract
typically would entitled receive payment for all services performed the cancellation date and subsequent client authorized
services related terminating the canceled project Typically however have contractual right the full amount the revenue
reflected our backlog the event contract cancellation The duration the projects included our backlog and the related
revenue recognition range from few weeks many years Our backlog may not indicative our future revenues from our
Research Development Solutions business and may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected our backlog
number factors may affect backlog including
the size complexity and duration the projects
the percentage full services versus functional services
the cancellation delay projects and
change the scope work during the course project
Although increase backlog will generally result increase revenues recognized over time depending the
level cancellations increase backlog particular point time does not necessarily correspond directly increase
revenues during particular period The extent which contracts backlog will result revenue depends many factors including
but not limited delivery against projected schedules the need for scope changes change orders contract cancellations and the
nature duration size complexity and phase the contracts each which factors can vary significantly from time time
The rate which our backlog converts revenue may vary over time for variety reasons The revenue recognition
larger more global projects could slower than smaller less global projects for variety reasons including but not limited
extended period negotiation between the time the project awarded and the actual execution the contract well
increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals Additionally the increased complexity clinical trials and the
need enroll precise patient populations could extend the length clinical trials causing revenue recognized over longer
period time Further delayed projects will remain backlog unless otherwise canceled the client and will not generate revenue
the rate originally expected Thus the relationship backlog realized revenues may vary over time
Our business depends the continued effectiveness and availability our information systems including the information
systems use provide our services our clients and failures these systems may materially limit our operations
Due the global nature our business and our reliance information systems provide our services intend increase
our use web enabled and other integrated information systems delivering our services also provide access similar
information systems certain our clients connection with the services provide them the breadth and complexity our
information systems continue grow will increasingly exposed the risks inherent the development integration and
ongoing operation evolving information systems including
disruption impairment failure data centers telecommunications facilities other key infrastructure platforms
security breaches cyberattacks and other failures malfunctions our critical application systems their
associated hardware and
excessive costs excessive delays other deficiencies systems development and deployment
The materialization any these risks may impede the processing data the delivery databases and services and the
day day management our business and could result the corruption loss unauthorized disclosure proprietary confidential
other data While have disaster recovery plans place they might not adequately protect the event system failure
While many our operations have disaster recovery plans place currently not have excess standby computer processing
network capacity everywhere the world avoid disruption the receipt processing and delivery data the event system
failure Despite any precautions take damage from fire floods hurricanes power loss telecommunications failures computer
viruses break ins and similar events our various computer facilities could result interruptions the flow data our servers
and from our servers our clients Corruption loss data may result the need repeat clinical trial cost the client but
significant cost the termination contract damage our reputation
addition any failure our computer environment provide sufficient processing network capacity transfer data
could result interruptions our service the event delay the delivery data could required transfer our data
collection operations alternative provider server hosting services Such transfer could result significant delays our
ability deliver services our clients and increase our costs Additionally significant delays system enhancements inadequate
performance new upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business Finally long term
disruptions the infrastructure caused events such natural disasters the outbreak war the escalation hostilities and acts
terrorism particularly involving cities which have offices could adversely affect our businesses Although carry property
and business interruption insurance our coverage might not adequate compensate for all losses that may occur
have continued undertake significant programs optimize business processes with respect our services Our inability
effectively manage the implementation and adapt new processes designed into new upgraded systems timely and costeffective manner may result disruption our business and negatively affect our operations
have entered into agreements with certain vendors provide systems development and integration services that develop
license the platform for programs optimize our business processes such vendors fail perform required there are
substantial delays developing implementing and updating the platform our client delivery may impaired and may have
make substantial further investments internally with third parties achieve our objectives Additionally our progress may
limited parties with existing claimed patents who seek enjoin from using preferred technology seek license payments
from Meeting our objectives dependent number factors which may not take place anticipate including obtaining
adequate technology enabled services creating enabled services that our clients will find desirable and implementing our business
model with respect these services Also increased related expenditures may negatively impact our profitability
may experience challenges with the acquisition development enhancement deployment technology necessary for
our business
operate businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection data processing cloudbased platforms analytics cryptography statistical projections and forecasting mobile computing social media analytics and other
applications and technologies particularly our Commercial Solutions business seek address our technology risks increasing
our reliance the use innovations cross industry technology leaders and adapt these for our biopharmaceutical and healthcare
industry clients Some these technologies supporting the industries serve are changing rapidly and must continue adapt
these changes timely and effective manner acceptable cost also must continue deliver data our clients forms that
are easy use while simultaneously providing clear answers complex questions There can guarantee that will able
develop acquire integrate new technologies that these new technologies will meet our clients needs achieve expected
investment goals that will able quickly cost effectively our competitors Significant technological change
could render certain our services obsolete Moreover the introduction new services embodying new technologies could render
certain our existing services obsolete Our continued success will depend our ability adapt changing technologies manage
and process ever increasing amounts data and information and improve the performance features and reliability our services
response changing client and industry demands may experience difficulties that could delay prevent the successful design
development testing introduction marketing our services New services enhancements existing services may not
adequately meet the requirements current and prospective clients achieve any degree significant market acceptance These
types failures could have material adverse effect our operating results and financial condition
Consolidation the industries which our clients operate may reduce the volume services purchased consolidated
clients following acquisition merger which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition
Mergers consolidations among our clients have the past and could the future reduce the number our clients and
potential clients When companies consolidate overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once
the combined entity leading loss revenue Other services that were previously purchased one the merged
consolidated entities may deemed unnecessary cancelled our clients merge with are acquired other entities that are not
our clients that use fewer our services they may discontinue reduce their use our services There can assurance
the degree which may able address the revenue impact such consolidation Any these developments could materially
harm our operating results and financial condition
may adversely affected client therapeutic concentration
Although did not have any client that represented more our revenues and derive the
majority our revenues from number large clients any large client decreases terminates its relationship with our
business results operations financial condition could materially adversely affected
Additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different clients single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same
similar chemical action has the past and may the future adversely affect our business some all the clinical trials are
canceled because new scientific information regulatory judgments that affect the drugs class industry consolidation
results the rationalization drug development pipelines Similarly marketing and selling drugs for different biopharmaceutical
companies with similar chemical actions subjects risk new scientific information regulatory judgment prejudices the drugs
class which may lead compelled voluntary prescription limitations withdrawal some all such drugs from the
market
Our business subject international economic political and other risks that could negatively affect our results
operations and financial condition
have significant operations countries that may require complex arrangements deliver services throughout the world
for our clients Additionally have established operations locations remote from our most developed business centers
result are subject heightened risks inherent conducting business internationally including the following
required compliance with variety local laws and regulations which may materially different than those which
are subject the United States which may change unexpectedly for example conducting single clinical trial
across multiple countries complex and issues one country such failure comply with local regulations
restrictions may affect the progress the clinical trial the other countries for example limiting the amount
data necessary for clinical trial proceed resulting delays potential cancellation contracts which turn
may result loss revenue
the United States foreign countries could enact legislation impose regulations other restrictions including
unfavorable labor regulations tax policies economic sanctions which could have adverse effect our ability
conduct business expatriate profits from the countries which operate including hiring retaining and
overseeing qualified management personnel for managing operations multiple countries differing employment
practices and labor issues and tax related risks including the imposition taxes and the lack beneficial treaties
that result higher effective tax rate for
foreign countries are expanding may expand their regulatory framework with respect patient informed consent
protection and compensation clinical trials which could delay inhibit our ability conduct clinical trials such
jurisdictions
the regulatory judicial authorities foreign countries may not enforce legal rights and recognize business
procedures manner which are accustomed would reasonably expect
local economic political and social conditions including potential hyperinflationary conditions political instability
and potential nationalization repatriation expropriation price controls other restrictive government actions
including changes political and economic conditions may lead changes the business environment which
operate well changes foreign currency exchange rates
immigration laws are subject legislative change and varying standards application and enforcement due
political forces economic conditions other events including proposals the change limitations
temporary and permanent workers and local immigration laws may require meet certain other legal requirements
condition obtaining maintaining entry visas which may impact our ability provide services our clients
potential violations local laws anti bribery laws such the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
FCPA and the Bribery Act may cause difficulty managing foreign operations well significant
consequences those laws are violated
regulatory changes and economic conditions leading and following the UK likely exit from the Brexit
including uncertainties its effect trade laws tariffs instability and volatility the global financial and
currency markets conflicting redundant regulatory regimes Europe such the European Medicines Agency
EMA possible relocation from country within the European Union and political stability
clients foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles and may more difficult collect receivables
foreign jurisdictions and
natural disasters pandemics international conflict including terrorist acts could interrupt our services endanger our
personnel cause project delays loss clinical trial materials results
These risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability among other things perform large global projects for our
clients Furthermore our ability deal with these issues could affected applicable United States laws and the need protect
our assets Any such risks could have adverse impact our financial condition and results operations
Exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results operations and financial condition
Because large portion our revenues and expenses are denominated currencies other than the United States dollar and our
financial statements are reported United States dollars changes foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our
results operations and financial condition Exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the United States dollar create
risk several ways including
Foreign Currency Translation Risk The revenue and expenses our foreign operations are generally denominated
local currencies and translated into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes Accordingly exchange rate
fluctuations will affect the translation foreign results into United States dollars for purposes reporting our
consolidated results
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk are subject foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations exchange
rates during the period time between the consummation and cash settlement transaction earn revenue from
our service contracts over period several months and some cases over several years Accordingly exchange
rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect such contracts
may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated our service contracts may hedge our
transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts options have not however hedged all our foreign currency
transaction risk and may experience fluctuations financial results from our operations outside the United States and foreign
currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts
Due the global nature our business may exposed liabilities under anti corruption laws including the United
States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the United Kingdom Bribery Act and various international anti corruption laws and any
allegation determination that violated these laws could have material adverse effect our business
are required comply with the FCPA the Bribery Act and other international anti corruption laws which prohibit
companies from engaging bribery including corruptly improperly offering promising providing money anything else
value non United States officials and certain other recipients addition the FCPA imposes certain books records and accounting
control obligations public companies and other issuers operate parts the world which corruption can common and
compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices Our global operations face the risk unauthorized
payments offers being made employees consultants sales agents and other business partners outside our control without
our authorization our policy implement safeguards prohibit these practices our employees and business partners with
respect our operations However irrespective these safeguards result monitoring compliance with such safeguards
possible that certain other parties may discover receive information some point that certain employees consultants sales
agents other business partners may have engaged corrupt conduct for which might held responsible Violations the
FCPA the Bribery Act other international anti corruption laws may result restatements irregularities our financial
statements well severe criminal civil sanctions and may subject other liabilities which could negatively affect our
business operating results and financial condition some cases companies that violate the FCPA may debarred the United
States government and lose their United States export privileges Changes anti corruption laws enforcement priorities could
also result increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and
results operations addition the United States other governments may seek hold liable for successor liability FCPA
violations violations other anti corruption laws committed companies which invest that acquired will acquire

Risks Relating Our Industry
The biopharmaceutical services industry highly competitive
The biopharmaceutical services industry highly competitive Our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical
services companies internal discovery departments development departments sales and marketing departments information
technology departments and other departments within our clients some which could considered large biopharmaceutical services
companies their own right with greater resources than ours also compete with universities teaching hospitals governments
agencies and others not compete successfully our business will suffer The industry highly fragmented with numerous
smaller specialized companies and handful companies with global capabilities similar certain our own capabilities Increased
competition has led price and other forms competition such acceptance less favorable contract terms that could adversely
affect our operating results There are few barriers entry for companies considering offering any one more the services
offer Because their size and focus these companies might compete effectively against which could have material adverse
impact our business
Our future growth and success will depend our ability successfully compete with other companies that provide similar
services the same markets some which may have financial marketing technical and other advantages also expect that
competition will continue increase result consolidation among these various companies Large technology companies with
substantial resources technical expertise and greater brand power could also decide enter further expand the markets where
our business operates and compete with one more our competitors potential competitors were merge partner with
another our competitors new entrant emerged with substantial resources the change the competitive landscape could
adversely affect our ability compete effectively compete the basis various factors including breadth and depth
services reputation reliability quality innovation security price and industry expertise and experience addition our ability
compete successfully may impacted the growing availability health information from social media government health
information systems and other free low cost sources Consolidation integration wholesalers retail pharmacies health
networks payers other healthcare stakeholders may lead any them provide information services directly clients indirectly
through designated service provider resulting increased competition from firms that may have lower costs market data
supply costs Any the above may result lower demand for our services which could result material adverse impact our
operating results and financial condition
Outsourcing trends the biopharmaceutical industry and changes aggregate spending and research and development
budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate
Economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our Research Development Solutions
business Biopharmaceutical companies continue seek long term strategic collaborations with global contract research organizations
with favorable pricing terms Competition for these collaborations intense and may decide forego opportunity may
not selected which case competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the client any may limited
addition the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its Research Development Solutions activities reduces its outsourcing
clinical trials and sales and marketing projects such outsourcing fails grow projected rates our operations and financial
condition could materially and adversely affected may also negatively impacted consolidation and other factors the
biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making our clients result the delay cancellation clinical trials Our
commercial services may affected reductions new drug launches and increases the number drugs losing patent
protection All these events could adversely affect our business results operations financial condition
Our business may materially and adversely impacted factors affecting the biopharmaceutical and healthcare
industries
The vast majority our revenue generated from sales the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries The clients
serve these industries are commonly subject financial pressures including but not limited increased costs reduced demand
for their products reductions pricing and reimbursement for products and services formulary approval and placement government
approval market their products and limits the manner which they market their products loss patent exclusivity whether
due patent expiration result successful legal challenge and the proliferation changes regulations applicable
these industries the extent our clients face such pressures they change how they utilize our offerings the demand for our
services the prices our clients are willing pay for those services may decline Any such decline could have material adverse
effect our business operating results and financial condition
may affected healthcare reform and potential additional reforms
The United States Congress continues consider healthcare reform legislation and impose health industry cost containment
measures which may significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry addition numerous government bodies are considering
have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake are the process undertaking efforts control growing
healthcare costs through legislation regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and biopharmaceutical
companies are uncertain the effects these recent reforms our business and are unable predict what legislative
proposals any will adopted the future regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profitability new drugs our clients
may reduce their research and development spending promotional marketing and sales expenditures which could reduce the
business they outsource Similarly regulatory requirements are relaxed simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the
demand for our services could decrease
Foreign and domestic government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation regulations that are more burdensome than
existing regulations For example product safety concerns and recommendations the Drug Safety Oversight Board could change
the regulatory environment for drug products and new heightened regulatory and licensing requirements may increase our expenses
limit delay our ability offer some our services Additionally new heightened regulatory requirements may have
negative impact the ability our clients conduct industry sponsored clinical trials which could reduce the need for our services
Actions government regulators clients limit prescription scope withdraw approved drug from the market
could adversely affect our business and result loss revenues
Government regulators have the authority after approving drug regulate limit its scope prescription withdraw
from the market completely based safety concerns Similarly clients may act voluntarily limit the scope prescription drugs
withdraw them from the market the past have provided services with respect drugs that have been limited and
withdrawn are providing services clients for drugs that are limited withdrawn may required narrow the scope
terminate our services with respect such drugs which would prevent earning the full amount revenues anticipated under the
related service contracts with negative impacts our financial results
not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive obsolete
The biopharmaceutical industry subject rapid technological changes Our current competitors other businesses might
develop technologies services that are more effective commercially attractive than render obsolete our current future
technologies and services our competitors introduce superior technologies services and cannot make enhancements
remain competitive our competitive position would harmed are unable compete successfully may lose clients
unable attract new clients which could lead decrease our revenue and financial condition
Laws restricting biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services
There have been significant number laws legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek limit
biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices For example three states and passed laws restricting the use
prescriber identifiable information for the purpose promoting branded prescription medicines Although these laws were
subsequently declared unconstitutional based decision the Supreme Court Sorrell IMS Health are
unable predict whether and what form other initiatives may introduced actions taken the state Federal levels limit
biopharmaceutical sales and marketing practices addition while will continue seek adapt our services comply with the
requirements these laws the extent applicable our services enacted there can assurance that our efforts adapt our
offerings will successful and provide the same financial contribution There can also assurance that future legislative
initiatives will not adversely affect our ability develop market current future offerings that any future laws will not
diminish the demand for our services all which could over time result material adverse impact our operating results and
financial condition
Our Research Development Solutions clients face intense competition from lower cost generic products which may
lower the amount that they spend our services
Our Research Development Solutions clients face increasing competition from lower cost generic products which turn
may affect their ability pursue research and development activities with the United States and Japan political pressure
reduce spending prescription drugs has led legislation and other measures which encourages the use generic products
addition proposals emerge from time time the United States and other countries for legislation further encourage the early and
rapid approval generic drugs Loss patent protection for product typically followed promptly generic substitutes reducing
our clients sales that product and their overall profitability Availability generic substitutes for our clients drugs may adversely
affect their results operations and cash flow which turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital invest research
and development and drug commercialization including our services competition from generic products impacts our clients
finances such that they decide curtail our services our revenues may decline and this could have material adverse effect our
business

Our wholly owned subsidiary IMS Government Solutions Inc primarily engaged providing services under contracts
with the United States government United States government contracts are subject extensive legal and regulatory requirements and
from time time agencies the United States government have the ability investigate whether contractors operations are being
conducted accordance with such requirements IMS Government Solutions discovered potential noncompliance with various
contract clauses and requirements under its General Services Administration Contract the GSA Contract which was awarded
its predecessor company Synchronous Knowledge Inc Synchronous Knowledge Inc was acquired IMS Health May
The potential noncompliance arose from two primary areas first the direction the government work performed under one
task order was invoiced under another task order without the appropriate modifications the orders being made and second

Backlog and Net New Business
Beginning with the third quarter began reporting net new business and backlog contracted basis signed
binding commitments and signed contracts during the period rolling basis for the last twelve months only report backlog
and net new business for the Research Development Solutions segment Previously net new business included non binding written
awards which was consistent with industry practice believe the contracted method more precise approach requires
higher threshold and less judgment for backlog inclusion Net new business totaled billion and billion for the twelve
months ended December and respectively Ending backlog was billion December
Net new business under sole provider arrangements recorded over the life the arrangement projects are awarded
Consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during particular period backlog represents particular point
time future service revenues from work not yet completed performed under signed contracts Once work begins project
service revenues are recognized over the duration the project Net new business and backlog denominated foreign currencies are
valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates effect during the month
believe that backlog and net new business may not consistent indicators future revenues because they have been and
likely will affected number factors including the variable size and duration projects many which are performed over
several years cancellations and changes the scope work during the course projects Projects that have been delayed remain
backlog but the timing the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected Additionally projects may
terminated delayed the customer delayed regulatory authorities the event that client cancels contract typically
would entitled receive payment for all services performed the cancellation date and subsequent client authorized services

Application Critical Accounting Policies
Note the audited consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere this Annual Report Form describes the
significant accounting policies used the preparation the consolidated financial statements The preparation our consolidated
financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities
and the disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the financial statements well the reported amounts
revenues and expenses during the period Our estimates are based historical experience and various other assumptions believe
are reasonable under the circumstances evaluate our estimates ongoing basis and make changes the estimates and related
disclosures experience develops new information becomes known Actual results may differ from those estimates
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used the
preparation our consolidated financial statements
Revenue Recognition
recognize revenue when all the following conditions are satisfied there persuasive evidence arrangement
the service offering has been delivered the client the collection fees probable and the arrangement consideration
fixed determinable not recognize revenue with respect start activities including contract and scope negotiation
feasibility analysis and conflict interest review associated with contracts The costs for these activities are expensed incurred For
contracts which portions revenue are contingent upon the occurrence uncertain future events recognize the revenue only
after has been earned and the contingency has been resolved
some cases contracts provide for consideration that contingent upon the occurrence uncertain future events
recognize contingent revenue when the contingency has been resolved and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met
Cash payments made clients incentives induce the clients enter into service agreements with are amortized reduction
revenue over the period the services are performed record revenues net any tax assessments governmental authorities
such value added taxes that are imposed and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions not recognize
revenue with respect start activities including contract and scope negotiation feasibility analysis and conflict interest review
associated with contracts The costs for these activities are expensed incurred
For arrangements that include multiple elements arrangement consideration allocated units accounting based the
relative selling price The best evidence selling price unit accounting vendor specific objective evidence VSOE which
the price charge when the deliverable sold separately When VSOE not available determine selling price use relevant
third party evidence TPE selling price available When neither VSOE nor TPE selling price exists use our best
estimate selling price considering all relevant information that available without undue cost and effort
derive the majority our revenues the Commercial Solutions segment from various information and technology service
offerings Our revenue arrangements may include multiple elements typical information offerings arrangement primarily under
fixed price contracts may include ongoing subscription based deliverable for which revenue recognized ratably earned over
the contract period and one time delivery data offerings for which revenue recognized upon delivery assuming all other
criteria are met Our subscription arrangements typically have terms ranging from one three years and are generally non cancelable
and not contain refund type provisions also offer technology services offerings that enable our clients make informed
business decisions Technology services offerings consist mix small and large scale services and consulting projects multiyear outsourcing contracts and SaaS licenses These arrangements typically have terms ranging from several weeks three years
with majority having terms one year less Revenues for services engagements where deliverables occur ratably over time are
recognized straight line basis over the term the arrangement Revenues from time and material contracts are recognized the
services are provided Revenues from fixed price hoc services and consulting contracts are recognized either over the contract term
based the ratio the number hours incurred for services provided during the period compared the total estimated hours
incurred over the entire arrangement efforts based upon delivery completed contract
The majority revenue our Research Development Solutions segment and Integrated Engagement Services segment
recognized based objective contractual criteria and does not require significant estimates judgments However any point
time are working thousands active client projects which are governed individual contracts Most projects are customized
based the needs the client the type services being provided therapeutic indication the drug geographic locations and other
variables Project specific terms related pricing billing terms and the scope and type services provided are generally
negotiated and contracted project project basis Changes the scope work are common especially under long term
contracts and generally result change contract value such situations enter into negotiations for contract amendment
reflect the change scope and the related price Depending the complexity the amendment the negotiation process can take
from few weeks for simple adjustment several months for complex amendment Management may authorize the project team
commence work activities outside the contract scope while negotiate and finalize the contract amendment these limited
cases are not able obtain contract amendment from the client our profit margin the arrangement may impacted This
result occurs because our costs delivery are expensed they are incurred while revenue not recognized unless the client has
agreed the changes scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract value amended and all other revenue recognition criteria
are met Most contracts are terminable upon days notice the client Our risk material loss these situations mitigated
these contracts generally require payment for expenses wind down the clinical trial project fees earned date and
some cases termination fee payment some portion the fees profits that could have been earned under the contract
had not been terminated early addition our contract terms provide for payment terms that generally correspond with performance
the services Termination fees are included revenues when realization assured
See Note our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this Annual Report Form for details
regarding the new revenue recognition standard which will effective January
Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Services
Accounts receivable represents amounts billed clients Revenues recognized excess billings are classified unbilled
services The realization these amounts based the client willingness and ability pay have allowance for doubtful
accounts based management estimate probable losses expect incur resulting from client failing pay Our
allowance for doubtful accounts and losses from clients failing pay have not been material our results operations any
these estimates change actual results differs from expected results then adjustment recorded the period which the
amounts become reasonably estimable These adjustments could have material effect our results operations
Investments Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Method Investments
have investments unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method accounting Periodically
review our investments for decline value which believe may other than temporary Should identify such decline
will record loss through earnings establish new cost basis for the investment These losses could have material adverse
effect our results operations
Income Taxes
Certain items income and expense are not recognized our income tax returns and financial statements the same year
which creates timing differences The income tax effect these timing differences results deferred income tax assets that create
reduction future income taxes and deferred income tax liabilities that create increase future income taxes Recognition
deferred income tax assets based management belief that more likely than not that the income tax benefit associated with
certain temporary differences income tax operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and income tax credits would realized
recorded valuation allowance reduce our deferred income tax assets for those deferred income tax items for which was more
likely than not that realization would not occur determined the amount the valuation allowance based part our
assessment future taxable income and light our ongoing income tax strategies our estimate future taxable income tax
strategies changes any time the future would record adjustment our valuation allowance Recording such adjustment
could have material effect our financial condition results operations
Income tax expense based the distribution profit before income tax among the various taxing jurisdictions which
operate adjusted required the income tax laws each taxing jurisdiction Changes the distribution profits and losses
among taxing jurisdictions may have significant impact our effective income tax rate not consider the undistributed
earnings our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Accordingly have provided
deferred income tax liability related those undistributed earnings The associated foreign income taxes our foreign earnings
could available credit the United States our income taxes recognize foreign tax credits the extent that the
recognition supported projected foreign source income See Note our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere the Annual Report Form for details regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the impact our consolidated
financial statements
Business Combinations
use the acquisition method account for business combinations and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the
liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest the acquiree are recorded their estimated fair values the date the
acquisition use significant judgments estimates and assumptions determining the estimated fair value assets acquired
liabilities assumed and non controlling interest including expected future cash flows discount rates that reflect the risk associated with
the expected future cash flows and estimated useful lives
When business combination involves contingent consideration recognize liability equal the estimated fair value
the contingent consideration obligation the date the acquisition The estimate fair value contingent consideration liability
requires subjective assumptions made regarding future business results including revenues and net new business discount rates
that reflect the risk associated with the expected future cash flows and probabilities assigned various potential business result
scenarios reassess the estimated fair value the contingent consideration each financial reporting period over the term the
arrangement Any resulting changes are recognized earnings and could have material effect our results operations
Goodwill Tangible and Identifiable Intangible Assets
have recorded and allocated our reporting units the excess the cost over the fair value the net assets acquired
known goodwill The recoverability the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment
and when events circumstances indicate possible impairment review the carrying values other identifiable intangible
assets the facts and circumstances indicate possible impairment Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized
and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives believe that the risk impairment
goodwill indefinite lived intangible assets currently very low
For goodwill perform qualitative analysis determine whether more likely than not that the estimated fair value
reporting unit less than its book value This includes qualitative analysis macroeconomic conditions industry and market
considerations internal cost factors financial performance fair value history and other company specific events this qualitative
analysis indicates that more likely than not that estimated fair value less than the book value for the respective reporting unit
apply two step impairment test which determine whether the estimated fair value the reporting unit excess its
carrying value the carrying value the net assets assigned the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value the reporting
unit perform the second step the impairment test determine the implied estimated fair value the reporting unit goodwill
determine the implied estimated fair value goodwill determining the present value the estimated future cash flows for
each reporting unit and comparing the reporting unit risk profile and growth prospects selected reasonably similar publicly traded
companies The inherent subjectivity applying discounted cash flow and market comparables approach valuing our assets and
liabilities could have significant impact our analysis Any future impairment could have material adverse effect our financial
condition results operations
For indefinite lived intangible assets perform qualitative analysis determine whether more likely than not that the
estimated fair value the indefinite lived intangible asset less than its carrying value this qualitative analysis indicates that
more likely than not that the estimated fair value less than the carrying value the indefinite lived intangible asset determine
the estimated fair value the indefinite lived intangible asset trade name determining the present value the estimated royalty
payments after tax basis that would required pay the owner for the right use such trade name the carrying amount
exceeds the estimated fair value impairment loss recognized amount equal the excess Any future impairment could
have material adverse effect our financial condition results operations
review the carrying values property and equipment the facts and circumstances suggest that potential impairment
may have occurred this review indicates that carrying values will not recoverable determined based undiscounted cash
flows over the remaining depreciation amortization period will reduce carrying values estimated fair value The inherent
subjectivity our estimates future cash flows could have significant impact our analysis Any future write offs long lived
assets could have material adverse effect our financial condition results operations
Stock based Compensation
measure compensation cost for stock based payment awards stock options and stock appreciation rights granted
employees and non employee directors fair value using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and for performance
awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model Stock based compensation expense includes stock based awards granted
employees and non employee directors and has been reported selling general and administrative expenses our consolidated
statements income based upon the classification the individuals who were granted stock based awards
The Black Scholes Merton option pricing model requires the use subjective assumptions including share price volatility
the expected life the award risk free interest rate and the fair value the underlying common shares the date grant
developing our assumptions take into account the following
calculate expected volatility based reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for
which the historical information available plan continue use the guideline peer group volatility information
until the historical volatility our common shares relevant measure expected volatility for future award grants
determine the risk free interest rate reference implied yields available from United States Treasury securities
with remaining term equal the expected life assumed the date grant
estimate the dividend yield zero not currently anticipate paying any future dividends
estimate the average expected life the award based our historical experience and
estimate forfeitures based our historical analysis actual forfeitures
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
provide retirement benefits certain employees including defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical
plans The determination benefit obligations and expense based actuarial models order measure benefit costs and
obligations using these models critical assumptions are made with regard the discount rate expected return plan assets cash
balance crediting rate lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate compensation increases addition retiree medical care cost
trend rates are key assumption used exclusively determining costs for our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit
plans Management reviews these critical assumptions least annually Other assumptions involve demographic factors such
turnover retirement and mortality rates Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them when its experience
deems appropriate
The discount rate the rate which the benefit obligations could effectively settled and determined annually
management For United States plans the discount rate based results modeling process which the plans expected cash
flow determined projected benefit obligation basis matched with spot rates developed from yield curve comprised highgrade Moody and above Standard and Poor and above non callable corporate bonds develop the present value
the expected cash flow and then determining the single rate discount rate which when applied the expected cash flow derives that
same present value the United Kingdom specifically the discount rate set based the yields universe high quality noncallable corporate bonds denominated the British Pound appropriate the duration plan liabilities For the other non United
States plans the discount rate based the current yield index high quality corporate bonds sensitivity measure
basis point increase the discount rate for our United States plan and United Kingdom plans absent any offsetting changes other
assumptions would result million decrease and less than million increase respectively pension expense December
Under the United States qualified retirement plan participants have notional retirement account that increases with pay and
investment credits The rate used determine the investment credit cash balance crediting rate varies monthly retirement the
account converted monthly retirement benefit
selecting expected return plan asset assumption consider the returns being earned each plan investment
category the fund the rates return expected available for reinvestment and long term economic forecasts for the type
investments held the plan The actual return plan assets will vary from year year versus this assumption believe
appropriate use long term expected forecasts selecting the expected return plan assets such there can assurance that
our actual return plan assets will approximate the long term expected forecasts sensitivity measure basis point change
the expected return assets EROA assumption for our United States plan absent any offsetting changes other assumptions
would result less than million increase decrease pension expense December For our United Kingdom plans
basis point change the EROA assumption absent any offsetting changes other assumptions would result less than
million increase decrease pension expense December While believe that the assumptions used are reasonable
differences actual experience changes assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future
expense
utilize corridor approach amortizing unrecognized gains and losses the pension and postretirement plans
Amortization occurs when the accumulated unrecognized net gain loss balance exceeds the criterion the larger the
beginning balances the projected benefit obligation the market related value the plan assets The excess unrecognized gain
loss balance then amortized using the straight line method over the average remaining service life active employees expected
receive benefits December the weighted average remaining service life active employees was approximately years
Foreign Currency
have significant investments non United States countries Therefore changes the value foreign currencies affect
our consolidated financial statements when translated into United States dollars For all operations outside the United States where
have designated the local currency the functional currency assets and liabilities are translated using end period exchange rates
revenues expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates exchange prevailing during the period the transactions
occurred Translation gains and losses are included adjustment the accumulated other comprehensive income loss
component stockholders equity addition gains and losses from foreign currency transactions such those resulting from the
settlement and revaluation third party and intercompany foreign receivables and payables are included the determination net
income loss
For operations outside the United States that are considered highly inflationary where the United States dollar
designated the functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using end period exchange rates whereas nonmonetary accounts are remeasured using historical exchange rates and all remeasurement and transaction adjustments are recognized

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Information relating recently issued accounting standards included Note our audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere this Annual Report Form
Item Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk the potential loss arising from adverse changes market rates and prices the ordinary course business
are exposed various market risks and regularly evaluate our exposure such changes Our overall risk management strategy
seeks balance the magnitude the exposure and the cost and availability appropriate financial instruments The following
analyses present the sensitivity our financial instruments hypothetical changes that are reasonably possible over one year
period
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
transact business more than countries and approximately currencies and are subject risks associated with
fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates Our objective reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign
currency exchange rate movements Accordingly enter into foreign currency forward contracts minimize the impact foreign
exchange movements non functional currency assets and liabilities also enter into foreign currency forward contracts hedge
certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows related service contracts and hedge non United States dollar anticipated
intercompany royalties our policy enter into foreign currency transactions only the extent necessary meet our objectives
stated above not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment speculative purposes The principal currencies
hedged are the Euro the British Pound the Japanese Yen the Swiss Franc and the Canadian dollar
The contractual value our foreign exchange derivative instruments all which were foreign exchange forward contracts
was approximately million December The fair value these contracts subject change result potential
changes foreign exchange rates assess our market risk based changes foreign exchange rates utilizing sensitivity
analysis The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss fair values based hypothetical change foreign currency
exchange rates The potential loss fair value for foreign exchange forward contracts based hypothetical decrease the
value the United States dollar the case non United States dollar related contracts the currency being purchased was
million December However the change the fair value the foreign exchange forward contracts would likely offset
change the value the future service contract revenue royalty balance sheet exposure being hedged caused the currency
exchange rate fluctuation The estimated fair values the foreign exchange forward contracts were determined based quoted
market prices
Exchange rate fluctuations affect the United States dollar value foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have
significant effect our results Excluding the impacts from any outstanding future hedging transactions hypothetical
change average exchange rates used translate all foreign currencies the United States dollar would have impacted income
before income taxes for approximately million The actual impact exchange rate movements the future could differ
materially from this hypothetical analysis based the mix foreign currencies and the timing and magnitude individual
exchange rate movements
Additionally commencing designated portion our foreign currency denominated debt hedge our net
investment foreign subsidiaries reduce the volatility stockholders equity caused changes the Euro exchange rate with
respect the United States dollar December these borrowings net original issue discount were million
million hypothetical decrease the value the United States dollar would lead potential loss fair value
million However this change fair value would offset the change value the hedged portion our net investment
foreign subsidiaries caused the currency exchange rate fluctuation
Interest Rates
Because have variable rate debt fluctuations interest rates affect our business attempt minimize interest rate risk
and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate caps and
swaps have entered into interest rate caps and swaps with financial institutions that have reset dates and critical terms that match
the underlying debt Accordingly any change market value associated with the interest rate caps and swaps offset the opposite
market impact the related debt December had approximately billion variable rate indebtedness and
interest rate caps and swaps with notional value billion Because not attempt hedge all our variable rate debt
may incur higher interest costs for the portion our variable rate debt that not hedged Excluding debt covered hedges each
quarter point increase decrease the interest rate our variable rate debt would result our interest expense changing
approximately million per year
Marketable Securities
December held investments marketable equity securities These investments are classified either trading
securities available for sale securities and are recorded fair value These securities are subject price risk December
the fair value these investments was million based the quoted market value the securities The potential loss fair
value resulting from hypothetical decrease quoted market values was approximately million December
