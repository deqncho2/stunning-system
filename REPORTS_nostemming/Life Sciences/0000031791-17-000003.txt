product offerings within our life sciences research market and decrease our environmental and food businesses due weak harvest conditions which
were partially offset increased demand our laboratory services business The increase our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year was
primarily due strong performance our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions emerging markets such China well Europe
our Discovery Analytical Solutions segment excluding the unfavorable impact foreign currency exchange experienced flat growth during
fiscal year several our products within our life science research end market compared fiscal year During fiscal year
experienced increased demand for our OneSource laboratory service and informatics businesses Our OneSource laboratory service business offers services
designed enable our customers increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all which continue critical for them
This was offset decreases revenue our environmental and food business due weak harvest conditions well our academic and government
product offerings due reduced government funding anticipate that the continued development contaminant regulations and corresponding testing
protocols will result increased demand for efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions
our Diagnostics segment experienced growth from continued expansion our newborn screening blood banking and screening businesses
Birth rates the United States continue stabilize and demand for greater access newborn screening rural areas outside the United States also
increasing evidenced prenatal trends saw during fiscal year The growth our Diagnostics segment was partially offset unfavorable
impacts from foreign currency the dollar strengthened the rising cost healthcare continues one the critical issues facing our customers

the foregoing standards and have not yet determined the impact their adoption our consolidated financial position results operations and cash flows
intend adopt these standards using the modified retrospective approach and not intend early adopt these standards While are currently
evaluating the impact the new revenue standard believe the key changes the standard that impact revenue recognition relate the accounting for
certain transactions with multiple elements bundled arrangements for example sales software subscriptions for which not have VSOE for
maintenance and support because the requirement have VSOE for undelivered elements under current accounting standards eliminated under the new
standard Accordingly may required recognize revenue portion the sales price upon delivery the software compared the current
requirement recognizing the entire sales price ratably over the maintenance period
Application Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation consolidated financial statements requires make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities
revenue and expenses and related disclosure contingent assets and liabilities ongoing basis evaluate our estimates including those related
revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions long lived assets income taxes
restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation base our estimates historical experience and various other
assumptions that believe reasonable under the circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used preparation our consolidated
financial statements
Revenue recognition record product revenue when persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price the buyer
fixed determinable and collectability reasonably assured For products that include installation and the installation meets the criteria
considered separate element recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition installation revenue recognized when the installation
complete For revenue that includes customer specified acceptance criteria recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met Certain our
products require specialized installation Revenue for these products deferred until installation completed defer revenue from services and recognize
over the contractual period services are rendered
limited circumstances have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered different points time such revenue from
products and services with remaining service storage component including cord blood processing and storage For these arrangements the revenue
allocated each the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices determined selling price hierarchy deliverable arrangement
qualifies separate unit accounting the delivered item has value the customer stand alone basis delivered item that does not qualify
separate unit accounting combined with the other undelivered items the arrangement and revenue recognized for those combined deliverables
single unit accounting The selling price used for each deliverable based upon vendor specific objective evidence VSOE such evidence
available third party evidence TPE VSOE not available and management best estimate selling price BESP neither VSOE nor TPE are
available TPE the price our any competitor largely interchangeable products services stand alone sales similarly situated customers BESP
the price which would sell the deliverable were sold regularly stand alone basis considering market conditions and entity specific factors
Table Contents
Revenue from software licenses and services was our total revenue for each fiscal years and sell our software licenses
with maintenance services and some cases also with consulting services For the undelivered elements determine VSOE fair value the price
charged when the undelivered element sold separately determine VSOE for maintenance sold connection with software license based the stated
renewal rate method determine VSOE for consulting services reference the amount charged for similar engagements stand alone basis
recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and consulting services upon shipment using the residual method
provided that the above criteria have been met VSOE fair value for the undelivered elements cannot established defer all revenue from the
arrangement until the earlier the point which such sufficient VSOE does exist all elements the arrangement have been delivered the only
undelivered element maintenance then recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period
The majority our sales relate specific manufactured products units rather than long term customized projects therefore generally not
experience significant changes original estimates Further have not experienced any significant refunds promotional allowances that require
significant estimation
Warranty costs provide for estimated warranty costs for products the time their sale Warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future
repair costs based historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period
Allowances for doubtful accounts maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability our customers
make required payments generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts applying specific percentage reserves accounts that are past
due and deemed uncollectible and specifically reserving for customers known financial difficulty Therefore the financial condition our
customers were deteriorate beyond our estimates may have increase our allowance for doubtful accounts This would reduce our earnings Accounts
are written off only when all methods recovery have been exhausted
Inventory valuation value inventory the lower cost market Inventories are accounted for using the first first out method
periodically review these values ascertain that market value the inventory continues exceed its recorded cost Generally reductions value
inventory below cost are caused our maintenance stocks products excess demand technological obsolescence the inventory regularly
review inventory quantities hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based either our estimated forecast
product demand and production requirements historical trailing usage the product our sales not materialize planned historic levels
may have increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory This would reduce our earnings actual market conditions are more favorable than
anticipated inventory previously written down may sold resulting lower costs sales and higher income from operations than expected that period
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for fair value Acquisition costs are expensed incurred and recorded selling
general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued fair value upon the acquisition controlling interest process
research and development IPR recorded fair value intangible asset the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with business
combination are expensed subsequent the acquisition date and changes deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the
acquisition date affect income tax expense Measurement period adjustments are made the period which the amounts are determined and the current
period income effect such adjustments will calculated the adjustments had been completed the acquisition date All changes that not
qualify measurement period adjustments are also included current period earnings The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and
judgment expectations for future cash flows the acquired business and the allocation those cash flows identifiable intangible assets
determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed The fair values assigned tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based management estimates and assumptions well other information compiled
management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments

that cash flows related those assets may diminished Any impairment charge that record reduces our earnings The goodwill impairment test consists
two step process The first step the comparison the fair value the carrying value the reporting unit determine the carrying value exceeds the
fair value The second step measures the amount impairment loss and only performed the carrying value exceeds the fair value the reporting unit
perform the annual impairment assessment the later January the first day each fiscal year This same impairment test will performed
other times during the course the year should event occur which suggests that the recoverability goodwill should reconsidered completed the
annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates January and January and concluded based the first step the process that
there was goodwill impairment January the fair value exceeded the carrying value more than for each reporting unit the
beginning the fourth quarter fiscal year realigned our organization into two new operating segments conjunction with the realignment
our operating segments also redefined our reporting units based our operating segments determined that the reporting units that should used
test goodwill for impairment are environmental health excluding food food life sciences and technology informatics OneSource diagnostics excluding
cord blood cord blood and medical imaging result the realignment reallocated goodwill from our life sciences and technology reporting unit
our diagnostics excluding cord blood reporting unit based the relative fair value determined using the income approach the applied genomics
business which resulted million goodwill being reallocated from our life sciences and technology reporting unit our diagnostics excluding
food reporting unit October January our Informatics reporting unit which had goodwill balance million had fair
value that was less than but greater than more than its carrying value Informatics increased risk impairment charge given its ongoing
weakness due highly competitive industry Despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit not believe there will significant
change the key estimates assumptions driving the fair value this reporting unit that would lead material impairment charge While believe that
our estimates current value are reasonable actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items future cash flows and the
volatility inherent markets which serve impairment charges against the carrying value those assets could required the future
Non amortizing intangibles are also subject annual impairment test The impairment test consists comparison the fair value the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount the carrying amount non amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value impairment loss
amount equal that excess recognized addition currently evaluate the remaining useful life our non amortizing intangible asset least
annually determine whether events circumstances continue support indefinite useful life events circumstances indicate that the useful life
our non amortizing intangible asset longer indefinite the asset will tested for impairment This intangible asset will then amortized prospectively
over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for the same manner other intangible assets that are subject amortization

annual test the Company regularly evaluates whether events circumstances have occurred that may indicate potential impairment goodwill nonamortizing intangible assets
The process testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination the fair value the applicable reporting units The test consists twostep process The first step the comparison the fair value the carrying value the reporting unit determine the carrying value exceeds the fair
value The second step measures the amount impairment loss and only performed the carrying value exceeds the fair value the reporting unit
The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units January its annual impairment date for fiscal year The

key estimates assumptions driving the fair value this reporting unit that would lead material impairment charge
The Company has consistently employed the relief from royalty model estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment non amortizing
intangible assets The impairment test consists comparison the fair value the non amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount the
carrying amount non amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value impairment loss amount equal that excess recognized addition
the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives its non amortizing intangible assets least annually determine whether events circumstances
continue support indefinite useful life events circumstances indicate that the useful lives non amortizing intangible assets are longer
indefinite the assets will tested for impairment These intangible assets will then amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives
