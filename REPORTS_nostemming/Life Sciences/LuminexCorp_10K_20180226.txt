ITEM RISK FACTORS
The life sciences industries are highly competitive and subject rapid technological change and may not have the technologies and resources
necessary compete successfully
compete with companies the United States and abroad that are engaged the development and production similar products will continue
face intense competition from existing competitors and other companies seeking develop and commercialize new technologies Many our
competitors have access greater financial technical scientific research marketing sales distribution service and other resources than and may
have longer operating histories more recognizable brand names These companies may develop technologies that are superior alternatives our
technologies may more effective commercializing their technologies products
The life sciences industries are characterized rapid and continuous technological innovation may need develop new technologies for our
products remain competitive One more our current future competitors could render our present future products those our partners obsolete
uneconomical technological advances including the introduction existence competing products technologies that may more effective
cheaper easier use than our products and technologies addition the introduction announcement new products others could result
delay decrease sales existing products await regulatory approvals while customers evaluate these new products customers choose
purchase the new products instead legacy products may also encounter other problems the process delivering new products the marketplace
such problems related design development supply chain manufacturing such products and result may unsuccessful selling such
products Our future success depends our ability compete effectively against current technologies well respond effectively technological
advances developing and marketing products that are competitive the continually changing technological landscape
Several companies provide systems and reagents for DNA amplification detection Life Technologies Corporation Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc
brand and Hoffman Roche Ltd Roche sell systems integrating DNA amplification and detection sequence detection systems the commercial
market Life Technologies Corporation Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc brand Roche Abbott Laboratories Becton Dickinson and Company Qiagen
Hologic Inc Meridian Bioscience Inc bioM rieux Illumina Inc and Quidel Corporation sell sequence detection systems some with separate robotic
batch DNA purification systems and they also sell reagents the clinical diagnostics market Other companies offer molecular diagnostic tests
Additionally anticipate that the future additional competitors will emerge that offer broad range competing products including increasing
adoption competitive products based mass spectrometry and next generation sequences test technologies
not introduce new products timely manner may lose market share and unable achieve revenue growth targets
sell many our products industries characterized rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving
customer needs and industry standards Many the businesses competing with these industries have significant financial and other resources invest
new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing
capabilities and established distribution channels deliver products customers Our products could become technologically obsolete over time
may invest technologies that not lead revenue growth continue sell products for which the demand from our customers declining which
case may lose market share not achieve our revenue growth targets The success our new product offerings will depend upon several factors
including our ability
accurately anticipate customer needs
innovate and develop new technologies and applications
obtain required regulatory clearances
successfully commercialize new technologies timely manner
price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products sufficient volumes and time and
differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings
Many our products are used our customers develop test and manufacture their products must anticipate industry trends and consistently
develop new products meet our customers expectations developing new products may required make significant investments before can
determine the commercial viability the new product fail accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities may invest heavily
research and development products that not lead significant revenue may also suffer loss market share and potential revenue are unable
commercialize our products timely and efficient manner
Currently limited number direct customers and strategic partners account for significant portion our revenue and the loss any one these
their inability perform expectations could have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations Our success
depends significantly the establishment and maintenance successful relationships with our direct customers and strategic partners
LabCorp Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc and Bio Rad Laboratories Inc accounted for total revenue and respectively the
twelve months ended December For comparative purposes these same three companies accounted for total revenue and
respectively the twelve months ended December and total revenue and respectively the twelve months ended
December other customer accounted for more than total revenue during the twelve months ended December total for the
years ended December and our top five customers accounted for and respectively our total revenue The loss any our
significant direct customers strategic partners the loss material portion the sales these customers partners could have material adverse effect
our growth and future results operations
Based upon extension agreement entered into the third quarter the Company will continue sell its products the Company
largest customer LabCorp through the end after which LabCorp may transfer its business alternative technology Also previously stated
our Annual Report Form for the year ended December LabCorp has elected develop the next iteration one their women health
products with another party have negotiated significant minimum women health purchases from LabCorp through June pursuant which
LabCorp committed acquire less than million our women health products from January through June LabCorp
acquired approximately million our women health products The anticipated future loss the LabCorp business could have material adverse effect
our growth and future results operations are unable effectively attract new customers and increase sales with existing customers
Delays implementation delays obtaining regulatory approval changes strategy the financial difficulty our strategic partners for any reason
could have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations
Our ability enter into agreements with additional strategic partners depends part convincing them that our products can help achieve and
accelerate their goals efforts expend substantial funds and management efforts with assurance that any additional strategic relationships will result
cannot guarantee that will able negotiate additional strategic agreements the future acceptable terms all that current future
strategic partners will not pursue develop alternative technologies either their own collaboration with others Some the companies are
targeting strategic partners offer products competitive with our xMAP technology which may hinder prevent strategic relationships Delays
implementation new products our strategic partners changes their strategy financial difficulties they experience delays obtaining their
inability obtain regulatory approval for their products could negatively affect our business Termination strategic relationships the failure enter into
sufficient number additional strategic relationships favorable terms disputes with our partners could reduce sales our products lower margins

significant factor the development testing production and marketing such products Products that develop the molecular diagnostic markets will
regulated medical devices the FDA and other global governmental authorities and may require receipt clearance following pre market
notification process prior marketing Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can expensive and may involve considerable delay Changes the
current regulatory framework including additional new regulations could arise any time during the development marketing our products which
may negatively affect our ability obtain regulatory approval our products
continue expand our business may experience problems scaling our manufacturing operations delays component shortages that
could limit the growth our revenue
continue expand our manufacturing capabilities order meet our growth objectives may not able produce sufficient quantities
products maintain consistency between differing lots consumables encounter difficulties scaling our manufacturing operations result
among other things quality control and quality assurance issues and availability components and raw material supplies will likely experience reduced
sales our products increased repair engineering costs due product returns and defects and increased expenses due switching alternate
suppliers any which could reduce our revenues and gross margins
presently outsource certain aspects the assembly our systems contract manufacturers Because long lead time delivery are required
place orders for variety items well advance scheduled production runs have increased our flexibility purchase strategic components within
shorter lead times entering into supply agreements with the suppliers these components Although attempt match our parts inventory and
production capabilities estimates marketplace demand the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates may experience continued
constraints our systems production and delivery capacity which could adversely impact revenue given fiscal period Should our need for raw materials
and components used production continue fluctuate could incur additional costs associated with either expediting postponing delivery those
materials effort control costs have implemented lean production system Managing the change from discrete continuous flow production
requires time and management commitment Lean initiatives and limitations our supply chain capabilities may result parts shortages that delay
shipments and cause fluctuations revenue
currently purchase certain key components our product line from limited number outside sources and the case some components
single source and these components may only available through limited number providers not have agreements with all our suppliers
While currently believe that will able satisfy our forecasted demand for our products the failure find alternative suppliers the event any
type supply failure any our current vendors reasonably comparable prices could have material adverse effect our business financial condition
and results operations Additionally have entered into supply agreements with most our suppliers strategic reagents and component
subassemblies help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect the purchase such components our suppliers
discontinue production key component will required revalidate affected product and may required resubmit previously cleared
product Our reliance our suppliers and contract manufacturers exposes risks including
the possibility that one more our suppliers our assemblers that not have supply agreements with could terminate their services any
time without penalty
natural disasters such earthquakes tsunamis and floods that impact our suppliers
the potential obsolescence and inability our suppliers obtain required components
the potential delays and expenses seeking alternate sources supply manufacturing services
the inability qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims our products
reduced control over pricing quality and timely delivery due the difficulties switching alternate suppliers assemblers and
increases prices raw materials and key components
Consequently the event that supplies components work performed any our assemblers are delayed interrupted our ability produce
and supply our products could impaired

Supreme Court the United States have arguably weakened United States patent rights including the Impression Products Lexmark case which expands
the scope the patent exhaustion doctrine sales patented products outside the United States and limits patent holder ability enforce post sale
restrictions under patent law The patent position companies like ours generally highly uncertain involves complex legal and factual questions and has
recently been the subject much litigation consistent policy has emerged from the Patent and Trademark Office the courts regarding the breadth
claims allowed the degree protection afforded under patents like ours
our current products and our products under development not become widely used the life sciences and clinical diagnostics industries may not
able maintain increase profitability
Life sciences and clinical diagnostic service provider companies have historically conducted biological tests using variety technologies including
bead based analysis The commercial success our products depends upon their widespread adoption methods perform assays order successful
must convince potential partners and customers utilize our systems instead other competing products Market acceptance depends many factors
including our ability
timely and successfully launch our products under development
manage trends relating the introduction existence competing products technologies that may more effective cheaper easier
use than our products and technologies
operate highly competitive marketplace including the presence competing products sold companies with longer operating histories
more recognizable names and more established distribution networks
convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our products are attractive alternative others for research clinical biomedical and
genetic testing and analysis
encourage these partners develop and market products using our technologies
manufacture products sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and acceptable cost
obtain and maintain sufficient pricing and royalties from partners such Luminex products and
place and service sufficient quantities our products the level service required the life science and clinical diagnostics market segments
Because these and other factors our products may not gain sustain sufficient market acceptance maintain increase profitability Additionally
may have write off excess obsolete inventory sales our products are not consistent with our expectations the demand for our products

acquisition may involve significant contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity capital resources
acquisitions and subsequent integration these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities and
the costs unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect our financial performance
Other risks integration acquired businesses include
disparate information technology internal control financial reporting and record keeping systems

Our success depends our ability service and support our products directly collaboration with our strategic partners
the extent that our strategic partners fail maintain high quality level service and support for xMAP products there risk that the
perceived quality our xMAP products will diminished the marketplace Likewise may fail provide the level quantity quality service
expected the marketplace This could result slower adoption rates and lower than anticipated utilization xMAP products which could have
material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations
third party payors continue increasingly restrict payments for healthcare expenses fail adequately pay for multi analyte testing may
experience reduced sales which would hurt our business and our business prospects
Third party payors government sponsored healthcare programs Medicare Medicaid and Tricare health maintenance organizations preferred
provider organizations and other private commercial insurers are continually seeking reduce healthcare expenses Payors are challenging the utilization
and prices charged for medical services including clinical diagnostic tests The federal government has implemented cost cutting strategies for
government sponsored healthcare programs including coverage limitations and reimbursement rate reductions required the Affordable Care Act
the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS issued final rule that significantly revised the reimbursement methodology under the Clinical
Diagnostic Laboratory Test Payment System required the Protecting Access Medicare Act Beginning January payment rates for most tests
included the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule are based commercial insurance rates which certain laboratories are required report The market based
reimbursement rates published for are generally lower than the Medicare rates and further reductions will phased through expect
reimbursement rates trend down over time Coverage and reimbursement from commercial payors may also reflect these reductions
Further cost containment initiatives governmental educational entities programs may reduce funding for genetic research and development
activities and slow the growth the genetic testing market Lack adequate coverage reimbursement for our products could affect consumer demand
reducing volumes adding additional cost pressures resulting lowered prices for our products Reduced sales margins our direct customers
and strategic partners would adversely affect our business profitability and business prospects addition failure secure appropriate reimbursement
foreign jurisdictions could severely limit our ability expand sales within these markets
expect our operating results continue fluctuate from quarter quarter
The sale our instrumentation and assay products typically involves significant technical evaluation and commitment capital our partners
and end users Accordingly the sales cycle associated with our products typically lengthy and subject number significant risks much which
beyond our control including partners budgetary constraints inventory management practices regulatory approval and internal acceptance reviews
result this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter quarter expect this
trend continue for the foreseeable future
The vast majority our system sales are made our strategic partners Our partners typically purchase instruments three phases during their
commercialization cycle first instruments necessary support internal assay development second instruments for sales force demonstrations and finally
instruments for resale their customers result most our system placements are highly dependent the continued commercial success our
strategic partners and can fluctuate from quarter quarter our strategic partners move from phase phase expect this trend continue for the
foreseeable future
Our assay products are sometimes sold large customers The ordering and consumption patterns these customers can fluctuate affecting the timing
shipments and revenue recognition addition certain products assist the diagnosis illnesses that are seasonal and customer orders can fluctuate for
this reason The loss any these customers including LabCorp decision move alternative vendor for women health products could
have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations
Because the effect bulk purchases defined the purchase more consumables quarter and the introduction seasonal
components our assay menus experience fluctuations the percentage our quarterly revenues derived from our highest margin items consumables
royalties and assays Our gross margin percentage highly dependent upon the mix revenue components each quarter These fluctuations contribute the
variability and lack predictability both gross margin percentage and total gross profit from quarter quarter expect this trend continue for the
foreseeable future
Due the early stage the market for molecular tests projected growth scenarios for our assays are highly volatile and are based number
underlying assumptions that may may not prove valid including our ability successful with our direct assay sales strategy
most our strategic partnerships have granted non exclusive rights with respect commercialization our products and technologies
expect that significant portion our future revenues will come from sales our systems and the development and sale kits utilizing our xMAP
consumables our strategic partners and from use our xMAP products our strategic partners performing services offered third parties believe
that our strategic partners will have economic incentives develop and market these products but cannot accurately predict future sales and royalty
revenues because some our existing strategic partner agreements not include minimum purchase requirements minimum royalty commitments Some
our existing strategic partner agreements contain minimum purchase requirements for certain years but unless renegotiated these minimum purchase
requirements could and expire addition have control with respect our strategic partners sales personnel and how they prioritize products
based xMAP technology nor can control the timing the development release products our strategic partners The amount these revenues
depends variety factors that are outside our control including the amount and timing resources that current and future strategic partners devote
develop and market products incorporating our technology Furthermore the development and marketing certain kits will require our strategic partners
obtain governmental approvals which could delay prevent their commercialization efforts our current future strategic partners not successfully
develop and market products based our technology and obtain necessary government approvals our revenues from product sales and royalties could
significantly reduced
the governmental laws and regulations change ways that not anticipate fail comply with existing laws and regulations that affect our
business could subject enforcement actions injunctions and civil and criminal penalties otherwise subject increased costs that could
delay prevent marketing our products
The production testing labeling marketing and distribution our products for some purposes including products based our technology are subject
governmental regulation the FDA and similar agencies other countries Some our products including those based our technologies for
vitro diagnostic purposes are subject clearance the FDA prior marketing for commercial use date seven strategic partners have obtained such
clearances Others are anticipated The process obtaining necessary FDA clearances can time consuming expensive and uncertain Further clearance
may place substantial restrictions the indications for which products may marketed whom they may marketed addition because some our
products employ laser technology are also required comply with FDA requirements relating radiation performance safety standards
Periodically the FDA issues guidance documents that represent the FDA current thinking topic These issues are initially issued draft form prior
final rule generally with enforcement discretion for some grace period time Changes made through this process may impact the release status
products offered and our ability market those products affected the change For example September the FDA released the final document
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Commercially Distributed Analyte Specific Reagents ASRs Frequently Asked Questions This guidance may limit
delay distribution assays our platform including assays that developed internally and distributed the extent additional regulatory clearance
required prior distribution
Cleared medical device products are subject continuing FDA requirements relating among other issues manufacturing quality control and quality
assurance maintenance records and documentation registration and listing import export adverse event and other reporting distribution labeling and
promotion and advertising medical devices Our inability the inability our strategic partners obtain required regulatory approval clearance
timely acceptable basis could harm our business addition failure comply with applicable regulatory requirements could subject our strategic
partners regulatory enforcement action including warning letters product seizures recalls withdrawal clearances restrictions injunctions against
marketing our products products based our technology and civil and criminal penalties
Medical device laws and regulations are effect within the United States and also many countries outside the United States These range from
comprehensive device clearance requirements for some all our medical device products requests for product data certifications regarding the
hazardous material content our products device manufacturer are required report annually the CMS any payments transfers value
have made physicians and teaching hospitals and any physician ownership investment interest the company part the European Council
Directive February are expected comply with certain requirements regarding the collection recycling and labeling our
products containing electronic devices each the member states where our regulated products are distributed While are taking steps comply
with the requirements WEEE cannot certain that will comply with the national stage implementation WEEE all member states continue
evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations they are enacted These regulations include for example the Registration Evaluation
Authorization and Restriction Chemical substances the RoHS Directive and the WEEE Directive enacted the European Union which regulate the use
certain hazardous substances and require the collection reuse and recycling waste from certain products manufacture This and similar legislation
that has been the process being enacted various countries may require design our products ensure compliance with the applicable
standards These redesigns may impact the performance our products add greater testing lead times for product introductions have other similar effects
believe comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and will continue monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted
under them determine our responsibilities addition the State California adopted the Electronic Waste Recycling Act effective January
which requires the California Department Toxic Substances Control adopt regulations prohibit the sale electronic devices California they are
also prohibited from sale the under the RoHS Directive because they contain certain heavy metals The number and scope these requirements are
increasing and will likely become subject similar laws other jurisdictions Failure comply with applicable federal state and foreign medical device
laws and regulations may harm our business financial condition and results operations are also subject variety other laws and regulations
relating among other things environmental protection and workplace health and safety
Our strategic partners and customers expect our organization operate established quality management system compliant with FDA Quality
System Regulations and industry standards the Vitro Diagnostic Directive October Directive implemented nationally the
member states and industry standards such ISO became ISO certified March and self declared our Luminex
FLEXMAP and MAGPIX instruments the Directive Our devices are conformity with Article Article Annex Essential Requirements
Annex III and the additional provisions the Directive December Subsequent audits are carried out annually ensure maintain our system
substantial compliance with ISO and other applicable regulations and industry standards became ISO and Canadian Medical Devices
Conformity Assessment System CMDCAS certified July Failure maintain compliance with FDA CMDCAS and regulations and other
medical device laws obtain applicable registrations where required could reduce our competitive advantage the markets which compete and
also decrease satisfaction and confidence levels with our partners
Our success depends our ability attract and retain our management and staff
depend the principal members our management and scientific staff including our chief executive officer Nachum Shamir and our operations
marketing research and development technical support technical service and sales staff The loss services key members management could delay
reduce our product development marketing and sales and technical support efforts addition recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and other
personnel perform research and development technical support technical service and marketing and sales work will critical our success There
shortage our industry qualified management and scientific personnel and competition for these individuals intense There can assurance that
will able retain existing and attract additional personnel necessary achieve our business objectives
Our reliance strategic partnerships makes forecasting difficult
result our reliance our strategic relationships can difficult accurately forecast future operating results Estimating the timing and
amount sales our products particularly difficult for the following reasons among others
not control the timing extent product development marketing sale our products our strategic partners
not control the incentives provided our strategic partners and distributors their sales personnel
utilize limited number geographically focused distributors for portion our sales including sales several our key assay products and
the loss nonperformance these distributors could harm our revenues the territories serviced these distributors
significant number our strategic partners intend produce clinical diagnostic applications that may need approved the FDA other
regulatory bodies jurisdictions outside the United States
certain strategic partners may have unique requirements for their applications and systems Assisting the various strategic partners may strain our
research and development and manufacturing resources the extent that are not able timely assist our strategic partners the commercialization
their products will likely delayed
certain strategic partners may fail deliver products that satisfy market requirements such products may fail perform properly
have limited access partner and distributor confidential corporate information sudden unexpected change ownership strategy other
material event due information which are not currently aware could adversely impact partner purchases our products and
partners tend order bulk prior the production new lots their products and prior major product development initiatives The frequency
these bulk purchases difficult predict and may cause large fluctuations microsphere sales quarter quarter
the quality our products does not meet our customers expectations our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could
negatively impacted
the course conducting our business must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects our
engineering design and manufacturing processes well defects third party components included our products Because our instruments and
consumables are highly complex the occurrence defects may increase continue introduce new products and services and rapidly scale
manufacturing meet increased demand for our products and services Although have established internal procedures minimize risks that may arise
from product quality issues there can assurance that will able eliminate mitigate occurrences these issues and associated liabilities
addition identifying the root cause quality issues particularly those affecting reagents and third party components may difficult which increases the
time needed address quality issues they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur Finding solutions quality issues can
expensive and may incur significant costs lost revenue connection with for example shipment holds product recalls and warranty other service
obligations addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new existing customers and adversely affect our brand image and our reputation
producer high quality products could suffer which could adversely affect our business financial condition results operations
become subject product liability claims may required pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage
Our business exposes potential product liability claims that are inherent the testing production marketing and sale biotechnological human
diagnostic and therapeutic products Although believe that are reasonably insured against these risks and generally have limited indemnity
protections our supplier agreements there can assurance that will able obtain insurance amounts scope sufficient provide with
adequate coverage against all potential liabilities product liability claim excess our insurance coverage claim that outside exceeds our
indemnity protections our supplier agreements recall one our products would have paid out our cash reserves
our direct selling efforts for our products are less successful than anticipated our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability generate
revenues could diminished
our direct sales force not successful additions our sales team fail gain traction among our customers may not able increase market
awareness and sales our products maintain historical sales levels fail establish our systems the marketplace could have negative effect
our ability sell subsequent systems and hinder the planned expansion our business
The commercial launch the ARIES System was the first Luminex system launch that was not channeled through partner The successful execution
our product launch and adoption our direct customers critical establishing installed base satisfied customers the extent that these
customers not adopt the current and forthcoming menu ARIES assays that have been significant focus Luminex research and development efforts
over the last four years there significant risk that our investment these assays may not pay off Additionally have made significant investment
the Luminex customer service support and direct sales force support the ARIES Systems launches The ability Luminex service support and sell the
ARIES and VERIGENE Systems directly and not through partner may also fail meet market expectations which could have material adverse effect
our business financial condition and results operations
The capital spending policies our customers have significant effect the demand for our products
Our customers include clinical diagnostic pharmaceutical biotechnological chemical and industrial companies and the capital spending policies
these companies can have significant effect the demand for our products These policies are based wide variety factors including general local
economic conditions governmental regulation price controls resources available for purchasing research equipment spending priorities among various
types analytical equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods Any decrease capital spending life sciences
companies could cause our revenues decline result are subject significant volatility revenue Therefore our operating results can
materially affected negatively and positively the spending policies and priorities our customers
become subject claims relating improper handling storage disposal hazardous materials could incur significant cost and time

Uncertain economic conditions and outlook may adversely impact our business results operations financial condition liquidity
Global economic conditions could adversely affect our results operations The credit markets and the financial services industry continue
experience volatility both domestically and internationally These conditions not only limit our access capital but also make extremely difficult for our
customers our vendors and accurately forecast and plan future business activities and they could cause and foreign businesses and consumers
slow spending our products and services which would delay and lengthen sales cycles Some our customers rely government research grants fund
technology purchases negative trends the economy affect the government allocation funds research there may less grant funding available for
certain our customers purchase technologies like those Luminex sells Certain our partners and their and our customers may face challenges gaining
timely access sufficient credit may otherwise faced with budget constraints which could result decreased purchases development products
based our products impairment their ability make timely payments our partners and our customers not make timely payments
may required assume greater credit risk relating those customers increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding
would negatively impacted Although maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability our customers
make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established may not continue experience
the same loss rates that have the past given the current condition the worldwide economy Additionally these economic conditions and market
turbulence may also impact our suppliers causing them unable supply timely manner sufficient quantities customized components thereby
impairing our ability manufacture schedule and commercially reasonable costs
catastrophe strikes our manufacturing warehousing facilities may unable manufacture distribute our products for substantial amount
time and may experience inventory shortfalls which would cause experience lost revenues
Our manufacturing facilities are located Austin Madison Northbrook and Toronto Although have business interruption insurance our facilities

risks and uncertainties Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated these forward looking statements
Overview
develop manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences industries
including diagnostics and research These industries depend broad range tests called assays perform diagnostic testing and conduct life science
research
primarily serve the life sciences industries marketing products including our specific testing equipment called systems and assays various
types testing laboratories have large base installed systems that has grown primarily from the following
placements made customers within our Licensed Technologies Group LTG previously referred our Partner Business which customers
either
license our xMAP technology and develop products that incorporate our xMAP technology into products that they then sell end users
purchase our proprietary xMAP laboratory instrumentation and our proprietary xMAP microspheres and sell xMAP based assay products
and xMAP based testing services which run the xMAP instrumentation and pay royalty and
addition utilize direct sales force that focuses the sale molecular diagnostic assays that run our systems
December Luminex had strategic partners which have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our
technology Our remaining LTG customers are various stages development and commercialization products that incorporate our technology
Luminex has number forms revenue that result from our business model
System revenue generated from the sale our xMAP multiplexing analyzers and peripherals and our VERIGENE readers and processors
Consumable revenue generated from the sale our dyed polystyrene microspheres along with sheath and drive fluid Our larger commercial
and development partners often purchase these consumables bulk minimize the number incoming qualification events and allow for
longer development and production runs
Royalty revenue generated when partner sells our proprietary microspheres end user when partner sells kit incorporating our
proprietary microspheres end user when partner utilizes kit provide testing result end user End users can facilities such
testing labs development facilities and research facilities that buy prepared kits and have specific testing needs testing service companies that
provide assay results pharmaceutical research companies physicians
Assay revenue generated primarily from four sources the sale our branded kits which are combination chemical and biological
reagents and our proprietary xMAP bead technology used perform diagnostic and research assays samples real time PCR and
multiplexed PCR assays using our proprietary MultiCode technology iii ARIES cassettes designed run fully automated sample answer
molecular assay the ARIES System and VERIGENE test cartridges sample answer molecular assay designed target infections the
bloodstream respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract the VERIGENE System
Service revenue generated when partner other owner system purchases service contract from after the standard warranty has expired
pays for our time and materials service instruments Service contract revenue amortized over the life the contract and the costs
associated with those contracts are recognized incurred
Other revenue consists items such training shipping parts sales license revenue grant revenue contract research and development fees

Acquisition Nanosphere
completed our acquisition the Acquisition Nanosphere publicly held molecular diagnostic company based Northbrook Illinois June
The Acquisition was all cash transaction that was undertaken expand the Company access the high growth molecular microbiology market
and Nanosphere portfolio molecular testing solutions connection with closing the Acquisition retired Nanosphere million debt and
paid transaction and debt prepayment expenses approximately million The results operations for Nanosphere are included the Company
consolidated financial statements beginning July
Luminex acquired Nanosphere with the intention accelerating the introduction higher plexed sample answer based solution the market This
decision followed series internal analyses and included input from external consulting firm how best address the sample answer multiplexing
market and the importance time market pursuing that opportunity Additionally anticipate research development and clinical trial costs savings
result the Acquisition The Acquisition provided revenue generating technology opposed incurring the risk significant system development
Nanosphere has portfolio with meaningfully lower gross margins than the pre existing Luminex business and expect the gross margins the
acquired portfolio continue negatively impact our consolidated gross margins the near term however expect synergies realized from the
Acquisition increased sales volumes and the commercialization the next generation VERIGENE System VERIGENE increase these gross margins
the long term
Reorganization
Following the Acquisition and better focus the Company core business the Company conducted reorganization December The
reorganization included headcount reduction approximately people reallocation responsibilities within the research and development
organization and significant reduction biodefense efforts result the organizational change the Company eliminated approximately its
aggregate workforce The Company recognized charge approximately million the fourth quarter conjunction with these activities
Material Partner Activity
Based upon extension agreement entered into the third quarter the Company will continue sell its products the Company
largest customer LabCorp through the end Also previously stated our Annual Report Form for the year ended December
LabCorp elected develop the next iteration one its women health products with another party have negotiated significant minimum women
health purchases from LabCorp through June pursuant which LabCorp committed acquire less than million our women health
products from January through June which LabCorp acquired approximately million our women health products The
anticipated future loss the LabCorp business could have material adverse effect our growth and future results operations are unable
effectively attract new customers and increase sales with existing customers
Consumables Sales and Royalty Revenue Trends
have experienced significant fluctuations consumable revenue over the past three years Year over year changes consumable revenue have
been increase million increase million and reduction million and respectively Overall the fluctuations
manifested themselves through periodic changes volume from our largest purchasing partners These partners account for more than our total
consumable sales volume expect these fluctuations continue the ordering patterns and inventory levels our largest bulk purchasing partners
remain variable Additionally even though experience variability consumable revenue the key indicator the success our partners
commercialization efforts the rising level royalties and reported royalty bearing sales
Growth Inventory
Our inventory has increased from million December million December primarily the result increases
systems and VERIGENE cassette inventory Based upon the increased demand for our systems and VERIGENE assays that have experienced over the
past twelve months are building both our finished good inventory and parts and supplies inventory related our systems and VERIGENE cassettes
able meet both expected and unanticipated demand
Future Operations
expect our areas focus over the next twelve months

Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been
prepared accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP The preparation these financial statements requires make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure contingent assets and
liabilities base our estimates historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances the
results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources The
following discussion our most critical accounting policies used the preparation our financial statements and the judgments and estimates
involved under each also have other significant accounting policies that not involve critical accounting estimates because they not generally
require make estimates and judgments that are difficult subjective These are described Note our Consolidated Financial Statements provided
herein Item Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
conditions
Revenue Recognition Revenue generated primarily from the sale our systems consumables assays and related services which are primarily support
and maintenance services our systems recognize product revenue the time the product shipped provided there persuasive evidence
agreement right return exists the fee fixed determinable and collectability probable There customer right return our sales
agreements the criteria for revenue recognition are not met the time shipment the revenue deferred until all criteria are met
may enter into arrangements for system sales that are multiple element arrangements including services such installation and multiple products
When such arrangements include installation revenue generally recognized until installation and delivery complete When such arrangements
include multiple products all the products are generally shipped the same time result generally not need defer revenue for any
undelivered elements However situations where revenue deferred for undelivered element have typically been able determine the selling price
each deliverable multiple element arrangement based the price for such deliverable when sold separately
Within the diagnostic portion our business provide systems and certain other hardware customers through reagent rental agreements under
which the customers commit purchasing minimum quantities disposable products stated price over defined contract term which normally two
three years All these reagent rental agreements are operating leases Instead rental payments recover the cost providing the system and other
hardware the amount charge for our diagnostic assays and other disposables Revenue recognized over the defined contract term assays and other
disposable products are shipped The depreciation costs associated with the system and other hardware are charged cost sales straight line basis
over the estimated life the system The costs maintain these instruments the field are charged cost sales incurred
Revenue from extended service agreements deferred and recognized ratably over the term the agreement may also entitled milestone
payments that are contingent upon our achieving predefined objective follow the milestone method recognizing revenue from milestones and
milestone payments are recorded revenue full upon achievement the milestone Revenues from royalties related agreements with strategic partners
are recognized when such amounts are reported the Company therefore the underlying end user sales may related prior periods
adopted new revenue accounting guidance effective January which will impact the amount and timing our future revenue recognition
For further discussion see Note Recent Accounting Pronouncements our consolidated financial statements included Part Item this Annual
Report Form
Inventory Inventories are valued the lower cost and net realizable value Cost determined according the standard cost method Net realizable
value defined the estimated selling price the ordinary course business less reasonably predictable costs completion disposal and
transportation Inventories have been written down through allowance for excess and obsolete inventories The two major components the allowance for
excess and obsolete inventory are specific write down for inventory items that longer use the manufacture our products that longer meet
our specifications and write down against slow moving items for potential obsolescence Inventory reviewed regular basis and adjusted based
management review inventories hand compared estimated future usage and sales While management believes that adequate write downs for
inventory obsolescence have been made the consolidated financial statements scientific and technological advances will continue and could
experience additional inventory write downs the future However not believe this estimate subject significant variability
Warranties provide for the estimated cost initial product warranties the time revenue recognized While engage product quality
programs and processes our warranty obligation affected product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred correcting product
failure While management believes that adequate reserve has been made the consolidated financial statements for product warranties should actual
product failure rates material usage service delivery costs differ from our estimates revisions the estimated warranty liability would
required However not believe this estimate subject significant variability
Purchase Price Allocation Intangibles and Goodwill The purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use accounting estimates and
judgments allocate the purchase price the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired including process research and development and
liabilities assumed based their respective fair values Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the
straight line method periodically review the estimated useful lives our identifiable intangible assets taking into consideration any events
circumstances that might result diminished fair value revised useful life
Goodwill represents the excess the cost over the fair value the assets the acquired business evaluate the carrying value goodwill
reporting unit level annually October each year more frequently there evidence that certain events changes circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount these assets may not recoverable Since have estimated the fair value our reporting unit using step one analysis
using fair value based approach based the market capitalization discounted cash flow DCF analysis our projected future results determine
more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount This analysis requires comparison the carrying value the
reporting unit the estimated fair value the reporting unit Determining the fair value goodwill subjective nature and often involves the use
estimates and assumptions including without limitation use estimates future prices and volumes for the Company products capital needs economic
trends and other factors which are inherently difficult forecast Our annual test performed the first day the fourth quarter did not result
impairment charge for the estimated fair value our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value significant enough amount that any
reasonably likely change the assumptions used the analysis would not cause the carrying value exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit
determined under our analysis
Accounting for Income Taxes calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment items for tax and accounting purposes
determining the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns judgment required Differences
between the anticipated and actual outcomes these future tax consequences could have material impact our consolidated results operations
financial position The recognition deferred tax assets reduced valuation allowance more likely than not that the tax benefits will not
realized regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish valuation allowance based historical income projected future
income the expected timing the reversals existing temporary differences and the implementation tax planning strategies The excess financial
reporting basis over tax basis our foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested with the exception the Canadian subsidiary Accordingly
provision for withholding taxes certain earnings has only been provided for this subsidiary
The GAAP guidance requires recognition the impact tax position our financial statements only that position more likely than not
sustained upon examination taxing authorities based the technical merits the position Any interest and penalties related uncertain tax positions
will reflected income tax expense Determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments estimates and the application
complex tax regulations are required provide for income taxes each the jurisdictions where operate including estimated liabilities for
uncertain tax positions Although believe that have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions the actual liability resulting from
examinations taxing authorities could differ from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result additional income tax expense having material
impact our consolidated results operations Changes estimates our income tax liabilities are reflected our income tax provision the period
which the factors resulting the change our estimate become known benefit from research tax credit incentives the and Canada
extended taxpayers engaged qualified research and experimental activities while carrying trade business
Significant reform the Internal Revenue Code was signed into legislation December pursuant the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax
Act This legislation includes among other things changes federal tax rates and the migration from worldwide system taxation territorial
system However tax reform modifications the taxation foreign profits and changes deductibility operational expenses will have
ongoing impact the tax estimates our financial statements and may not beneficial Currently there substantial uncertainty regarding the
interpretation and application the Tax Act These uncertainties could materially impact our tax estimates reflected the financial statements and could
adverse future years
addition the Affordable Care Act includes tax related provisions Specifically the law requires manufacturers producers and importers medical
devices pay excise tax sales certain medical devices January Our products that have received FDA approval fall under the
government classification and are subject the excise tax However moratorium the tax took effect January and has been extended through
December
Stock compensation All stock based compensation cost including grants stock options restricted stock units and shares issued under the Company
employee stock purchase plan measured the grant date based the fair value the award and recognized expense straight line basis over
the requisite service period which generally the vesting period The fair value our stock options estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing
model The Black Scholes valuation calculation requires estimate key assumptions such expected volatility expected term and risk free rate
return Calculation expected volatility based historical volatility The expected term calculated using the contractual term the options well
analysis our historical exercises stock options The estimate the risk free rate return based the Treasury yield curve effect the
time grant The dividend yield based our history and expectation dividend payouts the time grant
The amount stock based compensation expense recognized during period based the value the portion the awards that are ultimately
expected vest part the requirements ASC Stock Compensation the Company required estimate potential forfeitures stock grants and
adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly The estimate forfeitures based historical forfeiture performance and will adjusted over the
requisite service period the extent that actual forfeitures differ are expected differ from such estimates Changes estimated forfeitures will
recognized through cumulative catch adjustment the period evaluation and will also impact the amount stock compensation expense
recognized future periods Ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only for those awards that vest except for the limited
number market based awards under long term incentive plans use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense future
periods actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures the change our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our

recognize royalty revenue With the implementation the standard will record cumulative adjustment increasing retained earnings which currently
estimated approximately million royalty revenue After implementation estimated royalty revenue will recorded each quarter
accrual basis more closely coincide with the timing the end user sale the partner with reconciliation made upon submission the royalty report
the partner indicating actual royalties owed the following quarter anticipate this could contribute increase days sales outstanding
approximately days solely result the timing when revenue recorded not due any changes when payments are received addition the
Company will begin recording the portion reagent rental revenue associated with the recovery the cost providing the system and other hardware
reagent rental agreements from assay revenue system revenue effective January This change will not have any impact top line revenue and
not anticipate any material effects our revenue categorization
ITEM QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk Our interest income sensitive changes the general level domestic interest rates particularly since our investments are
long term instruments available for sale basis point fluctuation from average investment returns December would yield less than
variance overall investment return which would not have material adverse effect our financial condition
Foreign Currency Risk Our international business subject risks including but not limited foreign exchange rate volatility differing tax
structures unique economic conditions other regulations and restrictions and changes political climate Accordingly our future results could
materially and adversely impacted changes these and other factors
December result our foreign operations have costs assets and liabilities that are denominated foreign currencies primarily
Canadian dollars and lesser extent the Euro Renminbi and Yen For example some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses are denominated
Canadian dollars while sales products are primarily denominated dollars All transactions our Netherlands and Japanese subsidiaries are
denominated Euros and Yen respectively All transactions with the exception our initial capital investment our Chinese subsidiary are denominated
Renminbi consequence movements exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses fluctuate percentage net
revenue affecting our profitability and cash flows significant majority our revenues are denominated dollars The impact foreign exchange
foreign denominated balances will vary relation changes between the dollar Canadian dollar Euro Yen and Renminbi exchange rates
change all these exchange rates relation the dollar would result income statement impact approximately million foreign
currency denominated asset and liability balances December result our efforts expand globally the future will exposed
additional foreign currency risk multiple currencies however this time our exposure foreign currency fluctuations not material regularly
assess the market determine additional strategies are appropriate mitigate future risks
addition the indirect effect fluctuations interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have material adverse effect our business
financial condition and results operations For example currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect international demand for our products
addition interest rate fluctuations could affect our customers buying patterns Furthermore interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may
broadly influence the United States and foreign economies resulting material adverse effect our business financial condition and results
operations result cannot give any assurance the effect that future changes foreign currency rates will have our consolidated financial
