Risks Relating Our Business
The potential loss delay non renewal our contracts the non payment our customers for services that
have performed could adversely affect our results
experience termination cancellation and non renewals contracts our customers the ordinary course
business and the number and dollar value cancellations can vary significantly from year year
The time between when clinical trial awarded and when goes contract typically several months and prior
new business award going contract our customers can cancel the award without notice Moreover once
award goes contract most our customers for clinical trial services can terminate our contracts without cause
upon days notice Our customers may delay terminate reduce the scope our contracts for variety
reasons beyond our control including but not limited
decisions forego terminate particular clinical trial
lack available financing budgetary limits changing priorities
actions regulatory authorities
changes law
production problems resulting shortages the drug being tested
failure the drug being tested satisfy safety requirements efficacy criteria
unexpected undesired clinical results
insufficient investigator recruitment patient enrollment trial
decisions downsize product development portfolios
dissatisfaction with our performance including the quality data provided and our ability meet
agreed upon schedules
shift business another CRO internal resources
product withdrawal following market launch
shut down our customers manufacturing facilities
result contract terminations delays and modifications are regular part our business the event
termination our contracts often provide for payment fees for services provided the point
termination and for close out activities for winding down the clinical trial and reimbursement all non cancellable
expenses These payments may not sufficient for maintain our profit margins and termination nonrenewal may result lower resource utilization rates including with respect personnel who are not able
place another customer engagement Historically cancellations and delays have negatively impacted our
operating results
Clinical trials can costly and for the year ended December and our net service revenue was
derived from small biopharmaceutical companies and mid sized biopharmaceutical companies respectively which
may have limited access capital addition provide services our customers before they pay for some
our services There risk that may initiate clinical trial for customer and the customer subsequently
becomes unwilling unable fund the completion the trial such situation notwithstanding the customer
ability willingness pay for otherwise facilitate the completion the trial may legally ethically
bound complete wind down the trial our own expense
Because the contracts included our backlog are generally terminable without cause not believe that our
backlog any date necessarily meaningful predictor future results addition may not realize the full
benefits our backlog contractually committed services our customers cancel delay reduce their
commitments under our contracts with them Thus the loss delay large contract the loss delay
multiple contracts could adversely affect our net service revenue and profitability addition the terminability
our contracts puts increased pressure our quality control efforts since not only can our contracts terminated
customers result poor performance but any such termination may also affect our ability obtain future
contracts from the customer involved and others
Our backlog may not convert net service revenue our historical conversion rates
Backlog represents anticipated future net service revenue from net new business awards that have commenced but
have not been completed Reported backlog will fluctuate based new business awards changes scope
existing contracts cancellations revenue recognition existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from
non dollar denominated backlog Our backlog December was approximately million
Once work begins project net service revenue recognized over the duration the project Projects may
terminated delayed the customer delayed regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control the
extent projects are delayed the timing our net service revenue could adversely affected Moreover the event
that customer cancels contract often would entitled receive payment for services provided the
point cancellation and for close out activities for winding down the clinical trial and reimbursement all noncancellable expenses Typically however have contractual right the full amount the future net service
revenue reflected our backlog the event contract cancellation subsequent changes scope that reduce
the value the contract The duration the projects included our backlog and the related net service revenue
recognition generally range from few months several years Our backlog may not indicative our future net
service revenue and may not realize all the anticipated future net service revenue reflected our backlog
number factors may affect the realization our net service revenue from backlog including
the size complexity and duration the projects
the cancellation delay projects and
changes the scope work during the course project
Fluctuations our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that may receive small number relatively
large projects any given reporting period that may included our backlog Because these large projects our
backlog that reporting period may reach levels that may not sustained subsequent reporting periods
Additionally although increase backlog will generally result increase net service revenue over time
increase backlog particular point time does not necessarily correspond directly increase net service
revenue during any particular period all The extent which contracts backlog will result net service
revenue depends many factors including but not limited delivery against project schedules scope changes
contract terminations and the nature duration and complexity the contracts and can vary significantly over time
increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global nature there can
assurance about the rate which our backlog will convert into net service revenue decrease this conversion
rate would mean that the rate net service revenue recognized contracts may slower than what have
experienced the past which could impact our net service revenue and results operations quarterly and
annual basis The revenue recognition larger more global projects could slower than smaller less global
projects for variety reasons including but not limited extended period negotiation between the time
the project awarded and the actual execution the contract well increased timeframe for obtaining
the necessary regulatory approvals Additionally delayed projects will remain backlog and will not generate
revenue the rate originally expected Thus the relationship backlog realized revenues indirect and may
vary significantly over time
Additionally small and mid sized biopharmaceutical companies become less able access capital the future
may see decrease backlog conversion net service revenue and net new business awards due project
delays cancellations These companies have contributed materially our historical net service revenue they
cannot commit the same greater level capital our services going forward our results operations may
suffer
Our operating results have historically fluctuated between fiscal quarters and years and may continue
fluctuate the future which may adversely affect the market price our stock
Our operating results have fluctuated previous quarters and years and may continue vary significantly from
quarter quarter and year year and are influenced variety factors such
timing contract amendments for changes scope that could affect the value contract and
potentially impact the amount net new business awards and net service revenue from quarter
quarter
commencement completion execution postponement termination large contracts
contract terms for the billing and recognition revenue milestones
progress ongoing contracts and retention customers
timing and charges associated with completion acquisitions and other events
changes the mix services delivered both terms geography and type services
customer disputes other issues that may impact the revenue are able recognize the
collectability our related accounts receivable and
exchange rate fluctuations
Our operating results for any particular quarter year are not necessarily meaningful indicator future results
and fluctuations our quarterly yearly operating results could negatively affect the market price and liquidity
shares our common stock
Our operating margins could decrease due increased pricing pressure other pressures
Historically have been able generate the operating margins that because our disciplined full service
operating model However operate highly competitive environment and experience increased levels
competitive pricing pressure our operating margins may decrease addition may adapt our operating model
achieve greater levels growth response investor demands Such changes could result lower operating
margins
fail perform our services accordance with contractual requirements government regulations and
ethical considerations could subject significant costs liability and our reputation could adversely
affected
contract with biopharmaceutical companies perform wide range services assist them bringing new
drugs market Our services include monitoring clinical trials data and laboratory analysis electronic data capture
patient recruitment and other related services Such services are complex and subject contractual requirements
government regulations and ethical considerations For example are subject regulation the FDA and
comparable foreign regulatory authorities relating our activities conducting pre clinical studies and clinical
trials Before clinical trials begin the United States drug tested pre clinical trials that must comply with
Good Laboratory Practice and other requirements applicant must file IND which must become effective
before human clinical testing may begin Further independent IRB for each medical center proposing
participate the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for the clinical trial Once initiated clinical
trials must conducted pursuant and accordance with the applicable IND conditions the requirements the
relevant IRBs the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations including GCP and
other requirements are also subject regulation the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA which
regulates the distribution recordkeeping handling security and disposal controlled substances fail
perform our services accordance with these requirements regulatory authorities may take action against our
customers Such actions may include injunctions failure such regulatory authority grant marketing approval
our customers products imposition clinical holds delays suspension withdrawal approvals rejection
data collected our clinical trials license revocation product seizures recalls operational restrictions civil
criminal penalties prosecutions damages fines Customers may also bring claims against for breach our
contractual obligations and patients the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved the basis those
trials may bring personal injury claims against Any such action could have material adverse effect our
business financial condition results operations cash flows reputation
Such consequences could arise among other things the following occur
Improper performance our services The performance clinical development services complex and timeconsuming For example may make mistakes conducting clinical trial that could negatively impact
obviate the usefulness results the trial cause the results the trial reported improperly the trial
results are compromised could subject significant costs liability which could have adverse impact
our ability perform our services and our reputation would harmed examples
non compliance generally could result the termination ongoing clinical trials the disqualification
data for submission regulatory authorities
non compliance could compromise data from particular trial such failure verify that adequate
informed consent was obtained from patients which could require repeat the trial under the terms
our contract further cost our customer but potentially substantial cost and
breach contractual term could result liability for damages termination the contract
The services provide connection with large clinical trials can cost tens millions dollars and while
endeavor contractually limit our exposure such risks improper performance our services could have
material adverse effect our financial condition damage our reputation and result the cancellation current
contracts the affected customer other current customers failure obtain future contracts from the affected
customer other current potential customers
Investigation customers From time time one more our customers are investigated regulatory
authorities enforcement agencies with respect regulatory compliance their clinical trials programs the
marketing and sale their drugs these situations have often provided services our customers with respect
the clinical trials programs activities being investigated and are called upon respond requests for
information the authorities and agencies There risk that either our customers regulatory authorities could
claim that performed our services improperly that are responsible for clinical trial program compliance
our customers regulatory authorities make such claims against could subject significant costs
defending our activities and potential damages fines penalties addition negative publicity regarding
regulatory compliance our customers clinical trials programs products could have adverse effect our
business and reputation
Insufficient customer funding complete clinical trial noted above clinical trials can cost tens millions
dollars There risk that may initiate clinical trial for customer and then the customer becomes unwilling
unable fund the completion the trial such situation notwithstanding the customer ability
willingness pay for otherwise facilitate the completion the trial may ethically bound complete
wind down the trial our own expense
Interactive voice web response service malfunction develop and maintain our own and also use third parties
run interactive voice web response systems These systems automatically manage the randomization patients
given clinical trial different treatment arms and regulate the supply investigational drugs error the
design programming validation these systems could lead inappropriate assignment dosing patients
which could give rise patient safety issues invalidation the trial liability claims against Furthermore
negative publicity associated with such malfunction could have adverse effect our business and reputation
Additionally errors randomization may require repeat the trial further cost our customer but
substantial cost
addition the above laws and regulations must comply with the laws all countries where
business including laws governing clinical trials the jurisdiction where the trials are performed Failure comply
with applicable requirements could subject regulatory risk liability and potential costs associated with redoing
the trials which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results
bear financial risk underprice our fixed fee contracts overrun cost estimates and our financial
results can also adversely affected failure receive approval for change orders delays documenting
change orders
The majority our Phase contracts are fixed fee contracts bear the financial risk initially underprice
our contracts otherwise overrun our cost estimates addition contracts with our customers are subject change
orders which commonly experience and which occur when the scope work perform needs modified
from that originally contemplated our contract with the customer Modifications can occur for example when
there change key trial assumption parameter significant change timing change staffing needs
Furthermore may unable successfully negotiate changes scope change orders timely basis
all which could require incur cost outlays ahead the receipt any additional revenue addition under
GAAP cannot recognize additional revenue anticipated from change orders until appropriate documentation
received from the customer authorizing the change However incur additional expense anticipation
receipt that documentation must recognize the expense incurred Such underpricing significant cost
overruns delay documentation change orders could have material adverse effect our business results
operations financial condition cash flows

material adverse effect our business
Our customer therapeutic area concentration may have material adverse effect our business financial
condition results operations cash flows
Although did not have any customer that represented more our net service revenue during the year
ended December derive significant portion our revenues from limited number large
customers For the year ended December derived and our net service revenue from our
top customers and our largest customer respectively addition approximately and our backlog
December was concentrated among our top customers and our largest customer backlog
concentration respectively Moreover our backlog December was concentrated with our
largest customer net service revenue any large customer decreases terminates its relationship with our
business financial condition results operations cash flows could materially adversely affected Also
consolidation our actual potential customer base results increased competition for important market
segments and fewer available customer accounts
Additionally conducting multiple clinical trials for different sponsors single therapeutic class involving similar
drugs biologics medical devices may adversely affect our business some all the trials are terminated
because new scientific information regulatory decisions that affect the products class Moreover even
these trials are not terminated they may compete with each other thereby limiting our potential revenue going

June majority voters the United Kingdom elected withdraw from the European Union the
national referendum The referendum was advisory and the terms any withdrawal are subject negotiation
period that could last least two years after the government the United Kingdom formally initiates withdrawal
process Nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the

Kingdom determines which laws replace replicate the event withdrawal The referendum has also
given rise calls for the governments other member states consider withdrawal These developments
the perception that any them could occur have had and may continue have material adverse effect global
economic conditions and the stability global financial markets and may significantly reduce global market
liquidity and restrict the ability key market participants operate certain financial markets Any these
factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access capital which could have material adverse effect

Risks Relating Our Industry
Outsourcing trends the biopharmaceutical industry and changes aggregate expenditures and budgets
could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate
Our revenues depend the level expenditures size the drug development pipelines and outsourcing
trends the biopharmaceutical industry including the amount such expenditures that outsourced and
subject competitive bidding among CROs Accordingly economic factors and industry trends that affect
biopharmaceutical companies affect our business For example biopharmaceutical companies become less able
access capital the future they may commit less capital our services going forward Also biopharmaceutical
companies continue seek long term strategic collaborations with global CROs with favorable pricing terms Many
our competitors seek out these collaborations while generally not our competitors can successfully enter
into these collaborations may reduce the share the biopharmaceutical outsourcing business that might
otherwise positioned capture
addition the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing clinical trials such outsourcing fails
grow projected expected rates all our business financial condition results operations and cash flows
could materially and adversely affected may also negatively impacted consolidation and other factors
the biopharmaceutical industry which may slow decision making our customers result the delay
cancellation existing projects cause reductions overall expenditures lead increased pricing
pressures Further the event that one our customers combines with company that using the services one
our competitors the combined company could decide use the services that competitor another provider
All these events could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows results operations
face intense competition many areas our business and not compete effectively our business
may harmed
The CRO industry highly competitive often compete for business with other CROs well internal
development departments some our customers some which could considered large CROs their own
right also compete with universities and teaching hospitals Some these competitors have greater financial
resources and wider range service offerings over greater geographic area than not compete
successfully our business will suffer The industry highly fragmented with numerous smaller specialized
companies and handful full service companies with global capabilities similar ours Increased competition
has led price and other forms competition such acceptance less favorable contract terms which could
adversely affect our operating results recent years our industry has experienced consolidation This trend
likely produce more competition from the resulting larger companies Further certain our key competitors are
private and therefore they not contend with the cost pressures being public company compete with
both large CROs and mid sized CROs and have increasingly faced more competition from larger CROs Our ability
continue grow and perform effectively will directly impact our success against our competitors addition
there are few barriers entry for smaller specialized companies considering entering the industry Because their
size and focus small CROs might compete effectively against larger companies such especially lower cost
geographic areas which could have material adverse effect our business
may affected healthcare reform and potential additional regulatory reforms which may adversely
impact the biopharmaceutical industry otherwise reduce the need for our services negatively impact our
profitability
Numerous government bodies are considering have adopted various healthcare reforms and may undertake are
the process undertaking efforts control growing healthcare costs through legislation regulation and
voluntary agreements with healthcare providers and biopharmaceutical companies including many our
customers way example March the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act collectively the Affordable Care Act was signed into law which
among other things expanded over time health insurance coverage imposed health industry cost containment
measures enhanced remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse added new transparency requirements for
healthcare and health insurance industries imposed new taxes and fees pharmaceutical and medical device
manufacturers added new requirements for certain applicable drug and device manufacturers disclose payments
physicians including principal investigators and imposed additional health policy reforms any which may
significantly impact the biopharmaceutical industry are uncertain the full effects these reforms our
business and are unable predict what legislative proposals any will adopted the future regulatory cost
containment efforts limit the profitability new drugs our customers may reduce their expenditures which
could reduce the business they outsource Similarly regulatory requirements for product testing are relaxed
harmonized across jurisdictions simplified drug approval procedures are adopted the demand for our services
could decrease The result the recent presidential election the United States has added the uncertainty
regarding healthcare policies and regulations the new presidential administration and Congress have called
for the repeal the Affordable Care Act
Government bodies may also adopt healthcare legislation regulations that are more burdensome than existing
regulations For example product safety concerns and recommendations the Drug Safety Oversight Board could
change the regulatory environment for drug products and new heightened regulatory requirements may increase
our expenses limit our ability offer some our services Additionally new heightened regulatory
requirements may have negative impact the ability our customers conduct industry sponsored clinical
trials which could reduce the need for our services These developments and the lack clarity regarding future
healthcare policies and regulations have created significant uncertainty that could adversely affect our business
financial condition cash flows results operations
Consolidation the biopharmaceutical industry could lead reduction our revenues
The biopharmaceutical and CRO industries are currently undergoing period increased merger activity Several
large biopharmaceutical companies have recently completed mergers and acquisitions that will consolidate the
outsourcing trends and expenditures into fewer companies and many larger and medium sized
biopharmaceutical companies have been acquiring smaller biopharmaceutical companies result this and
future consolidations our customer diversity may decrease and our business may adversely affected
fail comply with federal state and foreign healthcare laws including fraud and abuse laws could
face substantial penalties and our business results operations financial condition and prospects could
adversely affected
Even though not order healthcare services bill directly Medicare Medicaid other third party payors
certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining fraud and abuse are applicable our business
could subject healthcare fraud and abuse laws both the federal government and the states which
conduct our business Because the breadth these laws and the narrowness available statutory and regulatory
exceptions possible that some our business activities could subject challenge under one more such
laws our operations are found violation any the laws described above any other
governmental regulations that apply may subject penalties including civil and criminal penalties
damages fines imprisonment and the curtailment restructuring our operations any which could materially
adversely affect our ability operate our business and our financial results
Laws and regulations regarding the protection personal data could result increased risks liability
increased cost could limit our service offerings
The confidentiality collection use and disclosure personal data including clinical trial patient specific
information are subject governmental regulation generally the country which the personal data was collected
used For example federal regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
amended the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their
implementing regulations including the Privacy and Security Rules collectively HIPAA generally require
individuals written authorization addition any required informed consent before protected health information
may used for research and such regulations specify standards for identifications and for limited data sets
may also subject applicable state privacy and security laws and regulations states which operate Two
our subsidiaries Medpace Clinical Pharmacology LLC and MARC LLC are covered entities under HIPAA
Further because amendments the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules that were promulgated January
known the Omnibus Final Rule service providers covered entities under HIPAA known business
associates are now directly subject HIPAA There are some instances where may HIPAA business
associate covered entity meaning that may directly liable for any breaches protected health
information and other HIPAA violations are also liable contractually under any business associate agreements
have signed with covered entities are determined business associate would subject
HIPAA enforcement scheme which amended can result million annual civil penalties for each
HIPAA violation single breach incident can result multiple violations the HIPAA standards meaning that
penalties could excess million addition the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment
Improvement Act required all federal agencies adjust their civil monetary penalties inflation later
than August result the minimum annual penalties for each HIPPA violation which occurs later than
February now million
HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general file suit behalf their residents for violations Courts are able
award damages costs and attorneys fees related violations HIPAA such cases While HIPAA does not
create private right action allowing individuals file suit against civil court for violations HIPAA its
standards have been used the basis for duty care cases state civil suits such those for negligence
recklessness the misuse breach protected health information addition HIPAA mandates that the
Secretary the Department Health and Human Services conduct periodic compliance audits HIPAA
covered entities and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards and
Phase two these audits focusing business associates has begun
the personal data includes any information that relates identified identifiable natural person with
health information carrying additional obligations including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for
collection use disclosure the information addition are subject rules with respect export such
data out the Such data export rules are constantly changing for example following decision the
European Court Justice October transferring personal data companies like that had certified
member the Safe Harbor Scheme was declared invalid and the other methods permit transfer are
now under review July the European Commission approved the Privacy Shield which replaces
the Safe Harbor Scheme The United States the and its member states and other countries where have
operations such Singapore and Russia continue issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations
that relate personal data and health information Failure comply with certain certification registration and
annual certification registration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and rules
various jurisdictions resolve any serious privacy security complaints could subject regulatory
sanctions criminal prosecution civil liability Federal state and foreign governments may propose have
adopted additional legislation governing the collection possession use dissemination personal data such
personal health information and personal financial data well security breach notification rules for loss theft
such data Additional legislation regulation this type might among other things require implement
new security measures and processes bring within the legislation regulation identified health other
personal data each which may require substantial expenditures limit our ability offer some our services
Additionally violate applicable laws regulations duties relating the use privacy security personal
data could subject civil liability criminal prosecution forced alter our business practices and suffer
reputational harm The laws the are under reform and from early onwards will subject the
requirements the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR because are processing data the The
GDPR increases the deadline for data breach notifications imposes additional obligations when process personal
data behalf our customers including relation security measures and increases administrative burdens
companies processing personal data not comply with our obligations under the GDPR could exposed
significant fines million EUR the total worldwide annual turnover the preceding
financial year whichever higher
The biopharmaceutical industry has history patent and other intellectual property litigation and might
involved costly intellectual property lawsuits
The biopharmaceutical industry has history intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely
continue the future Accordingly even without wrongdoing our part may face patent infringement suits
companies that have patents for similar business processes other suits alleging infringement their intellectual
property rights Legal proceedings relating intellectual property could expensive take significant time and
divert management attention from other business concerns regardless the outcome the litigation not
prevail infringement lawsuit brought against might have pay substantial damages and could
required stop the infringing activity obtain license use technology unfavorable terms Further our
customers could similarly exposed intellectual property suits and the resulting economic and operational strain
defending such claims could negatively impact such customers ability fund continue ongoing clinical trials
which are working
Actions regulatory authorities customers limit the scope withdraw approved drug biologic
medical device from the market could result loss revenue
Government regulators have the authority after approving drug biologic medical device limit its indication
for use requiring additional labeled warnings withdraw the product approval for its approved indication
based safety other concerns Similarly customers may act voluntarily limit the availability approved
products withdraw them from the market after begin our work are providing services customers for
products that are limited availability withdrawn may required narrow the scope terminate our
services with respect such products which would prevent from earning the full amount net service revenue
anticipated under the related service contracts
not keep pace with rapid technological changes our services may become less competitive obsolete
The biopharmaceutical industry generally and drug development and clinical research more specifically are subject
rapid technological changes Our current competitors other businesses might develop technologies services
that are more effective commercially attractive than render obsolete our current future technologies and
services our competitors introduce superior technologies services and cannot make enhancements
remain competitive our competitive position would harmed are unable compete successfully may
lose customers unable attract new customers which could lead decrease our revenue and have
material adverse effect our financial condition
Circumstances beyond our control could cause the CRO industry suffer reputational other harm that could
result industry wide reduction demand for CRO services which could harm our business
Demand for our services may affected perceptions our customers regarding the CRO industry whole
For example other CROs could engage conduct that could render our customers less willing business with
any CRO Likewise widely reported injury clinical trial participants could result negative perceptions
clinical trial activity thereby adversely impacting our industry One more CROs could engage fail
detect malfeasance such inadequately monitoring sites producing inaccurate databases analysis falsifying
patient records and performing incomplete lab work take other actions that would reduce the confidence our
customers the CRO industry result the willingness biopharmaceutical companies outsource
services CROs could diminish and our business could thus harmed materially events outside our control
Risks Relating Our Indebtedness
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent from fulfilling our debt
obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities

restrict from making strategic investments including acquisitions cause make non strategic
divestitures
limit our flexibility planning for reacting changes market conditions our business and the
industry which operate
place competitive disadvantage compared our competitors that have less debt
cause incur substantial fees from time time connection with debt amendments refinancings
increase our exposure rising interest rates because our borrowings are variable interest rates and
limit our ability borrow additional funds borrow terms that are satisfactory

Despite our current level indebtedness may incur more debt and undertake additional obligations
Incurring such debt undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks our
financial condition
Although the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contains restrictions our incurrence

Cinven and our Chief Executive Officer and founder collectively control substantial majority our
outstanding common stock and their interests may different from conflict with those our other
shareholders
December Cinven owned approximately the outstanding shares our common stock and
August Troendle our Chief Executive Officer and founder through his direct ownership shares
our common stock and his beneficial ownership shares our common stock held MPI controls
approximately the outstanding shares our common stock Upon distribution our common stock held
MPI our Chief Executive Officer would receive approximately such distributed shares Accordingly
both Cinven and Troendle are able exert significant degree influence actual control over our

our voting shares then outstanding Troendle shall required vote for one director affiliated with Cinven
after giving effect the directors then sitting the Board and our voting shares then outstanding
Troendle shall not required vote for any directors affiliated with Cinven
Because the Voting Agreement and the aggregate voting power Cinven and Troendle are considered
controlled company within the meaning the corporate governance standards NASDAQ Under these rules

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation financial statements accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the United
States America GAAP requires make variety decisions which affect reported amounts and
related disclosures including the selection appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions which
base accounting estimates reaching such decisions apply judgment based our understanding and analysis
the relevant circumstances including our historical experience and other assumptions Actual results could differ
from our estimates are committed incorporating accounting principles assumptions and estimates that
promote the representational faithfulness verifiability neutrality and transparency the accounting information
included the financial statements
Net Service Revenue Recognition
generally enter into contracts with customers provide services ranging duration from few months
several years The contract terms generally provide for payments based fixed fee unit service
arrangement Revenue these arrangements recognized when there persuasive evidence arrangement
the service offering has been delivered the customer the arrangement consideration determinable and the
collection the fees reasonably assured
majority our contracts provide for services based fixed fee arrangement which revenue recognized
based the proportional performance methodology Under this methodology revenue recognition determined
assessing the proportion performance completed delivered date compared total specific measures
delivered completed under the terms the arrangement The measures utilized assess performance are specific
the service provided and the Company generally compares the ratio hours completed the total estimated
hours necessary complete the contract detailed project budget hours developed based many factors
including but not limited the scope the work the complexity the study the participating geographic
locations and the Company historical experience believe the reporting and estimation hours the best
available measure progress many the services provided and best reflects the pattern which obligations
customers are fulfilled assist with the estimation hours expected complete project regular contract
reviews for each project are performed which performance date compared the most current estimate
complete assumptions The reviews include assessment effort incurred date compared expectations based
budget assumptions and other circumstances specific the project The total estimated hours necessary
complete fixed fee contract based these reviews updated and any revisions the existing hours budget
result cumulative adjustments the amount revenue recognized the period which the revisions are
identified Because the uncertainties inherent estimating the hours necessary fulfill contractual obligations
possible that estimates may change the near term resulting material change revenue reported
Fixed fee contracts provide for pricing modifications upon scope work changes recognize revenue related
work performed connection with scope changes when the underlying services are performed binding
contractual commitment has been executed with the customer and collectability reasonably assured our
customers not agree price renegotiation upon changes our scope work could exposed cost
overruns and reduced contract profitability Costs are not deferred anticipation contracts being awarded
amendments being finalized but are expensed incurred
For unit of service arrangements recognize revenue the period which the unit delivered Service unit
elements largely consist various project management consulting and analytical testing services
Many contractual arrangements combine multiple service elements For these contracts arrangement consideration
allocated identified units accounting based the relative selling price each unit account The best
evidence selling price unit accounting vendor specific objective evidence VSOE which the price
charged when the deliverable sold separately When VSOE not available determine selling price
management uses relative third party evidence available When neither VSOE nor third party evidence selling
price exists use the best estimate selling price considering all relevant information that available without
undue cost and effort
Most contracts are terminable the customer either immediately according advance notice terms specified
within the contracts These contracts require payment fees for services rendered through the date
termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary conclude the study close out the
contract Final settlement amounts are typically subject negotiation with the customer These amounts are
included net service revenue when realization reasonably assured occasionally enter into volume rebate
arrangements with customers that provide for rebates certain specified spending thresholds are met These rebate
obligations are recorded reduction revenue when appears probable that the customer will earn the rebates
and the related amount estimable
record revenue net any tax assessments governmental authorities that are imposed and concurrent with
specific revenue generating transactions
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
grant credit terms our customers prior signing service contract and monitor creditworthiness
ongoing basis assess ongoing collectability customer through variety performance indicators including
age billed receivable billing type knowledge available funding and other information available through
internal research large percentage our customers are small biopharmaceutical companies that rely funding
from investors finance their operations This creates heightened risk related their creditworthiness The
Company maintains allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable specifically identified that are risk
not being collected
Uncollectible accounts receivable are written off only after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted
Moreover many cases the Company requires advance payment from its customers for portion the study
contract price upon the signing service contract These advance payments are deferred and recognized
revenue services are performed
Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value net assets acquired business combinations
result prior year change control recognized million goodwill that was allocated and
recorded the reporting unit level Our reporting units are Phase clinical research services Phase
Laboratories and Clinics
The carrying value goodwill reviewed least annually for impairment indicators potential impairment
are identified the reporting unit level perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter
each year utilizing the quantitative two step model defined accounting guidance which governs such
assessments The first step involves the comparison each our reporting unit carrying values inclusive
assigned goodwill their respective estimated fair values reporting unit carrying value exceeds estimated fair
value second step requiring calculate the implied reporting unit goodwill fair value performed The
implied fair value goodwill determined performing hypothetical purchase price allocation reporting unit
fair value the reporting units identified assets and liabilities The resulting implied goodwill fair value
compared carrying value determine the extent impairment any exists Reporting unit fair value
estimated using combination the income approach discounted cash flow analysis and the market approach
utilizing the guideline company method The reporting unit discounted cash flow analysis requires significant
management judgment with respect net service revenue direct costs excluding depreciation and amortization
selling general and administrative expenses capital expenditures and the selection and use appropriate
discount rate The projected revenue and expense assumptions and capital expenditures are based our annual and
long term business plans Discount rates reflect market based estimates the risks associated with the projected
cash flows directly resulting from the use those assets operations
conjunction with the fourth quarter annual assessment goodwill determined that goodwill related
our Clinics reporting unit was impaired and recognized impairment charge million which represents
the goodwill that had been allocated this reporting unit This impairment was identified during the
annual impairment assessment the fourth quarter when updated our forecasted discounted cash flows
related the reporting unit reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results For our Phase and
Laboratories reporting units the reporting units fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values
including allocated goodwill There was indication impairment related goodwill based the fourth quarter
assessment
This process inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and assumptions make determining our
expected future cash flows assume that will continue acquire and convert new business contract
execute these contracts with reasonable profit collect customer receivables and thus generate positive cash flows
However future declines the operating results these reporting units could indicate need reevaluate the fair
value these components under accounting guidance governing goodwill and may ultimately result future
impairment continue monitor for any potential indicators impairment
Intangible Assets
The Company has indefinite lived intangible asset related its trade name valued million The carrying
value the trade name asset reviewed least annually for impairment indicators potential impairment
are identified The Company performs its annual impairment test the fourth quarter each year conjunction with
its annual assessment goodwill The assessment consists comparing the carrying value the indefinite lived
intangible asset its estimated fair value utilizing the relief from royalty method income approach valuation
The relief from royalty method requires management judgment with respect projected net service revenue
profitability and growth and the selection and use appropriate discount rate There was indication
impairment related the trade name asset based the fourth quarter assessment
Our assessment impairment charges any assets classified currently having indefinite lives could change
future periods certain events were occur including but not limited the following significant change
business results increase our discount rates due change our weighted average cost capital decrease
growth rates economic deterioration that more severe longer duration than anticipated another
significant economic event
Finite lived intangible assets consist mainly the value assigned customer relationships backlog and developed
technologies Finite lived intangible assets are amortized straight line using accelerated method over their
estimated useful lives which range term from months years Amortization expense recognized related
finite lived intangible assets was million million and million respectively for the years ended

Income Taxes
are subject income taxes the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment
required the forecasting taxable income using historical and projected future operating results determining
our provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities The provision for income taxes includes income
taxes paid currently payable and receivable and deferred taxes
record deferred tax assets and liabilities based temporary differences between the financial statement bases
and tax bases assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets are recorded for tax benefit carryforwards using tax rates
anticipated effect the year which temporary differences are expected reverse does not appear
more likely than not that the full value deferred tax asset will realized the Company records valuation
allowance against the deferred tax asset with offsetting charge the Company income tax provision benefit
The recoverability our deferred tax assets estimated based consideration all available positive and
negative evidence including but not limited our ability generate sufficient level future taxable income
reversals deferred tax liabilities other than those with indefinite reversal period tax planning strategies and
recent financial performance The assessment recoverability performed jurisdiction jurisdiction basis
Based the analysis the above factors determined that December and valuation
allowance the amount million and million respectively was required relating certain foreign

local operating loss carryforwards Differences actual results compared our estimates and changes our
assumptions could result adjustment the valuation allowance the future and would generally impact

uncertain tax positions that are subject various assumptions and judgment Liabilities for these uncertain tax
positions are assessed position position basis The calculation these liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties the application complex tax regulations both domestic and foreign jurisdictions These
positions may subject audit and review tax authorities and may result future taxes interest and penalties
are unsuccessful defending our positions the calculation liability related uncertain tax positions
proves more less than the ultimate assessment tax expense benefit expense respectively would

Valuation Assumptions
The Company determines the fair value stock options using the Black Scholes Merten option pricing model the
BSM Model The BSM Model primarily affected the fair value the Company common stock see
restricted share valuation discussion below the expected holding period for the option expected stock price
volatility over the term the awards the risk free interest rate and expected dividends
The following table sets forth the key weighted average assumptions used the BSM Model calculate the fair
value options
Expected holding period years
Expected volatility
Risk free interest rate
Expected dividend yield
Year Ended December
The assumptions used the table above reflect both grant date inputs arrive the grant date fair values for stock
options subject equity classified stock compensation accounting and reflect fair value calculation for stock
options outstanding the period subject liability classified stock compensation accounting Subsequent
August all outstanding stock based awards are subject equity classification through either modifications
the award terms and conditions that occurred during the years ended December and based
terms and conditions applicable the grant date
The expected holding period represents the period time the grants are expected outstanding The Company
uses the simplified method prescribed accounting guidance governing such awards calculate the expected
holding period for options granted employees not have sufficient historical evidence data provide
reasonable basis upon which estimate the expected holding period For options valued the Company for the
years ended December and the expected holding period based average between the
midpoint the vesting date and the expiration date the options
The Company estimates expected volatility primarily using the historical volatility publicly traded peer
group that operates the clinical research and development industry The Company does not have adequate history
calculate its own historical implied volatility and believes the Company expected volatility will approximate
the historical experience the peer group
The risk free interest rate based the yield Treasury obligations with remaining durations equal the
expected holding period the options The expected dividend yield assumed zero based recent and
anticipated dividend activity
Subsequent the IPO the fair value common stock based upon the market price the Company common
stock the date grant listed the NASDAQ Due the absence active market for the Company
common stock prior the IPO the Company determined the fair value restricted shares obtaining
independent valuation the fair value the Company equity applying discount for lack marketability and
then calculating the implied share price The fair value the Company was estimated primarily using income
approach which based assumptions and estimates made management and secondarily using other marketrelated factors current industry trends well observed transaction values determining the estimated future
cash flows used the income approach the Company developed and applied certain estimates and judgments
including current and projected future levels income based management plans business trends prospects and
market and economic conditions including market participant considerations Significant assumptions utilized the
income approach were based company specific information and projections which were not observable the
market and are thus considered Level measurements authoritative guidance The discount for lack
marketability the Marketability Discount was applied reflect what market participant would consider
relation the post vesting restrictions imposed regarding the inability sell transfer pledge the shares during
the restriction period The Marketability Discount was estimated using the BSM Model calculate the cost
