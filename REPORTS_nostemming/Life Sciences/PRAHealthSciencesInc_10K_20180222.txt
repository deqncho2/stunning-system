CRO Industry
CROs provide drug development services regulatory and scientific support and infrastructure and staffing support provide their clients with the
flexibility supplement their in house capabilities provide fully outsourced solution The CRO industry has grown from providing limited clinical
trial services the full service industry characterized broad relationships with clients and service offerings that encompass the entire drug
development process Today CROs provide comprehensive range clinical services including protocol design and management and monitoring
Phase through Phase clinical trials data management laboratory testing medical and safety reviews and statistical analysis addition CROs provide
services that generate high quality and timely data support applications for regulatory approval new drugs reformulations existing drugs well
new and existing marketing claims CROs leverage selected information technologies and procedures efficiently capture manage and analyze the large
streams data generated during clinical trial
Drug development processes
Discovering and developing new drugs expensive and time consuming process and highly regulated and monitored through approval
processes that vary region Before new prescription drug reaches commercialization must undergo extensive pre clinical and clinical testing and
regulatory review verify that the drug safe and effective
drug first tested pre clinical studies which can take several years complete When new molecule synthesized discovered tested
for therapeutic value using various animal and tissue models the drug warrants further development additional studies are completed and
investigational new drug application IND submitted the FDA Once the IND becomes effective the drug may proceed the human clinical trial
phase which generally consists the following interrelated phases which may overlap
Stages Clinical Development
Market trends
Industry Standard Research ISR market research firm estimated its CRO Market Size Projections report ISR
Market Report that the size the worldwide CRO market was approximately billion and will grow CAGR billion This
growth will driven increase the amount research and development expenditure and levels clinical development outsourcing
biopharmaceutical companies
Table Contents
Increased spending
ISR estimates the ISR Market Report that expenditures biopharmaceutical companies were approximately billion and
will grow approximately per year through this amount approximately billion was spent development including billion Phase
through clinical development Growth drivers spending among biopharmaceutical companies include the need replenish lost revenues
resulting from the patent expirations large number high profile drugs recent years which has resulted the need for biopharmaceutical companies
increase their expenditures eventually fill this revenue void with new drug approvals and robust capital raising environment among
biotechnology companies believe biotechnology companies primarily use the capital fund clinical trials and due the general lack existing
infrastructure these trials are often contracted CROs expect the favorable capital raising environment will continue source strong growth for
spending
Higher outsourcing penetration
ISR estimates the ISR Market Report that approximately Phase through clinical development spend outsourced CROs
and the levels penetration are expected increase approximately believe this increase outsourcing due several factors
including the need maximize productively the increasing burden clinical trial complexity and the desire pursue simultaneous registration
multiple countries
Maximizing Productivity and Reducing Cost Productivity within the biopharmaceutical industry has declined over the past several years and
the cost developing new drug which now estimated billion per drug has significantly increased The combined impact
declining productivity and increased development costs has translated into significant pressure margins and short term earnings for
biopharmaceutical companies believe that the need for these companies maximize productivity and lower costs will lead them
increasingly partner with CROs that can improve efficiency and increase flexibility and speed across their clinical operations
Increasing Clinical Trial Complexity Over the last decade the burden clinical trial complexity has been increasingly difficult manage due
requirements from regulatory authorities worldwide for greater amounts clinical trial and safety data support the approval new drugs
and requirements for adherence increasingly complex and diverse regulations and guidelines effort minimize potential risks these
regulatory agencies also typically require greater amount post approval information and monitoring drugs the market balance the
conflicting demands growing market with the need control expenses biopharmaceutical companies partner with CROs that can
provide services designed generate high quality and timely data support regulatory approvals new drugs the reformulations
existing drugs well support post approval regulatory requirements
Simultaneous Multi Country Registration Given their desire maximize efficiency and global market penetration achieve higher potential
returns their expenditures biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly pursuing simultaneous rather than sequential regulatory new
drug submissions and approvals multiple countries However most biotechnology and small mid sized pharmaceutical companies not
possess the capability capacity simultaneously conduct large scale clinical trials more than one country addition establishing and
maintaining internal global infrastructure pursue multiple regulatory approvals different therapeutic categories and jurisdictions can
costly

Item Risk Factors
You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included this Annual Report
Form including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto The occurrence any the following risks may materially and
adversely affect our business financial condition results operations and future prospects which could turn materially affect the price our common
stock
The potential loss delay non renewal our contracts the non payment our clients for services that have performed could adversely affect our
results
routinely experience termination cancellation and non renewals contracts our clients the ordinary course business and the number
cancellations can vary significantly from year year
Most our clients for traditional project based clinical trial services can terminate our contracts without cause upon days notice For
example our cancellation percentage for traditional project based Phase through trials was for the years ended December and Our
traditional project based clients may delay terminate reduce the scope our contracts for variety reasons beyond our control including but not
limited
decisions forego terminate particular clinical trial
lack available financing budgetary limits changing priorities
actions regulatory authorities
production problems resulting shortages the drug being tested
failure the drug being tested satisfy safety requirements efficacy criteria
unexpected undesired clinical results
insufficient patient enrollment trial
insufficient investigator recruitment
decisions downsize product development portfolios
dissatisfaction with our performance including the quality data provided and our ability meet agreed upon schedules
shift business another CRO internal resources
product withdrawal following market launch
shut down our clients manufacturing facilities
addition our clients for our Strategic Solutions offerings may elect not renew our contracts for variety reasons beyond our control
including the event that are unable provide staff sufficient number experience required for project
Table Contents
the event termination our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the study but these fees may not sufficient for maintain
our profit margins and termination non renewal may result lower resource utilization rates including with respect personnel who are not able
place another client engagement
Clinical trials can costly and material portion our revenue derived from emerging biotechnology and small mid sized pharmaceutical
companies which may have limited access capital addition provide services such companies before they pay for some our services There
risk that may initiate clinical trial for client and the client subsequently becomes unwilling unable fund the completion the trial such
situation notwithstanding the client ability willingness pay for otherwise facilitate the completion the trial may legally ethically bound
complete wind down the trial our own expense
Because the contracts included our backlog can generally terminated without cause not believe that our backlog any date
necessarily meaningful predictor future results addition may not realize the full benefits our backlog contractually committed services our
clients cancel delay reduce their commitments under our contracts with them Thus the loss delay large contract the loss delay multiple
contracts could adversely affect our service revenue and profitability addition the terminability our contracts puts increased pressure our quality
control efforts since not only can our contracts terminated clients result poor performance but any such termination may also affect our ability
obtain future contracts from the client involved and others believe the risk loss delay multiple contracts even greater those cases where
are party broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies
bear financial risk underprice our fixed fee contracts overrun cost estimates and our financial results can also adversely affected failure
receive approval for change orders delays documenting change orders
Most our traditional project based Phase through contracts are fixed fee contracts bear the financial risk initially underprice our
contracts otherwise overrun our cost estimates addition contracts with our clients are subject change orders which commonly experience and
which occur when the scope work perform needs modified from that originally contemplated our contract with the client Modifications can
occur for example when there change key trial assumption parameter significant change timing change staffing needs Furthermore
are not successful converting out of scope work into change orders under our current contracts bear the cost the additional work Such
underpricing significant cost overruns delay documentation change orders could have material adverse effect our business results operations
financial condition cash flows
Our backlog may not convert service revenue the historical conversion rate
Backlog represents anticipated service revenue from contracted new business awards that either have not started are process but have not been
completed and was billion billion and billion December and respectively Our revenue conversion rate based
financial and operational analysis performed our project management teams and represents the level effort expected expended specific point
time Once work begins project revenue recognized over the duration the project Projects may terminated delayed the client delayed
regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control the extent projects are delayed the timing our revenue could affected the event that
client cancels contract generally would entitled receive payment for all services performed the cancellation date and subsequent client
authorized services related terminating the canceled project Generally however have contractual right the full amount the revenue reflected
our backlog the event contract cancellation The duration the projects included our backlog and the related revenue recognition range from
few months many years Our backlog may not indicative our future results and may not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected our
backlog number factors may affect the realization our revenue from backlog including
the size complexity and duration the projects
the cancellation delay projects and
change the scope work during the course project
Fluctuations our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that may receive small number relatively large orders any given
reporting period that may included our backlog Because these large orders our backlog that reporting period may reach levels that may not
sustained subsequent reporting periods
increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global nature there can assurance about the rate which our
backlog will convert into revenue decrease this conversion rate would mean that the rate revenue recognized contracts may slower than what
have experienced the past which could impact our service
Table Contents
revenue and results operations quarterly and annual basis The revenue recognition larger more global projects could slower than smaller
less global projects for variety reasons including but not limited extended period negotiation between the time the project awarded and
the actual execution the contract well increased timeframe for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals Additionally delayed projects will
remain backlog and will not generate revenue the rate originally expected Thus the relationship backlog realized revenues indirect and may
vary over time
Our operating margins and profitability will adversely affected are unable either achieve efficiencies our operating expenses grow
revenues rate faster than expenses
operate highly competitive environment and experience competitive pricing pressure achieve our operating margins over the last three
years have implemented initiatives control the rate growth our operating expenses will continue utilize these initiatives the future with
view offsetting these pricing pressures however cannot certain that will able achieve the efficiency gains necessary maintain grow
our operating margins that the magnitude our growth service revenue will faster than the growth our operating costs are unable grow
our service revenue faster rate than our operating costs our operating margins will adversely affected Our initiatives and any future cost initiatives
may also adversely affect they may decrease employee morale make more difficult for meet operational requirements
are unable attract suitable investigators and patients for our clinical trials our clinical development business may suffer
The recruitment investigators and patients for clinical trials essential our business Patients typically include people from the communities
which the clinical trials are conducted Our clinical development business could adversely affected are unable attract suitable and willing
investigators patients for clinical trials consistent basis For example are unable engage investigators conduct clinical trials planned
enroll sufficient patients clinical trials may need expend additional funds obtain access resources else compelled delay modify the
clinical trial plans which may result additional costs These considerations might result our being unable successfully achieve our projected
development timelines potentially even lead consider the termination ongoing clinical trials development product

Our success substantially depends the collective performance contributions and expertise our senior management team and other key
personnel including qualified management professional scientific and technical operating staff and qualified sales representatives for our contract sales
services There significant competition for qualified personnel the biopharmaceutical services industry particularly those with higher educational
degrees such medical degree equivalent degree The departure any key executive the payment increased compensation attract and

pharmaceutical industries believe are one select group CROs with the expertise and capability conduct clinical trials across major
therapeutic areas global basis Our therapeutic expertise includes areas that are among the largest pharmaceutical development and focus
particular oncology central nervous system inflammation respiratory cardiometabolic and infectious diseases believe that further differentiate
ourselves from our competitors through our investments medical informatics and clinical technologies designed enhance efficiencies improve study

the savings and may responsible for covering the cost the unused resource are unable redeploy the resource For time and material contracts
bill the client only for the actual hours spend complete the contracted scope based upon stated hourly rates position The duration our
contracts range from few months several years Revenue for services recognized only after persuasive evidence arrangement exists the sales price

contracts the Data Solutions segment either ratably earned over the contract period for subscription based services upon delivery for one time
delivery data solutions reports Revenue from time and materials contracts recognized hours are incurred Billable hours typically fluctuate during
the terms individual contracts services provide generally increase the beginning study and decrease toward the end study Revenues and
the related costs fee for service contracts are recognized the period which services are performed
the Clinical Research segment majority our contracts undergo modifications over the contract period and our contracts provide for these
modifications During the modification process recognize revenue the extent incur costs provided client acceptance and payment deemed
reasonably assured
Volume discounts are offered certain large customers based annual volume thresholds record estimate the annual volume rebate
reduction revenue throughout the period based the estimated total rebate earned for the period
Most our contracts the Clinical Research segment can terminated the client either immediately after specified period typically
days following notice the case early termination these typically contracts require payment fees earned date the fees and some cases
termination fee some portion the fees profit that could have earned under the contract had not been terminated early Based ethical
regulatory and health considerations this wind down activity may continue for several quarters years Therefore revenue recognized prior cancellation
generally does not require significant adjustment upon cancellation
Increases the estimated total direct costs complete contract without corresponding proportional increase the total contract price result
cumulative adjustment the amount revenue recognized the period the change estimate determined

obligation our clients without risk reward are not obligated either perform the service pay the investigator the event default
the client addition not pay the independent physician investigator until funds are received from the client Accordingly unlike reimbursable
out of pocket costs not recognize these investigator fees revenue
Reimbursement costs and investigator fees are not included our backlog because they are pass through costs our clients
believe that the fluctuations reimbursement costs and reimbursement revenue from period period are not meaningful our underlying
performance
Costs and Expenses
Our costs and expenses are comprised primarily our direct costs selling general and administrative costs depreciation and amortization and

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
preparing our financial statements conformity with GAAP management required make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts assets and liabilities and disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts revenues
and expenses during the reporting period Our actual results could differ from those estimates believe that the following are some the more critical
judgment areas the application our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results operations have discussed the application
these critical accounting policies with our board directors
Table Contents
Revenue Recognition
The majority our service revenue recorded regionally proportional performance basis Revenue for service recognized only after
persuasive evidence arrangement exists the sales price determinable and collectability reasonably assured measure performance compare
contract costs incurred estimated total contract costs through completion believe this the best indicator the performance the contract
obligations because the costs relate the amount labor hours incurred perform the service Direct costs are primarily comprised labor related charges
associated with the delivery services Each month accumulate costs each project and compare them the total current estimated costs determine
the proportional performance then multiply the proportion completed the contract value determine the amount revenue that can recognized
Each month review the total current estimated costs each project determine these estimates are still accurate and necessary adjust the total
estimated costs for each project During our monthly contract review process review each contract performance date current cost trends and
circumstances specific each study The original current cost estimates are reviewed and necessary the estimates are adjusted and refined reflect any
changes the anticipated performance under the study the normal course business conduct this review each month all service delivery locations
the work progresses original estimates might deemed incorrect due among other things revisions the scope work patient enrollment rate
and contract modification might negotiated with the customer cover additional costs not bear the risk costs exceeding our original estimates
Management assumes that actual costs incurred date under the contract are valid basis for estimating future costs Should management assumption
future cost trends fluctuate significantly future margins could reduced the past have had commit unanticipated resources complete projects
resulting lower margins those projects Should our actual costs exceed our estimates fixed price contracts future margins could reduced absent
our ability negotiate contract modification accumulate information each project refine our bidding process Historically the majority our
estimates and assumptions have been materially correct but these estimates might not continue accurate the future
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

arise from net operating losses tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition revenue and

Foreign Exchange Risk
Since operate global basis are exposed various foreign currency risks First our consolidated financial statements are denominated
dollars but significant portion our revenue generated the local currency our foreign subsidiaries Accordingly changes exchange rates

purposes reporting consolidated financial results hypothetical change average exchange rates used translate all foreign currencies
dollars would have impacted income loss before income taxes and equity income losses unconsolidated joint ventures approximately
million for the year ended December The process which each foreign subsidiary financial results are translated into dollars
follows income statement accounts are translated average exchange rates for the period balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated end
period exchange rates and equity accounts are translated historical exchange rates Translation the balance sheet this manner affects the
stockholders equity account referred the cumulative translation adjustment account This account exists only the foreign subsidiary dollar

significant operations countries which the economy considered highly inflationary
addition two specific risks arise from the nature the contracts enter into with our clients which from time time are denominated
currencies different than the particular subsidiary local currency These risks are generally applicable only portion the contracts executed our
foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services The first risk occurs revenue recognized for services rendered denominated currency different from
the currency which the subsidiary expenses are incurred result the subsidiary earnings can affected fluctuations exchange rates
The second risk results from the passage time between the invoicing clients under these contracts and the ultimate collection client

may not recoverable The assessment possible impairment based the Company ability recover the carrying value the asset group from the
expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges the related operations these cash flows are less than the carrying value
such asset impairment loss recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value The Company primary measure fair value
based discounted cash flows The measurement impairment requires the Company make estimates these cash flows related long lived assets
well other fair value determinations
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually more frequently event circumstance indicates that
impairment loss may have been incurred Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives over the
period which economic benefit received The Company primary finite lived intangibles are customer relationships customer backlog and acquired
databases which are amortized accelerated basis which coincides with the period economic benefit received the Company
The Company reviews the carrying value goodwill determine whether impairment may exist annual basis whenever has reason
believe goodwill may not recoverable The annual impairment test goodwill performed during the fourth quarter each fiscal year The Company
did not have impairment for any the years presented
When evaluating for impairment the Company may first perform qualitative assessment determine whether more likely than not that
reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset impaired the Company does not perform qualitative assessment determines that not more
likely than not that the fair value the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount the Company will calculate the
estimated fair value the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset The Company decision perform qualitative impairment assessment for
individual reporting unit given year influenced number factors inclusive the size the reporting unit goodwill the significance the
excess the reporting unit estimated fair value over carrying value the last quantitative assessment date the amount time between quantitative fair
value assessments and the date acquisition During part the Company annual impairment analysis the Company performed the qualitative
assessment for all its goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible asset balances
the Company does not perform qualitative assessment goodwill impairment determined the Company using two step process The first
step the goodwill impairment test used identify potential impairment comparing the fair value each reporting unit determined using various
valuation techniques with the primary technique being discounted cash flow analysis its carrying value the fair value reporting unit exceeds its
carrying amount goodwill the reporting unit considered not impaired and the second step the impairment test unnecessary the carrying amount
reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step the goodwill impairment test performed measure the amount impairment loss any The
second step the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount that goodwill the
carrying amount the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value that goodwill impairment loss recognized
Revenue Recognition
