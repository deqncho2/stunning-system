Our Market Opportunity
Every living organism has genome that contains the full set biological instructions required build and maintain life analyzing the
variations genomes genes gene activity and proteins and between organisms researchers can determine their functions and roles health and disease
improved understanding the genome and its functions allows researchers drive advancements scientific discovery they make scientific
discoveries researchers have been able translate some these findings into clinical applications that improve patient care
gene specific set instructions embedded the DNA cell For gene turned expressed the cell must first transcribe
copy its DNA sequence into molecules messenger RNA Then the cell translates the expressed information contained the RNA into proteins that
control most biological processes addition the translated RNAs there are many types non coding RNAs that are involved many cellular processes
and the control gene expression including microRNA miRNA
Biological pathways are the networks tens hundreds genes that work concert produce biological function Understanding the
activation state pathways and disruptions individual elements these pathways provides significant insight into the fundamental basis disease and
facilitates data driven treatment decisions Therapeutic interventions such drugs can used treat disease activating inactivating biological
pathways that are relevant disease result pathway based biology has become widely adopted paradigm that researchers use understand
biological processes and has assisted them the development diagnostics and drugs treat disease This particularly important cancer research and
treatment
Over the last decade methods measuring genomic information have advanced substantially However pathway based research and the
development diagnostic tests require analysis multiple genes and sensitivity small changes expression which can challenging for traditional
genomic tools both life sciences research and clinical medicine there growing need for improved technologies that can precisely and rapidly measure
the activation state hundreds genes simultaneously across large number precious samples Furthermore there untapped opportunity for
technologies capable simultaneously profiling the activity genes and related proteins which ultimately dictate biological activity
Life Sciences Research
Academic government and biopharmaceutical researchers engaged gene expression protein analysis typically focus making biological
discoveries that may lead the development relevant medical products and better informed treatment decisions for physicians and patients They have
traditionally performed gene expression experiments using microarrays quantitative polymerase chain reaction PCR and protein expression
experiments using flow cytometry mass spectrometry immunohistochemistry enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA assays More recently RNA
sequencing RNA Seq has dramatically enhanced researchers ability discover patterns gene expression that have biological meaning However
related workflows and data analysis can cumbersome and time consuming and simultaneous analysis proteins not possible Researchers are
increasingly performing analyses larger number genes and samples and are seeking new methods interrogation that would allow them
increase the number molecular targets that can analyzed simultaneously order understand the complete biological pathway
involving multiple genes

testing result the convenience local testing hospitals and medical centers increasingly viewing their laboratories profit centers and need
increase access tests for patients outside the United States believe that there opportunity improve the quality diagnosis and treatment
diseases developing and commercializing comprehensive simple and widely available diagnostic products based initially gene expression analysis
and ultimately based our Biology capability
Cancer disease generally caused genetic mutations cells The behavior cancer cells extremely complex depending the activity
many different genes and proteins often impossible for researchers identify single gene protein that adequately predicts more aggressive less
aggressive type cancer some cases researchers have been able identify more aggressive less aggressive types cancer through gene expression
analysis biological pathways enabling oncologists determine which specific treatments are most likely effective for individual patient monitor
patient response those treatments and determine the likelihood recurrence
Recently researchers the field oncology have begun demonstrate the potential harnessing patient immune system fight cancer
new class therapeutics referred generally immuno oncology drugs have begun come market with the promise long term remissions even
cures certain types cancer Unlike cancer therapeutics the past these therapeutics not target genetic abnormalities and there are typically
reliable genetic biomarkers for determining which patients are likely respond treatment The development diagnostics inform decisions regarding
treatment with immuno oncology drugs likely require analysis both RNA and proteins
addition the medical community has favored trend toward decentralized diagnostic testing Tests for HIV Hepatitis Influenza and MRSA
which were once centralized are now often conducted hospital laboratories the point care believe that this trend decentralized testing will
continue result many factors including
Convenience believe that physicians would prefer that molecular diagnostic tests performed local level and the same
laboratory that performs other tests that the physicians may order Local molecular diagnostic testing could provide physicians the same
rapid turnaround test results that they have learned expect for other types tests
Economic Advantages believe that hospitals and medical centers desire make their clinical laboratories profit centers performing
tests and billing third party payors diagnostic technologies become less complicated administer hospitals and medical centers tend
favor sourcing tests
International Availability There critical need increase access molecular diagnostic tests for patients that live outside the United
States Currently patients living outside the United States may challenged gain access tests that are provided only specialized
laboratories located within the United States believe advanced molecular diagnostic testing will become more available patients
throughout the world when can provided their local clinical laboratories
believe that these factors create opportunity for technologies like ours that can facilitate the development and use complex molecular
diagnostics potentially targeting gene mutations gene expression and protein expression with high level precision decentralized basis

Government Regulation
Medical Device Regulation
United States
the United States medical devices including vitro diagnostics are subject extensive regulation the Food and Drug Administration
FDA under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDC Act and its implementing regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations
The laws and regulations govern among other things medical device development testing labeling storage premarket clearance approval advertising
and promotion and product sales and distribution
medical device instrument apparatus implement machine contrivance implant vitro reagent other similar related article including
any component part accessory which intended for use the diagnosis disease other conditions the cure mitigation treatment
prevention disease man other animals intended affect the structure any function the body man other animals and which does not
achieve any its primary intended purposes through chemical action within the body man other animals and which not dependent upon being
metabolized for the achievement any its primary intended purposes vitro diagnostics are type medical device and are tests that can used the
diagnosis and detection diseases conditions infections including without limitation the presence certain chemicals genetic other biomarkers
Some tests are used laboratories other health professional settings and other tests are for consumers use home
Medical devices commercially distributed the United States must receive from the FDA either clearance premarket notification
premarket approval premarket approval application PMA pursuant the FDC Act prior marketing unless subject exemption
Devices deemed pose relatively low risk are placed either Class Placement device into Class generally requires the manufacturer submit
the FDA seeking clearance for commercial distribution this known the clearance process Preamendment Class III devices for which
FDA has not yet required submission PMAs are also required submit FDA Most Class devices are exempted from this premarket
requirement Devices deemed the FDA pose the greatest risk such life sustaining life supporting implantable devices and some diagnostic tests
are placed into Class III requiring PMA approval Devices deemed not substantially equivalent previously cleared device novel devices for
which predicate device exists are placed into Class III but may reclassified FDA into Class Class upon the submission the manufacturer
novo reclassification application clinical trial almost always required support PMA application novo application and many cases
required for application All clinical studies investigational devices must conducted compliance with applicable FDA Institutional
Review Board IRB regulations
Clearance Pathway obtain clearance manufacturer must submit premarket notification demonstrating the FDA
satisfaction that the proposed device substantially equivalent intended use and technological characteristics previously cleared device
device that was commercial distribution before May for which the FDA has not yet called for submission PMA applications The previously
cleared device known predicate The FDA clearance pathway usually takes from four months but can last significantly longer
particularly for novel type product
After device receives clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety effectiveness that would constitute major
change its intended use requires new clearance could require PMA approval The FDA requires each manufacturer make this determination
the first instance but the FDA can review any such decision
Table Contents
the FDA disagrees with manufacturer decision not seek new clearance the agency may require the manufacturer seek clearance
PMA approval The FDA also can require the manufacturer cease marketing and recall the modified device until clearance PMA approval
obtained
PMA Approval Pathway The PMA approval pathway requires demonstration reasonable assurance safety and effectiveness the device
the FDA satisfaction The PMA approval pathway costly lengthy and uncertain
PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also information about the device and its components regarding
among other things device design manufacturing and labeling part the PMA review the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer facilities for
compliance with Quality System Regulation QSR requirements which impose elaborate testing control documentation and other quality assurance
procedures
Upon submission the FDA determines the PMA application sufficiently complete permit substantive review and the application
accepted for filing The FDA then commences depth review the PMA application The PMA approval process typically takes one three years but
may last longer The review time often significantly extended result the FDA asking for more information clarification information already
provided The FDA also may respond with not approvable determination based deficiencies the application and require additional clinical studies
that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months even years During the review period for new type device FDA
advisory committee panel external experts likely will convened review the application and recommend the FDA whether upon what
conditions the device should approved Although the FDA not bound the advisory panel decision the panel recommendation important the
FDA overall decision making process
the FDA evaluation the PMA application favorable the FDA typically issues approvable letter requiring the applicant agreement
specific conditions such changes labeling specific additional information such submission final labeling order secure final approval
the PMA application Once the approvable letter satisfied the FDA will issue PMA for the approved indications which can more limited than those
originally sought the manufacturer The PMA can include post approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary ensure the safety and effectiveness
the device including among other things post approval studies and restrictions labeling promotion sale and distribution Failure comply with the
conditions approval can result material adverse enforcement action including the loss withdrawal the approval placement restrictions the
sale the device until the conditions are satisfied
Even after approval PMA new PMA PMA supplement may required the event modification the device its labeling its
manufacturing process Supplements PMA may require the submission the same type information required for original PMA except that the
supplement generally limited that information needed support the proposed change from the product covered the original PMA
Novo Pathway predicate can identified the product automatically classified Class III requiring PMA However the FDA can
reclassify use novo classification for device for which there was predicate device the device low moderate risk device company can
ask the FDA the outset the novo route available for its particular product When granting novo application the FDA will establish special
controls that other applicants for the same device type must implement which often includes labeling restrictions and data requirements Subsequent
applicants can rely upon the novo product predicate for clearance The novo route less burdensome than the PMA process similar
many respects but generally takes much longer for clearance than the process and almost always requires clinical data The novo route
has been used for many vitro diagnostic products
Postmarket After device placed the market numerous regulatory requirements apply These include the QSR labeling regulations the
FDA general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved off label uses registration and listing the Medical Device Reporting MDR
regulation which requires that manufacturers report the FDA their device may have caused contributed death serious injury malfunctioned
way that would likely cause contribute death serious injury the malfunction were recur and the Reports Corrections and Removals
regulation which requires manufacturers report recalls and field actions the FDA initiated reduce risk health posed the device remedy
violation the FDC Act
The FDA enforces these requirements inspection market surveillance and other means the FDA finds violation can institute wide variety
enforcement actions ranging from untitled letter public warning letter more severe sanctions such fines injunctions and civil penalties recall
seizure products operating restrictions partial suspension total shutdown production refusing requests for clearance PMA approval
new products withdrawing clearance PMA approvals already granted and criminal prosecution For additional information see the section this

Risks Related Our Business and Strategy
have incurred losses since were formed and expect incur losses the future cannot certain that will achieve sustain profitability
have incurred losses since were formed and expect incur losses the future incurred net losses million million and
million for the years ended December and respectively December had accumulated deficit
million expect that our losses will continue for least the next several years will required invest significant additional funds toward ongoing
development and commercialization our technology also expect that our operating expenses will continue increase grow our business but
there can assurance that our revenue and gross profit will increase sufficiently such that our net losses decline attain profitability the future
Our ability achieve sustain profitability based numerous factors many which are beyond our control including the market acceptance our
products future product development and our market penetration and margins may never able generate sufficient revenue achieve sustain
profitability
Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter quarter which may adversely affect our stock price
Investors should consider our business and prospects light the risks and difficulties expect encounter the new uncertain and rapidly
evolving markets which compete Because these markets are new and evolving predicting their future growth and size difficult expect that our
visibility into future sales our products including volumes prices and product mix between instruments and consumables and the amount and timing
payments pursuant collaboration agreements will continue limited and could result unexpected fluctuations our quarterly and annual operating
results
Numerous other factors many which are outside our control may cause contribute significant fluctuations our quarterly and annual
operating results These fluctuations may make financial planning and forecasting difficult For example the third quarter product and service
revenue did not meet expectations which adversely affected our stock price addition these fluctuations may result unanticipated changes our
available cash which could negatively affect our business and prospects Factors that may contribute fluctuations our operating results include many
the risks described this section Also one more such factors may cause our revenue operating expenses one period disproportionately
higher lower relative the others For example May our collaboration with Medivation Inc and Astellas Pharma Inc Astellas Pharma was
terminated resulting the recognition million collaboration revenue for the three months ended June including the impact
million termination penalty Also October Merck Inc Merck notified the decision not continue pursue regulatory approval
the companion diagnostic for their product KEYTRUDA under our collaboration resulting the recognition million collaboration revenue
during the fourth quarter Furthermore our instruments involve significant capital commitment our customers and accordingly involve
lengthy sales cycle may expend significant effort attempting make particular sale which may deferred the customer never occur
Accordingly comparing our operating results period period basis may not meaningful and investors should not rely our past results
indication our future performance such fluctuations occur our operating results deviate from our expectations the expectations securities
analysts our stock price may adversely affected

our management and our operational and financial systems and processes For example development and commercialization the Prosigna Breast Cancer
Assay Prosigna and other future diagnostic products worldwide are key elements our growth strategy and have required hire and retain additional
sales and marketing medical regulatory manufacturing and quality assurance personnel not successfully generate demand for our products
manage our anticipated expenses accordingly our operating results will harmed
Our future success dependent upon our ability expand our customer base and introduce new applications and products
Our current customer base primarily composed academic and government research laboratories biopharmaceutical companies and clinical
laboratories including physician owned laboratories that perform analyses using our nCounter Analysis Systems Our success will depend part upon our
ability increase our market penetration among all these customers and expand our market developing and marketing new research applications
new instruments and new diagnostic products During effort enhance future results have added sales staff focused consumable sales
existing customers thus enabling existing sales representatives increase focus instrument sales expect that increasing the installed base our
nCounter Analysis Systems will drive demand for our relatively high margin consumable products are not able successfully increase our installed
base nCounter Analysis Systems sales our consumable products and our margins may not meet expectations Moreover must convince physicians
and third party payors that our diagnostic products such Prosigna are cost effective obtaining information that can help inform treatment decisions and
that our nCounter Analysis Systems could enable equivalent superior approach that lessens reliance centralized laboratories Palmetto GBA
Medicare Administrative Contractor MAC that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies through its Molecular Diagnostics Services Program
MolDx issued positive coverage determination for Prosigna Several other Medicare jurisdictions that participate the MolDx program have
adopted the same coverage policy the fall Palmetto declined process Medicare claims for Prosigna tests performed physician owned
laboratories However after receiving additional information demonstrating that such labs have the same qualifications required perform Prosigna
independent labs Palmetto has agreed process such claims
also plan develop and introduce new products which would sold primarily new customer types such our Digital Spatial Profiling
DSP instrument for use pathology labs and sequencer based our Hyb Seq chemistry targeted for use hospitals and oncology clinics Attracting
new customers and introducing new applications and products requires substantial time and expense Any failure expand our existing customer base
launch new applications and products would adversely affect our ability improve our operating results
Our research business depends levels research and development spending academic and governmental research institutions and
biopharmaceutical companies reduction which could limit demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating results
the near term expect that large portion our revenue will derived from sales our nCounter Analysis Systems academic and
government research laboratories and biopharmaceutical companies worldwide for research and development applications The demand for our products will
depend part upon the research and development budgets these customers which are impacted factors beyond our control such
changes government programs such the National Institutes Health that provide funding research institutions and companies
macroeconomic conditions and the political climate
changes the regulatory environment
differences budgetary cycles
competitor product offerings pricing
market driven pressures consolidate operations and reduce costs and
market acceptance relatively new technologies such ours
addition academic governmental and other research institutions that fund research and development activities may subject stringent
budgetary constraints that could result spending reductions reduced allocations budget cutbacks which could jeopardize the ability these customers
purchase our products Our operating results may fluctuate substantially due reductions and delays research and development expenditures these
customers Any decrease our customers budgets expenditures the size scope frequency capital operating expenditures could materially
and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition

Our sales cycle lengthy and variable which makes difficult for forecast revenue and other operating results
Our sales process involves numerous interactions with multiple individuals within organization and often includes depth analysis
potential customers our products performance proof principle studies preparation extensive documentation and lengthy review process
result these factors the large capital investment required purchasing our instruments and the budget cycles our customers the time from initial
contact with customer our receipt purchase order can vary significantly and months longer With the introduction our nCounter
SPRINT system July which targeted individual researchers that often have less certain funding than other potential customers our visibility
regarding timing sales has decreased Given the length and uncertainty our sales cycle have the past experienced and likely will the future
experience fluctuations our instrument sales period period basis These factors also make difficult forecast revenue quarterly basis For
example the third quarter our actual revenues were lower than our forecasts for many reasons that did not predict including extended
timelines for finalizing purchase decisions potential customers Furthermore from time time may lease instruments place instruments under
reagent rental agreements wherein customer does not purchase instrument upfront but instead pays rental fee associated with each purchase
reagents increase instruments placed under these lease reagent rental agreements may reduce the number instruments would otherwise sell
any period addition any failure meet customer expectations could result customers choosing continue use their existing systems purchase
systems other than ours
Our reliance distributors for sales our products outside the United States and clinical laboratories for delivery Prosigna testing services
could limit prevent from selling our products and impact our revenue
have established exclusive distribution agreements for our nCounter Analysis Systems and related consumable products many countries
where not sell directly intend continue grow our business internationally and must attract additional distributors and retain
existing distributors maximize the commercial opportunity for our products There guarantee that will successful attracting retaining
desirable sales and distribution partners that will able enter into such arrangements favorable terms Distributors may not commit the necessary
resources market and sell our products the level our expectations may choose favor marketing the products our competitors current
future distributors not perform adequately are unable enter into effective arrangements with distributors particular geographic areas may
not realize long term international revenue growth
Similarly our distributors have entered into agreements with clinical laboratories globally provide Prosigna testing services not
provide testing services directly and thus are reliant these clinical laboratories actively promote and sell Prosigna testing services These clinical
laboratories may take longer than anticipated begin offering Prosigna testing services and may not commit the necessary resources market and sell
Prosigna testing services the level our expectations Furthermore intend contract with additional clinical laboratories offer Prosigna testing
services including physician owned laboratories and may unsuccessful attracting and contracting with new clinical laboratory providers current
future Prosigna testing service providers not perform adequately are unable enter into contracts with additional clinical laboratories provide
Prosigna testing services may not successful selling Prosigna and our future revenue prospects may adversely affected
Our strategy seek enter into strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties develop diagnostic tests and other products may
not successful
have relied and expect continue rely strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties for discoveries based
which develop diagnostic tests For example licensed the rights intellectual property that forms the basis Prosigna from Bioclassifier LLC which
was founded several our research customers engaged translational research Similarly connection with our collaboration with Celgene
Corporation licensed the rights intellectual property relating gene signature for lymphoma subtyping which was discovered consortium
researchers including several our research customers from the National Institutes Health connection with our collaboration with Merck develop
companion diagnostic test our partner has licensed the technology for such test intend enter into more such arrangements with our research
customers and other researchers including biopharmaceutical companies for development future diagnostic products However there assurance that
will successful doing Establishing collaborations and licensing arrangements difficult and time consuming Discussions may not lead
collaborations licenses favorable terms all the extent agree work exclusively with party given area our opportunities collaborate
with others could limited Certain parties may seek partner with companies addition connection with project This turn may limit the
commercial potential any products that are the subject such collaborations Potential collaborators licensors may elect not work with based
upon their assessment our financial regulatory commercial intellectual property position particular our customers are not obligated collaborate
with license technology and they may choose develop diagnostic products themselves collaborate with our competitors

August entered into collaboration agreement with Lam Research Corporation Lam with respect the development and
commercialization our Hyb Seq sequencing platform and related assays Pursuant the terms the collaboration agreement Lam will contribute
million payable quarterly for allowable development costs exchange Lam eligible receive certain single digit percentage royalty payments
net sales certain products and technologies developed under the collaboration agreement addition issued Lam warrant purchase
million shares our common stock The outcome this collaboration uncertain and development costs may exceed million which case
would need obtain additional funding complete development our Hyb Seq sequencing platform and related assays Ultimately the development
may not successful which would negatively impact our prospects for future revenue growth
New diagnostic product development involves lengthy and complex process and may unable commercialize timely basis all any
the tests products develop individually with our collaborators
Few research and development projects result successful commercial products and success early clinical studies often not replicated later
studies any point may abandon development product candidate may required expend considerable resources repeating clinical
studies which would adversely impact potential revenue and our expenses addition any delay product development would provide others with
additional time commercialize competing products before which turn may adversely affect our growth prospects and operating results
addition the success the development programs for any product candidates assays developed collaboration with others will dependent
the continued pursuit and success the related drug trials our collaborators For example October Merck notified their decision not
continue pursue regulatory approval the companion diagnostic were developing for their product KEYTRUDA There guarantee that our
collaborators will continue pursue clinical trials for product candidates assays that are the subject our collaborations that such clinical trials will
successful and result may expend considerable time and resources developing vitro diagnostic assays that will not gain regulatory approval
Furthermore significant consolidation the life sciences industry has occurred during the last several years and connection with such consolidation the
combined company often reassesses its development priorities which may impact our existing collaborations future opportunities For example May
Astellas Pharma announced joint decision with Pfizer Inc Pfizer discontinue the planned ENDEAR trial which was the subject our
collaboration were informed that the decision resulted from oncology portfolio review Astellas Pharma and Pfizer Even establish new
relationships our collaborators may terminate those relationships they may never result the successful development commercialization
future tests other products From time time have agreed modify the terms our agreements with collaborators including financial terms and
the future possible that will agree modify the terms existing and future agreements with collaborators
Although expect such collaborations provide funding cover our costs development the failure discontinuation modification these
clinical trials could negatively impact our ability attract new collaboration partners and would reduce our prospects for introducing new diagnostic
products revenue growth and future operating results
Our future capital needs are uncertain and may need raise additional funds the future
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with funds available under our term loan agreement and revolving credit facility
will sufficient meet our anticipated cash requirements for least the next months However may need raise substantial additional capital
expand the commercialization our products
fund our operations and
further our research and development
Our future funding requirements will depend many factors including
market acceptance our products
the cost and timing establishing additional sales marketing and distribution capabilities
revenue and cash flow derived from existing future collaborations
the cost our research and development activities
the cost and timing regulatory clearances approvals
the effect competing technological and market developments and
the extent which acquire invest businesses products and technologies including new licensing arrangements for new products

The life sciences research and diagnostic markets are highly competitive fail compete effectively our business and operating results will suffer
face significant competition the life sciences research and diagnostic markets currently compete with both established and early stage life
sciences research companies that design manufacture and market instruments and consumables for gene expression analysis single cell analysis polymerase

trend there can assurance will successful doing Any failure compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business
financial condition and operating results
Prosigna fails achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance will not generate expected revenue and our prospects may harmed
Commercialization Prosigna Europe the United States and the other jurisdictions which intend pursue regulatory approval
clearance key element our strategy Currently most oncologists seeking sophisticated gene expression analysis for diagnosing and profiling breast
cancer their patients ship tissue samples limited number centralized laboratories typically located the United States may experience
reluctance refusal the part physicians order and third party payors pay for Prosigna the results our research and clinical studies and our
sales and marketing activities relating communication these results not convey physicians and patients that Prosigna provides equivalent
better prognostic information than those centralized laboratories addition our diagnostic tests are performed pathologists local laboratories rather
than vendor remote centralized laboratory which requires educate pathologists regarding the benefits this business model and oncologists
regarding the reliability and consistency results generated locally Also offer Prosigna other countries outside the United States where genomic
testing for breast cancer not widely available and the market for such tests new The future growth the market for genomic breast cancer testing will
depend physicians acceptance such testing and the availability reimbursement for such tests
These hurdles may make difficult convince healthcare providers that tests using our technologies are appropriate options for cancer diagnostics
may equivalent superior available tests and may least cost effective alternative technologies fail successfully commercialize
Prosigna may never receive return the significant investments sales and marketing medical regulatory manufacturing and quality assurance
personnel have made and further investments intend make which would adversely affect our growth prospects operating results and financial

The development new products typically requires new scientific discoveries advancements and complex technology and engineering Such
developments may involve external suppliers and service providers making the management development projects complex and subject risks and
uncertainties regarding timing timely delivery required components services and satisfactory technical performance such components assembled

diagnostic testing November FDA issued guidance document that described FDA approach regulating molecular diagnostic instruments that
combine both approved cleared device functions and device functions for which approval clearance not required There risk that the FDA could take
enforcement action against manufacturer for distributing dual use instruments the company does not follow the restrictions discussed the guidance
document For example there could enforcement action the FDA determines that approval clearance was required for those functions for which FDA
approval clearance has not been obtained the instruments are being promoted off label There also risk that the FDA could broaden its current
regulatory enforcement dual use instruments through additional FDA oversight such products impose additional requirements upon such products
Earlier this past year FDA proposed that the clinical diagnostic portions clinical multiplex test systems like the ones used with our Prosigna assay
exempt from the requirement for FDA clearance FDA adopted the proposal July and issued new regulations exempting certain clinical multiplex
test systems from premarket notification requirements However these new regulations will not impact the FDA clearance requirements for our nCounter
Analysis System which will still require clearance for use with specific assays like Prosigna
Medicare and other third party payors the United States and foreign countries not approve reimbursement for diagnostic tests enabled our
technology the commercial success our diagnostic products would compromised
Successful commercialization our diagnostic products depends large part the availability adequate reimbursement for testing services
that our diagnostic products enable from government insurance plans managed care organizations and private insurance plans There significant
uncertainty surrounding third party reimbursement for the use tests that incorporate new technology For example after the FDA clearance Prosigna
September took over two years achieve broad Medicare reimbursement Prosigna testing
are unable obtain positive policy decisions from third party payors approving reimbursement for our tests adequate levels the commercial
success our diagnostic products would compromised and our revenue would significantly limited Even obtain reimbursement for our tests
Medicare Medicaid and private and other payors may withdraw their coverage policies cancel their contracts any time review and adjust the rate
reimbursement require payments from patients stop paying for our tests which would reduce revenue for testing services based our technology and
indirectly demand for diagnostic products addition insurers including managed care organizations well government payors such Medicare and
Medicaid have increased their efforts control the cost utilization and delivery healthcare services which may include decreased coverage reduced
reimbursement From time time Congress has considered and implemented changes the Medicare fee schedules conjunction with budgetary
legislation and pricing and payment terms including the possible requirement patient payment for Medicare beneficiaries for tests covered

labs result commercial payment amounts decline there risk that Medicare prices will fall well though PAMA limits these reductions
more than less than the prior year during calendar years and more than less during years
Reductions the reimbursement rate third party payors have also occurred and may occur the future For example September CMS
published its preliminary determinations pricing for CDLTs take effect January CMS issued proposed payment determination that would
reduce Medicare reimbursement Prosigna our customers from the current rate per test per test CMS used pricing methodology called
crosswalking pursuant which new test such Prosigna determined similar existing test and assigned the same fee schedule amount
the existing test CMS recommended crosswalking Prosigna colorectal screening test which has the lowest priced code for advanced diagnostic tests
the fee schedule despite recommendation from advisory panel that crosswalked different code successfully advocated CMS
crosswalk Prosigna the code category and restore its current reimbursement level However part its market based pricing determinations for
required PAMA CMS calculated the weighted median commercial payments for laboratory tests For Prosigna only one commercial payment rate
from single commercial laboratory was reported which was lower than the current reimbursement price CMS used that single payment amount the
weighted median which triggered automatic reduction Prosigna Medicare reimbursement rate effective January
Reductions the prices which testing services based our technology are reimbursed could have negative impact our revenue
many countries outside the United States various coverage pricing and reimbursement approvals are required Positive reimbursement
decisions for Prosigna have occurred France certain regions Spain Canada Israel Switzerland and Denmark but despite these positive developments
continue expect that will take several years establish broad coverage and reimbursement for testing services based our products with most
payors countries outside the United States and our efforts may not successful

Factors Affecting Our Performance
Instrument Installed Base
Our future financial performance will driven large part the rate sales our nCounter Analysis Systems July introduced our
new generation the nCounter Analysis System the nCounter SPRINT Profiler which has increased our addressable market making the technology more
appealing individual researchers The new system single instrument with reduced footprint that combines prep station and digital analyzer and
offered more affordable price
plan grow our system sales the coming years through other strategies including expanding our sales channel both direct and distributor
territories and continuing enhance the underlying technology and applications for both research and clinical diagnostics use part this strategy
added incremental sales territories and augmented our field sales team with greater inside sales support and continued grow our base distributors
our installed base instruments grows solicit feedback from our customers and focus our research and development efforts enabling the
nCounter Analysis System for additional applications which turn helps drive additional sales our instruments and consumables
Our sales process involves numerous interactions with multiple individuals within organization and often includes depth analysis
potential customers our products performance proof principle studies preparation extensive documentation and lengthy review process
result these factors the large capital investment required purchasing our instruments and the budget cycles our customers the time from initial
contact with customer our receipt purchase order can vary significantly and may months longer Given the length and uncertainty
our sales cycle will likely experience fluctuations our future instrument sales period period basis
December had installed base approximately nCounter Analysis Systems which count based the number
nCounter SPRINT Profilers and nCounter Digital Analyzers sold given that system may couple one analyzer with multiple nCounter Prep Stations
Management focuses instrument unit sales primary indicator current business success and leading indicator likely future sales consumables
Recurring Consumables Revenue
Our instruments are designed used only with our consumables This closed system model generates recurring revenue from each instrument
sell Management focuses recurring consumable revenue per system indicator the continuing value generated each system calculate
recurring consumables revenue per system also known pull through quarterly dividing consumables and vitro diagnostic kits revenue recognized
particular quarter other than consumables revenue related proof principle studies the total number nCounter Analysis Systems installed
the last day the immediately preceding quarter Historically large majority our systems and related consumables have been sold research customers
Our average consumables revenue per installed system was approximately for the year ended December
the installed base the nCounter Analysis Systems expands consumables revenue expected increase and over time should continue
increasingly important contributor our total revenue Our consumables revenue per system installed may fluctuate the future reflecting the mix our
installed instruments and potential shifts the mix type consumables sold our installed customer base Additionally expect Prosigna vitro
diagnostic kit revenue contribute increasing amount recurring revenue install more diagnostic systems Prosigna included important breast
cancer treatment guidelines and reimbursement third party payors becomes more broadly available and launched additional
Biology panels including our first for the measurement DNA mutations and
Table Contents
launched our panels for use breast cancer immuno oncology and hematology intend expand beyond oncology and launch nCounter
panels focused neuroscience and immune related diseases The introduction new applications has the potential further increase our consumables
revenue stream Over time believe that consumables revenue may subject less period period fluctuation than our instrument sales revenue
Revenue Mix and Gross Margin
Our product revenue derived from sales nCounter Analysis System instruments and related consumables including Prosigna vitro diagnostic
kits Generally our consumables have higher gross margins than our instruments There may fluctuations sales mix between instruments and
consumables from period period For example during our total product and service revenues increased however experienced
decline instrument sales compared This decline instrument sales was offset revenue growth from our consumables including Prosigna
vitro diagnostic kits and increased revenue from service contracts resulting from our growing installed base nCounter Analysis Systems For and
experienced increase gross margin product and service revenues primarily due increasing proportion our sales being derived from
our consumable products and other factors including improved margins consumable revenues and service revenue Although future results may vary
period period over time our installed base systems grows consumables may continue constitute larger percentage total product revenue
which would tend increase our gross margins Such gross margin increases may offset the mix consumable products sold the event
introduce new instrument product platforms that become increasing components our product sales such DSP Hyb and Seq addition both the
average selling price and manufacturing cost our instruments has decreased with the introduction the nCounter SPRINT Profiler and this trend may
continue with future generations our nCounter Analysis System For example although sold approximately more systems compared
our instrument revenue only increased This was largely due substantially increased sales lower priced SPRINT systems Future
instrument selling prices and gross margins may fluctuate grow our volume distribution partners geographies outside the United States
introduce new products and reduce our product costs and from variability the timing new product introductions
derive service revenue from service contracts which are purchased majority our customers Additionally selectively provide proof ofprinciple studies connection with prospective sales customers demonstrate the performance our nCounter Analysis System Collaboration revenue
primarily derived from our diagnostic and other collaborations with Celgene Merck Lam and historically our collaboration with Medivation and

While our mix instruments sold remained relatively consistent year over year the average price per instrument sold was impacted
greater proportion instruments being sold through distributors during for which typically record lower selling prices well lower prices

growing installed base nCounter Analysis Systems well growth various European markets vitro diagnostic kit revenue represents sales
Prosigna assays which increased more testing providers came online and testing volumes increased The increase service revenue was primarily related
increase the number instruments covered service contracts and also increases revenue generated from technology access fees data analysis
and other services related new potential customers and technologies which are under development Our product and service revenue may continue
increase future periods result our increased investments sales and marketing activities the introduction new nCounter consumable products
and the potential commercial launch our DSP and Hyb Seq product candidates
Collaboration revenue increased million due largely changes estimates related future costs associated with our
collaborations with Merck and Medivation and Astellas Our collaboration with Medivation and Astellas was terminated during the second quarter
and during the fourth quarter were notified Merck change scope associated with planned future regulatory activities Both these
events resulted decrease the total expected costs associated with the collaborations and result the completion percentage used the proportional
performance model used for revenue recognition increased substantially These changes estimates resulted acceleration revenue recognized during
