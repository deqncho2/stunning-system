Item Risk Factors
Set forth below elsewhere this Form and other documents file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
differ materially from the results contemplated the forward looking statements contained this Form note that factors set forth below
individually the aggregate may cause our actual results differ materially from expected and historical results note these factors for investors
permitted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act You should understand that not possible predict identify all such factors
Consequently you should not consider the following complete discussion all potential risks uncertainties
The outsourcing trend non clinical discovery and safety assessment stages drug discovery and development may decrease which could impair our
growth
Over the past decade pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have generally increased their outsourcing non clinical research support activities
such discovery and safety assessment While many industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend continue increase for the next several years
although with different growth rates for different phases drug discovery and development decreases such outsourcing may result diminished
growth rate the sales any one more our service lines and may adversely affect our financial condition and results operations For additional
discussion the factors that believe have recently been influencing outsourcing demand from our clients please see the section entitled Our Strategy
included elsewhere this Form
reduction research and development budgets pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business
Our clients include researchers pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies Our ability continue grow and win new business dependent large
part upon the ability and willingness the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries continue spend molecules the non clinical phases
research and development and particular discovery and safety assessment and outsource the products and services provide Fluctuations the
expenditure amounts each phase the research and development budgets these researchers and their organizations could have significant effect
the demand for our products and services Research and development budgets fluctuate due changes available resources mergers pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies spending priorities including available resources our biotechnology clients particularly those that are cash negative who may
highly focused rationing their liquid assets challenging funding environment general economic conditions and institutional budgetary policies
Available funding for biotechnology clients particular may affected the capital markets investment objectives venture capital investors and
priorities biopharmaceutical industry sponsors
Our business could adversely affected any significant decrease drug research and development expenditures pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies well academic institutions government laboratories private foundations Similarly economic factors and industry trends that affect
our clients these industries also affect their research
and development budgets and consequentially our business well Furthermore our clients particularly larger biopharmaceutical companies continue
search for ways maximize the return their investments with focus leaner research and development costs per drug candidate For additional
discussion the factors that believe have recently been influencing research and development budgets our clients please see the sections entitled Our
Strategy and Management Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition and Results Operations included elsewhere this Form
reduction delay government funding research and development may adversely affect our business
portion revenue predominantly our RMS segment derived from clients academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding
partially dependent both the level and timing funding from government sources such the National Institutes Health NIH and similar
domestic and international agencies which can difficult forecast Government funding research and development subject the political process
which inherently fluid and unpredictable Our revenue may adversely affected our clients delay purchases result uncertainties surrounding the
approval government budget proposals Also government proposals reduce eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced
allocations the NIH and other government agencies that fund research and development activities Other programs such homeland security defense
general efforts reduce the federal budget deficit could viewed the government higher priority These budgetary pressures may result
reduced allocations the future government agencies that fund research and development activities reduction government funding for the NIH
other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results Also there guarantee that NIH funding will directed
towards projects and studies that require use our products and services
Any failure comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new
regulations and guidance may result additional costs
Any failure our part comply with applicable regulations could result the termination ongoing research the disqualification data for
submission regulatory authorities This could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our operating results For example the issuance
notice objectionable observations warning from the FDA based finding material violation for GLP cGMP requirements could
materially and adversely affect our operations are found violate any applicable law other governmental regulations might subject civil
and criminal penalties damages and fines Any action against for violation these laws even successfully defend against could cause incur
significant legal expenses divert our management attention from the operation our business and damage our reputation
Regulatory monitoring authorities such the FDA Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and OECD have increased their emphasis the
management computerized systems ensure data integrity New guidance related the need for data integrity compliance programs have recently been
released and may require additional efforts for validation audit trail review and archiving activities assure that have proper regulatory oversight
over our electronic records dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices ensure that appropriate record controls are place and
that robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance addition the FDA recently applicable SEND Standardization for Exchange
Nonclinical Data standards which apply our customers NDA and December IND submissions require provide electronic data
specific formats that will allow for more efficient higher quality regulatory reviews Accordingly our customers expect timely deliver their nonclinical
data compliant with SEND Notwithstanding some these standards require additional operating and capital expenses that will impact not only and our
industry competitors but clients the biomedical research community Non compliance with any these expectations could lead official action
government authority damage our reputation and potential loss business
addition regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use laboratory animals for research purposes continue evolve
Similarly guidance has been and continues developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community both national and
international basis including transportation mandated contingency planning euthanasia guidance import and export requirements biological materials
health monitoring requirements and the use disinfectants
Contaminations our animal populations can damage our inventory harm our reputation for contaminant free production result decreased sales and
cause incur additional costs
Our research models and fertile chicken eggs must free certain infectious agents such certain viruses and bacteria because the presence these
contaminants can distort compromise the quality research results and could adversely impact human animal health The presence these infectious
agents our animal production facilities and certain service
operations could disrupt our contaminant free research model and fertile egg production well our animal services businesses including GEMS harm our
reputation for contaminant free production and result decreased sales
they occur contaminations typically require cleaning renovating disinfecting retesting and restarting production services Such clean ups result
inventory loss clean and start costs and reduced sales result lost client orders and potentially credits for prior shipments addition
microbiological contaminations the potential for genetic mix ups mis matings also exists and may require the restarting the applicable colonies While
this does not require the complete clean renovation and disinfection the room would likely result inventory loss additional start costs and
possibly reduced sales Contaminations also expose risks that clients will request compensation for damages excess our contractual
indemnification requirements There also exists risk that contaminations from models that produce may affect our client facilities with similar impact
them for which could liable for damages some cases may produce import animals carrying infectious agents capable causing disease
humans and the case such contamination undiagnosed infection there could possible risk human exposure and infection
are also subject similar contamination risks with respect our large research models While often own these models they may maintained
our behalf site operated the original provider Accordingly risk contamination may outside our control and depend the practices and
protocols third parties ensure contamination free environment contamination may require extended CDC quarantine with subsequent reduced sales
result lost client orders well the potential for complete inventory loss and disinfection the affected quarantine rooms Furthermore while
often negotiate for contractual risk indemnification may exposed the event such contaminations the third party does not fulfill its
indemnification obligation unable result insolvency other impediments
All such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult predict and could adversely impact our financial results Many our operations
are comprised complex mechanical systems which are subject periodic failure including aging fatigue Such failures are unpredictable and while
have made significant capital expenditures designed create redundancy within these mechanical systems strengthen our biosecurity improve our
operating procedures protect against such contaminations and replace impaired systems and equipment advance such events failures and
contaminations may still occur
could experience breach the confidentiality the information hold the security our computer systems
operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts client data routine element our business collect analyze
and retain substantial amounts data pertaining the non clinical studies conduct for our clients Unauthorized third parties could attempt gain entry
such computer systems for the purpose stealing data disrupting the systems believe that have taken appropriate measures protect them from
intrusion and continue improve and enhance our systems this regard but the event that our efforts are unsuccessful could suffer significant
harm Our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require keep confidential the information generated from these studies the
event the confidentiality such information was compromised could suffer significant harm
Changes government regulation practices relating the pharmaceutical biotechnology industries including potential healthcare reform could
decrease the need for the services provide
Governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly the strictly regulate the drug development process Our business involves helping
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process Accordingly many regulations and often new
regulations are expected result higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries However some
changes regulations such relaxation regulatory requirements the introduction streamlined expedited drug approval procedures
increase regulatory requirements that have difficulty satisfying that make our services less competitive could eliminate substantially reduce the
demand for our services
Although believe are currently compliance all material respects with national regional and local laws well other accepted guidance used
oversight bodies which include the USDA the standards set the International Air Transport Association the Convention International Trade
Endangered Species Wild Fauna and Flora Fish and Wildlife Service The Centers for Disease Control the Department Transportation the
Department State the office Laboratory Animal Welfare NIH the Drug Enforcement Agency well numerous other oversight agencies Canada
Europe and Asia failure comply could subject denial the right conduct business fines criminal penalties and other enforcement actions
addition regulatory authorities were mandate significant reduction safety assessment procedures which utilize laboratory animals has been
advocated certain groups certain segments our business could materially adversely affected
March the Congress enacted healthcare reform legislation the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the ACA intended over time
expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures June the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality
this legislation The Court decision allows implementation key provisions impacting drug manufacturers going forward including but not limited
expansion access health insurance coverage expansion the Medicaid program enactment industry fee pharmaceutical companies
and imposition excise tax the sale medical devices Since the law and its implementation continue face challenges Congress and federal
courts and from certain state governments opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations well from the incoming president and
his administration are uncertain the ultimate effects this legislation our business and are unable predict what legislative proposals will
adopted the future
Implementation healthcare reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can made from the
development new drugs This could adversely affect research and development expenditures pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which
could turn decrease the business opportunities available both the and abroad addition new laws regulations may create risk
liability increase our costs limit our service offerings Furthermore health insurers were change their practices with respect reimbursements for
pharmaceutical products our clients may spend less reduce their growth spending research and development
The current Executive Branch the government has disclosed key initiative being repeal substantially unwind the ACA While not
possible predict whether and when any such changes will occur changes the local state federal level may significantly impact our domestic and
foreign businesses and those our clients Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that may have material
impact our clients include but are not limited appeal reform the ACA and modifications international trade policy public company
reporting requirements environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement
Our revenue generating agreements contain termination and service reduction provisions may otherwise terminate according their term which may
result less contract revenue than anticipate
Many our agreements with both large and small clients including those which underlie our strategic relationships with some our more significant
customers provide for termination reduction scope with little notice addition sell our products and services our competitors and
similarly they sell products and services For instance have historically entered into and currently are party contracts with certain our
competitors distribute specialty research models locations where our competitors may not have distribution capabilities
Clients and competitors may elect terminate their agreements with for various reasons including
the products being tested fail satisfy safety requirements
unexpected undesired study results
production problems resulting shortages the drug being tested
client decision forego terminate particular study
establishment alternative distribution channels our competitors
the loss funding for the particular research study
general convenience counterparty preference
client competitor terminates contract with are typically entitled under the terms the contract receive revenue earned date well
certain other costs and some cases termination fees Cancellation large contract proximate delay cancellation conclusion multiple contracts
could materially adversely affect our business and therefore may adversely affect our operating results
Many our contracts are fixed price and may delayed terminated reduced scope for reasons beyond our control may under price
overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting financial losses
Many our contracts provide for services fixed price fee for service with cap basis and accordingly bear the financial risk initially underprice our contracts otherwise overrun our cost estimates addition these contracts may terminated reduced scope either immediately upon
notice Cancellations may occur for variety reasons and often the discretion the client The loss reduction scope delay large contract
the loss delay multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle receive the costs
winding down the terminated projects well all fees earned the time termination Some contracts also entitle predetermined
termination fee and irrevocably committed costs expenses
Several our product and service offerings are dependent limited source supply which interrupted could adversely affect our business
depend limited international source supply for certain products such large research models Disruptions their continued supply may arise
from health problems export import laws restrictions embargoes international trade regulations foreign government economic instability severe
weather conditions increased competition among suppliers for models disruptions the air travel system activist campaigns commercial disputes supplier
insolvency other normal course unanticipated events Any disruption supply could harm our business cannot remove the disruption are
unable secure alternative secondary supply source comparable commercial terms
are not successful selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies acquire managing our current and future divestitures our
business may suffer
During the past fifteen years have steadily expanded our business through numerous acquisitions plan continue acquire businesses and
technologies and form strategic alliances However businesses and technologies may not available terms and conditions find acceptable risk
spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition alliance partners but not completing transactions
February entered into definitive agreement acquire MPI Research non clinical CRO providing comprehensive testing services
biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide consummated this transaction will the largest acquisition nearly fifteen years Refer
Item Financial Statements and Other Supplementary Data this Annual Report Form for more details
Acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include
difficulties achieving business and financial success
difficulties and expenses incurred assimilating and integrating operations services products technologies pre existing relationships with
our customers distributors and suppliers
challenges with developing and operating new businesses including those which are materially different from our existing businesses and which
may require the development acquisition new internal capabilities and expertise
potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities acquired companies that are not covered the indemnification may obtain from the
seller the insurance acquire connection with the transaction
loss key employees
the presence absence adequate internal controls and significant fraud the financial systems acquired companies
diversion management attention from other business concerns
becoming subject more expansive regulatory environment
acquisitions could dilutive earnings the event acquisitions made through the issuance our common stock the shareholders
the acquired company dilutive the percentage ownership our existing shareholders
risks not being able overcome differences foreign business practices customs and importation regulations language and other cultural
barriers connection with the acquisition foreign companies
new technologies and products may developed which cause businesses assets acquire become less valuable and
risks that disagreements disputes with prior owners acquired business technology service product may result litigation expenses
and diversion our management attention
the event that acquired business technology alliance does not meet our expectations our results operations may adversely affected
Some the same risks exist when decide sell business site product line addition divestitures could involve additional risks including the
following
difficulties the separation operations services products and personnel
diversion management attention from other business concerns and
the need agree retain assume certain current future liabilities order complete the divestiture
continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit our businesses These and any divestitures may result significant write offs including those
related goodwill and other intangible assets which could have adverse effect our results operations and financial condition addition may
encounter difficulty finding buyers alternative exit strategies acceptable prices and terms and timely manner may not successful
managing these any other significant risks that encounter divesting business site product line and result may not achieve some all
the expected benefits the divestiture
Impairment goodwill other intangible assets may adversely impact future results operations
have intangible assets including goodwill our balance sheet due our acquisitions businesses The initial identification and valuation these
intangible assets and the determination the estimated useful lives the time acquisition involve use management judgments and estimates These
estimates are based among other factors projections cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets acquired businesses and discount rates
based analysis our weighted average cost capital adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets Disruptions global financial markets and
deterioration economic conditions could among other things impact the discount rate and other assumptions used the valuations and actual cash flows
arising from particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established the dates
acquisition and which could result impairment such assets
the future growth and operating results our business are not strong anticipated overall macroeconomic industry conditions deteriorate and our
market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used establishing the carrying value goodwill other intangible assets the extent
goodwill other intangible assets are impaired their carrying value will written down their implied fair values and charge will made our income
from continuing operations Such impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results December the carrying
amount goodwill and other intangibles our consolidated balance sheet was million
Our business subject risks relating operating internationally
significant part our revenue derived from operations outside the Our international revenue represented approximately one half our total
revenue recent years expect that international revenue will continue account for significant percentage our total revenue for the foreseeable
future There are number risks associated with our international business including
foreign currencies receive for sales and which record expenses outside the could subject unfavorable exchange rates with the
dollar and reduce the amount revenue and cash flow and increase the amount expenses that recognize and cause fluctuations
reported financial results
certain contracts particularly Canada are frequently denominated currencies other than the currency which incur expenses related
those contracts and where expenses are incurred currencies other than those which contracts are priced fluctuations the relative value
those currencies could have material adverse effect our results operations
general economic and political conditions the markets which operate
potential international conflicts including terrorist acts
exchange controls adverse tax consequences and legal restrictions the repatriation funds into the
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations including risks work stoppages and strikes well
violations local laws anti bribery laws such the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the Bribery Act and the OECD Convention
Combating Bribery Foreign Public Officials International Business Transactions
unexpected changes regulatory requirements
the difficulties compliance with wide variety foreign laws and regulations
unfavorable labor regulations foreign jurisdictions
potentially negative consequences from changes interpretations and foreign tax laws
exposure business disruption property damage due geographically unique natural disasters including within the
longer accounts receivable cycles certain foreign countries and
compliance with import requirements and other trade regulations
Changes privacy and data protection regulations could have material adverse impact our operations The General Data Protection Regulation
GDPR becomes effective May and will replace the Data Protection Directive The GDPR will impose heightened obligations businesses
that control and manage the personal data citizens The penalties for non compliance are significant including four percent global revenue
These risks individually the aggregate could have adverse effect our results operations and financial condition For example mentioned
above are subject compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti bribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their
intermediaries from making improper payments foreign government officials for the purpose obtaining retaining business While our employees
distributors and agents are required comply with these laws cannot sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect from
violations these laws despite our commitment legal compliance and corporate ethics The occurrence allegation these types risks may adversely
affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results operations
Our facilities could damaged disrupted natural disasters other catastrophic events which could adversely affect our reputation financial
position results operations and cash flows
While have taken precautions mitigate production and service interruptions our global facilities major catastrophe such hurricane tornado
earthquake flood wildfire other natural disaster other unanticipated displacement near any our facilities could result physical damage our
properties including closure resulting prolonged interruption our business disruption resulting from any one these events could cause
significant delays shipments our products reduce our capacity provide services eradicate unique manufacturing capabilities and ultimately result
the loss revenue and customers Any these factors could have material adverse effect our reputation financial position results operations and
cash flows
New technologies may developed validated and increasingly used biomedical research that could reduce demand for some our products and
services
The scientific and research communities continue explore methods develop improved cellular and animal model systems that would increase the
translation human studies and vice versa and possibly replace supplement the use traditional living animals test platforms biomedical research
Some companies have developed techniques these areas that may have scientific merit improve translation between species addition technological
improvements existing new processes such imaging and other translational biomarker technologies could result the refinement and utility for the
number animal research models necessary improve the translation from non clinical clinical studies There increasing push focus vitro
technologies such that employ human biospecimens stem cell technologies and genome editing
our strategy explore these vitro technologies refine and potentially reduce the utilization animal models these new methods become
validated For example Charles River Laboratories Cleveland Ind ChanTest Corporation has well developed program evaluate the utility
induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes advanced vitro models and organ chip technologies Successful commercialization
alternatives traditional research models may not sufficient fully offset reduced sales profits from research models addition alternative research
methods could decrease the need for future research models and may not able develop new products effectively timely manner replace any
lost sales Lastly other companies entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that produce and which may
viewed more desirable some our clients
Negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business
The products and services which provide our clients are essential the drug discovery development and manufacturing processes and significant
amount are mandated law Notwithstanding certain special interest groups categorically object
the use animals for valid research purposes Historically our core research model activities with rats mice and other rodents have not been the subject
significant animal rights media attention However research activities with animals have been the subject adverse attention including shareholder

The drug discovery development services and manufacturing support industries are highly competitive
The drug discovery non clinical development and manufacturing support services industries are highly competitive often compete for business not
only with other CROs but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours
also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for outsourced services compete variety factors including
reputation for time quality performance
reputation for regulatory compliance
expertise and experience multiple specialized areas

not compete successfully our business will suffer Increased competition might lead price and other concessions that could adversely affect our
operating results The drug discovery and development services industry has continued see trend towards consolidation particularly among the
biotechnology companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies this trend continues likely produce more
competition among the larger companies and CROs generally with respect both clients and acquisition candidates addition small specialized entities
considering entering the CRO industries will continue find lower barriers entry and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities
acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition More generally our
competitors others might develop technologies services products that are more effective commercially attractive than our current future
technologies services products that render our technologies services products less competitive obsolete competitors introduce superior
technologies services products and cannot make enhancements ours remain competitive our competitive position and turn our business
revenue and financial condition would materially and adversely affected the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness

Potential Changes and International Tax Law
December President Trump signed into law significant tax law changes Tax Reform which reduces the federal statutory tax rate
broadens the corporate tax base through the elimination reduction deductions exclusions and credits limits the ability corporations deduct
interest expense and transitions territorial tax system which will allow for the repatriation foreign earnings the with federal dividends
received deduction prospectively addition Tax Reform requires one time transitional tax foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted
earnings Several the new provisions enacted part Tax Reform require clarification and guidance from the Internal Revenue Service IRS and
Treasury Department These other changes tax laws could impact our profits effective tax rate and cash flows
have substantial operations Canada Ireland and the United Kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements receive
substantial tax credits Canada from both the Canadian federal and Quebec governments and the Any reduction the availability amount these
tax credits increase tax rates due tax law changes outcomes tax controversies could have material adverse effect our profits cash flows and
effective tax rate
Currently the OECD has developed action plan address concerns regarding base erosion and profit shifting BEPS This initiative has resulted
proposed and enacted changes tax laws various countries including France Germany Luxembourg and the Future changes tax laws
interpretation tax laws resulting from the BEPS project could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability
Contract research services create risk liability
CRO face range potential liabilities which may include
errors omissions reporting study detail non clinical studies that may lead inaccurate reports which may undermine the usefulness

Business Trends
The demand for our products and services increased fiscal year Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued intensify their use
strategic outsourcing improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they not maintain internally Many our large
biopharmaceutical clients have continued increase investments their drug discovery and early stage development efforts and have strengthened their
relationships with both CROs like Charles River and biotechnology companies assist them bringing new drugs market addition small and midsize biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength the biotechnology funding environment fiscal year from capital markets
partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies and investment venture capital Academia has also benefited from partnering activities large
biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities broaden the scope their research activities Our full service
early stage portfolio continued lead additional client discussions fiscal year regarding strategic relationships where clients seek outsource
larger portions their early stage drug research programs
The primary result these trends was improved demand for our Safety Assessment services fiscal year particularly from biotechnology clients This
improvement led increased capacity utilization our Safety Assessment facilities which remained well utilized fiscal year Price also improved
slightly fiscal year industry capacity utilization continued increase order accommodate increasing client demand continued open
small amounts new capacity fiscal year believe our scientific expertise quality and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make
the decision outsource our clients continue pursue their goal more efficient and effective drug research they are evaluating outsourcing new
areas their research programs such discovery services have enhanced our Discovery Services capabilities over the past four years enable
work with clients the earliest stages the discovery process fiscal year demand our Discovery Services business was stable The completion
few large integrated early discovery projects from biopharmaceutical clients fiscal year was largely offset with improving demand from
biotechnology clients many these clients either initiated continued work with integrated programs and other projects Large
biopharmaceutical companies continue have significant internal discovery capabilities which they can choose rely order for large
biopharmaceutical clients increasingly outsource more work must continue
demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients drug discovery processes The business changes that implemented fiscal year
including small site consolidation and realignment sales strategies our early discovery business have been successful resulting the
stabilization the business fiscal year and attracting new clients including growing base biotechnology clients Demand for our vivo
discovery services continued increase fiscal year and acquired Brains Line August enhance our position the premier singlesource provider for broad portfolio discovery CNS services addition acquired KWS BioTest Limited January enhance our discovery
expertise with complementary offerings that provide our customers with additional tools the active therapeutic research areas oncology and
immunology

Solutions business remained strong manufacturers continued increase their use our rapid microbial testing solutions Our Biologics business
continued benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion biologic drugs the pipeline and the market
support this increased demand continue expand the capacity our Biologics business
Demand for our Research Models and Services was stable fiscal year Demand for research models mature markets outside China declined
modestly partially offset improved pricing The continued effect the consolidation internal infrastructure within our large biopharmaceutical clients
and longer term trend towards more efficient use research models has led reduced demand for research models Demand for research models China
continued robust fiscal year clients this growing market continue value our high quality research models accommodate increased
demand opened new research models facility China late Demand for research models services also improved fiscal year particularly

believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used the preparation our financial statements
Revenue Recognition
recognize revenue when all the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery has occurred services have
been provided our price the customer fixed determinable and collectibility reasonably assured
Service revenue generally evidenced client contracts which range duration from few weeks few years and typically take the form agreed
upon rate per unit fixed fee arrangements Such contracts typically not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement certain study
laboratory testing results Revenue agreed upon rate per unit contracts recognized services are performed based upon rates specified the contract
cases where performance spans reporting periods revenue fixed fee contracts recognized services are performed measured the ratio outputs
performance obligations completed the total contractual outputs performance obligations provided Changes estimated effort complete the
fixed fee contract are reflected the period which the change becomes known Changes scope work are common especially under long term
contracts and generally result change contract value Once the parties have agreed the changes scope and renegotiated pricing terms the contract
value amended and revenue typically recognized described above
Most contracts are terminable the client either immediately upon notice These contracts often require payment expenses wind down the
project fees earned date some cases termination fee Such payments are included revenues when earned
recognize product revenue net allowances for estimated returns rebates and discounts when title and risk loss pass customers When sell
equipment with specified acceptance criteria assess our ability meet the acceptance criteria order determine the timing revenue recognition
defer revenue until completion customer acceptance testing are not able demonstrate the ability meet such acceptance criteria
portion our revenue from multiple element arrangements that include multiple products and services deliverables single arrangement with
each deliverable combination the deliverables representing separate unit accounting allocate revenues each element multiple element
arrangement based upon the relative selling price each deliverable Revenue allocated each deliverable then recognized when all revenue recognition
criteria are met Judgments the identification deliverables units accounting the allocation consideration the deliverable and the appropriate

Income Taxes
prepare and file income tax returns based our interpretation each jurisdiction tax laws and regulations preparing our consolidated financial
statements estimate our income tax liability each the jurisdictions which operate estimating our actual current tax expense together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment items for tax and financial reporting purposes These differences result deferred tax
assets and liabilities which are included our consolidated balance sheets Significant management judgment required assessing the realizability
our deferred tax assets performing this assessment consider whether more likely than not that some portion all the deferred tax assets will not
realized The ultimate realization deferred tax assets dependent upon the generation future taxable income during the periods which those
temporary differences become deductible making this determination under the applicable financial accounting standards are allowed consider the
scheduled reversal deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and the effects tax planning strategies the event that actual results differ
from our estimates adjust our estimates future periods and may need establish valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial
position and results operations
account for uncertain tax positions using more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions evaluate uncertain
tax positions quarterly basis and consider various factors that include but are not limited changes tax law the measurement tax positions taken
expected taken tax returns the effective settlement matters subject audit information obtained during process audit activities and changes
facts circumstances related tax position adjust the level the liability reflect any subsequent changes the relevant facts surrounding the
uncertain positions Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can relieved only the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment
the taxing authority the expiration the statute limitations the recognition the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely thannot threshold the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process consider matters effectively settled once the taxing
authority has completed all its required expected examination procedures including all appeals and administrative reviews have plans appeal

interpretations analysis and assumptions made management additional guidance that may issued the Department the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service and any updates changes estimates have utilized calculate the transition impact Therefore our accounting for the
elements Tax Reform incomplete However were able make reasonable estimates the effects Tax Reform
Prior the fourth quarter fiscal year asserted that the unremitted earnings our foreign subsidiaries were deemed indefinitely reinvested they
were required fund needs outside the result the deemed repatriation toll tax and
other effects Tax Reform enacted during the fourth quarter fiscal year have withdrawn our indefinite reinvestment assertion for all our
unremitted foreign earnings and have provided deferred taxes million for future withholding and state income taxes upon the repatriation these
earnings light the reduced incremental tax cost repatriating unremitted earnings well other effects Tax Reform have determined

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
use assumptions and estimates determining the fair value assets acquired and liabilities assumed business combination The determination
the fair value intangible assets which represent significant portion the purchase price many our acquisitions requires the use significant
judgment with regard the fair value and whether such intangibles are amortizable non amortizable and the former the period and the method
which the intangible asset will amortized utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques such the income approach and the cost approach
appropriate establishing the fair value intangible assets Typically key assumptions include projections cash flows that arise from identifiable
intangible assets acquired businesses well discount rates based analysis our weighted average cost capital adjusted for specific risks
associated with the assets
review definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication potential impairment exists such significant reduction cash flows
associated with the assets Actual cash flows arising from particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different
carrying values from those established the dates acquisition and which could result impairment such asset
During fiscal year determined that the carrying values certain DSA intangible assets were not recoverable and recorded impairment charge
million which was included costs services provided excluding amortization intangible assets
evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events occur circumstances change that may reduce the fair value
the asset below its carrying amount Events circumstances that might require interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions
economic factors unanticipated technological changes competitive activities loss key personnel and acts governments and courts Estimates
future cash flows require assumptions related revenue and operating income growth asset related expenditures working capital levels and other factors
Different assumptions from those made our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation goodwill for impairment
have the option first assess qualitative factors determine whether necessary perform the two step goodwill impairment test elect this
option and believe result the qualitative assessment that more likely than not that the carrying value goodwill not recoverable the
quantitative two step impairment test required otherwise further testing required Alternatively may elect not first assess qualitative factors
and immediately perform the quantitative two step impairment test the first step compare the fair value our reporting units their carrying values
the carrying values the net assets assigned the reporting units exceed the fair values the reporting units then the second step the impairment test
performed order determine the implied fair value our goodwill the carrying value the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value

Valuation and Impairment Long Lived Assets
Long lived assets held and used including property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events changes circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount the assets asset group may not recoverable Factors consider important which could trigger impairment
review include but are not limited the following
significant underperformance relative expected historical projected future operating results
significant negative industry economic trends
significant changes developments strategy operations that negatively affect the utilization our long lived assets

assets and the benefit obligation measure plan assets and benefit obligations the date our fiscal year end
The cost and obligations these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the
amount which cannot completely determined until the benefit payments cease Major assumptions used the accounting for these employee benefit
plans include the expected return plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates discount rate and rate increase employee compensation levels
Assumptions are determined based our data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year the plans measurement date Should any
these assumptions change they would have effect net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation
The expected long term rate return plan assets reflects the average rate earnings expected the funds invested invested provide for the
benefits included the projected benefit obligations determining the expected long term rate return plan assets consider the relative weighting
