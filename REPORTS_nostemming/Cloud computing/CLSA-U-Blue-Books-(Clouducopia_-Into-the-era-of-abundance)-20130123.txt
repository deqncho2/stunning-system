marketing departments those firms most risk from the disruption cloud
computing not simply anything the web nor does automatically imply
social networks such twitter facebook most importantly not new
word for old models outsourcing application hosting such definitions

label the old the new and are therefore not useful what need
specific definition that captures the heart what cloud computing really
delivers and differentiates from previous generations computing
simple terms cloud computing delivers computing services data storage
computation and networking users the time the location and the
quantity they wish consume with costs based only the amount
resource used
laymen terms cloud computing delivers the computing services
support business personal needs without the user having know how the
underlying physical devices and software are configured managed
cloud computing and the economics abundance
the early days the computing industry hardware resources were
extremely scarce processors had limited computational capacity the limited
size computer program memory and disk storage put severe constraints
the size and complexity computer applications the earliest network
connections could only transmit data slowly and very high cost
cost and capacity
constraints have limited
capabilities software
the cost and limited capacity these foundational components computing
infrastructure computation memory storage and network bandwidth placed
severe limits the complexity the software operating systems and
applications which ran top optimizing for these limitations meant that
software was always written targeted for the specific underlying hardware
which would run ibm produced highly optimized operating systems
dedicated specific mainframe hardware memory and storage architectures
dec did the same for its mini computers and even later generation companies
such sun microsystems followed the same model extract every last ounce
performance from their workstation and service products

unix operating system ecosystems scarcity
the era scarcity the most direct analog linux was the unix operating
system invented bell labs unix was designed generalpurpose operating system which could run many different types
underlying hardware however when hardware resources are scarce the
operating system needs tuned and optimized efficient
possible each type computer tuning unix for each different system
turned from being single general purpose operating system being

that application written run one variant unix was not guaranteed

cloud resource management model
cloud computing its simplest sense computing resource management
model method for pooling and sharing hardware infrastructure
resources massive scale finite hardware resources are shared between
competing demands giving each user the illusion exclusive control over the
underlying environment and without the user needing know anything about
how the physical resources are configured cloud computing operating

the implications for companies that built their business models the
economics scarcity are profound the cloud computing management

cloud paves the way for

oracle success database technology came through its ability provide
high levels performance and scaling resource constrained environments
when those environments ran out capacity oracle would happy sell
you very expensive dedicated hardware solutions overcome the problem

what cloud computing
first need further depth elaborate the definition and main
characteristics cloud computing including some examples
cloud computing delivers computing services data storage computation and
networking users the time the location and the quantity they
wish consume with costs based only the resources used
let unpack this definition adding characteristics and examples
cloud services provide the
illusion infinite
resources demand
users procure the amount computing they want without investing
their own infrastructure only internet connection required
cloud services provide the illusion infinite resources demand
available users regardless their size and number
physical infrastructure decoupled from applications and platforms which
allocate computing memory and storage resources without reference
underlying physical infrastructures this known virtualization note
also that the physical location decoupled between the physical location
users and the cloud datacenters
cloud services transform

cloud services transform computing from capital expense operating
expense this changes the role expenditures within the firm
providers can dynamically add remove modify hardware resources
without reconfiguring the services that depend them this major
difference from traditional datacenter outsourcing
cloud computing changes the location data processing processing
moves from the edge the network pcs and private datacenters
towards the center the network shared cloud datacenters

for providers cloud
services are competitive
propositions that differ
from utilities
for providers cloud services are competitive propositions
the competitiveness the cloud computing service provision critically depends
the providers ability build out capacity scale far greater than any
individual user firm could afford for providers cloud services are not
utilities they are competitive propositions that differ from utilities several
important ways and providers would certainly resist being regulated
utilities
first cloud providers not want offer commodities goods offering
little value add that are interchangeable with others and which compete
primarily the basis price cloud providers are competing valuebased differentiation attributes such service level and functionality
second cloud providers not enjoy inherent geographic lock users
public utility providers are granted local monopolies but cloud services are
not geographically bound therefore cloud providers face pressure create
their own service level lock mechanisms these may include proprietary
software components such platform service layer specific
characteristics tailored for vertical industry regulatory requirements
third
the actual data bits delivered cloud services are not
interchangeable the manner electrons molecules traditional
utilities the bits combine into quite different uses some which are
mission critical and some which are more casual users care great
deal about the whereabouts the bits carrying sensitive personal
mission critical corporate data but far less about the location the
constituent bits photo video
datacenters are not inherently tied specific locations close the markets
they serve other factors such real estate electricity and access
network infrastructure matter greatly siting decisions
unlike traditional utilities
cloud services are
uniquely and dynamically
configured
arguably the biggest difference between cloud services and traditional
utilities lies the degree which cloud services are uniquely and
dynamically configured the needs each application and class user
cloud services are built from common set building blocks but unlike the
electricity provider cloud providers configure them unique ways for each
specific application for example the building block configuration for global
public email system differs from airline reservation system

disruption results from decoupling business logic from the database and
infrastructure software further undermining vendor lock in

cloud computing poised major disruptor not only for companies that
are currently providers the industry but also for wide range users
for providers cloud computing commoditizes large portion computing
activity that had been offered custom basis
for users cloud computing democratizes large scale computing enabling
even the smallest users access large scale computing capacity this
creates the possibility disruptions all sorts user industries
the evolution computing paradigms
the early era computing all the layers the stacks were vertically
integrated purchasing ibm mainframe meant that you would using
ibm operating system and software they were interlocking components
system that could not broken apart
the era unbundled
vertical integration
layers began compete
the advent the era occurred with the unbundling this vertical
integration and the decoupling between software and hardware layers with
the unbundling vertical integration each layer became marketplace with
different sets competitive logic the itself fragmented into its
constituent components such memory processors and hard disks linked
standard interfaces competition developed each the components
and value moved away from the final assembly which became increasingly
commoditized processors which intel dominated became the area within
the physical infrastructure that retained value
the era wintelism
commoditized everything
else
the decoupling between software and hardware occurred new logic
competition took hold the operating system microsoft windows emerging
its own platform layer platform windows provided common set
application protocol interfaces apis that freed software providers from
writing the code control specific basic hardware functions such
accessing memory and storage file systems the software would work any
machine that would run windows regardless who made the components
the underlying long had intel processor and could run
windows windows quickly became dominant following the principle
positive feedback loop which the more users adopted windows the more
valuable became platform for future users
the vertically unbundled and software hardware decoupled era
microsoft and intel captured disproportionate amount value from the
rapidly commoditizing pcs microsoft licensed windows and built
ecosystem software application that required windows function and
within the although almost all other components could assembled from
any number manufacturers the intel processor architecture was necessary

run windows enabling intel avoid commoditization well have
called this era wintelism since much the value has been captured
windows and intel with everything else rapidly commoditizing
unbundling vertically
integrated systems
allowed the software
industry emerge
major outgrowth the unbundling vertically integrated systems was the
emergence software discrete industry independent from hardware
microsoft prevailed over independent competitors personal productivity
applications such lotus and wordperfect integrating disparate
spreadsheets and word processing applications into suite notable that
the independent competitors that failed also lacked the leverage that
offered microsoft
despite the failures alternative and productivity application providers
sustain meaningful share against dominant microsoft note that the
software industry has seen independent application and infrastructure
companies prosper and thrive scale the heyday the wintelist era from
the mid through the late coincided with the time that apple was
reduced niche player apple did not decouple its hardware and operating
system and became increasingly reliant microsoft productivity suite
the its comeback from the late after steve jobs returned
however was fueled its control over both hardware and operating
systems
one path for escaping
commoditization was
high end enterprise class
solutions
consequence
client server then multitier architecture was
growing complexity
high end custom path escape commoditization
corporate computing quickly moved embrace commoditized wintel pcs
one path escape commoditization was provide high end large
enterprise size solutions that provided custom functionality ibm was the
most notable firm evolve into this form selling its hardware bundling
with the services delivered shift from selling hardware servers with
built functionality integrators found value vertically integrating the
different layers the stacks infrastructure platforms and applications
custom package for the user firm charging millions dollars upfront for
implementation they were therefore responsible for building and operating
corporate datacenters with the corporate applications provide functionality
consequence the rise client server then multi tier architecture was
the growing complexity and overwhelming plethora choices facing business
users every layer the stack database middleware application
server and application vibrant competition helped reinforce the prima facie
appeal best breed strategy that integrators possessed the
specialized insight and expertise necessary source and implement key
software projects drove massive expenditures for customized solutions

integrated and optimized with database and subsequently middleware and
analytics tools these systems were initially targeted general purpose
database and hardware system support both transactional applications and
data warehousing scenarios over time the company strategy reflected

disrupting the infrastructure layer
let take the infrastructure layer which encompasses networking storage
servers and software for management and security will start with servers
firms offering high end high performance servers such sun microsystems
were once the darlings silicon valley their fast and powerful servers gave
users requiring massive computing power competitive edge however with
the advent cloud computing there much less advantage for users buy
individual high performance machines with high price premiums
google was the first paradigm shifter using cheap off the shelf computers
rather than high end servers build datacenters its approach was that
higher hardware failure rates could built into the parameters its
software design with the ability for databases and other tasks
distributed among large numbers physical hardware unaffected failures
particular hardware performance came from the algorithms for distributing
the tasks rather than the performance the hardware itself this approach

cisco also facing threats networking hardware becomes commoditized
investment building out the internet took off the mid cisco
systems became enormously successful providing networking equipment
dominated global markets for internet backbone equipment and was
strong presence large corporate networking solutions the physical need
for routers connect datacenters servers and machines each other and
the internet gave cisco and its competitor juniper networks opportunities

cheaper commodity

both proprietary server

recently cisco under unprecedented level pressure because its highend networking infrastructure solutions are increasingly achievable through
software vmware acquisition nicira software defined networking
technology raised concerns that networking routers and switches could face
disruption analogous the impact virtualization the server market the
parallels are not exact however under utilization and overcapacity nonvirtualized servers were prime target for cost reduction nonetheless cheaper
commodity hardware can replace both proprietary server and network

networking solution through software importantly far lower price
management capabilities
evolve the stack
commoditizing
components
value moves from infrastructure the platform
management functions within software are increasingly migrating the
platform rather than being encapsulated individual components
datacenters whether storage networking databases this drives
commoditization the components
take databases for example which the simplest level are comprised the
database itself business logic that manages the database and the user
experience these three used integrally tied together oracle for
example its offerings does not let you decouple oracle financials from
oracle database oracle therefore embedding great deal management
logic into its database offerings
cloud reduces ways
lock customers
january
cloud platforms accelerate commoditization the database
however with the advent cloud based platforms rapidly becoming
possible procure just pure database offering without any management
logic embedded the database the management logic taken care
the platform level managed through open api the database from the
user vantage you can manage multiple resources through the platform
with multiple components open the api level control from the platform
therefore user you want standalone components that can mixed and
matched with the possibility migration from one another your financial
system will not coupled with particular storage engine and either can
moved new provider from the perspective the providers this
increases the pressures commoditization since there are far fewer ways
lock customers their offering

stored procedures are
what lock users into
particular databases
eroding stored procedures role vendor lock
current business reality businesses all layers have some business
logic each layer including the lower layers such stored procedures
databases but these stored procedures are what lock users into particular
databases the initial rationale for such stored procedures was for
performance optimization and security however performance now
optimized the cloud computing economics abundance which you can
simply allocate more computing resources rather than pursue customized
performance database

cutting edge lead users that are adopting cloud computing solutions

new uses technology lead the disruption
disruptions are about the

users and their new uses
the broader point that need make here that disruptions are almost
never just about the introduction new technologies equipment rather
they are about the experimentation lead users and the new uses which
they put the new technologies
took almost years
for electrification yield
major productivity gains
for example the case electricity took almost years for
electrification yield major productivity gains this was because the factories
were initially set according the logic steam engines the machines
were connected centrally located steam engine with system belts
the first electronic motors simply replaced the steam engine only after the
factories were reconfigured with machines placed according the logic
production rather than the previous logic steam power did productivity
gains skyrocket
cloud computing the
industrialization
likewise the earliest computers were simply replacements for calculators
only after innovative lead users installed them solve one set problems performing large numbers calculations quickly did they discover new
uses airlines for example installed them handle reservation systems but
then discovered they could manage and adjust routes based reservation
information with the advent databases computers transformed from
powerful calculators what if machines that could calculate probabilities

cloud service providers winning the user
for cloud service providers there are few big questions that will shape the
industry global scale
will global scale dominate there room for firms that principally offer
local and more limited local deployments
will provider strategies limited where they started
the answers these questions are not simply matter market dynamics
they also involve government policies that differ significantly around the world
scale offers advantages point
major question for the cloud provider industry whether the logic global
scale will dominate whether there room for local scale players carve
out sustained market shares
only handful
companies can spend
datacenters
first glance seems obvious yes global scale will prevail only handful
companies can invest numerous datacenters that exceed million
per datacenter google and microsoft are also aggressively purchasing
physical networks enhance their services and lower operating costs the
degree which they can provide the illusion infinite resources for instant
scalability and offer platforms that take advantage their databases storage
and other resources cannot matched smaller players
country regulatory
requirements may benefit
smaller local players
however when taking into consideration the importance regulatory
requirements and structures around the world along with the fact that the
largest global cloud providers are american firms the answer becomes less
january
clsau
section battle lines square off
blue books
obvious regulatory structures may provide room for smaller players with
national regional deployments the very nature global cloud services
which the location data not inherently related national borders
provides potentially strong disincentives for users particularly large
corporate and government users from putting data them
government
regulations can challenge
global cloud providers
the specter the patriot act which allows the government access
not only data that pass through the usa but also all data owned all
multinational companies with presence create serious concerns data
held amazon google and microsoft for example could seized
government concerned terrorist threats indeed the quick response
amazon jettison wikileaks from using its storage service was likely
attempt avoid potential government seizure some its data
data storage regulations
particularly europe
can provide room for
local providers
regulations particularly europe stipulating that certain types data must
stored domestically can provide room for local storage providers some
cases for large corporate users the slogan our data are subject the
patriot act may enough win particular market niche
local regional players
are unlikely have the
capabilities move into
areas higher value
the challenge for local regional players however that they are unlikely
have the capabilities for moving into areas higher value namely
platforms yet even though they face pressures for commoditization the
regulatory structures stipulating that certain types data functions remain
the domestic market corporate preferences keep particular functions
and data within national borders will protect them from pure commodity
price competition against the global scale providers
deutsche telekom for example marketed its cloud storage service being
free from the patriot act and therefore more secure for large enterprises
japan ntt data also provides the datacenters store the key databases for
large users salesforce com services platform such japan post the
postal service
one can pose this question the other way around does the fact that globalscale cloud providers operate global scale limit their ability serve
particular reasonably large markets this would imply that the logic global
cloud services provision not worldwide winner takes all market that
the benefits from low cost achieved economies scale would only reach
certain point before tapering off would allow myriad local smaller
players with offerings tailored local regulatory and possibly social and
political conditions carve sustained niches given the disruptions
existing players business models brought the cloud the question who
will the incumbent players such telcos and systems integrators that
successfully carve this niche and which niche will for example some
may specialize healthcare data storage and analytical tools while others
focus finance serving the government
the past few years court cases revealed some concerns for example the fbi used the stored
communications act access person email without warrant his consent and the court was
unable determine whether they were subject any expectation privacy another event the fbi
raided and seized servers from two texas datacenters with search and seizure warrants for wide range
equipment however included the equipment seized were servers that had data large number
clients unrelated the investigation the district court sided with the fbi major question whether
the fourth amendment which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures applied data held
cloud providers this has yet directly tested courts see james urquhart does the fourth
amendment cover the cloud wisdom the clouds david couillard defogging the

blue books
telcos pursue strategies outrun commoditization
the major telecom firms however are not simply sitting back die slowly
their challenges are likely come from regulatory strategies utilizing their
long history working closely with governments and many countries
their origins state owned monopolies
political debates over network neutrality various countries are prime
example cloud providers argue for equal treatment all bits flowing through
network providers networks but this commoditizes the latter network
providers argue for deregulation enabling differential tariffs service levels

access devices the device wars
today access devices derive their lineage from computing equipment and
they have become intensely competitive battleground winners will not
only define end user experiences but may also shape the nature and success

similar competitive battles the infrastructure layer over operating
systems processors and hardware the platform layer for developers and
the application layer for end user loyalty

handsets were rapidly becoming commoditized the mid with new

central processing units cpus unfolding unlike pcs intel the
underdog against multiple vendors producing processors based arm

arms suppliers face
commoditization with
software replacing
hardware functions
the core challenge facing arms suppliers the providers equipment for
cloud service providers that their functionality rapidly being
commoditized often with software solutions replacing and exceeding the kind
performance previously only attainable through high end hardware there
has been wave capital spending build out cloud computing
infrastructure over the past few years and this expected continue for the
medium term this has benefited holders industrial real estate particularly
rural areas near sources cheap power other direct beneficiaries have
included providers networking equipment servers virtualization and opensource software the industrialization datacenters commoditizes
foundational technology from the bottom the urgency expanding
capacity partly the result the explosive growth internet connected
smartphones and tablets which gain significant power from linkage the
cloud
servers are becoming
commodities
high end unix servers have been the first give way commodity
server farms google which built its datacenters from off the shelf parts
the paradigmatic example servers are therefore becoming commodities why
invest high end servers when you can get the same better
functionality deploying cloud architecture for less powerful
machines why not just buy however much capacity you need when you
need accessing cloud provider that uses hundreds thousands
machines their cloud datacenters
why invest high end cisco juniper network equipment when the same
functionality can provided through level software for far lower price
why invest oracle system that contains management logic the
database that prevents you from separating out different functions when you
can put together database from storage from etc
even the design
datacenters and servers
being open sourced
and shared
cloud computing infrastructure disruptive several levels virtualization
improves hardware utilization and decouples workloads from physical
hardware free open source software foundational the cloud often
supplanting expensive proprietary software even the design datacenters
and servers being open sourced and shared facebook has opened its
designs through opencompute org where its cloud computing peers and
enterprises can freely benefit from best practices
it notable that leading
cloud technologies are
mostly open source
notable aspect the evolution cloud stacks the software that enables
infrastructure service that leading technologies are mostly open
source openstack consortium roughly vendors spearheaded
rackspace cloudstack purchased citrix and open sourced the apache
foundation eucalpytus and amazon elastic beanstalk are open source
vmware remains the proprietary enterprise standard for cloud infrastructure
who does the cloud disrupt

intel high margin and highly profitable market for server processors
currently under serious threat from the arm processor architecture with
microsoft decision create version windows designed run arm
the wintel era may ending era armdows may dawning for
years manufacturing semiconductor chips has been moving towards
commodification the most significant threat intel has been that its
processor architectures would become commoditized this was the threat
faced amd emerged viable competitor
for intel linux emerged additional and even potentially alternative
platform microsoft significant merit was that linux was potentially
controllable intel since was not under the control any single player
this was not popular move with microsoft which began focusing more and
more arm
arm dominates tablet offerings from almost all device providers and intel
has not been powerhouse this segment low margin low power highvolume chips intel most profitable business comes from its high end
server targeted processors for which charges high premium leverages
volume economics and rode microsoft growth enterprise software
business its competitors such sun sparc and ibm power series were
killed off
the server market the wintel combination intel processors and
microsoft windows server stack continues dominant idc reports that
the third quarter intel servers running microsoft windows server
operating system accounted for overall quarterly factory revenue the
runner linux was
low power highly
efficient arm based
servers could power cloud
datacenters
however the question what happens when arm efforts optimize
processor design for server applications hits stride all likelihood with the
windows server team engaged the process when these efforts mature and
are combined with major shift enterprise scale computing towards cloud
computing are likely see new generation low power highly
efficient arm based servers power many the cloud datacenters
microsoft worldview they will running some version microsoft
operating system this will lead intel worst nightmare squeeze
between the low end high volume low margin arm based processors and
very attractive arm based value proposition for high end demand
traditional middle market pcs will rapidly get commoditized more powerful
low end devices and intel will left without the high volumes margins
continue the high end
intel challenge moving
forward will avoid
this worst case scenario

however with the growth cloud datacenters and network virtualization
facing serious commoditization challenge
cisco faces challenges
from cloud datacenters
that forgo premium
network equipment
cisco began facing major challenge when the billion plus datacenters
built the global cloud providers did not deploy premium cisco network
equipment google for example built its own using chips from fulcrum later
bought intel broadcom bought lower cost hardware from companies
such arista networks more firms choose rely ever more heavily
external cloud computing providers cisco will left out the most rapidly
growing portion datacenter traffic short high end network equipment
with intelligence embedded the hardware and offering performance for
significant premium will have far less market presence
network virtualization the second major force commodifying cisco
premium offerings now just physical server infrastructure was virtualized
into iaas offerings physical network infrastructure being virtualized with
offerings such nicira network virtualization platform logical networking
being decoupled from the physical networks performance attributes
traditionally attained through hardware solutions are increasingly achieved
