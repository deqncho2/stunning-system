drives improved outlook 
our latest alphawise cio survey sees improving 
environment driven europe software and services both 
see significant uptick and leading indicators continue 
skewed the upside see the survey most positive for 
sap sophos and remain overweight both 
broad based improvement spending expectations our latest cio 
survey sees spending growing improving from the seen 
our april survey this places current expectations ahead the growth 
have seen since geographically the improvement was driven the 
picking from low base and the maintaining expectations for growth 
sector wise software and services both saw meaningful improvements 
growth europe bounces back spending expected grow 
the line with growth expected the last survey the 
outlook europe recovered this survey with european cios expecting 
growth from growth april however this still slowdown 
the growth the picture better the where the expected for 
ahead the growth cios saw improving outlook 
europe clear positive for our coverage and fits with the better macro 
economic environment and declining political uncertainty now higher 
expectations are baked our leading indicators moderated slightly but potential 
budget revisions retain upward skew head into 
software growth returns trend cios raised software growth 
expectations from april june returning software 
trend growth digging deeper our survey suggests crm and saas more 
broadly will drive spending with sap best positioned here think cios 
continue see little impact spending sap from the shift public cloud 
services improvement continues helped cloud and cios revised 
their services expectations growth from april addition 
twice many cios currently expect overspending underspending 
services budgets leaving the potential for further acceleration growth 
cios identify next gen cloud applications and consulting systems 
applications the most likely benefit from increased spending therefore 
view these results positive for capgemini our coverage 
cloud security and analytics remain key focus areas positive for sap 
sophos there was major change top priorities for cios cloud security 
analytics have regularly featured the top this list see cloud 
analytics strength positive for sap which now has meaningful exposure 
both areas while the security spend priority positive for sophos
