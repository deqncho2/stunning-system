public cloud china takes off 
gauge the growth potential china public cloud market 
and analyze the competitive landscape alibaba our top play 
this segment given alicloud leadership think domestic 
players have edge amid information security concerns 
despite heated competition the near term 
how big the market potential low adoption now with ample room for 
growth the public cloud market china reached making 
merely the global market this well below the global value share 
for china other tech products pcs smartphones and servers implying low 
public cloud adoption our estimate nonetheless china set for wider 
adoption public cloud given government support vendors improving product 
quality and fast cost reduction and rising demand for new technology big 
data iot project that china public cloud market may reach 
cagr reaching global share with public cloud 
penetration rising 
who are the players alicloud leads heated competition china identify six 
groups domestic internet giants alibaba tencent baidu global leaders 
amazon web services aws microsoft azure google ibm telcos china 
telecom hardware vendors huawei lenovo inspur vertical players 
kingsoft cloud startups qingcloud ucloud estimate that alicloud had 
market share china with information security concerns 
tailwind despite global leaders technology edge price competition may intensify 
with huawei recently joining the crowd however public cloud scale business 
see virtuous cycle between scale and price cuts alicloud has begun 
show this cycle featured aws helping solidify its leadership china 
public cloud profitable business china believe but cost structure 
different believe public cloud services china could lower priced 
the owing different competitive landscape however the cost china 
could also lower because hardware utilities and network costs making 
total costs data center should lower than those the 
believe server costs china are among the lowest globally server 
shipments now come from domestic suppliers alicloud sales hit 
nearly breaking even and forecast rise more than 
based critical level aws opm was with sales 
alibaba our top pick china public cloud market alicloud aims not only for 
china but also globally expands along with alibaba ecommerce empire 
but aws still leads technology and richer ecosystem serve large 
enterprises expect alicloud make alibaba sales 
thus alicloud becomes material profit driver see upside risk 
our price target our base case assume stays near breakeven

how big china public cloud market 
china public cloud market overview 
the public cloud market china reached around revenue 
according idc making merely the global market close 
curbed low adoption this also compares with idc estimate that 
the public cloud market accounted for about two thirds the global public 
cloud market china global market share well below that china other 
tech products such pcs smartphones and also servers which accounted for the global market value this suggests that its public cloud adoption just 
beginning and the server utilization rate china should relatively low 
nonetheless represents ample room grow from low base

reasons for the current low adoption public cloud china 
estimate that public cloud adoption china just about take off current 
adoption rate only single digits attribute this 
china higher gearing government and state owned enterprises there 
information security the top priority whereas public cloud key value 
propositions are cost efficiency and scalability government spending made 
china gdp according the ministry finance 
enterprises general concerns over security and virtual services 
lack internal support large enterprises and smes this has been improving 
though 
however expect public cloud adoption rise substantially china supported 
government policy push 
more emphasis from government entities and non government enterprises 
cloud computing core strength and 
improving product offering and accelerating asp decline among domestic suppliers 
such alicloud tencent foreign rivals and more recently huawei 
most importantly cloud adoption customers china have expanded from early 
adopters commerce gaming mobile apps and video platform suppliers that could 
benefit from the cost edge and scalability public cloud adoption government 
entities that are gradually moving data with low sensitivity the public cloud and 
various traditional industries such the financial and manufacturing segments 
gauging the growth potential the public cloud market china 
the public cloud market china still nascent how forecast the market growth 
potential may represent challenge given the lack data thus third party forecasts

who are the players china public cloud market 
estimate that alicloud will remain the largest public cloud service provider 
china given its early mover advantage scale benefits and domestic edge with 
information security tailwind estimate that commanded market 
share whereas foreign cloud computing suppliers amazon aws and 
microsoft azure and other local players china telecom tencent and kingsoft 
each held single digit low teens market shares china because the 
regulations china foreign cloud computing suppliers would have form 
partnerships with local vendors several licenses are required operate public 
cloud business regulatory scrutiny has hindered the development foreign 
rivals allowing local vendors enjoy early advantage despite global leaders 
leadership technology and cloud ecosystems 
identify six groups cloud players china alicloud the current leader 
china public cloud market with share terms revenue 
believe foreign public cloud leaders aws and azure are alibaba key rivals 
especially because they are targeting the global public cloud market not just 
china nonetheless the competition with local rivals started intensify 
tencent sped investments and huawei recently joined the game with 
target surpassing alicloud three years alibaba well ahead domestic 
peers terms scale product portfolio and customer reach given its early 
mover advantage starting from whereas global leaders aws and 
azure have not yet made material impact china owing local regulatory 
constraints 
six groups public cloud vendors china 
domestic internet giants alibaba tencent baidu alibaba the forerunner the 
public cloud business china its venture started elaborate more 
alicloud operation the following section 
tencent started enhance its cloud presence since early upgrading its cloud 
brand with focus its strategies namely speed stability and security the same 
time also actively incubating cloud usage scenarios such mini program new 
function embedded wechat within its ecosystem tencent currently ranked the 
top the public cloud market china terms revenues 
latecomer the cloud market among the bat trio baidu rebranded its cloud 
business october officially tap into the public cloud business different from 
alibaba and tencent besides traditional cloud services baidu also advocates its cloud 
capabilities digital marketing and artificial intelligence providing customized services 
and products cater specialized customer demand 
global leaders aws azure and ibm aws partners with sinnet and azure cooperates 
with because foreign rivals are required obtain several licenses operate 
public cloud business china however their scale china remains small given 
regulatory constraints despite their high market share globally nonetheless both have 
started accelerate investments view the growth potential china public cloud 
market ibm recently signed agreement with wanda bring ibm cloud china 
through the new wanda cloud company march public cloud leaders have 
many edges over alicloud technology and cloud ecosystems given their extensive

public cloud profitable business china 
amazon aws has proven very lucrative business with both sales and 
margin expanding quickly until now the question has been whether the public 
cloud market china also represents profitable market for public cloud service 
providers observe that the pricing public cloud services china lower 
that the but the cost for domestic players operate public cloud 
business could lower well 
our study thus concludes that see good potential for the public cloud market 
become very profitable china given the ample room for growth despite 
different cost structure the public cloud service providers the 
pricing public cloud services china lower that the 
conducted price comparison standardized elastic computing products both 
the domestic and overseas markets found that the domestic players china 
generally set lower price for their elastic computing products compared the 
peers such amazon cloud and azure given their competitive cost structure and 
aggressive price cuts the recent years among the domestic players see that the 
prices services offered big players such alicloud tencent cloud and baidu 
cloud more competitive than those the smaller players such ucloud and 
qingcloud that likely because scale benefits and aggressive pricing strategies

first terms the hardware costs servers storage and switches are the key items 
the chinese public cloud vendors mainly source from local chinese vendors which tend 
price more competively than their global peers take servers for example the four 
leading domestic server makers huawei lenovo inspur and dawning made 
the server shipment market share china and dell aggregate 
market share addition the server customers are highly concentrated top 
internet giants like alibaba tencent and baidu which weakens the bargaining power 
the server vendors the margin servers china thin that some server odms 
taiwan even chose reduce exposure the server market china 
second terms the bandwidth costs the bat companies all have close 
relationship with the telcos china which believe will help get more competitive 
pricing 
last terms utility costs for industrial electricity usage the average price china 
per kwh which much lower than cents per kwh the 
alicloud aws 
believe that alicloud with its domestic advantage well positioned follow 
path similar that aws the become mega enterprise vendor 
china posing competitive challenge the traditional enterprise suppliers 
especially hardware servers storage and networking 
aws contributed more than amazon operating profit given not 
only strong sales growth but also margin expansion addition alicloud currently 
mainly provides iaas which mostly hardware related services whereas our 
team expects aws address larger market spreading from hardware 
software and soon services 
therefore view aws success very encouraging for alicloud which 
poised replicate this model china given information security concerns 
tailwind for alicloud china 
sales growth and margin comparison 
alicloud sales were still much smaller than aws 
however this scale alicloud reported marginal loss came close 
breaking even estimate that alicloud about five six years behind

pricing strategy comparison virtuous cycle between scale and price cuts key 
alicloud has begun experience the virtuous cycle between scale and price that aws 
business dynamic features price cuts bring more users which bring greater economies 
scale that can passed through further price cuts the price leadership 
alicloud will reward with faster growth and thus bigger scale secure its current 
leadership and raise barriers entry against potential rivals scale important 
enables the lowest marginal cost delivery and the most aggressive pricing 
alicloud announced price cuts for three year contract for its basic 
services mid october its cloud event did multiple price cuts and 
announced price cuts aws has already gone through period 
frequent price cuts with the frequency now slowing while the pace its innovations 
has picked recent years

much wider and more complete product offering and richer ecosystem serve large 
enterprise customers estimate that alicloud lags aws terms revenue scale 
years however believe that alicloud likely retain its current leadership
