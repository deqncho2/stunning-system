reiterate our overweight alibaba with price target our view 
supported our outlook for sales cagr and non gaap net profit cagr 
based our assumptions that core commerce business remains the key 
profit driver while continues leverage these profits invest new strategic 
initiatives thus conservatively assume the non gaap ebitda margin will decline 
from with stable core commerce margin partially 
offset investments content and lesser extent cloud 
expect alibaba outperform its internet competitors under our coverage because 
sustained core commerce growth reinvents the traditional commerce 
platform contributions from non commerce are becoming material cloud 
while most other domestic rivals are not yet able expand into meaningful new 
businesses and undemanding valuation trading our non gaap eps 
risks our call regulatory risks for alibaba and affiliates geopolitical risks and 
macro slowdown china expect alibaba outperform peers but susceptible 
overall macro conditions albeit smaller degree than peers because 
developing businesses other than commerce the alicloud business should 
countercyclical because public cloud adoption should accelerate amid economic 
slowdown due better cost savings 
alibaba empowering data believe that alibaba the early stages unlocking 
the value from what view its most valuable asset rich database that continues 
accumulate from its well controlled and extensive closed loop ecosystem through 
advancements data technology alibaba aims help merchants improve their 
efficiency all their revenue and cost expense items view alibaba more 
than commerce company its businesses range from core commerce 
taobao tmall financing ant financial cloud computing alicloud logistics and 
others 
core commerce business evolving through data technology requiring adaptive 
approach for performance evaluation alibaba transforming from distribution 
platform marketing platform thus alibaba online marketing service revenue sales 
growth outshined commission growth and expect this trend continue 
project that the company online marketing service revenue cagr will reach 
versus for commission revenue project alibaba core commerce sales 
will deliver cagr 
alicloud this business emerging enterprise leader china that could 
challenge traditional hardware and potentially software suppliers our view alicloud 
well positioned china aws like provider because alibaba has clear edge 
scale china largest commerce player has high house demand for cloud 
computing and such should able increase scalability providing public 
cloud services the robust expansion the double event has proved the capability 
its cloud system data security concerns should enable domestic competitors 
enjoy edge over foreign cloud suppliers and expanding product offerings from 
iaas saas 
alibaba the price setter for public cloud services china which vital its success 
our view believe can remain the industry leader thriving virtuous cycle 
between price cuts and the rising scale public cloud services price cuts would not 
necessarily result lower margins the cuts reflect cost benefits from scale merits 
and turn more customer wins public cloud adoption remains low china 
enterprise spending size based our estimate but believe that success 
alicloud could challenge china enterprise vendors note that aws 
disruption vendors started the hardware segment six years ago now spreading 
software and likely spread soon the service realm according our 
team 
ant financial innovating china financial market noted alipay unit ant 
financial has become china largest third party payment service provider with

driver and the rest the investment stage 
see upside risk our price target from alicloud our forecasts continue assume 
that alicloud will stay its current profitability level small loss with ebita 
margin close breakeven however alicloud were become material profit 
driver building critical scale over then believe that could deliver 
least single digit opm given its scale and operating leverage this scenario project
