projecting typical technology adoption cycle for public cloud suggests most current valuations are fair our detailed framework analyzing the growth and profitability trends the cloud businesses leaders

ibm cloud undervalued even base case raising ibm 
transforming cloud platform expect its public cloud 
business grow cagr with gross and operating margins expanding industry average this may prove conservative cognitive services like watson and blockchain deliver but even

are pricing for the major public cloud vendors our detailed framework for analyzing the public cloud 
market and the cloud businesses amazon microsoft alphabet ibm oracle sap and alibaba leads

typical curve adoption pattern line with declines have observed the server virtualization cycle 
the implied non cloud valuations are mostly line with company specific historical sales multiple 
averages from before cloud businesses were priced into valuation this suggests investors are 
pricing relatively sober view the public cloud opportunity with one exception

what does the bull case look like 
global public cloud utility emerges 
our bull case lays out scenario where 
public cloud different from prior 
technology adoption trends the lower 
price and lower barriers entry 
compute and storage resources 
broadens out the use existing 
application workloads and perhaps 
more interestingly spurs accelerating 
growth new workloads see two 
scenarios where garner increased 
confidence this more expansive view 
the public cloud opportunity 
scenario already seen 
significant opportunity expansion 
markets where public cloud has 
penetrated most deeply one took 
idc forecast the sales force 
automation sfa market and continued 
the forecasted trend line growth through 
predicted market just over 
billion salesforce was 
million upstart the sfa market 
with less that subscribers 
bringing market easy use yet powerful solutions with 
faster implementations and lower upfront costs 
salesforce not only ramped represent the 
sfa market they fundamentally expanded the market 
salesforce ended billion revenue run 
rate sales cloud sfa alone out total billion run 
rate public cloud business and helped push the overall 
sfa market billion almost inflation from 
expectations 
scenario public cloud enabling the automation 
new areas work via machine learning public cloud 
environments are proving the staging grounds where 
vast stores data come together with large amounts 
processing power and the new methodologies 
programming enable new capabilities for digital 
applications these new capabilities create the building 
blocks for whole new classes applications technologies 
like autonomous vehicles real time translation virtual 
personal assistants the fundamental nature these new

alibaba view alibaba emerging giant china given its 
public cloud business leadership china public cloud 
sales estimate the analysis this report supports 
our view that alibaba cloud business undervalued the market both our cloud base and bull case suggest upside current 
share prices and respectively also see the information security concerns tailwind for alibaba develop public 
cloud business china even though its technology may still 
behind the global leaders additionally highlight the public 
cloud market still nascent china which suggests long runway 
for growth revenues from china public cloud market should 
reach per idc forecast making merely 
the global market curved low adoption currently therefore 
our assumptions here could still conservative apply consistent assumptions because the growth trajectory china

market assumptions underlying cloud valuations appear conservative our valuation analysis suggests investors are taking relatively sober view the public cloud market with cloud valuations likely 
the range our relatively conservative multiple based valuation discount cloud revenue 
and our base case dcf valuation which assumes significant drop off growth after reaching 
penetration line with declines the server virtualization market these two methodologies imply 
non cloud valuations that are mostly line with company specific historical sales multiple averages 
from before believe cloud businesses were priced into valuation however any upside 
our conservative base case cloud dcf assumptions would suggest undervaluation these large caps

commercial office base supports cloud valuation microsoft still 
rosoft valuation resulting from this analysis 
has base premises commercial office users majority which are likely transition over the next years 
our base case dcf assumes low single digit growth for microsoft 
our estimate this vast installed base coupled with pricing uplift 
cloud starting any upside this assumption implies 
when customers transition see microsoft microsoft 
upside the stock 
ready bring the bottom line think feb and 
high saas margins that drive the majority free cash flow sup 
while our bull case assumes more durable top line growth 
porting our microsoft cloud valuation 
conservatively assume the same margin profile our base case 
and also model capex cagr from our bull 
while expect azure grow rapidly over the next several years 
case support this growth which weighs fcf 
still assume that aws iaas paas revenues are larger than 
azure revenues driving home the point that its microsoft 
the historical sales multiple that apply non cloud 
high margin office franchise making the difference cloud valua

narios from time when microsoft multiples were 
technology offerings compared several years ago and microsoft 
compressed trading just forward eps the and 
incumbency advantage higher utilization data center assets and 
orcl 
push premium paas services should materially improving margins over time 
while non cloud revenues for microsoft include the declining

valuation methodologies and assumptions 
base case dcf methodology for each company estimate cloud revenue and expenses well 
taxes capex and depreciation reach cloud free cash flows through then assume standardized methodology across companies calculate free cash flows through and the dcf terminal value 
apply the same rate deceleration revenue growth the rate deceleration seen 
the server virtualization market when reached similar penetration assume that 
each company has reached mature cloud operating margin beyond assume free cash 
flow growth after hitting stable revenue growth margins and reinvestment requirements assume 
company specific wacc ranging from depending the company specific variables driving 
company cost capital assume debt cash for the cloud business calculating enterprise 
value 
bull case dcf methodology the general assumptions from our base case dcf methodology apply but 
assume cloud revenues not follow the same decelerating growth trajectory the server virtualization market once reaching penetration our bull case lays out scenario where public cloud different where the combination cost savings customers from basic cloud economics coupled with the 
union several secular themes mobile iot big data drives more durable growth public cloud 
workloads and sustained growth dollars accruing public cloud vendors assume cloud vendors 
are able maintain double digit growth through supporting this growth assume that the capex 
growth rate from sustains through accompanied higher depreciation too beyond 
apply model terminal value methodology with growth decelerating over five year period from 
the long term sustainable growth rate
