ibm cognitive and cloud platform through investments that are largely 
place today see ibm public cloud business growing line with the 
market cagr with gross and operating margins expanding 
industry average our base case cloud discounted cash flow analysis 
assumes public cloud follows the typical technology adoption cycle where 
growth slows single digits post adoption this conservative scenario 
yields cloud enterprise value billion ibm today leaving ibm 
core trading sales below the company trough over the last five 
years despite improving declines applying more appropriate sales 
more line with peers and ibm historical pre cloud average drives 
upside our base case 
stronger adoption would suggest our analysis conservative also 
consider bull case which public cloud foundational technology par 
with public utility where broad usage accelerates workload growth and public 
cloud revenue sustains double digit growth well beyond key signpost 
that supports this bull case stronger adoption machine learning 
technologies where see public cloud environments facilitating the automation 
entirely new areas work like image recognition natural language 
processing and decision making what more upside our base case may 
prove conservative cognitive services like watson and blockchain deliver given 
the potentially higher value higher margin characteristics these businesses 
using the previously outlined methodology higher cloud revenue forecasts

year earlier than expected with return growth and fcf surpasses

fcf shr 
transformation bears fruit with stabilizing revenue constant currency and 
return pre tax income growth while the cloud story better appreciated 
structural challenges the company core solution portfolio are largely offset 
double digit growth strategic imperatives excluding the impact

strategic imperatives fail take off ibm fails increase the relevancy its 
product portfolio after divesting commoditized businesses and acquiring 
strategic imperatives cheaper and more nimble competitors take customer 
share and slow ibm transformation ibm converts less than net 
income fcf our multiple line with legacy peers like oracle and 
reflects meaningful discount msft 
key value drivers 
can ibm win the cloud game not how you 
think don expect ibm compete with

however believe ibm portfolio

customer dollar share way that more 
commoditized hardware peers like hpe and

cloud services could help margins surprise 
the upside relative cloud peers 
what the right multiple for company 
transition believe ibm has better 
prospects than most hardware companies 
with limited strategies transform for
