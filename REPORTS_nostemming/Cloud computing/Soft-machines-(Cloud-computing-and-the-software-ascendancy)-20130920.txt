the distinction between public and private clouds has been meaningful the
early stages the market most what investors and users think when
they hear the term cloud computing public clouds like amazon
privately operated clouds that take advantage the same architectural
characteristic extensibility dynamic pooling resources and massive

into private clouds this renders iaas interchangeable this commodifies the
technology components that comprise iaas altering competitive market
dynamics fully realized paas layer will the key technology that renders

the first generation paas offerings was predominantly public heroku and

developers the ability write applications without worrying about the
underlying infrastructure however public paas failed address enterprise
concerns over security and governance and hence did not see significant
adoption deploying applications hybrid enabled paas middleware layer

another behind the firewall cloud based architecture
according david linthicum gigaom advantages private paas include
common self service application development platform allows developers
design test and deploy applications within environment that
provides consistency control and quality assurance
developers can access datacenter resources more effectively paas
handles server utilization helping abstract the application logic from
the underlying server and storage this improves utilization and efficiency
hardware and results more effective operations
developers can utilize their existing skill sets while taking advantage
new management capabilities around application management and

argument that fuel efficiency improvements would actually increase fuel use

highlight the trend
sdn and sddc architectures endeavor accelerate provisioning and
management networks through software similar way how
virtualization and software abstraction changed how servers are deployed
the goal sdn provide similar agility networks the sdn
architecture decouples the control and data planes centralizing networking
intelligence and state the underlying network infrastructure becomes
abstracted from control applications the result programmable automated
network infrastructure that can linked high level orchestration systems
that can also control servers storage and security ultimately software
automation can control entire datacenter allowing for far greater flexibility
scalability and cost savings
sdn software also
decouples software from
the underlying hardware
abstracting the topology the network and the datacenter reduces need for
lot manual configuration and connections reducing costs and overhead
principle the sdn approach analogous virtualized servers with cost
savings coming from lower operational costs and the ability use commodity
hardware for storage server and networking rather than proprietary devices
thinking the sdn software akin paas this decouples software from
the underlying hardware allowing users select the most appropriate

products reasonably well positioned for the coming cloud wave
emc seems less risk than smaller vendors mainly due its breadth and
depth product and incumbent status the company best positioned with
its ownership vmware which aims leader clouds and sddc with
vcloud vmware also has its own cloud stack software although mostly
faulted for not being open comparison openstack cloudstack besides
its vmware advantage emc enjoys installed base storage solutions

survive and thrive the new environment the vnx vnxe launched
also pushed the company into leading spot converged architecture

managers are risk adverse
the old saying used that datacenter manager was ever fired for
buying ibm the suggestion that was the safe low risk solution the same
today goes for emc when installing new type solution it said that
you are not the leading edge technology but the bleeding edge for
the pain that often inflicted making work thus vendors often continue
buy what they have previously bought low risk
knowledge processes takes time limited for new technologies
incumbents have products readily available today and while not the lowestcapital cost option and times quite expensive compared the alternative
they are tested and proven even when planning something new such
cloud might the current products that get picked over new unproven
ones besides familiarity with these products there base knowledge
and experience within one own company and broadly the industry that
does not emerge quickly with new technologies it often difficult find

this solution actually the cloud specifically cloud storage emc concept
that company does not want run public cloud via say amazon due
the variety issues with public cloud then could buy preconfigured
system with the same components public cloud but installed its own
datacenter private cloud and enjoy the same benefits it hard
evaluate this product solution good acquiring cloud stack and
doing oneself but least true cloud solution
also emc atmos advertising suggests savings storage costs
versus normal approach which understand cloud storage with
commodity hardware versus storage arrays
virtual computing environment vce
the joint venture was created november when cisco emc and
vmware decided create converged infrastructure product that would help
customers deploy solutions and move the cloud converged system
model networking compute storage and visualization are included one
product vce demand run rate surpassed revenue the
product competes directly with oracle exalogic and netapp cisco flexpod
and sold exclusively through the channel tie the cloud possible but
vce not low cost commodity product basically integrated made
easier deploy but not low cost option

managing the big shift
oracle business model
has been predicated
premise software
and hardware sales
oracle business model has been predicated premise software and
hardware sales with support revenue key the model the hardware
business commodity business which continues underperform and
are seeing broad based weakness branded servers other vendors
well believe enterprise hardware businesses will continue
commoditized cloud computing both public cloud providers like amazon
and the architecture server farms are undermining traditional servers
management had expected the commodity portion would bottom out
engineered systems gain traction but this taking longer than initially
thought the exa systems offerings are seeing decent momentum largely
around consolidation within the existing installed base
apps are important but
are arguably not
oracle core dna
the emphasis selling infrastructure products not solutions has been
successful driving high margin product business but infrastructure
servers increasingly database and middleware becomes subject
commoditization applications will the path towards higher value for
oracle apps are important but have been relatively smaller than database
largely acquired and arguably not its dna
recent partnerships with salesforce netsuite and microsoft are notable
moves that signal more open stance towards integration with competing
solutions salesforce has committed oracle database exadata and
oracle linux for years now oracle will also adopt salesforce com crm
while salesforce will adopt oracle hcm and back office apps
the technical advantages
oracle vertically
integrated systems have
been key selling points
oracle cloud business
now running over

expanding into the cloud
oracle cloud related offerings span extensive portfolio hardware
software and services ranging from oracle public cloud hybrid cloud saas
applications and flexible deployment paths for its existing applications the
technical advantages oracle vertically integrated system stack have been
key selling points but have concerns over the company shift
ratable services based purchasing model it also unclear how oracle will
navigate the economic model shift the cloud pricing remains opaque
particularly for pending database messaging and storage services still
don expect pricing particularly disruptive oracle not competing
the commodity iaas segment the market
the company has disclosed that well over customers are using its cloud
services database services include oracle database the cloud running
exadata box supporting apex sql sql java and rest apis the
data schema and table space isolation are managed and monitored java
services run java apps the cloud jdeveloper eclipse netbeans there
variety configurations which can from share multinode instances

openstack accessible with rest api developer services enable agile
development teams through git and messaging services for asynchronous
communications for applications compute services allow users package

including rightnow for customer service products taleo for talent management
and eloqua for marketing customer experience most rightnow taleo and
eloqua capabilities have been integrated into the portfolio
protecting the database and middleware flanks
oracle has been the dominant market leader the database management
systems segment the new for cloud database offers number
enhancements including multitenant and enhanced management capabilities
that are intended lower operating costs for customers and support
cloud based applications part the sun deal oracle acquired
mysql open source database many cases lower end alternative
the oracle database the oracle enterprise manager provides rich set
self serviced management user interfaces for managing services the cloud
platform oracle fusion middleware based unique hot pluggable
architecture middleware products ranging from application server
integration process management development tools for building
standards based platforms develop and run services the bea systems
acquisition which closed was another move oracle
strengthen its enterprise infrastructure software and middleware offerings
the partnership with microsoft deploy oracle software including java
oracle database and oracle weblogic server windows server hyper
and windows azure demonstrates the company ambition push for the
wider adoption its cloud solutions and its java the platform ideology
oracle remains the dominant leader the relational database market but
there growing momentum around open source alternatives such
hadoop nosql and object oriented variants such apache cassandra
mongodb and others we note that oracle installed base databases
supporting production apps quite sticky but the challenge capture
share new generation applications that take advantage mobility and big
data use cases for the global oracle remains fixture but for new
companies that are key drive growth the future for instance internet
companies like pinterest foursquare and saas companies like workday
there less pressing need invest proprietary relational database
even oracle open source mysql offering being targeted competitively
mongodb oracle does have columnar and nosql offerings but these are
relatively small the other challenge the relational database lock comes
from the role platform service haven seen widespread signs
hadoop replacing traditional data warehouses use cases are more
complementary but recently heard couple rip and replace cases
the challenge for oracle capture more the new use cases that
threaten capture more open source share and use commodity hardware
scale out virtualized infrastructure

hardware faces off against infrastructure service
oracle hardware product offerings have been significantly consolidated after
the sun microsystems acquisition the exadata and exalogic engineered
systems zfs storage and oracle supercluster are examples its compute
storage and network resources oracle then provides the abstraction and
pool management capabilities for mapping the resource layer the
operating system front oracle solaris has been declining the server
market while oracle linux likely benefit from market momentum
indicated the recently announced microsoft partnership whereby oracle
linux preconfigured instances will made available windows azure users
initial pricing models for hosted exadata and exalogic capabilities are
essentially just term licenses rather than metered pricing this more
managed hosting than cloud services put finer distinction what will
continue challenge oracle how the advent cloud platforms creates the
conditions where database increasingly commoditized for certain types
workloads not traditional transactional applications but more highly scalable
web based applications we seeing more companies such pinterest
foursquare run aws using nosql database like couchbase
mongodb there fundamental deflation across hardware and infrastructure
software and oracle applications represent way migrate value over time

the double edged sword
sep
cloud computing holds both opportunities and risks
rackspace only one many players the cloud side and significantly lags
aws with revenue iaas cloud services are doubleedged sword for rackspace with lot risks the company could see
margin leverage more clients move the cloud requires
customization and manual intervention while the cloud less due
automation and virtualization incremental revenue from the cloud can
more margin accretive than which more linear function but this
depends technology and scale
behind technology and scale
technology the key achieve leverage and rackspace behind
comparison aws for example aws can spin down applications
automatically for rackspace it still manual process aws far the
industry leader and six times the size rackspace based revenue aws
can use this scale advantage competitive weapon with pricing with
giants like microsoft google ibm and vmware also entering this market
competition will further intensified
the giants have awakened merger possible
today the competition comprises mostly aws tomorrow will also include
google microsoft ibm and many other industry giants tech you don
become giant merge with one over time you are big disadvantage
however merger with rackspace could tough given its roughly
market cap and deal say premium would put over
both microsoft with cash and google with net cash
could potentially look strengthen their offerings and rackspace interests
them they could afford ibm too but financially would probably
stretch though not impossible for most others basically believe would
out reach

rackspace openstack
few years back rackspace had released solid production version
openstack might have been able dominate the cloud software stack
market however there were many false starts the original work was with
nasa and then with citrix all which never panned out and both partners
eventually moved onward
rackspace realized order get true momentum the whole community
needed contribute the effort was bigger than expected late
and into the company moved the core the code apache
software foundation for open source certification gave the concept
selling software via the vmware model but hopefully left the door open for
red hat type support model way leverage its core business via
openstack cloud apps
august
rackspace private cloud
software was released
april cisco dell ibm red hat and many others
announced their intent become platinum gold members and supporters
openstack despite their endorsement rackspace felt the code was still
not ready for enterprise support august the company eventually
released rackspace private cloud software code name alamo freely
available from its website order get return its effort the company
offers support for fee and hopes this will material however prior
comments from the ceo are that this could take years develop april
openstack had very successful user conference portland oregon
with over attendees doubling the attendance from the previous event
six months prior
rackspace considered
thought leader for open
cloud stack software
but enough
the shift the open community has moved rackspace and openstack the
level thought leaders for cloud stack software still determined
whether the code gaining traction outside this group supporters and
will emerge standard the key future success
there view that companies that want build their applications for use
public cloud hybrid cloud environment right from the beginning will want
use open software code first avoids being locked into paying anyone
licensing fee second given vmware success the datacenter reduces
the concern that more control will given one vendor there have been
many comments from industry experts and companies that even the latest
release openstack still not ready for prime time even does become
standard it unclear rackspace will profit from and ibm could
benefit even more from than rackspace they are using run their
own cloud hosting sites and competing directly with rackspace

wrote beyond the cloud the benefits cloud computing include
conversion capital commitment operating costs ability pay per use
and reduced need for prior provisioning reduced capital commitments can
help smaller companies scale hardware only when needed
pay per use releases excess computing and storage capacity into the cloud
until needed and essentially converts these into utilities ease provisioning
reduces over and underprovisioning risks within hardware planning
cloud computing concept has been around for while the internet
form cloud computing providing connectivity across systems
estimated that the world datacenters use only the time their
peak but there dearth inventive ideas that could benefit from the
additional computing power
scalability and
not efficiency motivates
cloud computing
unlike virtualization cloud computing not only motivated efficiency
instead also potential enabler for business models that may not
able grow without access the scalability cloud computing provides

basic terms cloud computing pool resources dynamically allocated
and accessible through common application programming interface api
essentially set software hooks which users connect concurrent
trends hardware commoditization and virtualization have converged with
grid computing and component based service oriented architecture soa
form the basis cloud computing multitenant architecture enables scalable
infrastructure accessed and shared multiple unrelated and distinct
users service the realization saas possible because cloud
services are elastic available demand and measurable and economies
scale can exploited
the benefits cloud computing are well documented the most obvious
example savings the cost avoided building expanding private
datacenter rather than acquiring capacity stair step fashion
possible and more economical acquire capacity needed from cloudservice provider because the ability scale and even more critically
scale down when resources are not needed cloud users save money and their
businesses become more flexible result
another example savings related personnel costs nist has
estimated the total cost information technology runs times the cost
equipment alone the advantage multitenancy lies reducing costs
because single platform can shared and updated once while the
attractiveness potential cost savings and increased business agility are
compelling the evolution cloud services remains early stages with
obstacles inhibiting wider adoption
technology challenges remain obstacles adoption
data governance and
compliance are
key hurdles
data governance and compliance issues are key challenges disparate
sometimes nonexistent regulation data and where resides may
reside can create planning and compliance headaches for multinationals
regulation transactions and taxes pose dilemma for clouds that may
transfer data processing across state country borders addition security
issues are critical for instance many european countries require that
consumer data reside datacenters that are physically located the same
country the customers themselves
outages remain
lingering fear
downtime also threat data become consolidated massive regional
datacenters the potential negative ramifications from hacking and outages
become more severe every major cloud service provider has had deal with
outage one time another amazon web service has faced several
intermittent outages that have sidelined hundreds websites and startup
businesses and this has presented challenge adoption for businesses
concerned with downtime microsoft windows azure service saw intermitted

scalable typically grid based infrastructure that employs virtualization
techniques and multitenant architectures support dynamic provisioning

closed private cloud which the infrastructure operated and
maintained and solely for the benefit single organization most
appropriately large enterprise government organization another
variant the hosted private cloud where resources are maintained
third party provider collocation facility but resources are reserved
for single organization the case community private cloud
group organizations partners enterprise private cloud offers
more sophisticated security levels usage tracking and other capabilities
and typically offered value added service carrier collocation
provider generally the common characteristic private cloud the
delineation resources for use single organization group
contrast more broadly shared resources with the public cloud what
distinguished the private cloud from more the traditional datacenter the
use virtualization technologies pool resources such hardware
storage and and self service provisioning and management
capabilities the private cloud approach most commonly used the
largest organizations such banks and government private clouds can
operated organizations themselves outsourced third party
resources with certain workloads and applications typically designated
run one another the ability provide burst capacity moving
workload from private cloud public cloud accommodate temporary
spikes traffic resource demands characterizes the potential vision
the hybrid cloud model challenges for architecting and implementing
hybrid clouds relate federation workloads portability virtual stacks
between private and public clouds data governance and persistence
security policy nonetheless the hybrid cloud likely the most
typical approach for enterprises they gradually adopt cloud computing
public external cloud this term describes cloud computing its
most widely conceived sense pool computing and storage
resources delivered over the internet that can dynamically provisioned

vendors with origins traditional premise technology such ibm oracle
and microsoft are focused building their cloud offerings different ways
while the three have roots different technology eras ibm mainframe
oracle and microsoft client server and all made the transition the
top multitier internet architected application the late and
the shift cloud computing led saas and presents challenges the
technology business model and organizational fronts for investors gaining
transparency into the distinctions that arise from the shift from perpetual
license subscription challenge for the organizations themselves
managing the separate sales force approaches commission structures and

enhance and complement and other cases replace existing offerings for
certain enterprise applications the transition saas cloud based
approaches can relatively straightforward some vendors like autodesk
offer stripped down cloud offerings grow the user base others like adobe

infrastructure software encompasses complex range needs and use

cloud services creates opportunities for existing vendors expand their
services offerings the security market has for the past decade lent itself
mixed approach bundling premise software into hardware appliances
along with content services signatures and updates that provided greater
revenue visibility systems management vendors like and compuware
have historically offset the non recurring nature their premise business
model with term licenses and have expanded into cloud based adjacencies for
diversification the challenge for mixed model infrastructure vendors
similar that faced mixed model application and diversified technology
vendors bridging disruptive delivery and business models for infrastructure
however the impact the cloud model pronounced premise
management functions longer become necessary environments where
infrastructure delivered service less relevant becomes more
