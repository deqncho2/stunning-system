what our numbers 
and assume takes much longer 
ramp 
firstly incorporate only part the new capacity into our forecasts the built sydney melbourne and brisbane 
only capacity directly factored into our modelling 
model centre and our assumptions are structured reflect 
the first point would make that the ramp centres date 
has been fast and centre level economics have been very compel 
slower ramp percentage time fill basis than experi 
ling believe nxt has established track record execution 
enced the first each city typically years for 
that makes the sales process for second generation centres much 
the new dcs 
less onerous and less volatile 
utilisation caps out lower levels than currently 
the new centres are bigger and that implies much larger absolute 
achieved and 
volume sell however historically appears not have significant influence the ramp profile ramp profiles nxt 
pricing lower levels per than the corresponding and 
largest centres appear similar among the smallest also 
centres result mix factoring slight shift towards whole 
highlight three further factors consider credibility nxt has 
sale from less retail 
national coverage and much greater scale compared with when 
was selling first generation centres customer relationships 
greater knowledge customer requirements and what their 
slightly lower returns than existing

key issue what are the key risks our 
views returns 
does impact the customer experience directly trigger any 
short are bullish about the 
structural tailwinds and about nxt 
and the industry ability expand 
capacity rational way 
essentially continuation the 
trend that has played out globally 
over the past decade however 
acknowledge there are risks and set 
out the key risks our thesis below 
our thesis highlight five factors that view the 
biggest areas risk and perceived risk our thesis 
namely the future ajd property ownership power 
cost exposure execution growth initiative demand 
supply shocks and renewal risk 
clauses see change control event something that could 
very plausibly written into contracts for example nxt wholesale customers would likely value the neutrality and the property 
were acquired third party for example direct competitor this 
may have some contingency written into the contract management 
has confirmed this not the case with any customer contracts 
what the strategic value owning the owning the property obviously far more capital intensive and the property assets 
should logically lower returning however now that nxt capital 
constraints have been relaxed compared nxt saw fit compete aggressively for the assets they are clearly strategic value 
due 
certainty renewal for nxt and its customers the tenancy 
agreement long dated the life the fit out becomes far 
less issue 
set out the five biggest potential risks our thesis and conclude 
landlords capturing some the economics successful 
that out these execution pricing and demand shocks are the big 
market rent review for saw rents increase low inflation 
gest risks the organic business but that asset quality and pricing 
environment the land value also influenced the success the 
the back book would come sharply into focus were any potential 
operator 
situations arise 
marketing edge customers seek uptime certainty and continuity 
risk future ajd 
from data centre operators the longer the lease term the better for 
the customer lease longer dated than ownership 
background january nxt sold its property assets into 
newly formed specialist reit asia pacific data centre group 
does make sense shift away from leases altogether not 
ajd the assets included the sale were and early 
necessarily some circumstances the lease terms could compel 
capital took stake and then sought board changes 
ling and may even include purchase options whilst nxt has clearly
