new growth drivers for the enterprise biz and sizable cost synergies 
not yet the model should push eps meaningfully higher post blue 
coat while mergers hold risk the new mgmt team well executes 
this potential stronger growth profile should push multiples higher 
and symc our 
the new new symantec post the blue coat acquisition see symantec better 
positioned than ever address the long term secular themes within security 
increased consolidation security functionality onto broader platforms 
increased visibility across threat vectors and more automation across the security 
architecture highlighted rethinking security our upgrade 
symc december last year see symantec clearing path towards value 
upgrading overweight dec was predicated the spin off nonsecurity related assets highlighting strengthening enterprise security segment 
which believed was being undervalued investors our view the addition 
blue coat significantly bolsters that enterprise security business expanding 
the tam raising the top line growth profile low teens and improving 
profitability our ebit this improved positioning enterprise 
security continues underpriced investors our view our current 
forecasts combine the current top line growth trends the symantec and blue 
coat enterprise security portfolios revenue synergies and just 
the proposed expense synergies which still drives eps 
supporting our price target management fully executes the potential 
this combined entity further upside towards our bull case readily 
achievable are resuming coverage with overweight rating 
see symantec entering period favorable model dynamics 
enterprise revenue has new growth engine lagging solution set 
has dragged the enterprise business new solutions the market 
such next gen endpoint and security analytics revenue synergies with 
blue coat large web proxy installed base and compelling new products 
from blue coat portfolio around cloud security should drive improving 
enterprise security growth see the enterprise business growth 
improving from yoy constant currency revenue

assumes symantec removes expenses relative margin 
levels model operating margins improving from 
even with more conservative outlook than 
management 
with margin improvement declining interest expense symantec pays down 
debt the medium term and lower share count from continued share buybacks 
our model looks for eps from 
what worth our price target based off eps 
with relatively line with symc year average from 
component basis this target assumes multiple against our enterprise 
ebit discounted back and consumer business declining into perpetuity 
think current levels likely reflect mid teens enterprise ebit multiple too 
low for mid teens top line growth plus margin improvement and 
terminal growth rate for consumer likely too draconian with blue coat adding 
another lever growth operating margins improving and capital allocation 
continuing think symc will rate better align with its earnings growth

however see room for the consumer business stabilize start

transitions new subscriptions with endpoint security high priority new solutions 
advanced malware protection encryption and cloud security ramping and with 
synergies between blue coat and symantec bases think symantec should well 
positioned high single digit organic revenue growth its enterprise business 
which would make the current valuation levels too cheap 
updating model include blue coat and symantec results update our 
symc model include reported results and incorporate blue coat into the

revenue saw improving growth the with revenue down yoy constant currency 
versus down yoy last data loss prevention continues area strength 
with dlp revenue yoy enterprises focus protecting critical data 
symantec endpoint security suite seeing modest growth its large base 
incrementally adopts its new advanced threat protection solution with revenue 
yoy consumer security continues struggle symantec transitions its base 
subscriptions via online distribution with consumer security down yoy versus 
last however management commentary suggests that consumer security declines 
have reached bottom and growth should improve through 
our updated model now looks for revenue eps and revenue 
eps our underlying assumptions symantec stand alone remain 
relatively unchanged growth improves low single digits consumer 
becomes less headwind and enterprise sees some traction with new products 
add blue coat assuming revenue growth for blue coat over the next few
