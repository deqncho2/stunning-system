overview favorable conditions support strengthening 
fundamentals 
the fundamentals the life insurers remain solid heading into while much 
the improvement already reflected higher valuations across the group with the 
sector trading levels not seen since prior the financial services crisis still see 
solid upside select stocks specifically voya athene and ameriprise are stocks where 
see solid upside potential 
the strengthening fundamentals have been large part reflection the favorable 
macro environment with equity markets having moved near record highs margins 
across equity sensitive products have expanded and returns alternative investments 
have provided substantial boost while remaining somewhat range bound interest 
rates have similarly improved while favorable foreign exchange rates are also providing 
boost companies with international operations 
additionally also see other factors including tax reform providing boost the 
outlook while the life insurers not receive much benefit some other 
industries and some cases could actually see cash taxes rise still see corporate 
taxation reform boosting earnings over ultimately this benefit likely 
competed away but with relatively long duration product portfolios expect this 
erosion will take several years 
further the strength the economy also driving strength the results strong 
labor markets appears driving favorable underwriting results particularly group 
disability the strength the economy has also led benign credit conditions driving 
strength capital across the industry although higher stock prices has muted the 
accretion from stock buybacks also expect some rollback the regulatory burden 
across the industry positive catalyst for the sector 
sure lot this already reflected valuations with the group trading 
level not seen since before the financial services crisis this has led some clients 
question whether buying the stocks peak multiples peak earnings makes sense 
while certainly appreciate that point view the valuations not necessarily look 
that expensive relative the broader market specifically completed analysis 
looking the relative valuation the industry the market different interest rate 
environments when the year treasury rate falls the range the sector 
has historically traded which significantly above the current level

reflecting these factors are moderately increasing our price targets 
average which implies average upside from their current levels the higher price 
targets have three overall drivers 
higher estimates first are basing our price targets estimates that have been 
marked market which given the stronger equity markets have moved higher 
average this accounts for roughly our price target revisions 
higher multiples second reflecting the diminished tail risk and improved 
regulatory environment are moving our base valuation multiples higher our 
revised market multiples bring the overall sector relative the market 
level that consistent with prior historical levels the higher target multiples 
accounts for roughly the price target increases 
exhibit drivers changes 
taxation reform our revised price targets are based higher estimates revised 
for the taxation reform incorporating the upside potential from corporate taxation 
reform average accounts for substantial our price target change

what the tax reform means for the industry 
under the final tax legislation corporate tax rate declined from this impacts 
the insurers three different ways impact gaap operating earnings impact cash 
taxes and impact rbc ratios

results least the near term while the lift operating earnings will quickly 
reflected new product pricing there should still positive impact the legacy

impact cash taxes while the final version the tax reform significantly softened 
various provisions surrounding the calculation tax reserves and accounting for 
deferred acquisition costs compared the house bill the various proposals still shift 
tax expense items further into the future thus increasing taxable income earlier years 
accordingly cash taxes are expected increase earlier years despite the meaningful 
increase operating earnings result free cash flow relative operating earnings 
expected decline some cases meaningfully while most companies are downplaying 
potential repercussions for capital management activities there remains the risk the 
margin that buybacks for some companies could impacted negatively 
impact rbc ratios discussed our primer the reduction the tax rate 
likely put downward pressure the reported risk based capital ratios across the 
industry that said believe unlikely the rating agencies would ask the companies 
rebuild their capital back where they were previously due this change 
anything the earnings coverage ratio would improve and based discussions have 
had with the agencies they generally view tax reform positive for ratings 
accordingly except for those companies with already very low capital ratios would 
not expect this impact capital management activities meaningfully 
the major proposals impacting gaap earnings the tax reform include 
reduction corporate tax rate the reduction the corporate tax rate from 
clearly provides benefit for the higher tax payers the industry their legacy 
operations although the benefit likely quickly reflected pricing new sales 
companies with the higher effective tax rates include torchmark and unum 
dividend received deduction trimmed the tax reform states that only the 
dividend received will pro rated the life insurance company this better than the 
full elimination which many thought was possibility but will act offset for 
companies who rely heavily this deduction companies most impacted this 
proposal include principal and lincoln 
payment offshore affiliated entities subject alternative minimum tax amt 
under the new bill payments made corporation related foreign 
corporation that are deductible would subject alternative minimum tax amt 
the amt requires companies calculate taxes two ways total pretax earnings 
corporate tax rate portion earnings and pay the higher among the various 
companies athene would stand company who could negatively impacted 
that said under the assumption that prior reinsurance transactions are grandfathered 
athene likely see it all that excise and regular taxes tax rate from around 
over the course the next years that essentially means the 
company will facing mere basis points annual earnings pressure from 
slowly but gradually increasing tax rate 
regulatory rollback 
another area potential change revolves around softening the regulatory 
environment further the first area regulation watch the department labor 
fiduciary standards the department labor currently reviewing the fiduciary 
standards and have requested further delays implementation the department 
labor has sent final rule that would extend the transition period its fiduciary rule 
months the office management and budget for review while the rules have 
already been partly implemented the best interest contract exemption was pushed back 
further mid the dol completes additional work the regulations 
the second area potential regulatory reform surrounds the dodd frank act 
currently stands only prudential designated systematically important and like 
most others expect them shed that designation its annual designation review 
the third area potential regulatory reform revolves around reserving and capital 
rules for variable annuity captives oliver wyman introduced new proposals 
which were further tweaked from the original proposals specifically investors were 
concerned that new proposals base required capital stochastic tests 
could problematic for some companies oliver wyman conducted second 
quantitative impact study qis evaluate the new proposals and recommend any 
changes necessary while most the proposals from the original qis were retained 
the study recommended replacing with the new calculation use 
would reduce the required capital from the original proposals that said these 
proposals are yet adopted the naic with further changes expected before final 
implementation though these proposals have the ability drive higher capital 
requirements believe the industry appropriately capitalized and any additional 
reserve charges are not likely material our view companies with captives 
such voya lincoln and brighthouse warrant the closest attention

the life insurance stocks have rallied significantly over the past months 
absolute basis they are now trading levels not seen since before the onset the 
financial services crisis show exhibit the sector has typically traded level 
around the market multiple measured the the aftermath 
the financial services crisis while prior the financials crisis was around 
given the strong correlation the life insurers interest rates the group tends 
trade higher multiples relative the market when interest rates are higher 
historically the group has tended trade the market multiple when year 
treasury rates were between against this the current market multiple 
suggests the group trading considerably below historical average accordingly while 
the group looking somewhat expensive absolute terms the same not necessarily 
true with respect where trading relative basis 
further the current consensus estimates are likely somewhat stale and not reflect 
the benefit from taxation reform based where the markets are currently would 
estimate streetwide estimates would need move higher roughly given the 
benefit from tax reforms and marking market 
further the relatively low historical multiples the stocks part reflect the highly 
regulated nature the industry and the risk further tightening rules across the 
industry negatively impacting future returns given the potential regulatory rollback 
there are arguments made that this regulatory discount should decline although 
until specific proposals are outlined remains difficult gauge the impact 
raising estimates mostly from taxation reform impact 
are raising our eps estimates average with the vast majority 
that coming from the tax reform first marked our estimates market resulting 
the estimates moving modestly higher average the positive side equity markets 
have appreciated more than the had previously modeled while interest rates 
have also moved modestly higher offsetting factors have been less buyback accretion
