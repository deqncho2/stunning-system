tax reform could the most significant catalyst this year 
our extensive and proprietary analysis ranks tax reform 
exposure eps change and the npv value reform appears

hrc isrg abmd bcr and jnj 
our medical technology outlook report discussed tax reform perhaps 
the most significant catalyst for our coverage this year our extensive and 
proprietary analysis ranks likely tax reform exposure various factors that 
impact either the eps npv value business our algorithm encompasses 
four key tax items where see the most clarity lower statutory rate 
interest deductibility iii repatriation and capex depreciation also 
provide analysis border adjustability but not include this our 
primary rankings given the levels variability uncertainty around each 
element tax reform well our underlying assumptions are discussed 
detail within the report 
some companies are more equal than others tax reform likely positive for 
all companies our coverage but the degree benefit can vary substantially 
general smid caps average benefit see larger benefit than large caps 
average benefit due primarily greater exposure sales and 
manufacturing higher tax rates and lower margins six our eight profitable 
smid cap companies were among the top beneficiaries from tax reform our 
analysis including the top three spots abmd nuva gmed only two tfx 
hae the bottom among large caps believe jnj holx and isrg are 
best positioned while abt bdx and bsx see more limited benefit see exhibit 
and exhibit for our company rankings 
reform about much more than lower tax rate the impact lower 
corporate tax rate may the easiest conceptualize has the most positive 
impact for companies with higher overall tax rates see exhibit that said many 
companies see just large not more substantial impacts from other less 
appreciated elements tax reform removing interest rate deductibility 
would most negative for high debt low margin companies like hyh and hrc 
see exhibit repatriation would most positive for those with large levels 
cash and unremitted foreign earnings like jnj and abt see exhibit 
although the additional tax provides some degree offset and iii deductibility 
capex would most positive for those with higher relative levels like hrc 
and nuva see exhibit 
tax has been and would continue driver performance has been 
almost two months since the election and while clearly tax reform isn the only

deeper dive each element tax reform 
tax reform may the most significant catalyst for our coverage the 
republican sweep the election has made tax reform significant possibility 
the combination republican presidency and republican congress may break the 
bipartisan gridlock that has defined politics for the last several years take look 
statements from the trump campaign and the house gop better way plan led 
speaker paul ryan below outline the five key tax items lower statutory 
rate interest deductibility iii repatriation capex depreciation and border 
adjustability that believe have the most significance general tax reform would 
have significant impact our coverage lifting eps for smid caps average 
and for large caps average 
assumptions behind our analysis assume midpoint range 
discussed below statutory rate through all these tax options analyze the effects 
lower statutory rate interest deductibility border adjustability and repatriation 
with assumption that foreign cash used for buybacks eps basis 
analyze the repatriation tax liability and capex depreciation npv basis those 
items impact the intrinsic value and cash flows the companies but will not have 
direct impact adjusted earnings 
certain companies were excluded from parts our analysis dexcom insulet irhythm 
and nevro were all excluded from analyses the basis earnings estimates they 
have limited profitability still important note that while certain elements 
tax reform won impact these companies forward earnings they still can have large 
impact the intrinsic value the companies grifols was excluded from repatriation 
foreign domiciled company that will unaffected even though medtronic 
foreign domiciled ireland still included has significant amount trapped 
cash that would impacted tax reform for abbott used pro forma estimates 
for the company jude acquisition neither company included stand alone 
basis this analysis 
ranking system explained our overall ranking system comprises two parts first 
calculate the net change eps from lower statutory rate interest deductibility 
and repatriation buybacks second combine the npv the capex tax shield benefit 
and the npv the repatriation tax liability take the combined npv these tax 
reform items percentage the company market capitalization and add this the 
percentage change eps calculate the net effect tax reform companies that have 
the largest net benefit result have the highest rank rank important 
note that our overall rank does not factor border adjustability although 
rank each company the basis where believe they stand relative each other 
border adjustability excluded due limited visibility the mechanics behind imports 
and exports company specific basis likelihood companies change border mechanics

statutory rate 
description currently the corporate tax rate for companies our coverage 
president elect trump has proposed lowering the statutory rate while the ryan 
plan has proposed further under the trump plan foreign profits would continue 
subject tax without deferral rate foreign taxes paid can 
deducted against this whereas the ryan plan would transition territorial system 
that would longer tax foreign earnings going forward our discussions with our tax 
and accounting colleagues indicate range most likely for the tax rate 
and assume companies not have pay taxes foreign earnings going forward 
similar the ryan plan 
assumptions our analysis assume statutory rate and make 
assumptions about the portion adjusted pretax income generated the and 
subject taxes through financial filings and conversations with companies 
assume companies can continue defer taxes foreign earnings going forward 
effect our assumed rate suggests benefit median with 
individual company benefits ranging from our analysis suggests abiomed 
nuvasive and hologic would benefit the most seeing lifts eps and 
respectively and teleflex baxter boston scientific and abbott would benefit the 
least with benefits for teleflex and baxter and for boston scientific and 
abbott 
sensitivity the trump plan despite having lower corporate tax rate would 
actually have smaller net benefit considering the tax ongoing foreign earnings our 
analysis suggests eps benefit from the trump plan with median 
benefits could range from under the ryan plan which calls for 
statutory rate and taxes foreign earnings this would average benefit 
median with relatively narrower range versus the trump 
plan

interest deductibility 
description currently interest expense deductible for tax purposes president elect 
trump supports reasonable cap the deductibility interest and under the ryan 
plan interest expense will deductible until matches the amount interest income 
this cap interest deductibility would increase taxes paid 
assumptions our analysis assume that all interest paid companies our 
coverage debt for simplicity all interest expense currently tax deductible 
except for grifols and assume interest deductible only until the amount 
interest income 
effect companies would see hit eps net income weighted basis line 
with the median ranging from for companies with relatively little 
debt our analysis abiomed globus and intuitive would least affected 
while hologic hill rom and halyard would most affected with potential eps 
impacts and respectively note that the case halyard 
combination debt and limited profitability has led interest deductions having 
relatively greater effect eps 
sensitivity companies with relatively less debt and higher margins see less 
headwind while companies with lower margins and more significant debt loads see more 
negative effect

repatriation 
description both the trump and ryan plans propose deemed repatriation forced 
not voluntary repatriation unremitted foreign earnings trump has proposed 
deemed repatriation tax unremitted foreign earnings payable over years the 
ryan plan proposes deemed repatriation tax the portion unremitted 
foreign earnings that consists cash and cash equivalents and tax for all 
other portion unremitted foreign earnings that not cash payable over years 
note even though companies will owe taxes based unremitted foreign earnings 
they will gain access foreign cash which assume will used for buybacks the 
taxes owed unremitted foreign earnings will create long term tax liability the 
balance sheet 
assumptions our analysis for eps assume that all company unremitted 
foreign earnings taxable and that companies use their foreign cash for share 
buybacks share price premium current levels analyze the tax 
liability npv basis with payback period years and discount rate 
use the tax rates from the ryan plan our base case analysis grifols was excluded 
from this analysis 
effect companies would see gain eps net income weighted basis median 
with benefits ranging from for companies with little foreign cash 
abbott and teleflex would best positioned with potential benefits 
and respectively nuvasive abiomed globus and boston scientific would see 
relatively immaterial benefits from repatriation eps market cap weighted basis 
companies would see tax liability equivalent their market cap due deemed 
repatriation ranging from relative market cap for the tax liability 
abbott baxter and would see the largest tax liabilities market cap while 
abiomed globus and nuvasive would see minimal tax liabilities relative basis 
sensitivity our eps benefit can change based the portion cash used for 
buybacks companies used their foreign cash for buybacks versus our 
assumption companies would see benefit eps weighted basis 
respectively for the tax liability longer payback period higher discount rate would 
decrease the size the tax liability relative market cap under the trump plan which 
would have payback period years along with flat tax unremitted 
foreign earnings estimate the average npv the tax liability percentage 
market cap would bps higher average further use discount rate

capex depreciation 
description currently when capital expenses are depreciated the depreciation expense 
tax deductible and provides tax shield under both the trump and ryan plans 
capital expenses are expensed immediately for full tax deduction the first year but 
not generate tax shields from depreciation years beyond the first year since the 
full tax benefit received sooner npv basis this should have positive effect for 
firms 
assumptions assume discount rate and perpetual growth rate capex 
also assume average life years for capital expenditure assets 
assume the same percentage capex and depreciation for companies takes place the 
does the percentage company cogs that produced the see border 
adjustability for more this particular assumption 
effect market cap weighted basis companies would see average npv benefit 
worth their market cap line with the median ranging from 
companies with more capex intensive businesses will see larger benefits relative 
market cap for the tax liability nuvasive hill rom globus zimmer and haemonetics 
would best positioned with nuvasive and hill rom seeing benefit and globus 
zimmer and haemonetics seeing benefit intuitive medtronic hologic and 
abiomed would see minimal benefits 
sensitivity our analysis sensitive the discount rate and growth rate capex that 
assume for our companies higher discount rate would reduce the npv benefit 
discount rate versus our would reduce the weighted average npv benefit 
versus market cap bps higher growth capex would increase the npv 
benefit capex growth rate versus our assumption would increase the 
weighted average npv benefit longer useful life assets would also drive the 
npv benefit higher

border adjustability 
description currently companies that produce goods abroad then import those goods 
sold the can deduct the cost those goods from their taxes and companies 
that produce goods domestically then sell those goods abroad must pay taxes those 
goods the ryan plan proposes transition the corporate tax system into border 
adjustable destination based cash flow system effectively imports would not tax 
deductible and exports would not taxable with limited visibility into the mechanics 
behind imports and exports company specific basis the likelihood that companies 
change manufacturing mechanics response tax changes and given the lower 
likelihood border adjustability passing have not included border adjustability 
our overall rankings but our analysis has produced some estimates that investors may 
find useful provide adjusted tax ranking with border tax estimates exhibit 
for illustrative purposes only 
assumptions our analysis make assumptions about the portion company 
cogs that manufactured the and use these percentages along with 
company and revenue exposures determine the values imports 
produced and sold the and exports produced the and sold 
use these determine the current import tax deduction and current taxes paid 
exports and remove both these items find the effect border adjustability taxes 
paid 
effect weighted net income our companies would see benefit eps line 
with the median but with wide range our analysis suggests eps effects could 
anywhere from hill rom and nuvasive would best positioned with 
potential benefits and respectively while grifols and halyard could 
most adversely impacted with potential eps hits 
sensitivity the effects vary widely amongst companies depending whether
