market optimism policymaking reality remain odds hence 
our guide navigating incoming tax reform details today 
market friendly reforms are among the most likely outcomes 
but are eclipsed the sum less friendly ones analyze 
the latter offer hedges for fixed income investors 
these may not the reforms you looking 
for think tax reform coming but push our 
timing the president has promised 
disclose further details soon hence establish 
framework gauge the prospects for various 
types tax policy change while market friendly 
reforms are among the likely outcomes there are 
several others with reasonable probability that 
could disappoint investors delays smaller cuts and disruptive elements 
border taxes that make for tough drawn out transitions put 
outcomes into three buckets good tax bad tax and mixed tax and see 
the cumulative probability good tax outcomes only hence the 
risk tax disappointment may underappreciated 
what the price more good tax than bad tax our view credit and 
markets reflect clear optimism about good tax outcomes though rates 
and munis tell more mixed story hence the risk that key markets may 
not accounting for the cumulative probabilities other outcomes 
policy focus taxing the border border tax its various potential 
forms the critical uncertainty tax reform often the differentiator 
between more and less positive risk outcomes building the unintended 
consequences previously identified see reality bites our 
economists argue there isn clear case for the near term benefits 
border tax even when paired with regulatory reform given the path for 
usd seen our strategists furthermore our corporate credit team 
sees meaningful risks from this provision given elevated business model 
uncertainty and weak starting point corporate fundamentals 
contingency plans dealing with tax disappointment tax but one 
many factors driving markets and the favorable view risk assets our 
cross asset strategy team nevertheless lay out hedges for investors

common refrain from clients our discussions about tax that failure deliver 
reforms timely manner could much negative market catalyst 
delivering the wrong kinds reforms think valid point particularly given 
the views our fixed income strategists detailed the next section that their 
markets are implicity expecting beneficial tax outcomes our view reform 
coming the next months subjective probability given that republicans 
have strong motive and variety tools circumvent the legislative and 
political barriers success see reality bites january and taxes knowing 
half the battle december this first time assigned numerical 
values probabilities and assigned lower ones than might have few 
weeks ago disagreements have risen within the republican caucus how 
execute key points tax reform and aca repeal reform which some 
members feel should precede hence also pushed our base case expected 
timing for tax action and note meaningful probabilities tax reform delays 
will some form border tax included this the critical uncertainty tax 
reform including border tax some kind bat vat reciprocal tax may 
disruptive the near term the economy but has the practical benefit 
raising money toward revenue neutral permanent tax cut and the political 
benefit satisfying the president promise make trade fairer not including 
border tax would leaves two very different options deficit funded stimulative 
but sunsetting tax cut modest fully funded permanent tax cut other 
words don see any obvious win win scenarios but see meaningful 
variety them based this decision point currently think this tossup 
chance some type border tax enough republican senators have 
expressed displeasure with the concept hypothetically keep tax reform from 
passing and this ought make the odds lower however the president won let 
the concept his closest economic advisers treasury secretary mnuchin and 
national economic council director gary cohn have floated alternatives like 
reciprocal tax which suggests his administration looking for politically 
palatable way make border tax work perhaps recognizing the practical 
legislative and political benefits cited earlier 
border tax not adopted biased toward the idea that republicans 
eventually abandon revenue neutrality though perhaps not name and accept 
sunsetting tax cut given the president more casual attitude toward deficits the 
motivation deliver meaningful decrease headline rates and increasing signs 
from republican senators that they willing accept some deficit expansion this 
could gambit that tax benefits will deliver larger majority midterm 
elections creating avenue toward making the tax reform permanent face saving 
measures like balanced outyear budgets within the year budget window and 
independent validation the fiscal benefits deficit funded tax plan perhaps 
from the omb could assist 
what form would border tax take not all border taxes are created equal and 
hence drive variety outcomes with varying potential push the economy 
and markets both positively and negatively the bat currently proposed 
house republicans would drive revenue neutral non stimulus reform that 
would likely need phased order mitigate the risks unintended 
economic consequences and potentially spark retaliation from trading partners 
found non wto compliant reciprocal tax which take mean effort 
level the playing field taxing imports equal the difference between 
country vat and state and local sales tax could offer some alternative 
benefits there hypothetical flexibility retailers who could lower costs 
importing from lower vat countries which may may not realistic and 
potential replace the revenue raised the bat estimate reciprocal tax 
would generate about its first year yet retailers free traders and their 
republican senate allies may still scoff such plan non wto compliant 
veiled tariff and extra tax consumers 
yet another alternative could executive option reciprocal tax giving the 
treasury the authority but not the requirement use reciprocal tax certain 
conditions are met this could give the president tool that makes credible his 
threats about penalizing offshoring and promises pursue fairer trade and deal 
renegotiations without automatically triggering reciprocal trade actions this 
would likely increase deficits and hence would require some the budget tactics 
mollify deficit hawks that previously discussed see reality bites january 
final alternative implausible might sound the surface would 
vat that includes carve outs for key products blunt its regressive nature 
vats have historically been anathema republicans and vat wouldn 
guarantee the type tax congruence that the president might want with trading 
partners however wto compliant and could fund substantial income tax rate 
cuts hence don think implausible that republicans could eventually find 
way toward embracing vat our view these latter two approaches executive 
option reciprocal tax and watered down vat stand out from the others 
particularly they offer face saving though admittedly flawed provisions the 
president house republicans and senate republicans concerned about importers

our view the key takeaway that good outcomes are still outweighed mixed 
and bad outcomes hence markets could conflating the low odds success for 
individual negative tax provisions the bat with low odds overall disappointing 
outcome other words there may more potentially disappointing outcomes than 
what currently reflected the price key markets 
hence what can fixed income investors biased course and believe tax 
reform critical variable market performance concede however not the 
only critical variable the view our cross asset colleagues who are taking broader 
factors into account there still plenty scope for risk rally see cross asset 
playbook still sparkle before fade february hence wouldn advocate for 
wholesale shift asset allocation strategy just that investors account for the risk for 
those who may agree with the thesis laid out here the following trades may

corporate credit 
assessing what the price when comes the border tax challenging part 
because the lack clarity around many the details well how the bat will fit 
into broader tax reform additionally our view there even disagreement among 
credit investors about the impact this tax change markets however can make 
few general points 
first immediately after the election think markets were anticipating the delivery 
clearly business friendly tax reform rapid fashion particular drop tax rates 
preservations most corporate tax preference items consequence and big 
increase earnings and growth result credit markets are near post crisis tights 
especially adjusting for leverage and stocks are near all time highs hence even the 
unintended consequences around potential provisions like border tax did not 
materialize think the bar high for policy deliver these promises said 
differently simply getting tax reform done later than originally anticipated tax cuts 
that are less stimulative growth earnings perhaps because the tax cut smaller 
funded with bat would disappoint markets 
addition meaningful likelihood border tax doesn seem baked even 
sector level for example show below have not seen any meaningful 
underperformance the bat losers outperformance the winners defined 
our previous work adjusting company financial statements for the effects such tax 
see border tax exposure guide february although retail has 
underperformed our view this has more with rising issues specific retail

rates 
rates markets should reflect the various tax reform outcomes probabilistic 
sense but the variety possible outcomes and implications for rates markets make 
difficult know precisely what the price take for example the behavior longerdated forward real interest rates and longer dated forward breakeven inflation rates 
the wake the election 
exhibit suggests after initial post election bump both forward real yields and 
breakeven inflation rates moved sideways year forward year real yield just 
below and the associated breakeven inflation rate just above markets are 
not projecting economic outcome all that different from what markets were 
projecting ahead the fed first rate hike 
exhibit year forward year breakeven inflation rate and real yield 
source morgan stanley research 
what exactly are rates markets suggesting without knowing the specifics the tax 
reform outcome think rates markets are expressing healthy skepticism that tax 
reform will transformational for economic growth inflation from medium tolong term perspective especially the fed has push back against the upside risks 
such tax reform could create for the economy the near term something the fed may 
begin early the march fomc meeting 
fact when dissect daily movements breakeven inflation rates and real yields 
see direct relationship between how the market priced inflation immediately after the 
election and how priced inflation after the fed signaled faster pace hiking 
the december fomc meeting exhibit shows the history movements real 
yields and breakeven inflation rates combined way that categorize good 
inflation and bad inflation 
for example real yields move higher the same time that breakeven inflation rates 
move higher suggest that the market pricing good inflation outcome one 
which both growth and inflation expectations are rising coincidently the extent 
that real yields rising reflects more hawkish fed the coincident rise breakeven 
inflation rates would suggest that the tighter fed policy would not enough 
prevent higher inflation which turn suggests that growth expectations are even 
stronger 
exhibit good inflation bad inflation extracted from coincident movements year 
breakevens and real yields 
source morgan stanley research 
back exhibit the wake the election markets increasingly priced good 
inflation outcome but once the fed raised rates december and signaled faster pace 
hiking the pricing good inflation subsided the new year began focus 
the bat increased unsurprisingly rates markets began price bad inflation 
outcome one which breakeven inflation rates rise while real yields fall 
while the good inflation bad inflation analysis does not tell specifically what 
the price for tax reform helps better track market sentiment about the evolving 
discussions washington 
munis 
while muni pricing certainly more rational about tax risk relative the above markets 
still see meaningful underperformance risk should bad outcome materialize for 
example our view that capping the muni interest exclusion for high income 
earners would still preserve tax shield least the bracket see muni strategy 
playbook game codes january hence the muni market hypothetically not 
overvalued the market implied tax shield holding muni calculated grossing

housing 
see fundamental risks housing via potential mortgage interest deduction caps 
manageable and therefore not incompatible with current housing price momentum 
higher mortgage rates are not the only thing with the potential change the relative 
affordability owning home the context the proposals for personal tax 
reforms address the possibility that the mortgage interest deduction mid might 
the table 
eliminating the deductibility mortgage interest will unequivocally make housing less 
affordable all else equal but how will that relative change affordability impact 
home prices answer that question first dive into just how much people utilize 
the mortgage interest deduction today the last year for which have 
complete data people that filed taxes claimed mortgage interest deduction 
exhibit 
exhibit share irs tax filings that claimed mortgage interest deduction income 
bracket 
source irs morgan stanley research 
while this makes the argument that relatively small though far from insignificant 
portion households utilize this deduction the total filings also include number 
families that not actually own home and therefore cannot apply 
look the census bureau for statistics ownership households find that 
million families lived homes that they owned those million have 
mortgage other words while only tax filings included mid

while the differences state and local taxes across the country make difficult 
determine the exact marginal tax rate for each these income brackets safe say 
that the elimination the mortgage interest deduction would take chunk out 
mortgage holders income our estimates were consider the complete 
removal the mid vacuum would decrease incomes anywhere from for 
mortgage holders with income above almost for mortgage holders 
with income below 
that said the mortgage interest deduction unlikely eliminated vacuum for 
example the mid could modified include cap the deduction that would only 
affect higher income households those that tend fall toward the lower end our 
range impacted disposable income 
increasing the standard deduction has also been discussed the ultimate impact this 
change hard discern could and arguably intended increase the 
disposable income households further down the income spectrum think 
money fungible this should tailwind for homeownership all else equal 
however this happens alongside substantial curbing the mortgage interest 
deduction then consumers are longer receiving additional incentive own 
home with their newfound disposable income 
while this might impact consumer decision own versus rent consumer sentiment 
remains heavily skewed toward ownership recent survey published nar shows 
that the perception homeownership remains strong among the consumer fannie 
mae home purchase sentiment index has increased over from its levels the 
summer and just barely off its post crisis highs while consumers views 
toward ownership could change the aftermath tax reform starting from very 
favorable position 
scaling back the mortgage interest deduction would impact large number 
households however the ultimate impact would depend the manner which 
done would any repeal specifically targeted higher income brackets and the 
other tax reforms that accompany any change the mortgage interest deduction 
ultimately there are wide range policy changes the new administration can enact 
that would have both positive and negative effects the housing market and 
stated the beginning this report believe there greater potential for the 
positive effects manifested least the near term 
policy focus taxing the border 
summary 
more fully explain the rationale for our tax scenarios this section explore 
the fundamental impact various forms border tax including comparisons 
between immediate implementation and phased process the key takeaways 
the dollar would strengthen under most protectionist measures with the 
pacing and magnitude determined the specifics the measures 
for the economy there are myriad downside risks that mean one 
shouldn simply rely border tax potential trade benefits trade 
retaliation wealth effects and interest deductibility curbs are key 
considerations that could offset trade capex positives 
corporate credit would suffer from significant financial uncertainty 
especially given the weak starting point corporate fundamentals 
impact 
dara blume 
proponents the border adjustment tax have argued that the net impact trade 
would negated the fact that the dollar would adjust completely offset its 
effects moving assuming corporate tax rate our work border 
adjustability how tax reform could boon for usd suggests that this not the 
case instead argue for hike usd for number reasons most which 
are outlined the piece 
purchasing power parity does not hold empirically and when does this over 
the very long run 
concerns about retaliation and litigation would mute usd appreciation investors 
anticipated offsetting moves from other countries 
around one third the us major trading partners manage their currencies peg 
their currencies and many others use volatility muting mechanisms times 
weakness 
financial not trade flows dominate markets financial markets would obviously 
react the bat news but have other driving forces 
not all consumer goods are imports fact only approximately are 
our calculation the total import content including intermediate goods final 
consumer goods likely higher but consumers also spend lot money 
services once you include these the total amount import content 
consumer expenditures roughly this means that even ppp did hold the 
total impact the dollar would less than the full tariff 
much trade priced usd meaning that prices not the currency should the 
adjustment lever 
this last point especially important economic theory would suggest that the reer 
real effective exchange rate which incorporates nominal currency moves and inflation 
should move offset the tariff the extent that prices rise the need for nominal 
adjustment less the adjustment comes through the relative pricing channel and 
vice versa 
and the bat timing matters 
this framework useful for considering how usd would perform phased versus 
immediate bat usd would undoubtedly rise both scenarios partially offset the 
tariff however the pace would different and believe bat phased over five 
years would impact currencies differently than one immediately put place for few 
reasons 
first five years enough time for contracts repriced the extent that the 
adjustment felt through prices the exchange rate the longer timeframe gives 
companies time comfortably pass higher costs customers renegotiate 
contracts reflect them this particularly important for dollarized trade which 
represents roughly global invoicing and over trade 
second significant initial usd rally phase scenario with offsetting 
adjustment tariffs would weigh heavily economic growth well inflation the 
result would reduce investor interest real assets given weak growth could also 
force more dovish fed moving interest rate differentials against usd the result 
would self correction the dollar the policy was not phased such swift 
currency adjustment would necessitated help mute the impact importers and 
inflation and therefore would possible 
third five years long time for financial markets for many short term investors 
may difficult make trades highly volatile markets that will only fully play out 
five years the future when the border adjustment fully phased that timeframe 
also leaves ample possibility for wto litigation well changes official policy 
without phase the moves will much more violent net importing companies 
facing sticky prices would not have time adjust these and may forced absorb 
the higher costs weighing net profits and growth this would weigh risk appetite 
would uncertainty surrounding how the policy would play out more broadly 
immediate move the currency would also necessitated the immediate move 
tariffs this would also furthered the fact that the impact all stimulative 
corporate tax cuts would immediate which helps mute any growth concerns but 
would also usd positive 
what could reciprocal tax look like for markets 
another potential approach for leveling the playing field international trade apart 
from the border adjustment tax would reciprocal tax which was mentioned 
treasury secretary mnuchin recently there are many ways this could implemented 
but one that consider this piece tariffs applied based the relative differential 
consumption taxes between the two countries this case each import from each 
trade partner would taxed the differential between the partner vat rate and the 
average sales tax rate for some countries canada and japan for example 
vats are lower than tariff would applied for others germany and the 
for instance the tariff applied under this policy would still greater than

with most protectionist policies this would usd supportive however likely 
drive significantly lower level usd strength than either the bat scenarios would 
for few reasons first many the us major trading partners would get rate 
seen exhibit second there are complexities around vat that may mean the 
tariff imposed even less than the numbers shown this because most countries have 
exceptions their vat laws for example mexico imposes vat some 
agricultural imports and maquiladora imports which will exported these 
exceptions are accounted for could mean the effective tax even lower than exhibit 
suggests third even adjust the impacted currencies for the full reciprocal tariff 
expect the move the broad usd index less than under both bat scenarios and 
would emphasize that this path likely upper bound for the currency move for 
the same reasons mentioned above it unlikely the currency would adjust fully the 
tariff perhaps even more this case where countries are affected less than 
and individual case case basis 
our forecasts for the usd path can seen exhibit compared our current 
forecast for appreciation the broad trade weighted usd over the next two years 
believe the broad trade weighted dollar would rise over the next two years 
phased bat and over the next two years immediate application phasein the bat could continue gradually adjust the immediate scenario some 
retracement could actually come the fed reacts usd moves over time 
reciprocal tax see usd rallying this year before retracing 
mentioned above but worth reiterating see our forecast for reciprocal tax 
upper boundary and use parametrize the usd move rather than define one 
other point worth mentioning though not included the chart below how vat

persistent inflation pressures both bat scenarios call for higher path for the 
federal funds rate compared with the baseline 
other practical considerations can easily negate any upside these scenarios 
retaliation wealth effects interest deductibility but there are positive 
considerations note well decreased regulation immediate expensing 
the section that follows proxy the economic impact border taxes 
simulating the impact two styles bats and noting key factors exogenous our 
simulations that could meaningfully impact those results 
building theoretical baseline 
the first step our analytical process establish baseline for the impact border 
taxes this neutral baseline allows then consider how the net impacts would play 
out under different assumptions about the reaction and under different 
assumptions about the timeline potential phase the border adjustment tax 
build this theoretical baseline work with the face value details the house

scenario immediate bat and partial dollar offset 
this scenario the border adjustment tax introduced immediately but the dollar only 
partially adjusts offset its effects under this assumption the positive nearterm impacts growth and inflation are more immediately evident albeit modest 
net real gdp rises above the baseline the first year after implementation 
the border tax above the baseline the second year and above the baseline 
the third year exhibit the drivers here are largely improvement net trade 
while business investment also benefits lesser extent this more than offsets the 
drag consumption from the dampening effect price increases household 
spending 
for inflation the implementation the border tax has persistent impacts core pce 
prices this driven part the underlying structure the frb model where 
inflation dynamics are inertial prices are sticky and these frictions slow the speed 
price adjustments response shocks such the one modeled here this border 
adjustment tax scenario the rate core pce inflation lifted above baseline 
the first year after implementation the tax the second year and 
the third year exhibit 
the slow price adjustment dynamic significant here because core inflation remains 
elevated the model for quite some time after the initial shock the price level 
only fully adjusts over the medium term cumulatively the price level rises about 
over the medium term which notable for two reasons 
first this simulation result somewhat less than the inflation effect based rough 
estimate using simple arithmetic around the amount imported content 
consumer spending roughly consumer spending can traced the cost 
imported goods and services including both spending for imported goods and services 
sold directly households and the imported share intermediate inputs usproduced goods and services full pass through the import tax into consumer 
prices would expected raise inflation all else equal 
second the way think about the bat inflation adjustment that total 
adjustment the real effective exchange rate needed offset the border 
adjustment tax several years inflation around mean should expect 
cumulative rise inflation around the years following implementation 
this important because makes for the other half the reer adjustment that 
needed the nominal move the dollar only turns out around

scenario year phase bat and partial dollar offset 
this scenario the border adjustment tax phased over five years imports are 
deductible the first year deductible the second year etc the dollar only 
partially adjusts over time noted previously our strategists 
under these assumptions the initial growth impacts from the border adjustment tax are 
more modest the new policy phased and the anticipatory reaction largely 
offsets most the growth upside such that the net impacts are roughly neutral the 
first two years after implementation only the third year after the tax policy 
implemented that the positive growth effects start come through with real gdp 
rising above the baseline the bat continues phased real gdp 
continues rise above the baseline the fourth year after implementation and 
above the baseline the fifth year after implementation exhibit 
the impacts inflation show somewhat more modestly first with the rate 
core pce inflation rising above the baseline the first year after implementation 
and above the baseline the second third fourth and fifth years after the initial 
implementation exhibit again the price dynamics here are slow adjust and are 
much more persistent such that inflation remains above the baseline over the medium 
term the price level adjusts for the new trade policy

implications for fed policy 
would remiss ignore the monetary policy reaction this scenario faced with 
persistently higher pace core inflation the federal open market committee fomc 
would lean the price stability side its dual mandate adjusting the path policy 
normalization higher control inflationary pressures 
using the model inertial taylor rule guideline the first scenario immediate 
bat and partial dollar offset would call for almost adjustments the first year 
higher level the fed funds rate the second year and higher level the 
fed funds rate the third year exhibit the second scenario bat phase 
and partial dollar offset the policy rule would call for the fed funds rate remain 
roughly consistent with the baseline until about four years out when the rule would

key upside and downside considerations 
trade retaliation 
perhaps the most meaningful factor not accounted for the above the impact 
overall trade should border tax met with retaliatory action key trading partners 
leading materially lower growth business investment and consumption said 
differently should the adopt border adjustment taxation system how will 
viewed the rest the world the bat intended stave off base erosion yet that 
goal can only met all trading partners adopt possible that unilateral 
adoption such system would escalate tax competition would lead base 
erosion our trading partners income tax systems likely forcing follow adoption 
case point january was reported that finance ministers across the european 
union included the list countries viewed potential tax havens 
consider the following scenario 
take european pharmaceutical company that only sells into greater europe this 
company profitable and pays corporate income tax rate has business 
customer relationships the united states 
with border adjustable system this firm incentivized domicile its intellectual 
property and production the united states and license sell back europe 
the maximum marginal price 
the both the property investment and the revenue from exports will 
untaxed fact given the proposed policy the investment could even 
subsidized the 
selling licensing back into europe either related third party the 
maximum marginal price the rate now low zero profit margin will reduce the 
company income tax burden and increase profits and will erode the european tax 
base 
the cash flow nature the proposed corporate tax reform the has been disputed 
many trade lawyers non compliant with wto rules considering that these rules 
not permit border adjustability direct taxes such income taxes but only indirect 
taxes see taxes knowing half the battle december there are also 
compliance concerns over the proposed border adjustment and labor cost deductions 
the wto could therefore potentially impose trade sanctions the 
rising risk protectionism measuring the impact analyzed the potential impact 
any meaningful changes trade policy the and included potential 
retaliatory responses from our trading partners while this note focused more the 
relationship specifically between the and china modeling tariff with like forlike retaliation provides similar results when modeling bat with retaliation this 
scenario initial decline imports partially offsets lower exports with gdp lower 
after one year higher inflation the first year after the policies are 
implemented around weighs domestic demand business investment falls 
below the baseline after one year and consumption falls below the baseline 
wealth effects 
another key risk the near term erosion net wealth there are called sector winners 
and losers border adjustability regime such one might expect that financial 
wealth could affected should the market cap across the losers outweigh that the 
winners and assuming investors reward the winners and punish the losers prior 
analysis have noted that absent full foreign exchange offset border adjustability 
will benefit net exporters and hinder net importers retailers and multinationals with 
international supply chains are particularly exposed see border adjustability how 
tax reform could boon for usd december 
unfortunately there not deep pool academic work looking into the wealth effect 
border adjustment february note alan auerbach berkeley robert 
burch center for tax policy and public finance has taken stab and estimates the 
upper bound losses roughly gdp little more than trillion this 
estimate assumes immediate border adjustment with increase the dollar 
against all other currencies that eye popping figure and auerbach contends that 
the loss could considerably smaller given that adjustments have not been made for 
derivative hedging foreign currency risk foreign ownership corporate foreign 
portfolio investment 
the only conclusion made here that there could negative wealth effect 
associated with border adjustability regime and this only adds considerable 
uncertainty around projections the macroeconomic impact corporate tax reform 
interest deductibility 
limiting the tax deductibility net corporate interest expense the potential net impact 
tax reform that eliminates limits the interest expense deduction new debt could 
have material downside impacts the above analyses the extent this downside and 
potential for full mitigation function offsetting impacts from declines statutory 
tax rates see election losing interest october 
our prior note illustrates the macroeconomic impacts under the assumption that the 
interest expense reduction completely eliminated and the current statutory rate 
lowered this scenario gdp growth rises above the baseline and more 
sizeable direct effects are seen real business equipment and structures investment 
which rise above the baseline and respectively therefore corporate tax 
reform that includes border adjustable element with the loss limitations 
interest deductibility could see further mitigating support from lower statutory rate 
immediate expensing 
potentially mitigating the effects the above three factors immediate expensing 
capital investment tax reform component that believe enjoys broad support and 
seen way reform business taxes without hampering investment see taxes 
knowing half the battle december corporate tax reform allows for 
immediate expensing front while the tax cuts are phased then investment costs 
can deducted today higher tax rate than the rate which cash flow taxed 
later this creates incentive for capex that could boost business investment our 
simulations all else equal 
important caveat ultimately immediate expensing incompatible with interest 
deductibility the interest deduction would then result subsidization debtfinanced capital investment 
regulation 
finally remiss didn recognize the potential benefits deregulation 
exogenous factor that could mitigate the negative effects tax reform while 
somewhat outside the scope this analysis delivered tandem could lessen the 
broader fundamental concerns detailed herein 
our financials team led betsy graseck believes that regulatory easing will come 
over the next months new agency heads are put place see banks executive 
order signals intent but new agency heads will lead the way february 
banks widen the credit box the increased economic activity associated with the 
expansion household debt could mitigate some the downside risk for the consumer 
from border adjustment tax 
consumer revolving credit grew year over year december from 
december regulatory changes lead lenders expand the credit box and the 
pace consumer revolving and mortgage credit growth picks further estimate 
that this could boost growth total about the effects begin coming 
through early enough the year 
example increase the pace consumer revolving credit growth 
would incrementally add about billion nominal consumer spending power real 
terms all this expanded credit were directly consumer spending would 
add about real consumer spending growth this year and about real 
gdp growth 
likewise easier regulations could also benefit mortgage lending annualized growth 
household mortgages averaged over the first three quarters 
increase the pace home mortgage growth would incrementally add just 
under billion nominal home buying power assuming about half this goes 
fund purchases new homes real terms this would add about residential 
investment growth this year and about overall real gdp growth 
corporate credit impact 
adam richmond meghan robson vishwas patkar todd castagno 
thinking about the fundamental impact the various proposals the border 
adjustment tax system start noting two points 
any such proposals would increase uncertainty significantly our view the market 
under appreciates the many unintended consequences such dramatic change 
the corporate tax code 
the border adjustment mechanism only one component broader tax reform 
the loss interest deductibility immediate expensing capital investment and 
lower tax rates would all affect companies well many cases opposing 
ways 
the tax system were put place without adequate phase think uncertainty 
would magnified and the market would start react the potential negative 
unintended consequences quickly consumer prices would likely rise margins for 
importers would fall while margins for exporters would rise would see major 
disruptions supply chains with certain importers the extreme struggling survive 
and hit net foreign assets addition the possibility retaliation other 
countries top potential fed response rising inflation would likely impact 
sentiment well 
absent full foreign exchange offset border adjustability would will likely create 
winners and losers benefitting net exporters and hindering net importers 
potential beneficiaries net exporters agriculture energy chemicals and materials 
industries stand benefit the near term however believe companies that can 
leverage high value intellectual property sold large international customer bases will 
benefit the most the long run specifically software media pharma biotech and ipintensive industrial firms see below for more background 
most risk industries with high net import content such apparel retailers 
consumer and industrial electronics industries and services may most negatively 
impacted manufacturers and importers price elastic goods and services and where 
supply chains and labor supply are relatively immobile may find difficult adjust 
their business models the new regime 
for further discussion and analysis please see our border tax exposure guide february 
key issue with the house current plan the inadequate proposed treatment 
business losses net exporters and capital intensive firms abnormal growth stages 
would incur more frequent and greater taxable losses relative today income based 
tax system conceivable that net exporter may never generate domestic taxable 
income deal with this conundrum the gop blueprint proposes that operating losses 
carried forward indefinitely with compensating return for inflation however this 
likely insufficient policy without immediate rebates the inability monetize losses 
breaks the symmetry the border adjustment mechanism where imports will bear the 
full burden the import tax but exports will only recognize partial subsidy this 
produces unintended consequences and may lead perverse corporate behavior such 
activity and the creation special purpose joint venture entities motivated 
primarily import export balancing 
now there are certainly some positive attributes the border adjustment tax would 
get rid the incentive transfer profits outside the and could incentivize 
domestic production well capex spending more broadly the bat were phased 
over time some the negative consequences listed above could mitigated with 
companies having time figure out what works and what does not however even 
this case see some potential for unintended consequences for example the 
border adjustment were phased but the dollar appreciated immediately 
anticipation the tax change the short term benefit could flip from exporters 
importers with the latter benefitting from the dollar rise yet not facing the border 
adjustment right away 
phased bat think capex spending would trend higher but potentially not 
much some believe the one hand mentioned above the bat incentivizes 
production and full expensing capital investment would push companies towards 
higher capex spending addition deregulation well rising corporate confidence 
could drive similar outcome 
the other hand remind investors that until tax reform passed and even for 
some time afterwards uncertainty will remain very elevated first are skeptical that 
companies would ramp spending major way least until the details tax 
reform were crystal clear second confidence could turn very quickly some point 
later this year the market feels like policy makers are under delivering third and most 
importantly companies have not spent capex for years despite the fact that they 
have been able borrow for almost nothing yes confidence improving and that 
matters but are also later the cycle with leverage even higher and rates rising 
given these dynamics companies have chosen hold back spending the past why 
would that now change major way least until demand actually picks short 
are hesitant forecast large increase speculative capex 
also push back the growing consensus view that the loss interest deductibility 
would benefit corporates driving lower leverage and significantly lower bond 
issuance see reality bites january for our full thoughts the topic but 
short while think the loss interest deductibility would incentivize modestly 
lower leverage the long term environment where animal spirits are rising are 
hesitant believe that companies will all sudden voluntarily delever their balance 
sheets usually when confidence highest late cycle debt growing fastest 
think the market under appreciates the short term headwinds such change 
leverage has risen for years part because low rates and yet even with rates 
such low levels earnings growth has been anemic all sudden the ability 
deduct interest expense goes away current leverage levels would become even less 
manageable the argument that interest deductibility going away beneficial for 
corporates like saying that the rises credit markets will win because 
companies will issue less debt yes this true supply would lower but the pain for 
levered corporate balance sheets would more than offset the positive technical 
addition existing debt grandfathered then anything the short term supply 
could rise companies try issue bonds ahead the loss interest deductibility

corporate credit simply shorting credit broadly our view not the best hedge 
against the bat our view the border adjustment led broad based tightening 
financial conditions then credit would sell off but are not sure that credit would 
react much differently than other risk assets our view the right hedge one that

our view driven two key factors first based current pricing equity 
looks quite rich and priced for just two defaults over the next four years second

good historical analogy the time weakness autos was mostly 
idiosyncratic the cdx index went from april may 
relatively modest correction the equity tranche the same index fell almost

comprised the tail the portfolio the risk this trade that portfolio dispersion

rates tips for the rates market tax disappointment relative our base case would 
either involve less deficit financing than expect implying financing via another 
means like revenue raised from bat very little tax reform speak due 
delay and perhaps permanent one either way expectations for tighter fed policy 
should moderate scenario tax disappointment and nominal yield curve 
steepeners should benefit for investors looking position for 
inclusion bat the tax reform package suggest positioning breakeven 
flatteners receiving cpi swaps the risk this position the market pricing 
positive long term impact from tax regulatory reform this could lead inflation 
being priced further down the curve leading steeper breakeven curve this would 
amplified the fomc perceived too dovish over the long term 
opportunities tips however will depend the form disappointment tax 
reform delayed then would expect both real yields and breakeven inflation rates 
fall reversal the good inflation outcome that markets priced immediately 
after the election however tax disappointment arrives with bat then would 
expect markets price bad inflation outcome again one which real yields fall
