metals mining call 
implications proposed border 
adjustability 
the proposed border adjustability tax rule would positively 
impact metals and mining companies two ways first 
domestic producers would see price margin benefits foreign 
competitors are taxed the border second net exporters 
stand benefit from lower taxes 
take look how the potential border adjustability tax rule would affect 
companies our coverage universe although note that the passage the 
rule faces significant challenges and not include the benefits our base case 
estimates think steel companies would benefit the most followed coal 
companies while gold and metals company benefits would more muted our 
accounting tax team has done extensive work border adjustably tax reform 
see here 
steel companies are the clear winners under this plan under the border 
adjustability tax buyers steel would longer able deduct the cost 
imported steel from earnings which effectively creates tariff equal the 
corporate tax rate this would have the result raising domestic steel prices 
roughly the amount the new corporate tax rate which would greatly 
benefit domestic steel producers which have most their production and sales 
inside borders 
met coal producers should also benefit met coal production was 
exported exports would not taxed would make export tons 
more competitive thermal coal producers would see less benefit since most 
thermal coal sold domestically however there would some benefit 
global coal prices rise levels that are profitable for exports but limited port 
capacity would likely keep the industry from benefiting meaningfully 
the net exporter gold and copper and the gold companies and fcx 
would stand benefit from the border tax adjustability polices well since 
their exports would not taxed however note that the gold producers and 
fcx have many their assets outside the which would mute the benefit 
relative steel and coal companies 
similarly has large portion their assets outside the the benefits 
border adjustability are muted relative others furthermore could see 
some cost headwinds imports alumina for its smelters they could 
restart the port comfort alumina refinery but they would still need import
