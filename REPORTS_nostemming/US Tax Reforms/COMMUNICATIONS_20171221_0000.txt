service provider spend should improve after lumpier than expected but 
equipment vendors need well positioned for new network architectures 
the pauses from service provider should eventually lift while firstnet 
build could start early for the optical space inventory levels should 
clear china and lead some spending recovery but globally carrier capex will 
remain challenged many service providers continue exercise caution around 
low revenue growth and will favor equipment vendors best positioned help 
modernize networks and increase efficiencies see similar dynamic the 
enterprise side where customers will continue explore sdn and integrate 
networking with security strategies which should drive generally positive effect 
upgrade activity but particularly help those vendors with the breadth and 
product portfolio enable them 
post tax reform capital allocation flat profit industry will big theme 
investors have long anticipated the passage this week tax reform bill and 
generally expect companies our coverage universe primarily increase 
share repurchase activity for some stocks most notably csco large capital 
return programs could drive eps upside beyond what currently anticipated 
valuations but wonder least some the companies our coverage 
universe could better off exploring strategic despite improved network 
spend still anticipate relatively flat profit pools for the industry and 
companies struggling grow revenue may better off acquiring expand 
their addressable markets

stock appreciation checklist for quick reference our coverage universe and 
available levers drive stock prices 
our checklist square indicates that the market not yet anticipating the stock driver 
circle indicates the market partially anticipating the driver and deviations from 
current forecasts could impact the stock company positively negatively check mark

squares company has the more likely the stock can meaningfully appreciate our 
view 
share gains from new products despite market maturity most communications 
companies continue invest aggressively gain share core markets and push 
into adjacent markets there are exceptions this for example telephony and 
contact center markets are mature but cloud versions these products are still 
its infancy similarly the enterprise smartphone market mature but enterprise 
mobility management software still relatively young 
increased returns shareholders markets matured and company growth rates 
slowed investors including activists have pushed aggressively for increased cash 
returns many companies our coverage universe have responded with sizable 
buybacks and most still have substantial funds available given the size 
available buybacks and current fcf forecasts believe that increased cash 
returns shareholders are largely built into expectations and valuations across 
the group 
substantial opex cuts leverage typically these cuts leverage only come after 
substantial pain for stockholders while many the operating expense 
rationalization programs have taken place our space there are number

could realize synergies viav arrs comm additionally many the young

conditions look good for improvement service provider spend but still 
challenging space while overall globally carrier capex was was lumpier 
than expectations and many equipment vendors were caught off guard namely infn 
comm cien jnpr lite moving into some the roadblocks more 
consistent spending environment should clear driving rebound for certain vendors 
results for the optical space not expect conditions return peaks 
particularly terms profitability but think that spending should better 
than levels whole 
resolution the time warner and centurylink acquisitions 
dampened the spending environment particularly heading into the 
infn comm viav calx saw the biggest negative reactions this downturn 
particularly approvals for both these deals have dragged centurylink 
now closed and time warner appears coming closer 
resolution would expect both improve spending infn could see the biggest 
rebound from centurylink resuming spending though management cautious 
forecast the timing after false starts through most 
firstnet firstnet allocates and spectrum build interoperable 
public safety broadband network the united states march was 
granted authority build out firstnet and each state has the choice opt 
the program build out the network themselves opt opt out elections for the 
states and territories are due december this year and states have 
already elected opt firstnet build out should begin early next year and 
comm would see the most benefit our coverage universe comm has estimated 
revenue more the first year from this project total 
additionally has held off allocating additional spectrum until firstnet 
decisions are made which could drive bigger resurgence wireless spend for 
comm building could start early soon 
china inventory clears much the optical componentry space has been 
depressed the transition from backbone provincial build outs china 
did not planned the transition has been slower than expected and 
equipment vendors huawei and zte decided tighten cash cycles and work 
through inventory for much the year expect inventory clear heading into 
but not think spending levels will match and given maturing build 
needs prices paid for equipment will less than expected roadm buildouts are 
still opportunity but are not expecting huge rebounds spend that could 
see valuations return levels noted our optical cycle piece earlier 
this year valuations rarely return multiples seen peak even when china

meaningful size shouldn start until the period our research indicates that the 
ramp will more arduous than costs need come down 
explored our proprietary model permitting issues spectrum allocation regulatory 
buy and technical challenges not expect these issues resolved 
when sizable spend expected begin consequently believe the cycle will 
more elongated with smaller initial wireless spend compared previous cycles this 
odds with some investors views that could have synchronized ramp more

expect spend start with fixed wireless use cases the and europe whereas 
china use cases may focused more iot internet things are wrong and 
the cycle faster than are expecting would likely driven quicker rollouts 
china that spur global competitive reaction given deployment and cost issues are 
not large believe the amount invested will less than will have

sdn helps security and networking converge the exponential benefit combining 
networking and security efficiencies encapsulated our sdn concept

integrated with network functionalities which estimate could deliver much 
savings global enterprises given the relatively small cost networking 
the overall budget stack expect roi improvements with sdn will drive 
equipment replacement cycles for vendors that enable traffic visibility analytics and 
automation functionalities the push traffic growth alone has faded and without 
security killer app equipment life cycles will continue fade estimate that 
csco has spent acquiring companies that improve network traffic visibility 
analytics and automation capabilities the past two years csco holds leading share

attractive business mix shift however continued pressure memory pricing the 
cpe business and execution risk rkus integration leave cautious rerating 
near term 
lack positive earnings revisions has been biggest headwind for the stock something 
the continued pressure memory pricing expected prevent the near term 
view arris lack ability post upward estimate revisions the biggest inhibitor 
valuation growth over the last couple years situation don see abating for the 
next months arris gross margins have dropped the last year dram 
pricing has increased significantly and its ability pass pricing increases 
customers the video set top box stb portion its cpe customer premise 
equipment business has remained limited with our global semiconductor memory 
team expecting dram pricing continue increase for least the next six months 
and arrs buying memory months ahead time think will difficult for 
arrs avoid further gross margin pressure from memory pricing increases that 
will continue pressure ability post upward earnings revisions 
while like the ruckus icx acquisition are cautious about arris ability post 
upside early quarters another driver upward estimate revisions could the 
addition the ruckus icx business acquired for cash off the balance 
sheet while exhibit our report shows stabilization this business over the last 
months think that with coming generation change from there 
could pause purchasing ahead product released the additionally with 
arris typically acquiring consolidation targets are cautious its ability instantly 
optimize enterprise sales team overall like the rationale the transaction 
just think there little opportunity for upside that could create positive valuation 
impact until the 
cable investment cycle happening but difficult see impact near term have 
been positive arris over the last year given the impending docsis upgrade 
still think this positive earnings growth driver throughout much cable 
companies upgrade the speeds their networks compete with fiber but given 
memory pricing challenges and acquisition risk think this catalyst gets drowned out 
the near term 
with but like ability rate towards end year memory pressures 
and risk abate potential for earnings beats return mentioned view positive 
earnings revisions the greatest opportunity for sustained valuation moves for arris 
allowing trade more its traditional trading range ntm the range 
has been bounded for the last two years think that memory pricing and 
acquisition integration create headwinds that make organic revisions unlikely the near 
term and result are changing our ntm earnings 
eps the range has traded for the last two years could turn more positive 
the headwinds abate the biggest risk our call the meaningful flexibility for 
accretive share repurchases acquisitions the annual free cash flow 
affords arris view further downside the near term limited given dcf valuation

post tax change eps growth whereas they view the global industry china growing 
over that same time period mentioned previously ciena has executed well 
their strategy diversify revenue sources their product roadmap has given them the 
ability attract net new customers believe that they can achieve above market 
growth though fall the bottom end that range over the next three years from 
product advantages and benefits long investments new relationships but tend 
more reserved market growth however remain less optimistic ability 
achieve the operating margin target over that period just given the amount 
competition that exists the space general believe that above market growth 
will come slightly lower margins will come from net new customers meaning 
that for the company will either fall slightly short margin targets growth 
targets could prove too conservative our view margins software 
growth becomes more meaningful portion revenue new wins are more 
accretive than expected 
with ciena traction with new customers and categories packet 
networking webscale waveserver blue planet continue encouraging this 
expanded focus should help consistency results and help ciena outgrow the market 
however given levels competition within optical not see this enough reason 
for the multiple expand our eps which builds level 
conservatism the speed metro builds and discount for forecasting issues 
inherent cien from having larger customers have raised our account 
rolling forward estimates well more assumed top line growth from new wins 
could turn more positive were the pace international wins increase software
