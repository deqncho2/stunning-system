potential benefits from posited tax changes could substantial for media 
cable satellite presume that broad reduction corporate tax rate 
would require some revenue offsets enacted into law but exhibit 
illustrates very simple analysis which highlight the current multiple 
across our group and the impact from potential shift effective tax 
rate while the details behind any major overhaul tax policy are both 
important truly assessing the impact valuation our group there does 
seem real momentum towards broad reduction rates the majority 
companies under our coverage are profitable and have effective tax 
rate the largest potential benefits trading multiples said differently where 
pro forma eps leads potential material drop implied are seen siri 
rgc trco cmcsa cnk and ipg also discuss the net positive implications 
chtr which trades primarily fcf but also has sizable tax assets the 
impact high dividend payers including the exhibitors and the ooh reits and 
canadian domiciled lgf immediate expensing capital spending for tax 
purposes and indefinite carry forwards would particularly benefit capital 
intensive industries like cable and dish lowering cash taxes note that one 
many potential offsets earnings lift from lower tax rate could include 
reinvestment the additional profits into the business rather than dropping 
entirely net income and are not adjusting any price targets today given 
uncertainty around these changes 
potential for stronger economic cycle and inflation could lift advertising 
spending but note the potential negative impact rising rates and stronger 
usd morgan stanley economics team recently published its outlook 
faster reflation fatter tails which raised its outlook for gdp growth 
predicted rate hikes and expects move the 
trade weighted usd accurate these trends would all have 
implications for our stocks which qualitatively summarize exhibit 
generally advertising highly correlated both gdp and inflation 
stronger cycle would likely help our supported traditional media names 
including lamr out cbs and sni rising rates over time would likely negatively 
impact earnings fcf from the more levered stocks including lamr out

for our two reits out and lamr there are two somewhat countervailing possible 
changes tax policy worth nothing first the fcf conversion advantage relative 
non reits theory would drop overall corporate tax rates are reduced out and 
lamr could still see lower cash taxes paid result lower effective rate their 
trs income second and perhaps counterbalancing the reduction tax advantaged 
status for investors could come from broader harmonization personal income taxes 
which would serve actually increase the after tax yield reit dividend income for

benefit chtr fully taxed fcf from lower corporate tax rate fully offsets 
reduced near term value its tax assets our current forecast for chtr assumes 
not meaningful cash tax payer until largely due its significant nols 
our estimates the total value chtr tax assets which predominantly 
includes the tax shields from both its nols and the future conversion the bhn 
partnership units roughly calculate the value its tax assets

lgf earnings fcf unlikely benefit from lower corporate tax rate however 
tax reform could remove hypothetical dis synergy domiciled vancouver lgf 
already benefits from the lower canadian corporate tax rate our published forecast 
assumes that lgf strza pays minimus cash taxes over the next years and over 
the long term cash tax payer lgf stand alone and strza 
stand alone which modestly below the hypothetical level our analysis 
therefore would not expect lgf directly benefit from the rate reduction 
however lgf favorable tax position peers possibly creates dissynergy today hypothetically lgf were engage transaction that created 
greater exposure taxation the company could face higher effective tax rate 
therefore lower corporate tax rate might reduce eliminate this potential dissynergy and increase the odds that lgf could benefit from industry consolidation
