investors should note they may not receive full tax reform information perhaps 
expected the next earnings release filing the mix evolving tax and 
accounting requirements will likely create volatility key financial statement line 
items and metrics certain effects will booked before others and provisional 
amounts will require adjustment comparability key metrics between firms and 
within industries will reduced over the one year measurement period 
particular there high degree investor focus the measurement the 
deemed tax unremitted foreign earnings example such evolution 
december the treasury and the irs released notice defining what qualifies 
cash and investments for the upper effective deemed repatriation 
such expect disclosure and recognition the related liability may delayed for 
many companies there still uncertainty how apply the act

company facts and circumstances was not able determine reasonable 
estimate the tax liability for this item for the reporting period which the act was 
enacted the time that issues its financial statements for that reporting period that 
company did not have the necessary information available prepared analyzed 
develop reasonable estimate the tax liability for this item evaluate how the 
act will impact company existing accounting position indefinitely reinvest 
unremitted foreign earnings result company would not include provisional 
amount for this item its financial statements that include the reporting period which 
the act was enacted but would its financial statements issued for subsequent 
reporting periods that fall within the measurement period beginning with the first 
reporting period falling within the measurement period which the necessary 
information became available prepared analyzed order develop the reasonable 
estimate and ending with the first reporting period within the measurement period 
which company was able obtain prepare and analyze the necessary information 
complete the accounting under asc topic 
example assume similar fact pattern example however company was able 
determine reasonable estimate the income tax effects the act its 
unremitted foreign earnings for the reporting period which the act was enacted

period the act was enacted subsequent reporting period within the measurement 
period company was able obtain prepare and analyze the necessary information 
complete the accounting under asc topic which resulted adjustment

based application certain provisions the act company determines that 
reasonable estimate cannot made for the reporting period the act was enacted
