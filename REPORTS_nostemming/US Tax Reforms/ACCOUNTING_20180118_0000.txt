note performance methodology 
calculate performance computed year ahead monthly adjusted returns each december stock had returns for every 
month the following year just used that stock returns however stock return series terminated during the year 
substituted returns for the stock sector remaining months then compounded the stock sector monthly 
returns get annual returns the motivation for constructing these hybrid return series include many companies 
possible the highly underfunded cohorts where stock counts are often low next equal weighted these stocks 
calculate each group performance 
order compare performance between pension funding cohorts without sector biases constructed sector matched 
benchmarks for each cohort used the sector weights based the numbers stocks per sector the cohorts the 
end each year and equal weighted sector returns month the sector weights change yearly and vary pension funding 
cohort with these benchmarks can compare the performance underfunded cohorts with typical stocks with the same 
sector composition and see what extent the performance underfunded cohorts was driven sector allocations and what 
was due performance relative the sector
