corp conversion convert 
not convert that the 
question 
growing probability significant corp tax cuts make corp 
conversion the dominant debate wouldn surprised 
see most alts shed their partnership structure tax rates 
drop more positive equal weight apo less positive 
overweight oak top picks overweights 
lower tax world the shakespearean question for the alts convert 
not convert continue exist with discount broader market 
and discount traditional asset mgrs despite secular growth make 
entity level change whether more noble suffer the slings and arrows 
less investor friendly structure take arms against the sea troubles 
that limit the investor base and converting corp and improving 
governance end them see our esg framework here 
average our sum the parts valuation would increase alts 
convert corps tax rate current tax rate reflected our fee 
related earnings valuation and longer term our npv carry importantly this 
assumes benefit for multiple expansion from easier own corp 
structure our valuation approach has always assumed they convert the 
future but current tax rates sum the parts valuation would increase the 
most apo current sotp and and ares current 
sotp 
growing prospects for the biggest sweeping tax law change decades raises 
the probability that alts may convert from current partnership structure 
corporation recall the alts are currently structured partnership that 
enhances economics with single layer taxation but the structure limits the 
investor base given the complexities around partnership tax reporting 
however converting corp structure could expand the investor base and 
drive multiple expansion previously estimated potential multiple 
expansion turns more with the higher end the new structure leads 
index inclusion corporate tax cuts may just the catalyst drive change 
lower corporate tax rate could make corp conversion more 
appealing than the past the tax leakage would less than converting 
today tax rate

what would take convert from partnership corp signing form and mailing 
the irs don expect conversion drive legal entity restructuring and should 
fairly straight forward process however expect some extra time care would 
taken the back end ensure credit facilities and isda agreements among others 
are not impacted the more time consuming part the process would making the 
determination convert not once the decision made wouldn surprised 
see conversion completed less than months the wild card today uncertainty 
around what final tax bill would include and the time frame for passage 
ares apo and are most likely convert our view they have greater tax 
leakage higher tax rates today via greater earnings skew management fees 
ares apo broadly less tax efficient structure multiple expansion 
about turn would offset the hit earnings from higher tax payments for the group 
see details inside 
index inclusion possible corp but less likely alts convert with dual share 
class structure and russell recently made changes their criteria exclude from 
their benchmarks stocks that have dual share classes msci has yet make decision 
while major customers the indices blk ishares have publically opposed such 
restrictions arguing that narrower universe index eligible stocks could hinder 
performance passive etfs 
more positive equal weight apo see among the most upside our valuation 
tax rate fee related earnings valued multiple our sum the parts 
contribute our apo valuation for which currently use tax rate fee 
related earnings tax rates fall could see apo valuation near shares 
today less positive overweight oak expansionary fiscal policies could 
extend the economic cycle and result less opportunities for distressed focused money 
mgrs 
top picks overweight and bx innovation machine should drive 
differentiated growth and premium multiple with expanding pipeline new 
initiatives and momentum growing for their newer businesses see upside 
estimates cg accelerating growth fee related earnings over the next months 
combined with consistent and growing performance fees and resolution legacy issues 
should drive the stock higher our view

corp conversion 
converting corp would reduce earnings power but the alts would only need multiple expansion average offset the earnings drag recall the alts are 
structured pass through partnerships today with minimal entity level taxation the 
average tax rate about they converted corp tax rate they only 
require turns multiple expansion offset the higher tax rate and keep current 
valuation unchanged the corporate tax rate were then they require about multiple expansion fully offset the earnings drag 
apo and would require the least multiple expansion offset corporate tax 
rate while would require the most multiple expansion 
reduction corporate tax rates would result less tax leakage and reduce the cost 
moving from single layer taxation double taxation structure while investors 
would give economics the process the new business structure would command 
higher valuation multiple
