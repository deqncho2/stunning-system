see wrap tax december for the full takeaways from our 
public policy team and fixed income and equity strategists this update 
the forecasts presented our economic outlook ringing 
year november 
three key items have affected the forecast relative our year ahead base 
case year tax cuts deficit expansion appear higher potential 
for modest further growth defense and disaster spending modestly 
more stimulative policy mix evidenced deeper corporate than personal 
tax rate cut expectations moreover assume additional response 
from monetary policy financial conditions 
the impact the deficit gdp ratio front loaded raising our 
forecast and 
have raised our gdp growth forecast additional 
gdp growth lifted 
this brings the total gdp fiscal impulse 
personal income tax cuts contribute the biggest delta real 
disposable income gets earlier lift any additional impulse 
investment kicks with lag around mid the consumer 
impulse fades while investment remains supported permanently 
lower tax rate 
fiscal policy lifts aggregate demand well supply side factors 
leaving room for faster growth without greater spillover inflation 
pressures our core inflation forecast calling for mild rise remains 
unchanged amid low inflation assume the fed does not feel the 
need hike faster and continue look for three rate hikes next year

forecast changes nutshell 
have raised our gdp growth forecast additional 
gdp growth lifted 
the upward revision growth top estimated impact already 
included our year ahead outlook baseline this brings the total gdp fiscal impulse 
though the tax bill lifts growth further and compared with the previous 
baseline the shape growth remains the same much the fiscal impulse absorbed 
then less the initial impact fades before growth slows across

the inherent uncertainty multipliers 
perhaps the quote the year regarding fiscal stimulus came from federal reserve 
board governor lael brainard when she said generally fiscal stimulus that expands 
spending and investment directly targeted households and businesses that have 
the greatest propensity spend rather than save can expected generate the 
largest response aggregate demand what governor brainard referring the 
multiplier effect various policies the field economics blend science theory 
and art estimating multipliers falls the realm art 
even hindsight difficult discern exactly what the multiplier effects tax policy 
have been the congressional budget office cbo published what estimated 
the multipliers from the major provisions within the american recovery and 
reinvestment act arra you can see exhibit the results are wide ranging with 
the lowest multipliers assigned cuts for higher income people and onetime payments 
retirees both groups are high savers while larger multipliers were assigned

truth the exact impact changes tax policy may never known massive 
overhauls the tax code are not common the the last one occurring three 
decades ago the implicit multiplier extract from our updated forecast about 
the critical uncertainty corporate behavior the growth impulse from tax reform could 
strengthen corporations spend more their returned dollars than we assuming 
despite what our tax policy strategists see relative static incentives see 
wrap tax december hence will vigilant for signs such behavior 
and adjust views accordingly 
the deficit 
our updated estimates see the budget deficit widening from gdp fiscal year 
and expansion per year and 
wider than our prior estimates exhibit while the majority the update the result 
more front loaded tax package that will implemented earlier than expected 
about the change also reflects expectations for even larger spending 
disaster relief and national defense compared with our previous baseline 
the overall deficit impact the tax cuts and jobs act roughly expected but its 
distribution more front loaded than assumed according the jct score nearly 
the trillion static deficit expansion over the year budget window will 
effect within the first two fiscal years enactment and moreover earlier 
passage means the effects are longer spread out over and but fully 
impact the budget deficit from the start calendar year 
also expect additional deficit spending from third round disaster relief and 
increased defense spending according politico the white house has requested 
additional funding for disaster relief which combined with the 
already approved would amount almost total aid assume there will 
minor spending cuts that partially offset this amount and that spread over two 
years 
terms defense spending press reports indicate that republicans may able 
raise the budget caps around both and with overseas 
contingency operations adding additional spending per year such

also update our forecasts for the current account balance exhibit now see 
the current account deficit remaining gdp and narrowing slightly

revision reflects several offsetting factors one hand increased aggregate demand 
results higher imports and wider trade deficit the other hand and detail

personal saving rate throughout our forecast horizon 
measuring the growth impact 
january implementation means that all workers should begin receiving greater 
take home pay early february earlier than our base case such the biggest 
lift gdp comes from greater consumer spending than previously forecast not all 
the higher take home pay will saved investment also higher lower 
corporate tax rate than previously assumed while our analysis shows that investment 
has already inflected higher the from corporates reacting organically 
investment incentives amid plenty cashflow see the productivity pickup who

forecast horizon our estimates are consistent with rise the personal saving 
rate with the saving rate remaining higher over the remainder the 
forecast horizon exhibit the wealthier households that tend dictate 
the savings rate maki and the potential impact the changes tax 
policy are less certain for those income groups such additional take home pay for 
the upper income groups likely saved and spending may remain cautious overall 
until clarity about the impact various tax changes can gained this may not come 
until the tax season 
for many middle lower income households much the extra take home pay will 
likely spent general goods and services historical spending and savings patterns

below are excerpts from chair yellen following the december meeting the 
federal open market committee fomc regarding tax policy 
chair yellen and the consensus fiscal policy december fomc 
most participants incorporated fiscal assumptions their forecasts 
most colleagues factored the prospect fiscal stimulus along the lines 
what being contemplated congress into their projections 
think colleagues and are line with the general expectation among most 
economists that the type tax changes that are likely enacted would tend 
provide some modest lift gdp growth the coming years 
those assumptions included both demand and supply side dynamics 
colleagues and mainly see the likely tax package boosting aggregate demand 
but also having some potential boost aggregate supply changes the 
corporate tax side the reduction the corporate tax rate expensing will lower the 
cost capital and while there are range estimates and uncertainty about how 
much stimulus that will provide investment general would see some stimulus 
investment 
terms aggregate supply effects stronger pace investment could boost 
capital formation and thereby raise productivity growth and potential gdp 
output some extent exactly how large those effects might remain uncertain 
but that channel suppose also possible uncertain how significant this 
would be that lower marginal effective tax rates for those groups that will see 
them could boost labor supply 
the impact tax policy had little effect the monetary policy outlook 
the extent that there are larger impacts than those analyses assume 
aggregate supply potential gdp the context economy that has had 
disturbingly low productivity growth that would welcome and could support 
faster gdp growth least for some period without creating need tighten 
monetary policy offset that there are potentially both demand and supply 
effects here importantly you really don the end the day see very much 
change the federal funds rate path 
continue think you can see from the projections that gradual path rate 
increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants now factoring their 
impact the tax policy 
generally you see modestly faster growth over the next couple years which 
consistent and said think for most participants reflects partly impact from 
taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending but not gigantic increase 
growth relative september you see lower path for unemployment but 
remember that inflation has also been running low persistent basis and the 
committee does have concern about inflation you might think well shouldn see 
more well okay growth little stronger the unemployment rate runs bit lower 
that would perhaps push the direction slightly tighter monetary policy but 
again counterbalancing that that inflation has run lower than expected and 
you know could take longer period very strong labor market order 
achieve the inflation objective
