repatriation appears have good chance being enacted 
but the magnitude financial impact would relative 
company size and cash positions and detailed rules are tbd

repatriation would positive but fundamental outlooks are most important 
for stocks and may benefit targets more than acquirers access more 
cash the would yield greater capital allocation flexibility but most 
companies fundamental stock investment theses would remain unchanged 
competition for small mid size candidates could intense and drive high 
bids for desirable assets targets would likely benefit more than acquirers megadeals would still require companies take significant debt and issue 
shares have knowledge any discussions for any our 
companies see our dec report biopharma likely key theme 
current cash relatively small fraction market caps estimate 
that the eight mega cap pharma and biotech companies collectively hold 
cash representing combined market cap these eight 
amgn has the highest estimated cash percentage market 
capitalization abbv and pfe have the lowest exhibit 
repatriation proposals are mandatory taxes would apply historical earnings 
rather than the actual cash pulled into the the government would like 
realize taxes unremitted foreign earnings and encourage companies shift 
cash into the under both ryan and trump proposals companies would 
likely have pay taxes all unremitted earnings regardless whether cash 
actually repatriated practice known deemed mandatory repatriation 
trump proposes flat tax while ryan proposes tax cash and 
tax non cash earnings 
cash investments percentage estimated unremitted earnings 
varies dramatically unremitted earnings figures can only estimated dec 
hence calculated cash unremitted earnings 
the average and the range from for bmy for amgen exhibit 
earnings not equal existing cash because most cash generated over the 
past several years has already been invested companies for some companies 
the mandatory tax could eat portion their current cash hand 
are generally not expecting companies borrow money repatriate

more than current cash hand some did unless they choose 
lever for unlike voluntary tax holiday which taxed only the cash 
that was actually repatriated during short window both trump and ryan are 
proposing deemed mandatory repatriation historical unremitted foreign 
earnings hence under the new proposals taxes would levied regardless 
whether not the cash actually repatriated presumably companies would 
have leeway decide when bring back earnings which they have already 
paid taxes they could repatriate future cash flow over time raising debt 
repatriate would not necessary unless companies wanted lever 
pursue additionally some tax reform proposals passed would 
permanently eliminate the benefit keeping cash overseas trump wants 
eliminate tax deferral while ryan wants territorial tax system which future 
earnings and cash flow that are repatriated would not taxed see our

unremitted earnings math 
there are two types unremitted earnings indefinitely reinvested and not indefinitely 
reinvested 
unremitted earnings intended indefinitely permanently reinvested overseas 
for which there associated deferred tax liability dtl the balance sheet this 
figure disclosed companies 
unremitted earnings not intended indefinitely reinvested overseas company 
discloses these earnings some disclose the deferred tax liability associated with the 
earnings note that companies who report dtls unfortunately not disclose the tax 
rate foreign earnings that yielded the dtl 
unremitted earnings not indefinitely reinvested are tricky estimate 
companies not disclose these figures one must take the deferred tax liability 
dtl and divide the difference between the statutory tax rate and 
estimated rate paid the foreign earnings because the rate not disclosed 
theoretical math example calculate the denominator subtract from theoretical 
estimated foreign tax rate which yields divide the dtl back into 
the extra unremitted earnings the dtl the extra unremitted earnings figure
