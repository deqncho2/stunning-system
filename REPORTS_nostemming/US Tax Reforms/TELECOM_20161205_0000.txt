tax reform helps telecom much the initial post election focus telecom 
investors was the regulatory implications particularly for merger approvals 
and topics like net neutrality the macro side the back rates and 
expectations for fed tightening also took center stage going forward seems 
increasingly likely that broad based tax reform may one the most 
important potential benefits the election for telecom stocks the telecom 
sector well positioned benefit with primarily domestic earnings streams 
moderate leverage levels most cases and high levels capex see 
meaningful upside eps levels particularly and verizon while some 
the rural carriers may face some pressures cash flow implications are somewhat 
less clear but should also positive particularly given ongoing accelerated 
depreciation for capex 
what the plan with control the white house and both bodies congress 
the republicans appear set push hard for broad based tax reform 
while this will not easy seems possible that deal can reached the 
summer with possible implementation for the details remain murky and 
will likely shift significantly over the coming months the trump campaign 
proposed corporate tax rate while the ryan brady house tax plan rolled 
out last summer envisaged rate order pay for this may see limits 
deductibility interest expenses well significant changes related 
international taxation border adjustability including non deductibility 
imports communications equipment smartphones etc the tax reform would 
likely include bonus depreciation element 
eps boost for many telcos estimate that and verizon could see 
double digit eps boost with smaller gains for other carrier but not 
everybody may win some the rlecs such frontier and windstream have 
high levels interest expense relative pre tax profit which could mean that 
any broad based limitation interest deductions could potentially more than 
offset the lower corporate tax rate benefits 
plenty wild cards the devil the details 
timing will finally get broad based tax reform summer 
when would take effect 
what will the new corporate tax rate 
would interest deductibility lost partially lost what sort phase 
transition mechanism would enacted 
would capex fully partially deductible year one 
what about the reit sector 
what about taxes tax deduction imported equipment smartphones 
etc under border adjustability model

most positively affected 
and verizon estimate that and verizon could see mid high 
teens boost reported eps assuming corporate tax rate and the 
loss interest expense deductibility this would lower their multiple 
about two turns the bells benefit from heavy concentration revenues 
and investment grade status limiting the drag from loss interest deductibility 
note this analysis excludes any impact the proposed time warner merger for 
year one deductibility capital spending could also help enhance 
cash flow generation would expect the companies primarily direct any 
surplus funds toward deleveraging given their medium term leverage targets 
other beneficiaries 
centurylink centurylink standalone should see estimated boost 
eps under our base case scenario the higher leverage reduces the eps 
accretion relative the bells nevertheless lower tax rate would very 
helpful sustaining cash flows their nols expire 
mobile currently mobile does not expect pay cash taxes before 
but lower tax rate should boost eps perhaps helping lower 
the multiple and lower tax rate would boost cash flows shareholders 
over the medium long term 
tds usm these companies have relatively high interest expense compared 
operating profit which would likely lead fairly modest eps accretion 
assuming the loss interest deductibility 
limited impacts 
zayo zayo expects pay material cash taxes before while the 
relatively high leverage limits any benefit reported eps 
level prior centurylink merger level significant nol balance limits any 
near term cash flow benefit although the company could see boost 
reported eps from proposed tax changes 
reits data centers towers communications sales and leasing would get 
some modest benefit relating their taxable reit subsidiaries will important 
watch any developments impacting the reit sector under any new tax plan 
potential negative impacts 
the regional wireline carriers could face some challenges the lower corporate 
tax rate funded loss interest deductibility given their relatively high 
leverage levels 
frontier frontier could potentially see reduction net income potentially 
driven into loss position due higher tax bill currently their 
annual interest expense creates significant tax shield 
windstream windstream another company benefitting from significant tax 
shield from interest deductibility
