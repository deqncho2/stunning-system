here are key takeaways for investors congress heads back into 
session 
congress faces urgent complex and intertwined list 
september 
congress needs raise the debt ceiling the end the month fund appropriations 
september pass authorizations key government programs including the 
national flood insurance program and will likely pass funding package for hurricane 
harvey relief the political considerations surrounding each these list items are 
complex and intertwined with various political factions looking use each fiscal action 
bargaining chips achieve more difficult goals entitlement spending reform border 
wall funding etc call the fiscal scrum the unpredictable negotiating dynamic 
created interconnected but see disorganized processes appropriations 
prevent government shutdown raising the debt ceiling and tax reform 
september the day which treasury has urged congress raise the debt 
ceiling 
september pass appropriations fund the government most likely 
continuing resolution through the end the year 
september pass reauthorization the national flood insurance program 
federal aviation administration and the children health insurance program 
soon possible pass supplemental appropriations for disaster relief funding 
for those affected hurricane harvey 
later the fall pass budget resolution with reconciliation instructions for tax 
reform 
later the fall raise budget control act spending caps for funding 
levels 
december pass appropriations before continuing resolution runs out 
expect temporary extension government funding 
combined with disaster relief funding raising the debt ceiling 
with only legislative days september expect congress will pass temporary 
measure and push off political debates until the end the year while the president 
and some members congress had angled for shutdown over border wall funding 
republican congressional leadership has stated repeatedly that they did not want 
shutdown and absolutely would raise the debt ceiling the need pass disaster relief 
may provide the face saving factor that allows conservative factions pass large bill 
with all those measure combined that they would otherwise oppose consider 
freedom caucus chair rep mark meadows stated last week that would not 
seek spending cuts pay for hurricane harvey aid that would support 
continuing resolution through the end the year without border wall funding 
allowing congress more time negotiate appropriations 
omb director mick mulvaney stressed lawmakers that funding appropriations 
for harvey may impact the time frame during which congress needs lift the debt 
ceiling dynamic was also highlighted our economists their recent note 
getting handle harvey 
this sets shutdown and debt ceiling risks for with 
tax reform and the border wall flashpoints 
while press reports indicate that the desire provide disaster funding may allow the 
parties push pass this current fiscal scrum expect the same dynamic will 
resurface later this year rather than disappear previously discussed the political 
considerations around each the items the fall list create unpredictable 
negotiation dynamic between the parties and inside each party post financial crisis this 
has tended catalyzed economic uncertainty market volatility and risk off sentiment

not clear this point congress will opt raise the debt ceiling for the same 
length the continuing resolution keep the issues together past the 
midterm elections which would best case scenario 
other policy debates watch 
watch the wall shutdown happens later the year conflict over funding the 
presidential demand for border wall would the most likely cause our view 
bca caps are additional hurdle congress faces constraining caps defense 
and non defense discretionary spending unless passes legislation raise the 
caps has been done years past democrats and republicans worked together 
the past raise the caps for defense and non defense equally but may 
challenge this year 
miscellaneous demands far the debt ceiling shutdown debate the freedom 
caucus has floated demanding billion mandatory spending cuts codifying 
the one regulation two regulations out order and adding debt prioritization 
language debt limit increase democrats have floated authorizing csr 
payments insurers these demands won necessarily away they could 
resurface any time 
delayed deliberations government funding support our 
delayed and diluted tax reform thesis 
pushing the complex politicking around government funding into uses legislative 
capacity further crowding out potential tax reform deliberations this syncs with our 
delayed and diluted view tax reform don think will happen until and 
when does will fall meaningfully short original fiscal stimulus and tax cut level 
ambitions see summer the swamp june further affirms that risks remain 
the long side terms timing 
market implications risk catalysts deferred rates catalysts 
play 
previously discussed the deferral key policy debates also defers key catalyst 
that could have activated volatility and risk asset weakness september will 
monitor policy deliberations closely determine when such catalysts may come back 
into play likely the end the year 
the meantime raising the debt ceiling catalyzes substantial bill issuance treasury 
aims get the cash balance back more normal preferred level quickly 
billion cash balance the end december after having cut billion 
september that means billion additional borrowing top the 
underlying deficit boosting the total borrowing estimate billion current 
coupon auction sizes continued through getting billion total borrowing 
would require billion net bill supply however congress only raises 
the debt ceiling until the end the year suspends until year end with 
requirement that the cash balance drops back current levels the end the 
suspension treasury will not have enough room raise the cash balance above 
billion 
their recent note central bankers set the tone our rates team stated that the 
debt ceiling suspended raised sufficiently allow the treasury spend until the 
end the year beyond sep and oct bill yields should converge and thus they 
recommend buying the oct paper selling the sep paper additionally their 
note usd liquidity into year end august the rates team stated that 
increased bill issuance raise treasury cash balance stands reduce money 
market fund cash available for repo lending this likely tighten funding conditions 
and put upwards pressure repo rates swap spreads are likely tighten the 
treasury follows through with its plan increased bill issuance 
endnotes 
the hill august 
abc news august 
politico august 
the end june there were billion bills outstanding that would more than increase three months even 
every coupon auction size tips were raised billion october and held the higher levels thereafter getting 
billion total borrowing would require billion new bill supply see that magnitude increased coupon supply 
auctions each month raised billion october and held there months billion more gross coupon supply being about 
what will needed total over the course fiscal year big coupon supply boosts are likely come some point but takes 
some time for coupon size boosts have large cumulative impact enormous borrowing estimate means bills need fill the 
gap predominantly initially
