forecast highlights 
our year ahead outlook revised upward our gdp growth 
forecast for and attribute 
that faster pace real personal consumption 
expenditures than previously estimated 
stronger outlook pulls faster pace rate hikes from the fed 
but the household balance sheet largely protected against 
rising interest rates 
the back likely tax reform personal disposable income holds 
despite slower job growth this development now allows 
households maintain level pace spending compared with the 
slowdown had previously anticipated 
lower income households tend have higher marginal propensity 
consume out tax savings while higher income households will 
save more the aggregate historical evidence suggests 
households will spend little less than the tax cuts 
after growing estimated real pce 
growth now follows similar pattern rising 
and 
the quarterly pattern for growth real pce inflects higher starting 
the anticipation personal income tax cuts builds 
higher consumer confidence and income expectations will likely lead 
faster pace debt accumulation expressed rising balances 
revolving credit credit cards 
discretionary spending categories that exhibit high income elasticity 
demand should benefit most from tax reform breathing new life 
into consumer durables and stretching out the cycle travel related 
spending also gets lift

the personal income tax blueprint 
january president trump will preside over unified republican 
congress believe his economic agenda likely provide needed boost 
growth with positive inflection later tax reform expect 
trump use the power the pulpit curb the influence the deficit hawks 
his party achieves personal income tax reform that adds the deficit and 
therefore effectively stimulus but not the degree his original proposal 
the size have presumed gdp year this makes 
trump tax cut more line with the size and scope the gop paul ryan 
lueprint order give those same hawks some amount rhetorical cover 
assume the cuts come and recognize the risk earlier delivery 
ryan blueprint that are using rough guide aims consolidate the tax 
brackets and lower overall rates resulting tax code that simpler fairer 
and flatter dynamic analysis the tax foundation concluded that the 
distribution changes after tax income look fairly even around average 
for all taxpayers but skews higher for the top taxpayers and 
beyond 
while lower income groups tend spend one dollar for every dollar tax 
savings upper income groups tend have much lower marginal propensity 
consume and save good deal the tax cuts across all income groups 
expect the multiplier average out less than line with the findings 
economists the imf 
among other details ryan plan collapses the number tax brackets from 
seven three and lowers the top individual income tax rate from top 
rate taxes capital gains and dividends ordinary income the 
alternative minimum tax eliminated well the estate tax eliminates all 
standard itemized deductions with the exception charitable donations and

balance sheets and rising interest rates 
this business cycle when the fed finds itself the position normalize policy more 
quickly expect later the interest expense incurred households should 
not rise materially historically rising interest rates have increased the cost carrying 
household debt significantly quickly cutting into disposable personal income and 
causing knee jerk reaction among households pull back spending today 
households are sitting nearly unprecedented counter cyclical balance sheet with 
little interest rate exposure 
facing economy that expected grow beyond its potential think policymakers 
will remain cautious first continuing pursue gradual path and letting the 
economy build pressure before normalizing policy more quickly after having raised 
rates december now expect the fed raise rates twice september 
and december then three more times year end target range
