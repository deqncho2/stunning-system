executive summary 
have initial window into how the republicans plan pay 
tribution annual limit from the current this yet 
for corporate and individual tax reform the chairman mark 
another potential source revenue that republicans may consider 
first draft the proposed tax legislation released recent weeks 
pass tax reform legislation 
just the starting point what sure tense negotiation 
between congress the white house and various industry lobbying 
similar the health care debate there opposition from more 
groups expect the ongoing debate around rothification con 
conservative members who like see more muted deficit 
tinue through committee markups the potential revenue ranges 
impact currently added the deficit over years and from 
between over years according our analysis and 
members who represent higher taxed states etc whose 
multiple media reports 
constituents would affected provisions related state and 
local tax deductions additionally the day the house bill was 
the stiffer the opposition the brady draft house version the 
released industry groups including the nfib national small business 
more likely rothification becomes our view lowering the cap 
lobby voiced opposition for various reasons opposition also not 
pretax contributions retirement accounts which would likely 
limited members the house some gop senators have voiced 
drive savers into roth iras was not included the house version 
concern over the initial proposal 
the bill but the debate likely remain fluid eliminating all pretax 
contributions could produce nearly billion pay fors and 
see potential outcomes relates rothification 
media reports suggest there are disagreements among house gop 
members certain pay fors currently included the bill leaving 
bull case language reducing the pretax contribution limit 
the door open for form rothification then chairman 
the tax bill and the current pretax contribution limit remains 
the ways and means committee dave camp proposed 
therefore there would impact gross industry 
cap pretax contributions there prior framework 
retirement flows related change retirement saver behavior 
which new plan could based 
contribution limits see this scenario more likely than our bear 
case full rothification given the political sensitivity the issue and 
not forgotten the senate has also introduced its version 
intense lobbying efforts against changes 
tax reform bill broadly the bills are similar that both reduce the 
corporate tax rate and streamline remove certain deductions 
base case the bill reduces the current pretax cap about half 
offset and pay for some the tax cuts there are major differences 
limit but also raises the total cap roth ira contributions 
though which will only complicate the path toward consensus 
help incentivize additional retirement savings any 
among the gop members specifically the senate bill would delay 
contributions over annually would with after tax dol 
the corporate tax rate rate until the house version 
lars the newly proposed limit this level 
but would also eliminate taxpayers ability deduct state and 
would expect gross retirement flow impact the industry 
local taxes the house version allows for property tax deduction 
over the next years about retirement industry flows 
neither bill its initial form included form rothifica 
would expect some debate initially new cap limit has 
tion however the aforementioned differences leave lot room 
been cited multiple media reports pretax cap and 
between the two chambers that must made via compromise 
new roth ira total cap but think the limit reason 
and keep open the possibility rothification reemerging 
able level that could politically convincing legislators and raise 
pay for 
enough revenue for broader reform making effective pay for 
recent development recent amendment introduced senate 
bear case full rothification eliminating the pretax contribution 
finance chairman orrin hatch would rothify all catch con 
altogether allowing only after tax dollars contributed and 
tributions that would fully tax the additional contributions 
raising the total roth ira cap similar level the base case 
those over years old are eligible make plans 
this were become law calculate negative 
slight offset the amendment proposes increase the catch con 
impact gross retirement flows over the next years about 
morgan stanley research 
retirement industry flows see this remote possibility 
given how politically challenging will for legislators coupled 
with intense lobbying efforts 
impact stocks cyprys dally any change the pretax contribution rate would impact trow lpla and wdr negatively within 
our coverage group retirement related assets make greater 
than their total assets the insurance side voya and pru 
are most exposed using market share data estimate less flow 
impact other traditional asset managers including blk ivz ben 
discount brokers schw amtd and etfc could also see impact

the irs data breaks pretax contribution down into ranges etc base our scenarios 
potential pretax caps and higher caps appear unlikely assume that plan
