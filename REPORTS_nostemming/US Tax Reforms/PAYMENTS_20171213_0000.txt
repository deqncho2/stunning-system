update our tax reform impact analysis latest proposals see last year 
piece here this point assume rate well minimum 
foreign tax rate also assume ebit limitation interest 
deductibility but expect that cash impact only companies will able 
defer interest deductibility later year last highlight firms with the 
most foreign cash relative market cap that could benefit from repatriation 
what does mean for our stocks think upside from this tax benefit 
already substantially reflected our stocks multiples would expect some 
multiple compression reform passed and street estimates start come 
note not currently capture tax reform upside our base case 
estimates and accordingly expect would raise our estimates but lower target 
multiples once passes 
biggest rate beneficiaries see tss gdot tnet and payx all 
likely see mid improvements eps latest corporate tax reform 
proposals that said most companies within our coverage pay relatively high 
federal tax and should see benefit eps with notable exception pypl 
and both which recognize all their profit internationally see exhibit

deductibility ebit which could potentially impact gpn mgi 
and fdc however expect this only impact cash taxes paid the excluded 
deductions can carried forward and realized some point the future which 
should allow for companies recognize the full deduction their book tax rate 
see exhibit 
foreign tax both and pypl have accumulated substantial foreign cash 
limit tax repatriation thus while they are lesser beneficiaries lower 
tax rate they will see some offset from the better access their offshore cash
