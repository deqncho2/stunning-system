what investors are asking about 
tax reform 
our analysis range tax reform proposals suggests fit 
cdw aapl stand benefit materially while wdc hpq hpe 
could see similar higher tax rates however border 
adjustability reduces the benefit for those importing cogs 
with the impact apple closer neutral under this scenario 
how likely tax reform under president elect trump and what are the 
implications with president elect trump taking hard stand lowering 
corporate taxes investors have been asking what the implications are for the 
hardware group our view coming into president elect trump inauguration 
next month there are three proposals for tax reform the table each having 
their own unique and complicated details respect the top corporate tax 
rate trump campaign has pointed rate while the house gop has 
pointed rate and the tax reform act comes with top 
corporate rate respect other details trump wants introduce 
repatriation tax accumulated foreign profits while the house gop wants 
introduce territorial system with border adjustability provisions this point 
there telling which proposal will become law once president elect trump 
pushes his reform bills through congress but one thing near certain the 
corporate tax system will change and our house view that the president 
and congress can get done 
how will lowering the top corporate rate effect hardware names exhibit 
assume range corporate tax rates between and and foreign 
rate with deferrals internationally accumulated earnings 
additionally assume interest deductibility which one way the 
government can fund lower overall tax rate what learned that 
companies our universe would see their effective tax rate fall average 
points with fitbit cdw and apple the biggest beneficiaries the case apple 
lowering the federal rate and elimination international deferrals 
will help bring their effective tax rate next fiscal year from anywhere 
between additionally apple stands benefit from repatriation which 
would provide access cash that trapped overseas conversely 
western digital could see its effective tax rate increase the most from 
due higher mix international earnings that will now taxed 
previously benefitting from tax holidays number countries 
how would the border adjustability provision change our conclusions the 
house gop proposes transition border adjustable destination based cash 
flow system whereby exports would not taxable the imports would 
not tax deductible and interest expense would longer tax deductible

therefore pure importer domestic reseller would negatively impacted 
since they wouldn able deduct most their cogs that come from 
abroad while pure exporter domestic manufacturer would see their tax rate 
negative since their revenue would tax free exhibit provides 
example for how this border adjustability framework would impact apple who 
closer the pure importer domestic reseller profile since they import 
majority their cogs from abroad and sell their products around the world 
estimate that the federal tax rate falls proposed the 
house gop and apple exports their revenue but all cost goods 
sold imported then apple tax rate would increase from 
however lower percentage cogs likely imported for instance some 
product support costs component purchases and data center costs are usbased order hold its tax rate flat under border adjustability 
scenario more than its cogs can imported 
exhibit tax reform most beneficial for fit cdw aapl potentially negative for
