what make ford tax rate 
ford tax rate dropped points due 
preemptive tax planning strategy ahead potential tax 
reform smart move but don put multiple this 
transitory accounting benefit 
last week ford surprised investors with effective tax rate for the quarter 
from booking benefit for tax credits resulting from repatriation 
strategy ahead potential tax reform the company included this benefit 
both adjusted earnings per share and adjusted effective tax rate measures 
both the strategy and the tax rate are drawing confusion 
believe ford executing savvy tax planning strategy maximize and 
preserve the value foreign tax credits ahead potential tax reform 
policy while may sound counterintuitive favorable repatriation policy with 
shift territorial system could significantly limit foreign tax credit value ford 
preemptive tax planning smart and will likely copied others 
while the strategy has merit the earnings implications are transitory 
suggest investors exclude this benefit from their operating earnings base and 
refrain from putting multiple item that will not persist 
what foreign tax credit corporations are subject income tax 
their worldwide income however income earned foreign subsidiaries 
generally taxed only when profits are repatriated back the prevent 
double taxation the law allows for foreign tax credit ftc offset portion 
the tax corresponding income taxes already paid another foreign 
government for instance firm paid tax foreign government ftcs 
this amount would offset the tax and the company would only owe the 
incremental based rate 
how foreign taxes impact earnings with today high tax rate firms are 
incentivized keep foreign profits abroad avoid the incidence taxation 
accounting rules fuel this incentive companies are permitted under gaap 
ignore the future tax liability and the corresponding tax expense long 
they assert foreign earnings are permanently reinvested abroad for instance 
this assertion lowered ford reported tax rate average over the last 
three years 
will this benefit and low tax rate persist ford cfo bob shanks said the 
call terms tax think about the effect that talking about being 
would think when get into move back more normal tax 
rate around believe investors should exclude this transitory 
accounting benefit from their operating earnings base even though ford includes 
their adjusted earnings per share and adjusted effective tax rate non gaap 
measures

what are the tax reform implications with potential tax reform the 
horizon there push shift the current worldwide tax system territorial 
tax system under territorial system foreign generated income largely 
exempt from domestic taxation this would eliminate the deferral incentives and 
associated trapped cash phenomenon corporates experience today 
conjunction with the switch territoriality expected the will deem 
one time tax all accumulated foreign earnings favorable rates 
paving the way for repatriation see here for more detail 
while the mechanics deemed repatriation tax are uncertain few proposals 
would allow foreign tax credits offset the deemed repatriation tax but 
would significantly haircut their value correspond with the 
lower repatriation rate therefore many cases may far more tax efficient 
repatriate from certain jurisdictions ahead deemed repatriation order 
maximize the value the associated ftcs believe this may the case with 
ford 
however preserved ftcs are still subject risk noted above territorialstyle system achieved exempting all most foreign income from 
taxation policymakers choose full exemption then preserved ftcs 
conceivably would worthless there would foreign income offset 
even exclusion would limit the value these ftcs time value 
basis thus the ability monetize the full may limited for these 
reasons many companies are lobbying congress allow conversion excess 
foreign tax credits general business credits 
note ford currently carries substantial tax assets and pays little cash taxes 
relative its effective tax provision the company carried deferred tax 
assets from credits and operating loss carry forwards
