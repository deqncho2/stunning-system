who getting the biggest tax 
refund 
with tax reform getting closer the finish line assess 
the potential impacts across our coverage with most 
advantaged names including elf twnk and buff 
tax reform close the finish line december the senate voted 
pass tax reform following the previous house passage tax reform 
november there are still disagreements between the senate house 
versions the bill that will need solved the conference committee 
process over the next few weeks our analysis assume the ultimate tax 
changes align more with the senate version performed analysis across 
our coverage the potential benefits tax reform including the following 
provisions reduction the corporate tax rate from 
repatriation foreign earnings with mandatory tax cash held overseas 
and tax illiquid assets line with the senate bill and iii 
assumed foreign cash subject repatriation taxes used repurchase 
shares our analysis incorporated the impact cap interest 
expense deductibility ebit line with the senate bill for select 
companies mdlz and but did not apply this the rest our 
coverage due difficulty calculating interest coverage and the ability 
companies adapt switching foreign debt also not include the 
impact from immediate expensing capex given low asset intensity across our 
coverage 
relative winners losers across our staples coverage sector level 
consumer staples should outsized beneficiary potential corporate tax 
reform measures although the ultimate changes tax policy are clearly 
uncertain this point across our coverage view elf twnk and 
buff the largest beneficiaries from tax reform given their high pretax 
mix and high tax rates the other hand believe mdlz tup and 
coty are relatively disadvantaged given their low pretax mix and 
gaap losses and low tax rates separately the proposed repatriation 
measures the biggest beneficiaries include epc enr and pep all which 
have total cash held overseas and would see average eps 
benefit assume overseas cash used for share repurchases above 
the average for our coverage terms what priced into the stocks 
would note that our top five tax beneficiaries staples stocks are since 
the day before the house passed their bill for the bottom five our 
analysis shows the eps impact from tax savings reinvestment for illustrative 
purposes but clearly some benefit will likely reinvested particularly 
packaged food where competitive intensity already high and lesser extent 
household products conversely see less reinvestment risk tobacco given
