how much cash available repatriate 
the trillion statistic represents accumulated foreign retained earnings that 
have yet remitted back the parent entity estimate that only 
trillion these earnings are available the form cash and 
marketable securities thus the majority these foreign earnings have been 
reinvested support foreign operations and exist the form other operating 
assets such inventory property equipment intangibles and goodwill this 
distinction important for two reasons 
many observers are overestimating the repatriation potential confusing 
accumulated earnings with excess cash held foreign subsidiaries 
morgan stanley does and seeks business with 
companies covered morgan stanley research 
result investors should aware that the firm may have 
conflict interest that could affect the objectivity

believe this concentration very important from tax policy perspective given 
that material tax revenues can generated from narrow cohort firms 
what the difference between permanently reinvested earnings and nonpermanently reinvested earnings 
discussed below the most likely legislative outcome will mandatory tax 
all accumulated unremitted foreign earnings the tax will likely applied 
accumulated and unremitted foreign earnings profits tax concept 
broadly synonymous with retained earnings under gaap unfortunately 
not required public disclosure item must use gaap retained earnings 
disclosures proxy for unremitted foreign 
for financial accounting purposes unremitted retained foreign earnings come 
two flavors 
foreign earnings deemed management permanently reinvested 
abroad permanently reinvested earnings are required disclosure item 
under gaap calculate sum trillion these earnings from 
latest submissions 
non permanently reinvested foreign earnings unfortunately the gross 
amount non permanently reinvested earnings rarely disclosed 
however under gaap firms need accrue deferred tax liability for 
the tax upon eventual repatriation grossing this liability 
assumed tax rate allows estimate the balance non permanently 
reinvested foreign earning estimate corporates hold additional 
billion non permanently reinvested foreign earnings 
accounting standards provide significant flexibility making the permanently 
reinvested assertion managers are incentivized deem earnings permanently 
reinvested avoids the accrual deferred tax liability leading lower 
effective tax rate and higher reported earnings 
style repatriation holiday likely 
believe highly unlikely that future policy provides optional 
repatriation and continuance the current international tax system thus the 
term holiday somewhat misleading believe the most likely policy 
outcome the imposition mandatory tax offshore earnings required 
transition new system for international taxation 
corporations are generally subject tax their worldwide income 
however income earned foreign subsidiaries normally taxed only when 
profits are repatriated back the parent this deferral mechanism creates 
incentives for firms reinvest and keep foreign generated profits abroad 
temporarily permanently avoid the incidence taxation the american 
jobs creation act provided multinationals with the option repatriating 
foreign earnings advantageous effective rate research demonstrates 
that this policy conditioned firms anticipate future holidays and changed 
behavior concentrating more earnings abroad there bipartisan consensus 
among congressional leadership and tax writing committees that the current 
deferral system broken and that mandatory tax all accumulated profits 
necessary order transition new international tax system mandatory 
tax also generates large pool revenue offset lower rates 
what the most likely form tax accumulated foreign earnings 
believe the republican sponsored tax reform act and the gop 
blueprint for business tax reform provide the policy baseline for mandatory tax 
accumulated foreign taxes these proposals provide two effective tax rates 
based how accumulated unremitted foreign earnings were subsequently 
reinvested 
for earnings held the form cash cash equivalents and short term 
investments deduction would apply resulting effective tax rate 
deduction would apply earnings attributed all other assets 
resulting effective rate 
one major technical issues how draw the line for cash investments 
operating investments while also preventing structuring and arbitrage 
legislation will likely include look back rule but may not prevent all 
gamesmanship 
also important note the plans also permit the ability pay the resulting 
tax liability over eight year period thus alleviating liquidity concerns 
president donald trump campaign proposed mandatory tax all 
accumulated earnings believe dual rate approach more likely given the 
majority accumulated earnings are not the form investment assets but 
the form operatings assets 
would firms able utilize foreign tax credits offset the mandatory tax 
under policy similar tax reform act foreign tax credits and foreign 
tax deductions would permitted however the value would proportionally 
reduced along with the corresponding earnings thus limited and 
noted above such limitation would require corresponding deferred tax assets 
the balance sheet written down this particular concern for 
regulated financial institutions 
what are the budgetary and tax revenue implications 
the mandatory tax accumulated foreign earnings estimated generate 
billion revenue over year period general rule thumb 
billion over year period estimated fund percentage point 
reduction the corporate tax rate 
the joint committee taxation estimated the transition tax the tax reform 
act would generate billion over year period however this was 
off much smaller base foreign earnings 
the last fiscal budget the obama administration proposed one time 
deemed repatriation tax accumulated undistributed foreign earnings with 
offsetting credit for the amount foreign taxes associated with such 
earnings this plan estimated generate billion over year period 
believe policymakers may incentivized increase the effective tax rate 
these earnings given the concentration firms materially exposed this issue 
finding offsetting revenue for tax cuts extremely difficult and there are very 
few pools significant revenue isolated few firms taxing old earnings 
also seen far more efficient than equally offsetting relative tax new 
earnings taxing old earnings does not affect marginal new investment thus this 
leads more favorable outcomes dynamic scoring models 
what are the accounting consequences mandatory tax accumulated 
foreign earnings 
companies that have not provisioned for eventual repatriation foreign 
earnings will need book deferred tax liability for the transition tax the 
recognition this liability will cause one time headwind earnings however 
anticipate most firms will add back this expense their non gaap 
performance measures this charge could potentially problematic for 
regulated financial services entities will result reduction capital
