remainco strives closer more pure play competitors rollins and rentokil 
after the spin off remainco will consist terminix and franchise services with 
profits generated from the pest control business currently believe recent 
management initiatives have been launched emulate rollins and rentokil such 
higher investments promote growth and greater focus its commercial business 
addition believe the spin off will allow management alter its capital structure 
further imitate rollins and rentokil such lowering its leverage and ideally initiating

the growth debate 
terminix investments should start impacting top line growth after quarters 
increasing investment and ceo change think terminix growth should 
accelerate least gdp not closer the growth the pest 
industry has seen over the last years 
the market likely expects terminix growth issues continue and does not have 
conviction that recent investments the business along with new strategic initiatives 
instituted the new management team will pay off 
recent years terminix focused too much margins the expense growth 
for instance though terminix ebitda margins were higher than that 
rollins and nearly higher than rentokil ebita margins terminx organic 
growth lagged rollins and rentokil relative rollins this 
margin gap was likely impacted rollins larger labor force greater focus training 
and increased service frequency 
exhibit margin differential rol and rto expected narrow 
after increased terminix investments

order combat this revenue gap servicemaster management began increasing its 
terminix investment with focus labor sales and marketing for example 
terminix increased employee base nearly though this still 
below the employees rollins for nearly the same level total revenue 
based management commentary far terminix technician count has 
continued increase also looked optimized its technician capacity within 
branches using new multi day planning tool think closing the labor gap 
rollins the right strategy though not expect fully close would note 
that historically terminix has had fewer employees than rollins but only recently did 
growth begin lag significantly terminix grew organically 
think increasing employee count should help narrow the gap rollins but not fully 
expect terminix fully match its headcount and growth rates the near term with 
continued investment labor sales and marketing original guidance for terminix 
margins was for flat down though this guidance was further lowered 
down midway through the year believe that investors are more 
focused near term growth terminix over margins growth will remain the key 
for multiple rating 
exhibit terminix headcount likely higher 
source company reports morgan stanley research note serv indicates over employees and over employees 
addition labor investments new ceo nik varty who took over july has 
put renewed focus customer service which should help improve retention for 
instance one way new management has attacked this issue changing technician 
compensation structure previously serv management had incentivized technicians 
time delivery which had inadvertent impact causing technicians leave 
customers early sometimes without fully answering questions moving away from 
this should help improve customer retention recent conferences management has 
noted that time spent with customers while net promoter scores proxy for 
customer satisfaction have also trended higher 
though growth has been choppy since the investments began think these investments will begin move revenue higher beginning 
based both rollins and rentokil having margins that are already lower than 
terminix think growth the key metric that terminix investors are currently focused 
and would sacrifice some margin expansion long growth accelerates 
continue think the investments are necessary and should allow terminix return 
least gdp grower not closer recent industry growth and 
pct top growth the pest control industry stable and resilient industry 
and one which company with terminix scale with its ability spend marketing 
and technology should able grow estimate growth for terminix 
expect recent investments begin flow the top line and then return 
least gdp level 
exhibit terminix organic growth 
exhibit pct top total revenue 
source company reports morgan stanley research 
source pct note represents top pest control companies revenue 
besides improving growth the expense margins new management also 
increasing its focus the commercial business order more closely resemble 
rollins and rentokil terminix has historically had lower commercial mix than both 
competitors with revenue terminix from commercial rollins and 
rentokil commercial generally seen the more attractive market with 
stickier customer base rollins reports retention commercial 
residential terminix management expects the overall commercial market grow 
faster than the residential market the years come 
exhibit terminix has less commercial mix compared rollins and rentokil 
source company reports morgan stanley research note represents mix 
because these positive characteristics higher multiple generally put 
commercial revenue and ebitda with recent discussion with industry expert see 
servicemaster global holdings takeaways from meeting with former rollins cfo 
suggesting the market commercially focused businesses generally sell for 
sales closer sales for residential business and sales for termite 
business since taking over ceo nik varty has made point focus this high 
value commercial business and sees significant opportunity after the vertical was 
not really focused over the last several years with terminix strength small and 
medium sized business expects able expand its business national accounts 
well management finalizing its strategy and close appointing new leader 
this segment after recently letting the previous commercial head though could 
lower margin business front terminix may use price attract customers 
believe investors would reward accelerating growth the expense some margin 
contraction 
spin off creates capital transformation opportunity 
the capital allocation debate 
believe the closer remainco resembles rol and rto the more likely the 
market will assign terminix higher multiple believe the spin off will allow 
management alter remainco capital structure further imitate rollins and 
rto well other firms stable industries waste lowering its 
leverage and initiating dividend fundamentally expect recent initiatives will 
further position terminix look more like pest control peers management has 
been increasing investments terminix sales labor and marketing which should 
promote growth management also placing greater focus its commercial 
business which should drive closer business mix rol and rto 
believe the market not contemplating change leverage levels nor dividend 
initiation remainco post spin historically serv has not paid dividend due its 
higher leverage net leverage though began repurchasing stock 
believe the market not assigning much value this possibility the current 
price 
serv can use financial engineering create remainco with lower leverage and 
ideally pay dividend this again would out the rol and rto playbook but 
would also emulate waste industry firms rsg wcn which view similar 
slow growth businesses but stable and resilient industry see remainco multiple 
waste below with the spin off expected take place serv has indicated its 
intention file initial confidential form the quarter though this will 
nonpublic until audited financials can provided believe that remainco 
tmx and fsg should use this opportunity more closely resemble rol and rto 
lowering its leverage and returning more capital shareholders order 
accomplish this even though tmx and fsg will have more ebitda compared 
the ahs spinco believe more debt should placed the ahs business that 
tmx can look closely peers possible think remainco tmx and fsg 
should carry the debt which would place net leverage the time 
the spin even with returning fcf the form dividends buybacks which 
below the that rol returned last year would still allow remainco slighty 
reduce this net leverage over the course our proforma spin model ending with 
net leverage even taking the company debt remainco could 
still net leverage level 
exhibit remainco tmx and fsg net leverage different debt allocation and shareholder 
payout scenarios 
source morgan stanley research 
scenario which ahs spinco takes the current serv debt think the 
resulting leverage ahs manageable also capital light business with 
strong fcf that can lever quickly our model which assume fcf 
returned shareholders ahs would still able lever full turn 
growth has been strong recently ahs with ytd organic growth and 
margin expansion though expect ahs growth slow mid single digits the 
coming years still expect modest margin expansion and ebitda growth which 
should create enough fcf cushion comfortably pay down debt 
exhibit spinco ahs net leverage different debt allocation and shareholder payout 
scenarios 
source morgan stanley research 
think remainco should utilize dividend part its capital return similar 
rollins rentokil and the waste industry the stable pest control industry with its 
minimal capital requirements attractive industry for investors that made more 
attractive dividend the dividend yield does not need that high pest 
competitors rol and rto both only pay dividend yield addition the 
average the top waste companies which see applicable comp set for 
remainco also only pay yield div yield our remainco value per share
