why tax reform could turn 
beta alpha 
weekly while investors are naturally focusing 
etr impacts tax reforms lay out why see this 
significant stimulus industrial capacity and thus see 
cheap beta continued sources alpha here 
this note lay out why believe cut corporate tax rates could 
the carrot that brings back manufacturing capacity the opposed the 
stick import tariffs given the importance this topic will hosting 
webcast monday november with james lucier managing director 
and head tax policy capital alpha discuss the key debates around tax 
reform see here for the webcast link 
popular question field from investors what everyone else asking 
about sometimes struggle think common theme but these days 
easy all about the impact tax reform that not say that other 
aspects the trump stimulus plan are not important but tax reform feels very 
real and tangible while there more than little skepticism our conversations 
that meaningful infrastructure bill can pass muster 
investor focus around the impact effective tax rates and hence earnings 
this clearly important but casual regression analysis tax rates sales 
mix reveals some real outliers lay out exhibit for example how can 
company like regal beloit with sales mix report effective tax rate 
are sure there are manifold factors but the primary reasons are 
deductions and here must remember that part and parcel tax reform 
the proposed elimination many popular deductions such interest 
etc 
should also not lose sight that the high tax rate the has been major 
cause off shoring activity the the exodus capital south the border 
has been helped the significant hourly labor arbitrage between the and 
mexico exhibit but labor accounts for just cogs the 
manufacturing sector and some industries low which fraction 
the consumed materials exhibit however manufacturers are able 
report deduction manufacturing and importing goods from mexico thus 
benefiting from the higher corporate tax rate 
such believe that the lowering corporate income taxes levels 
closer the oecd average exhibit would act disincentive for 
companies like lennox and eaton manufacture for demand places like 
mexico and puerto rico thus representing carrot bring back capacity the 
opposed the stick tariffs our prior survey work has revealed that 
high tax rates were the biggest barrier adding new capacity well above the

more common gripes around the regulatory burden interestingly our work 
suggests that the level the usd almost irrelevant exhibit 
therefore view tax reform potentially significant growth stimulus for 
the industrial sector that could far more material that infrastructure 
bill and our prior work first published april manufacturing 
renaissance masterpiece head fake suggests that the auto 
transport equipment paper steel and aluminum sectors would likely best 
positioned from shoring activity exhibit clearly timing and many other 
things the air our working assumption that tax reform hits 
but more optimism could lead uptick activity sooner 
our colleagues europe published last week that their proprietary mscgi 
short cycle index has turned positive for the first time since which 
shadows the strong momentum that have been reporting capmi since late 
remember capmi leads sales months while mscgi more 
coincident which suggests that core sales are set inflect meaningfully 
also the extent that capmi keeps rising supports continued positive stock 
price momentum for the group and this regard note that the bottom 
capmi led the trough the correction months see exhibit and 
exhibit 
while the opec meeting wednesday will grab lot market attention 
our sense that the group well supported through the holidays given 
the outlook for core growth acceleration into and perhaps more 
importantly the emergence bull case clearly the distributors 
look the catbird seat benefit from exposure and tax reform our 
favored plays here are wcc and hds but would also look cheap beta
