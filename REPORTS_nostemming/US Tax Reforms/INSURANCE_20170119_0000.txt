update corporate tax reform quantifying the many scenarios 
and several potential offsets 
while our base case scenario that life insurers would see 
benefit earnings there are wide variety potential 
scenarios and likely offsets consider 
overall expect corporate taxation reform positive our base case 
assumption territorial taxation system with rate but the elimination 
all deductions would yield around average pick earnings for the 
sector that said there remain broad range potential scenarios under many 
which the benefit could substantially lower and for some companies could 
even negative accordingly while view taxation reform positive 
catalyst lot remains uncertain and believe somewhat premature this 
stage reflect the full potential impact taxation reform into valuation 
multiples 
but there are wide range potential scenarios will the dividend received 
deduction drd retained how about tax advantaged investments will 
interest expenses related long term debt still deductible what will the 
eventual tax rate the border adjustment system 
implemented could impact companies who import reinsurance services 
essentially move blocks business low tax jurisdictions 
there could also some negative consequences non deductibility newly 
issued debt likely result substantially lower prepayment income 
corporate bonds owned the life insurers shorter duration products such 
group insurance could see any benefit quickly competed away the extent 
personal taxation reform also proceeds sales tax deferred life and annuity 
products may negatively impacted well several companies with large 
deferred tax assets are also likely see impairments their book value 
winners and potentially challenged potential winners are tmk and unum both 
are more domestically focussed with higher effective tax rates cno and voya 
would also likely receive sizable boosts their operating eps although this 
mostly reflects the higher assumed tax rate they use presenting operating 
earnings conversely athene would see little benefit and potentially could see 
its tax advantaged status challenged under border adjustment system 
taxation principal prudential and lincoln would also likely see limited benefit 
given the substantial benefit they currently receive from drd which expect 
could eliminated under corporate taxation reform

our overall view that corporate taxation reform should 
positive driver future earnings across the sector that said 
also believe there are wide variety potential scenarios that 
could play out while there are also range potential offsets 
which could mitigate the positive impact accordingly while still 
positive would reluctant fully reflect higher earnings 
prospects into the valuation multiples across the sector this 
point 
this stage there remain plethora possible scenarios that 
could play out with respect corporate taxation reform some 
the key variables see include 
dividend received deductions life insurers receive deduction 
for the taxes already paid dividends they receive from 
policyholder funds that they hold their separate account 
prior discussion taxation reform elimination this 
deduction has regularly been raised leading view that 
likely eliminated part corporate taxation reform 
companies that benefit most include those with larger 
separate account balances including principal voya and 
lincoln although voya case they report earnings using 
assumed tax rate rather than their effective tax rate 
which substantially lower 
other tax advantaged investments various life insurers also own other tax 
advantaged investments including municipal bonds and build america bonds 
their investment portfolio whether the income from these investments will 
continue exempt remains unanswered question 
tax deductibility interest expense for spread based businesses interest 
expense the equivalent the cost goods sold for manufacturing companies 
for all practical purposes expect this will exempt from provisions 
eliminate the deductibility interest expense however whether not this 
exclusion would also apply the insurers long term debt which part their 
overall capital structure unclear even this interest expense longer 
deductible expect would apply only newly issued debt and accordingly 
would take time impact the results 
corporate tax rate given the range different proposals being considered there 
yet consensus the proposed taxation rate the trump proposal talks 
the republican plan while many investors with whom spoke 
expect such look the potential impact under each these scenarios 
border adjustment territorial system the republican house taxation reform 
proposal based border adjustment basis where the cost goods and 
services imported are non deductible whereas exports are fully deductible how 
this would apply reinsurance remains unclear notionally companies such 
athene purchase from their offshore subsidiary reinsurance coverage these 
reinsurance premiums were longer tax deductible then the substantial taxation 
advantage they have relative their peers could threatened 
given the wide range potential outcomes have looked the impact the sector 
under range different scenarios our base case that all deductions and other 
taxation advantages are eliminated move tax rate and interest expense for 
long term debt remains eligible deduction under this scenario would expect the 
earnings for the sector rise however the range potential positive impact 
varies significantly from earnings benefit the low side the high side 
among the names our base case scenario 
the bear case scenario that all prior taxation deductions and advantages are 
eliminated the interest expense long term debt non deductible while the tax rate 
reduced down only the bull case the reverse all deductions remain 
place interest expense remains deductible and move rate

prepayment income when bonds are prepaid ahead their maturity date often 
there make whole provision where the life insurers receive additional income 
the extent that interest newly issued debt will longer deductible the 
companies will incentivized not prepay existing debt this could lead 
meaningfully lower levels prepayment income across the industry 
unfortunately relatively few companies provide details the contribution 
prepayment income earnings such assessing the potential impact 
challenging 
advantage competed away the extent that companies not change their 
target internal rate returns various products they are likely pass some 
not all the taxation benefit onto consumers through lower prices for shorter 
duration products such group insurance this would imply any uplift after tax 
earnings from lower taxes could relatively short lived for other longer duration 
products such pension risk transfer the uplift earnings likely last 
significantly longer 
lower sales the event that personal taxes are reduced and estate taxes are 
lowered eliminated then the value the tax deferral embedded various life 
and annuity products will eroded the margin this could erode the demand 
for these products and drive lower future sales and earnings 
balance sheet impairments last various companies including cno hartford and 
voya have large deferred tax assets while the net operating losses they are 
carrying will not change the tax rate applied the nols will decline thus driving 
balance sheet impairment 
would also note that the difference varies widely among the companies 
companies that stand benefit the most would those that are more domestically 
oriented with higher effective tax rates this would include companies such 
torchmark and unum our analysis also shows companies such voya and cno would 
also likely see sizable increase reported operating earnings but both circumstances 
this reflection their operating earnings being presented under relative high tax 
rate both cases their effective tax rates due large deferred tax assets 
substantially lower 
the negative side companies that are likely receive little benefit include 
athene lincoln principal and prudential for athene the company pays little tax due 
its bermuda domicile the vast majority business writes the essentially 
reinsured its bermuda subsidiary conversely each the other companies benefit 
substantially from dividend received deductions the elimination which largely offsets 
the benefit from lower tax rates 
athene company particular interest given its ability reduce taxes the 
majority its income one its key competitive advantages there have been various 
prior proposals shut down the ability companies move earnings into low 
tax jurisdictions under the border adjustment proposal possible that reinsurance 
premiums would longer tax deductible which could largely negate their 
advantage further the extent that other companies pass along benefit lower 
taxes policyholders through lower prices then expect athene would need 
follow suit which would weigh their return profile for these reasons believe 
they stand out the company which best benefits among the least and worst 
potentially risk from corporate taxation reform
