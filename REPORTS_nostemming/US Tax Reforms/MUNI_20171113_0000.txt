corporate rate cut 
unreliable risk 
the senate tax plan was lighter touch the muni market 
but client feedback that the corporate rate 
concern don see this powerful stand alone market 
factor evidence definitive link between taxes bank 
allocations limited watch bank loan demand instead 
for muni investors the senate and house bills remain net positives 
particularly considered against the broad risks comprehensive tax reform 
process had posed individual tax rates are not going down significant 
amount and both bills preserve the core muni interest exemption for 
public purpose government bonds

for muni issuers the senate bill was improvement over the house

with pabs repeal longer center stage the most common investor 
question received whether corporate tax rate would reduce 
bank and insurance company muni holdings although wouldn rule

taxes bank demand less than meets the eye 
the senate plan unveiled last week like the house plan includes corporate tax 
rate this lower rate than our base case although still expect the rate rise 
from here some the most contentious pay for provisions are diluted through 
negotiations and lobbying that being said the corporate rate percentage 
point cut has led clients worry that bank and insurance company demand 
could decline significantly while there logic those concerns don see 
strong enough risk reliably weaken the market least its own premise this 
three points 
taxes appeared just one factor many that contributed the decline bank 
and insurance company muni holdings following the last major tax reform common 
argument within academia that the various tax reform acts the resulted 
banks and insurance companies owning smaller portion the municipal bond market 
see for example marlin and poterba tax law changes beginning 
limited the deductibility carrying cost for municipal bonds followed rate 
reductions that being said appears other factors were play besides just 
the tax rate fact several scholars have argued for excess funds approach 
explain institutional demand see dickinson this view institutions buy 
munis and fixed income generally when banks are flush with liquidity and deposits but 
perceive fewer opportunities for profitable loan underwriting supporting this view 
declines bank and insurance company portfolios were well underway before the 
reagan tax changes banks and insurance companies allocations munis percent 
their own assets peaked the late full decade before the reagan tax cuts 
the nor can detect reliable relationship between munis and taxes the 
household level households substantially increased their exposure munis after the 
reagan tax cuts course makes sense that households would become better 
buyers munis institutions were withdrawing from the market that said the data 
not point tax changes the only factor driving shifts household and institutional 
portfolio allocation between

for banks think the loan deposit ratio better indicator bank demand 
than tax rates although the relationship does not hold for all time periods going back 
over the past twenty years find relatively strong correlation between 
bank allocations munis and bank loan deposit ratios this intuitively makes sense 
given the fundamental behavior banks and line with the excess funds 
scholarship noted earlier when banks are flush with liquidity deposits they have 
capacity buy assets and make loans when loan growth insufficient that when 
banks not perceive profitable lending opportunities banks are compelled buy 
fixed income assets earn net interest when the yield curve steep the net interest 
owning fixed income assets compelling 
exhibit munis like other fixed income assets are alternative loans for deposit rich banks 
munis assets

source morgan stanley research federal reserve 
think banks increased prominence the market over the past few years 
owed the happy coincidence that munis offered wide spreads treasuries the 
same time that left the largest banks awash deposits 
exhibit increased bank deposits faster than banks could lend increasing the demand for 
fixed income assets

banks holdings percent the overall muni market began noticeably tick higher 
the fourth quarter right the minutes sell off precipitated high 
mmd ust ratios and wider muni credit spreads note that bank demand continued 
increase even regulations took shape which made munis relatively less attractive
