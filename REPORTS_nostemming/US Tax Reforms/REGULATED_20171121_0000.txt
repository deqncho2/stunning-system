tax reform expanding 
utility implications 
are expanding our prior analysis from eps impacts across 
our coverage cash flow and rate base impacts from the 
latest house and senate tax reform proposals see 
negative cash flow impacts for most utilities and credit 
metrics potentially under pressure for several stocks 
tax reform bills from the house and senate have mixed implications for utilities 
overall with several companies likely experience higher eps and rate base 
growth but most facing lower cash flows and thus weaker credit metrics 
analyzed the house and senate tax reform bills and extended our prior analysis 
eps impacts also consider the cash flow and rate base implications for our 
coverage lowering the corporate tax rate from benefits eps for 
several utilities with profitable non regulated businesses and raises regulated 
rate base growth due the reduction utilities deferred tax liabilities dtl 
however cash flows would lower for most utilities due the loss bonus 
depreciation reduced customer payments from lower tax rate and flowback 
the dtl reduction the stocks see most risk facing weaker credit 
metrics and possible incremental equity needs over year period are duk 
etr ppl and likely net beneficiaries from eps perspective include 
exc nee peg sji and sre 
key tax reform elements that assessed 
lower statutory corporate income tax rate from

tax reform could boost rate base growth utility deferred tax liabilities have 
been used source financing for regulated rate base investment and 
would revalued lower given the lower corporate tax rate the reduction the 
value utility dtls results increase rate base since this component 
typically subtracted from utility rate base for ratemaking purposes the 
change the dtl will need refunded customers over time but will also 
refinanced with debt and equity the higher debt and equity financing costs 
will charged customers thus resulting higher earnings power the 
timeframe over which the refunds and corresponding increase rate base will 
occur has not been finalized but many companies expect this occur over the 
remaining year life the assets resulting modest tailwind for 
earnings and rate base growth and modest drag cash flow note that for 
some companies deferred taxes are included regulated rate base and the 
equity ratio reduced account for the deferred tax liability for these 
companies the total rate base would not increase but the equity layer would rise 
over time supporting greater earnings base for the utility assuming 
year period for refunds and rate base increases average this leads 
higher annual growth utility rate base across our coverage secondarily the 
elimination bonus depreciation for utilities would also modestly increase rate 
base deferred income taxes are subtracted from most utility rate bases the 
elimination bonus depreciation could lead smaller reduction rate base

longer term lower customer bills could also give utilities additional headroom 
grow rate base two effects tax reform specifically lower tax rates and dtl 
refunds benefit utility customer bills this dynamic could potentially allow 
utilities increase rate base growth and accelerate investment plans given less 
inflationary pressure customer bills key concern utility regulators 
think this particularly beneficial for utilities states with low sales growth 
since there lower sales volume spread rate increases over these regions 
and for utilities with substantial capital programs that are constrained nearterm rate increases 
cash flow impacts tend negative for most companies there are several 
drivers lower cash flow for utilities lower corporate tax rate will result 
lower customer revenues since the utility will need cover less federal 
income taxes think this benefit will typically passed through customers 
soon after tax reform policies are passed though the timing will likely 
managed state state basis because many utilities are already not paying 
cash taxes but are still charging customers for taxes the lower customer 
revenues should lead lower cash flow for most companies the loss 
bonus depreciation reduces utilities ability shield income from cash taxes for 
companies whose primary cash tax shield came from the use bonus 
depreciation this should increase cash taxes and lower cash flow most utilities 
though have other tools that lower defer cash taxes including net operating 
loss carryforwards accelerated depreciation renewables investments and tax 
credits such production tax credits ptcs and investment tax credits itcs
