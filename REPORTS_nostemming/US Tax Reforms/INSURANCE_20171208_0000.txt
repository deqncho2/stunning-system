taxes it not about operating eps continue receive several questions 
over the potential impact near term operating eps from the various tax 
proposals would note however that even though gaap earnings may 
receive meaningful albeit temporary lift from tax reform many life insurers 
may actually facing higher cash taxes while rbc ratios across the industry 
could also taking hit 
voya highlights from time the road with management several clients 
were interested what voya management had say while were the road 
with them earlier this week the three major topics discussion revolved around 
the operating eps growth which appears track prospects for the potential 
sale its closed block and implication taxation reform the company 
athene overblown given substantial underperformance over the past month 
more investors mainly hedge funds are beginning question whether the 
underperformance has been overdone with tax reform likely result 
headwind only around basis points eps growth over the next years 
believe has 
aflac upside surprise while guidance was largely line with expectations 
most investors with whom spoke felt the company needed positively 
surprise justify further upside potential the stock with earnings guidance 
largely line and capital management being touch softer was therefore not 
surprising see the stock come under pressure 
other stocks and topics discussion what prudential and metlife are likely 
say next week their respective outlook calls were among the other topics 
discussion while metlife under pressure present positive outlook the 
company has track record not sugarcoating commentary

eps impact 
average 
taxes what the latest there were several questions over the course the week 
the potential impact taxation reform across the life insurance space from our 
perspective there are three factors keep mind first and what are asked most 
often about the impact gaap operating earnings aggregate both the senate 
and house versions tax reform would provide meaningful boost the operating 
results least the near term while expect the lift operating earnings will 
quickly reflected new product pricing there will still positive impact the 
legacy book business how long that advantage lasts will reflection the 
duration that business with longer duration products such pension risk transfer 
seeing longer benefit than shorter duration products like group insurance 
second the impact cash taxes while the senate version significantly softened 
various provisions surrounding the calculation tax reserves and accounting for 
deferred acquisition costs the various proposals still shift tax expense items further into 
the future thus increasing taxable income earlier years accordingly based 
conversation have had with several companies many expect cash taxes actually 
increase earlier years despite the meaningful increase operating earnings 
result free cash flow relative operating earnings expected decline some cases 
meaningfully while most companies are downplaying potential repercussions for 
capital management activities there remains the risk the margin that buybacks for 
some companies could impacted negatively

third the impact risk based capital ratios given required capital most cases 
include tax offset discussed our note the looming tax hit capital 
ratio and will matter the reduction the tax rate likely increase required 
capital while total adjusted capital could negatively impacted deferred tax asset 
write downs the net result likely point reduction the reported risk based 
capital ratios across the industry that said believe unlikely the rating agencies 
would ask the companies rebuild their capital back where they were previously 
due this change anything the earnings coverage ratio would improve and based 
discussions have had with the agencies they generally view tax reform positive 
for ratings accordingly except for those companies with already very low capital ratios 
would not expect this impact capital management activities meaningfully 
athene overdone athene likely see negative impact from the tax reform has 
come under significant pressure the past month given the ongoing uncertainty 
taxation reform coupled with the overhang additional stock held the aaa 
investment vehicle likely hit the market early such underperformance 
understandable that said heard from several investors questioning whether had 
potentially been overblown our view has under the assumption that prior 
reinsurance transactions are grandfathered athene likely see it all that 
excise and regular taxes tax rate from around over the course the 
next years that essentially means the company will facing mere basis 
points annual earnings pressure from slowly but gradually increasing tax rate for 
company that posting substantial growth operating earnings are 
from the prior year view this pressure being largely immaterial accordingly 
are inclined view the pressure the stock being overblown thus creating solid 
buying opportunity for investors 
voya news from the road earlier this week had the opportunity travel with 
management voya financial from these meetings there were three major themes 
first the company remains track with respect delivering substantial improvements 
operating earnings the cost reduction plan exceeding their initial 
expectations while the initiative spending expected wind down coupled 
with lower dac amortization retirement improved loss ratios employee benefits 
and solid organic growth and substantial stock repurchases the company appears 
firmly track deliver robust eps growth 
second while they are encouraged see variable annuity transactions higher interest 
rates remain key getting anything done while the announcement out hartford 
shows that deals are indeed possible they continue believe the price they would 
need pay private equity player take over their variable annuity block could 
exceed resources currently backing the block only when year treasury rates 
approach around would there convergence likely pricing and available 
resources accordingly while the hartford transaction was encouraging sign 
remains unlikely that will see transaction near term 
third they continue see substantial improvement operating earnings from the 
taxation reform currently they report results using tax rate under the proposals 
that rate would fall around providing substantial boost the negative 
side they would face some deterioration the value their deferred tax assets but 
from our perspective few investors ascribe full value those assets currently 
aflac not enough aflac held its outlook call last week where management guided 
eps the general feedback received from clients was that the 
guidance held few surprises the positive side appears the branch conversion could 
completed little earlier than originally envisaged with management highlighting 
completion early april that would allow for the company roll out new 
product introductions the second quarter arguably mitigating the risk weak 
japan sales that said also appears buybacks the range billion were 
somewhat disappointing investors with most expecting them the upper end 
this range aggregate though given strong stock price performance the consensus 
view from investors with whom spoke was that the company needed provide 
solid upside surprise justify additional upside this was not the case were not 
surprised see some profit taking the stock following the announcement

prudential low ball reflection recent strength recent quarters operating 
earnings have been coming meaningfully ahead expectations with strong upside 
returns assets both annuities and asset management explaining most the 
upside the strength returns likely sustainable barring market 
correction would seem imply the current consensus should easily achievable 
that said there also the question whether management would prefer set out 
somewhat conservative guidance that they would expect easily achieve even 
market conditions were turn somewhat more challenging look back over time 
the company did have reputation for setting conservative guidance which they 
typically tended meaningfully exceed more recent years however their guidance 
has tended more line with the consensus and what they ultimately achieved 
given this more recent track record expect the risk the company low balling 
guidance has been somewhat mitigated although will find out for sure next week 
metlife under pressure deliver robust outlook given the substantial noise 
created the recently completed retail separation investors were asking whether the 
company feels under pressure deliver robust outlook and whether the outlook call 
could therefore act positive catalyst not believe that necessarily the case 
from our perspective metlife management has tended somewhat cautious 
guidance not over promise and under deliver look there are 
range positive items including the strength group insurance results improvements 
auto combined ratios and climbing expense saves that said they also face ongoing 
spread compression narrower securities lending margins flattening the yield 
curve and challenges growing japan given the interest rate environment and adverse 
hedged exchange rates given these factors expect the guidance commentary 
balanced and not necessarily positive catalyst for the stock 
trading color were better for sale athene with sizable long only selling being 
only partly offset hedge fund buying also saw meaningful long only selling from 
international accounts ameriprise and domestic long only selling metlife 
following its investor day saw hedge funds build short positions aflac while 
hartford saw hedge fund buying following its announcement sell talcott resolution
