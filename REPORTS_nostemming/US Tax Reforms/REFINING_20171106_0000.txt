house republicans reveal their tax reform plan while there high likelihood 
changes will come during the mark process and subsequent negotiations 
think the proposed tax bill largely reinforces the benefits expect reform will 
bring refiners highlighted the gop blueprint june last year and 
most recently the tax reform framework refiners are high tax 
payers having averaged effective tax rate over the last three years and 
paid out aggregate cash taxes over the same period such the key 
aspects the proposal are focused are the reduction the corporate 
tax rate from and the ability fully and immediately expense 
the cost qualified property acquired and placed into service 
scenario analysis hypothetical refiner estimate these changes could 
increase cash flows depending which combinations are assumed other 
items will keep eye include limiting the amount interest expense 
deduction ebitda and the one time repatriation rate with 
the intent transition territorial style from today worldwide system 
there was mention proposal repeal the lifo method accounting for 
inventories although has been for discussion the past and may 
brought negotiations the senate draft expect receive more 
information over this week lobbying ramps and the house bill marked 
addition the senate plans release their draft bill this week although 
the timing may slip depending how the house bill received and may make 
different choices than the house fit their own political calculus thus while 
republican leaders have ambitious timeline this process only just beginning 
our view our accounting tax policy team anticipates legislative efforts 
tax reform will likely take until the end see more discussion inside 
here 
for mlps the tax proposal seems relatively benign according our mlp team 
led tom abrams there was little the proposal that would uniquely impact 
mlps from corp point view lower corporate tax rate alone would 
leave the creation and support mlp less attractive the margin however 
lower deductibility interest for example might offset the tax rate change 
leaving effective tax rates the same and the motivation relative cost capital 
mlp unchanged see our mlp team weekly note here for more details

earnings week and the beat hfc and pbf continued the string 
earnings beats last week the prints every company cover have come 
above expectations far the theme strong utilization and margins 
particularly the mid con with margins above our expectations should 
positive read for both andv and both reporting and having 
and their respective refining foot print the interior the continent 
however caution expectations have likely been raised after two weeks 
strong prints beyond the results will look for update andv share

day for look reinforcement its guided mlp dropdown pace strategy 
around krotz spring plans for aldw and the future the california assets 
the cut cut cut bill reinforces promise lower rent 
corporate tax rate proposed but could end being higher and will likely 
phased the main highlight the bill relates refiners the proposal 
reduce the corporate tax rate flat from the current schedule with the top 
statutory rate this the most meaningful proposed change refiners are 
high tax payers having averaged effective tax rate over the last three years 
and paid out aggregate cash taxes over that time period exhibit note 
that our tax policy team base case accounting for potential maneuvering 
compel votes there were reportedly proponents for corporate rate cuts come 
into immediate effect however believe generally viewed that phase the 
most practical way raise money offset potentially lost pay fors that consistent 
with historical tax action 
ability fully and immediately expense cost qualified capital investments 
high level believe this may incremental benefit for the refiners that have 
growth opportunities outside the their logistics mlp unless projects are built the 
corporate level before being dropped down and refining segments retail 
marketing chemicals lubricants etc don expect this incent refiners 
dramatically ramp refining investments beyond the margin enhancement and 
optimization projects being considered
