are updating our prior tax analysis earlier this year discussed how tax 
reform could significant catalyst for our coverage our updated analysis 
force ranks our coverage based the three key areas where currently see 
the most clarity change the tax rate limiting interest deductibility 
and iii repatriation provide thoughts capex depreciation fourth item 
but not include this our overall ranking given low likelihood passing 
have also removed border adjustability from our analysis our updated view 
that tax reform will pass sometime though note the political 
situation continues evolve 
our methodology has changed leading material changes our rankings 
make the following assumptions our tax analysis for change the tax 
rate assume statutory rate and minimum effective foreign tax 
rate for interest deductibility assume interest expense deductible only 
until the amount interest income and all interest deductible for tax 
purposes and for repatriation assume that unremitted foreign 
earnings and foreign cash will used for buybacks note that this 
for illustrative purposes only and are aware that many companies may have 
take out additional debt finance these repurchases from unremitted foreign 
earnings key differences versus our prior ranking system are include 
minimum tax foreign earnings versus none prior include 
unremitted foreign earnings for buybacks versus none prior and iii remove 
the immediate expensing capex from our total score also estimate the 
portion adjusted pretax income that generated the and the amount 
foreign cash company specific basis 
our company rankings show wide dispersion results but small caps have 
the edge note that our top ranked companies are smid caps abiomed 
globus and nuvasive while our bottom ranked companies are large caps 
boston and teleflex fact our analysis suggests smid caps could see 
eps benefit while large caps would likely see eps benefit from tax reform 
note this primarily due smid names having greater pretax income 
though large cap names can see more upside from repatriation fueled buybacks 
amongst large caps see intuitive baxter and edwards best positioned

analysis 
overview 
earlier this year discussed how tax reform could significant catalyst for our 
coverage the time believed the combination republican presidency and 
republican congress could break through the bipartisan gridlock that had defined 
politics for the last several years however our initial expectations the timeline were 
optimistic instead the trump administration decided tackle healthcare first and the 
labored process behind the ahca has shown that the path forward not easy our 
updated house view that tax reform would pass sometime though note 
the political situation continues evolve 
are refining our prior tax analysis our updated tax analysis takes into account three 
key factors 
lower corporate tax rate which includes minimum effective foreign tax rate 
limiting interest deductibility and 
forced repatriation foreign cash and unremitted foreign earnings 
use these factors force rank companies our coverage specifically add the 
upside downside expected eps npv basis from these items derive the 
total benefit which base our ranking also provide thoughts around the 
immediate expensing capital expenditures fourth tax item but given that our tax 
and accounting colleagues view element unlikely passed have removed 
from our base case for deeper dive each these tax items please see our 
sections tax rate interest deductibility repatriation and capex depreciation 
respectively 
the border adjustability tax bat has been removed from our analysis our original 
analysis attempted estimate companies exposure border adjustability but 
noted the time that this was difficult given limited visibility specifically companies 
not reveal the amount imports and exports product can cross borders multiple 
times during production and companies can adapt bat differently depending 
the nature their individual supply chains now feel these factors make difficult 
make reliable estimates and comparisons across our coverage our tax and 
accounting colleagues also view border adjustability unlikely included tax 
reform together these reasons lead remove the bat from our analysis 
certain companies were excluded from our analysis dexcom insulet irhythm and 
nevro were all excluded from our analysis they have limited profitability 
however important note that certain elements tax reform can still can have 
large impact the intrinsic value these companies grifols was excluded from our 
repatriation analysis foreign domiciled company that will unaffected even 
though medtronic foreign domiciled ireland still included our repatriation 
analysis has significant amount trapped cash and unremitted foreign earnings 
that would impacted tax reform 
have updated our assumptions and show the illustrative effects tax reform 
numbers given the complications around tax and the evolving political newsflow 
base our analysis estimates illustrate relative positioning across our 
coverage use two key company specific assumptions drive our thoughts the 
portion adjusted pretax income generated the and the amount trapped 
foreign cash the other broad assumptions use our analysis are detailed further

tax rate 
description currently the statutory tax rate for companies our coverage 
the trump administration latest tax plan has called for top corporate tax rate 
while the house gop blueprint has called for top corporate rate our 
discussions with our tax and accounting colleagues indicate range most 
likely the new tax plan will also eliminate many deductions though adjustments for 
the tax credit domestic manufacturing deduction and excess benefit from stock 
compensation will likely remain further both trump and the house gop plans aim 
eliminate the deferral foreign earnings the trump plan aims this through 
ongoing minimum tax foreign earnings the house gop plan aims this 
through switching destination based cash flow system border adjustability 
tax without border adjustability tax our tax and accounting colleagues believe 
likely that the minimum effective foreign tax rate will implemented source 
government revenue while lower statutory rate will decrease taxes paid the 
minimum effective foreign tax rate can increase taxes paid 
assumptions our analysis first make assumptions about the portion adjusted 
pretax income generated the then start with statutory tax rate and 
subtract estimated deductions for the tax credit and domestic manufacturing 
not estimate the effect stock compensation for tax purposes given the reliance 
stock price using this estimate the current taxes paid then estimate the 
taxes paid with tax rate under these assumptions still including the estimated 
tax credit and domestic manufacturing deductions also use our 
assumptions derive foreign pretax income adjusted basis foreign taxes paid 
and the effective foreign tax rate this rate lower than the minimum foreign tax rate 
assume companies must pay additional taxes foreign earnings until 
they meet the minimum foreign tax rate note that assume companies cannot defer 
taxes foreign earnings going forward following repatriation calculate the change 
taxes income and foreign income deduce the net change taxes paid 
effect our assumed rate suggests weighted average benefit median 
with individual company impacts ranging from our analysis 
suggests abiomed nuvasive and globus would benefit the most seeing lifts eps 
and respectively note that these are smid names that have 
disproportionate amount income generation the the companies that would 
benefit the least relative basis would stryker teleflex and boston with 
estimated eps headwinds for stryker and teleflex and for boston 
this primarily due our analysis suggesting these companies have effective foreign 
tax rates below leading additional taxes paid foreign earnings that offset 
lower statutory rate exhibit details the overall eps effect statutory rate 
change with taxing foreign earnings exhibit shows the upside purely from lower 
statutory rate and exhibit shows the headwinds from minimum effective foreign tax 
rate 
sensitivity reduce the new statutory rate line with the latest 
comments from the trump administration our analysis suggests this would 
benefit eps median weighted average basis ranging from 
inclusive the minimum effective foreign tax rate for every change the 
statutory tax rate the weighted average benefit eps across our coverage changes

interest deductibility 
description currently interest expense deductible for tax purposes this creates tax 
advantage for funding projects through debt versus equity cash president trump 
latest tax announcement made mention net interest deductibility for businesses 
but the house gop plan limits interest deductions the amount interest income 
this cap interest deductibility would increase taxes paid 
assumptions our analysis assume that all interest paid companies our 
coverage debt for simplicity all interest expense currently tax deductible 
and assume interest deductible only until the amount interest income 
use tax rate line with our overall analysis illustrate the increase taxes 
from losing the interest tax shield 
effect companies would see hit eps net income weighted basis median 
ranging from for companies with relatively little debt 
our analysis abiomed globus and intuitive would least affected due 
effectively interest expense while grifols halyard and hill rom would most 
affected with potential eps headwinds and respectively 
sensitivity companies with relatively less debt and higher margins see less 
headwind while companies with lower margins and more significant debt loads see more

repatriation 
description both the trump and house gop plans propose deemed repatriation 
forced not voluntary repatriation unremitted foreign earnings and foreign cash 
trump has previously proposed deemed repatriation tax unremitted foreign 
earnings payable over years though this detail was not included the 
administration latest tax proposal the gop blueprint proposes deemed repatriation 
tax foreign cash and cash equivalents and tax for all other 
unremitted foreign earnings minus foreign cash payable over years together 
unremitted earnings and foreign cash can used for buybacks boosting eps through 
lower share count the taxes owed unremitted foreign earnings will create longterm tax liability the balance sheet which likely will not affect the but will affect 
the npv the firm 
assumptions our analysis begin making company specific assumptions for the 
portion company cash that trapped abroad then for eps assume that all 
company unremitted foreign earnings are taxable and that companies use 
unremitted foreign earnings and their foreign cash for share buybacks share 
price premium current levels analyze the tax liability npv basis 
with payback period years and discount rate use the tax rates from the 
house gop blueprint our base case analysis grifols was excluded from this analysis 
even though medtronic foreign domiciled ireland still included has 
significant amount trapped cash and unremitted foreign earnings that would 
impacted tax reform note that this for illustrative purposes only and are 
aware that many companies may have take out additional debt finance these 
repurchases from unremitted foreign earnings 
effect companies would see gain eps net income weighted basis median 
with benefits ranging from for companies with little foreign cash 
unremitted foreign earnings abbott baxter medtronic and would best 
positioned with eps benefits and respectively while globus 
nuvasive and abiomed would see relatively immaterial benefits given limited trapped 
cash and unremitted foreign earnings the npv the tax liability percentage 
market cap would imply bps negative impact firm value market cap 
weighted basis across our coverage with maximum impact bps market cap 
for abbott 
sensitivity our eps benefit can change based the portion cash used for 
buybacks companies used their foreign cash for buybacks versus our 
assumption would imply weighted benefit eps across our 
coverage respectively increasing the portion unremitted foreign earnings used for 
buybacks suggests weighted average eps benefit for the tax liability 
longer payback period higher discount rate would decrease the size the tax liability 
relative market cap under trump earlier proposal for repatriation which would 
have payback period years along with flat tax unremitted foreign 
earnings estimate the weighted average npv the tax liability percentage 
market cap would bps higher increasing the discount rate the tax liability

capex depreciation 
description currently when capital expenses are depreciated the depreciation expense 
tax deductible and provides tax shield this tax shield occurs over the depreciable 
life span the asset the immediate expensing capex would allow these capital 
expenses deductible immediately for tax purposes versus spreading out the 
benefit over years through depreciation president trump previously expressed support 
for the immediate expensing capital expenditures but this detail was not included 
the administration latest tax proposal under the house gop blueprint capital 
expenses are expensed immediately for full tax deduction the first year and not 
generate tax shields from depreciation years beyond the first year since the full tax 
benefit received sooner npv basis this should have positive effect for firms 
our discussions with our tax and accounting colleagues indicate that immediate 
expensing for capex unlikely pass not include immediate capex expensing 
for tax purposes our overall ranking but provide thoughts this section 
assumptions assume discount rate perpetual growth rate and 
tax rate for both capex and depreciation also assume average life 
years for capital expenditure assets for simplicity assume all capex and depreciation 
provides tax shield

worth their market caps line with the median ranging from bps 
companies with more capex intensive businesses will see larger benefits relative
