insurance life annuity 
outlook expecting 
strong finish the year 
expect robust results although given substantially 
higher stock prices expectations for the group appear have 
risen 
overview expect life insurers report strong fourth quarter results 
especially among companies with more equity sensitive operations also 
expect strong alternative investment results provide boost and for 
underwriting results similarly robust that said sales challenges and 
meaningfully lower accretion from buybacks are least partial offsets 
positive trends equity markets rose point point basis and 
average which should boost results from equity sensitive products including 
asset management variable annuities and pension given the strength markets 
last quarter expect continued strength alternative returns the dollar 
also continued modestly weaken which should provide boost those 
companies with foreign operations some companies such cno and unum are 
completing their annual actuarial reviews which are likely benign given the 
improved macro environment 
negative trends given stronger stock prices expect the positive influence 
capital management under pressure and some cases expect 
companies may have slowed the pace buybacks generally expect sales 
areas such variable annuities remain under pressure 
company outliers are above the street names including metlife athene 
both strong alternative returns principal and lincoln reflecting strength 
equity markets are below consensus sun life reflecting decline 
corporate spreads our estimates are also generally above the street for 
although appears the consensus estimates are somewhat stale and some 
cases have not been updated for taxation reform
