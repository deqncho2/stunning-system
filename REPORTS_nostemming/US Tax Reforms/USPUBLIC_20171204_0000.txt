early saturday morning the senate voted pass 
tax reform after making several amendments firm 
the republican vote count while the content 
the bill limited stimulus moderated corporate 
benefit etc and the successful vote comports with 
our base case that republicans tax reform plan will 
become law effective the senate acted faster 
than expected keeping track for passage 
other fiscal policy risks are now worth exploring including potential government 
shutdown and potential sequestration 
here are key takeaways for investors 
complex simplification brings passage closer reality republicans found 
the policy combination that gained senate votes through series 
amendments the house plan compromises and promises many ways these 
changes cut against the goal simplifying the tax code but mostly fit our 
expectations given narrow majority and the dictates the budget 
reconciliation process said differently tax simplification got complicated but 
that shouldn too surprising given the process and the politics 
who down with jct while the budget score the policy both 
static and dynamic basis both showed deficit expansion least 
the end senator corker was the only republican voting against the bill 
other deficit hawks dismissed corker concerns citing faith that the bill 
would create more growth than the jct assumed hence the evidence 
suggests the notion fiscal conservatism will not barrier passage 
from here out 
tax cut ambitions moderated phase ins phase outs amt despite the 
above there were some implied influence the deficit hawks reflected 
the final bill items such interest deduction curbs and other revenueraising measures were included despite their absence from earlier blue 
prints phasing the corporate rate cut phasing out the personal rate 
cuts and making the corporate tax break less generous were parts our 
base case key the budget reconciliation math mirroring the house 
salt provisions eliminating salt deductions but keeping property 
tax deduction allowance appeared necessary sure the vote count 
both chambers one thing not our base case adding back the 
morgan stanley does and seeks business with 
companies covered morgan stanley research 
result investors should aware that the firm may have 
conflict interest that could affect the objectivity 
morgan stanley research investors should consider 
morgan stanley research only single factor making 
their investment decision 
for analyst certification and other important disclosures 
refer the disclosure section located the end this 
report 
individual albeit with higher exemption levels and corporate amt any 
the above provisions are revised conference would expect this 
enabled higher corporate tax rate thereby limiting any improvement 
the net benefit corporates president trump has already hinted this 
possibility 
republican determination demonstrated when assuming tax reform 
wouldn complete until the calendar turned appear 
have underestimated the power determination the part the 
republican party perhaps the best demonstration this power the 
rationale for affirmative votes from two potential holdout senators 
collins and flake who got board part promises future policy 
enactment from republican leadership 
stimulus still limited while longer surprising senate passage affirmed 
again that republicans would not attempt imperil their vote count 
exceeding the budget allowance set for the reconciliation process per 
the jct score the senate bill holds deficit expansion down 
roughly gdp while this number could change upon conference 
comports with our assertion that the tax bill unlikely provide meaningful 
exogenous boost growth see life the slow lane september 
market impact still better travel than arrive progress toward our base 
case affirms our thinking key markets equities tax reform passage 
helps push markets higher better potential earnings but once this achieved 
the upside becomes limited the view our equities strategists corporate 
credit passage headwind for highly leveraged credits given limits interest 
deductibility supporting our cautious stance particularly low quality high 
yield rates the modest near term stimulus potential the bill supports 
flatter curves and lower ceilings for treasury yields 
some relevant late changes for corporates some late revisions the bill are 
consequence corporate finance 
corporate amt surprise late amendment fund other 
modifications the senate passed bill includes alternative minimum tax 
amt for corporations full rate amt was largely expected 
repealed for corporations was for individuals amt functions 
parallel tax system that permits fewer deductions and credits however 
amt has historically applied rate less than the full statutory rate 
applying amt the full rate the mechanism may partially fully 
eliminate other beneficial provisions particular there concern that the 
tax credit popular bipartisan incentive may effectively nullified 
for many corporations this perhaps unintended consequence lastminute policymaking and will likely subject modification 
conference however billion over years will the cost 
another provision the rate itself the credit primarily benefits 
technology healthcare and industrials sectors 
immediate expensing gets bonus the senate passed bill aligns with the 
house bill including immediate expensing for qualified non real 
property through however the senate bill extends form bonus 
depreciation with front expensing and scaling down 
for capital intensive companies immediate expensing often 
results companies spending into taxable loss position losses are not 
immediately creditable but may carried forward indefinitely under the 
senate bill however limited taxable income through and 
thereafter losses can take years earn back they often lose the 
time value money and may restrict monetization other subordinate 
tax credits that have shorter expirations research indicates companies 
often forgo electing bonus depreciation due loss concerns would 
more constructive the efficacy immediate expensing stimulus 
tax writers allow tax carry forward losses accrue annual real rate 
return prescribed the house bill for more discussion 
immediate expensing and sectoral implications please see corporate credit 
research tax reform implications for credit markets sep 
ebit ebitda one the most frequent questions from investors 
whether the final bill will adopt taxable ebit ebitda interest 
limitation approach the funds over billion over ten years 
think they will use the senate deductibility cap ebit versus 
the house cap ebitda the lower base will affect more 
companies and marginally more pro cyclical noted previously the 
difference how the cap calculated important credit markets 
our view for example capping interest expense ebitda would 
impact virtually companies capping interest expense ebit 
would impact roughly our universe excluding exempted sectors 
for the impact even bigger with over half all companies above 
the cap many well above roughly one third the house plan thinking 
about slightly differently using very rough approximation applied 
bottom our credit universes find that most companies would 
still get net tax cut incorporating tax rate and assuming the 
senate version the cap all else equal however estimate that 
companies would now not benefit from the tax cut with decent 
chunk the market seeing sizeable hit along these lines calculating 
interest deductibility using ebit ebitda not only impacts highly levered 
companies but also starts impact companies with leverage only 
modestly above the market average note real estate and regulated 
utility operations are largely exempted from interest deductibility 
limitations 
repatriation tax materially higher another effort fund offsets 
predicted the senate increased the deemed repatriation rates 
accumulated retained foreign earnings cash backed earnings 
and all other earnings from and respectively this 
largely line with the house bill and respectively 
protecting the base investors should closely monitor reconciliation 
house and senate base erosion protection provisions while conference 
while both chambers attempt similar objectives with similar mechanisms 
there are pros and cons each approach among all provisions 
particular highlight overlooked provision the senate bill that 
would allow multinationals effective rate intangible 
income exported from the united states this policy would primarily 
benefit technology biotechnology pharmaceutical industrial and media 
industries 
what are watching paygo conference committee and shutdown risks 
there are several key risks our base case watching 
conference committee there are disagreements between the senate 
house versions the bill that need resolution the conference process 
removing the individual mandate and keeping personal amt may raise 
the ire moderate republicans the house though perhaps not 
sufficient number the temporary nature personal cuts may rankle 
conservatives our base case that these differences are not fatal 
particularly given the demonstration determination overcome 
ignore disagreements that was just demonstrated

market implications paygo the pay you act paygo 
downside risk already limited stimulus from the tax measure further 
could have specific market implications the congressional budget 
office explained november letter congress the law requires that 
new legislation enacted during congress not increase estimated deficits 
above current levels the omb makes indication increasing 
deficits then omb must order sequestration fancy word for spending 
cuts however paygo exempts many categories spending from 
sequestration for example restricts sequestration cuts medicare 
maximum around billion per year but that leaves only about spending restrict per the sequestration rules this can have 
implications for markets 
take the municipal bond market for example muni investors should note 
the risk that sequester this magnitude could conceivably cut the build 
america bonds subsidies deeply enough such that whole calls 
would become economical for issuers 
for now watching paygo risks rather than making them our base 
case for one appears that only omb can declare sequester and 
conceivable they could delay doing refuse altogether 
addition this only issue tax reform signed this calendar year tax 
reform not signed until paygo would not issue until 
further congress typically does could fix these paygo issuers 
before they took effect possibly part year end spending deal 
shutdown risk rising into year end current funding runs out 
december but expect the real shutdown risk emerges the 
beginning january republicans plan pass two week clean 
continuing resolution until december they then plan 
negotiate the top line appropriations numbers for the bca caps and pass 
another lasting until mid january giving the appropriations committees 
time finalize their bills for passage democrats have leverage since 
spending bills require votes the senate think they will along 
with this planned timing but eventually demand concessions three 
points daca csrs and the border wall these are all also three points 
that conservative republicans are firmly the other side while the 
faster than expected movement tax reform should mean that such 
drama shouldn spill over into finalization tax policy there risk 
particular mitch mcconnell tries make good his promise susan 
collins hold vote the murray alexander bill funding the costsharing reduction payments the and before tax reform 
finalization this could hold the process
