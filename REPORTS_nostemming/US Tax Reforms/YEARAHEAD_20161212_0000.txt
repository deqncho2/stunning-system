should you buy the dip started off would another banner year 
for reits but the sector has significantly underperformed largely 
rates currently the third worst performance for reits relative the 
spx since trailing only and while there have been similar rate 
fear driven sell offs during past several years all which proved buying 
opportunities think this time different 
downgrading our reit industry view cautious two key factors have changed 
from our may industry downgrade line earnings growth likely 
slower than anticipated and rates have risen faster than anticipated now 
project modest decline ffo multiples despite higher earnings our base case 
return with ratio previously and see 
asymmetric bull bear skew and respectively this does not 
include the current dividend yield 
why this time different occupancy and rents are peaking driving 
decelerating revenue growth interest rates are rising and absolute reit 
valuations don look cheap this different than prior cycles where rate hikes 
were accompanied accelerating fundamentals the market has priced higher 
rates but underappreciates slowing growth and therefore reit multiples have 
room contract 
where investors hide investors shouldn follow the conventional rising rate 
play book favoring multifamily and storage that offer shorter lease terms and 
higher rent growth the economy improves instead they should hedge their 
bets with exposure both short well long lease asset classes tactical 
views look important the year ahead think reits are set for volatility

but where should investor hide 
against this uncertain backdrop investors should not follow the conventional rising 
rate playbook which assets with shorter lease durations hotels storage and 
multifamily are favored instead think hedging bets with exposure both short 
and long lease asset classes prudent but avoid making large sector bets 
most subsectors are now trading close their avg ffo multiples with the 
exception industrials that look somewhat expensive adjusting absolute valuation for 
growth ffo growth one subsector stands out with the exception apartments 
which screen expensive 
tactical views look increasingly important the year ahead think reits are setup for volatility given greater risks boom bust periodic rallies are possible 
rates stabilize decline but recommend selling into them 
rates are rising but could bear flattener during which short term rates 
rise more than long term historically this rate scenario results one subsector 
standing out terms stock performance also note our house view that 
yields end relatively flat from today somewhat supportive triple 
nets and healthcare reits 
subsector prefer industrials and select office and triple nets

hedges against risks steeper yield curve while triple nets hedge against

what debated 
this outlook was written conjunction with the broader views expressed morgan 
stanley global economic and strategy teams their respective outlooks the reit team 
had multiple discussions how these views impacted the sector much what debate 
doesn make into the final version the hopes that helps your investment process 
here what left the cutting room floor 
where could wrong our views the cre cycle 
think the market consensus more bullish than ours with expectations quicker 
end the cycle albeit not yet over however there wider range opinions reflective 
pronounced uncertainty result considered more bullish and more bearish 
views follows 
see three primary reasons why our views could too bearish 
overestimating the cre markets reliance financing underestimating the 
strength noi growth and underestimating cre investors willingness accept 
lower return the combination these factors could result cre prices 
continuing rise similar what been observed over the past 
several years 
see three primary reason why our views may too bullish potential tax 
reform underestimating potential for tightening lending conditions and 
deregulation that could net negative for overall cre origination volumes 
banks focus residential lending the combination these factors could result 
cre prices declining similar what was observed the late 
note that one significant difference between now and the late limited 
supply new properties 
this another buying opportunity for reits 
think there debate regarding the pull back presented attractive buying 
opportunity was the beginning revaluation the sector what was the 
very front our mind was that there hasn been two consecutive years reit 
underperformance relative the spx since and our base case for next 
year certainly isn for another great financial crisis bullish factors that considered 
included the sell off rates overdone have reits already priced the decline 
cre valuations and how attractive the dividend yield relative other equity 
alternatives acknowledge these factors our bull case scenario but saw even 
greater tailwinds discussed this report result thought that the riskrewards were skewed favor underweight ultimately view 
another time that reits underperformed the spx for two consecutive years 
better playbook for reits given combination decelerating noi growth and higher 
rates 
should simply recommend blue chip reits 
given pronounced market uncertainty heading into considered the best 
recommendation was simply own blue chip reits regardless their subsector our 
analysis basket blue chips spg frt bxp pld ess psa vtr hcn shows 
this subgroup trading premium the group simple average versus its year 
average premium indeed not often that you have the opportunity buy 
well run companies significant discounts their consensus nav the debt markets 
would call this moving credit quality which trade recommendation are 
favoring the year ahead for our top reit recommendations have selected few 
blue chips overlaying sector fundamentals valuation etc the other hand today 
avoid blue chips some sectors retail that view secularly challenged 
think there will come time own some these names just not today 
should more constructive multifamily storage 
were conflicted our recommendations for multifamily and storage with our 
views shifting several times during our debate market where there are headwinds 
many commercial real estate subsectors making difficult love anything investors 
may start taking longer term view based what works fundamentally multifamily 
and storage fit this description have conviction that longer term fundamentals 
the subsector remain strong however over the near term believe that supply 
pressures may continue weigh the sector and therefore investors may not 
willing take the plunge regardless what the price result chose 
make tactical decisions multifamily and storage recommending caution over the near 
term but acknowledging there likely attractive entry point some time this 
year our fear that time now and are missing 
should outright negative triple nets and 
healthcare 
assuming our base and bull case assumptions rising rates plays out the historical 
playbook would suggest favoring asset classes with shorter lease terms hotels 
storage and multifamily and avoiding those with long lease terms triple nets and 
healthcare think this cycle different given our economics team view 
uncertainty and elevated volatility and greater probability boom bust 
and therefore owning combination long and short lease term assets prudent 
interestingly when the fed first raises rates the curve has flattened historically and 
this environment bear flattener our work shows that one sector stands out 
term stock performance triple nets believe the market already pricing 
year yields between and therefore think the risk further multiple contraction 
more modest given our interest rate teams base case yield target 
acknowledge however steeper than anticipated move rates could result 
material underperformance 
macro backdrop boom bust 
our global macro outlook our economists revised their growth forecasts for 
the bull scenario assumes growth kicked into high 
gear and rates rise more quickly while bear calls for credit crunch and deep recession 
reflation emerging key theme our macro thinking about the our 
economists expect that combination rebounding inflation expectations and abovetrend growth will help keep core pce inflation around over the remainder the 
forecast horizon 
furthermore our economists expect that fiscal policy will continue support growth 
and will likely get more expansionary the late cycle fiscal stimulus will bring 
faster fed hikes two hikes and three more 
our rates strategist expect the treasury market sell off continue into the first 
days trump presidency starts laying the groundwork for his fiscal policy 
agenda they forecast yields end but not before reaching 
the end and that may not represent the high print for the year their bear and 
bull case scenarios calls for yields and respectively year end see

what the right playbook 
our base case economics view rates will continue rise into though the yield 
curve may flatter than prior periods rising rates our economics and strategy 
teams also highlight pull forward growth and the greater likelihood tail risk 
boom bust and persistence uncertainty and high volatility from reit 
perspective important acknowledge are late the fundamental cycle and cre 
price appreciation has stalled offer the following thoughts strategies 
the conventional rising rate playbook may not appropriate 
first rising rates have generally been associated with stronger economy and asset 
classes that can adjust rents offset higher inflation have done well subsector 
office apartments and self storage have outperformed the reit group this 
especially true bear steepening periods can seen the chart below our house 
view fed funds and the suggests more bear flattener which generally 
plays out when the fed first starts raise rates during which historically one

barbell approach short cycle and long lease term names may prudent 
also suggest avoiding large sector bets given our house view treasury yields 
the end suggesting modest move from current levels owning some 
long lease asset classes triple nets and healthcare may not bad idea this would 
also provide hedge against bear case which earnings recession unfolds and this 
accompanied credit crunch 
taking longer term view with secular tailwinds 
while several sectors reits are faced with cyclical headwinds namely elevated 
supply and decelerating rent growth may look brighter for those investors willing 
take longer term view also recommend considering sectors stocks that are

gaming lodging reits downgrading glpi equal weight 
thomas allen 
while cover one sector gaming lodging important stress that the gaming 
reits and the lodging reits couldn more different the lodging reits earn 
revenue based the current pricing their hotel rooms and ancillary sources like 
food beverage and pay managers percentage mostly that revenue meaning the 
lodging reits hold most the positive and negative variance revenue and operating 
leverage associated with their real estate they are very short duration the gaming 
reits are triple nets that earn mostly fixed rents with escalators over year contracts 
with extensions that would bring the contract out years they are very long 
duration 
gaming reits 
given our more cautious outlook the reit sector are more cautious 
the gaming reits are lowering our price targets accordingly and moving glpi 
equal weight from overweight see the future environment difficult for gaming 
reits because their existing fixed rent streams and dividend yields are less attractive 
investors rates rise and part the value gaming reits their ability 
accretively buy the real estate existing casinos given the reits premium multiples 
this becoming more difficult reits multiples have compressed while casino 
operators have rated and the value arbitrage could decline further corporate 
tax rates are lowered reits cost capital benefit regular corps will diminish 
their tax rates converge and there will likely less distressed sellers given higher 
cash flows though rising interest rates could offset this 
our price targets drop for glpi upside and for mgp upside 
have lowered our valuation multiples from for mgp and from 
for glpi while also cutting the future value attributed the stocks from 
acquisitions the next year continue believe that mgp should trade higher 
multiple than glpi given taxable reit subsidiary earnings greater rent 
coverage and built acquisition pipeline with the mgm right first offer rofo 
assets which include nat harbor our price target this offset somewhat 
higher variable interest expense with glpi fixed while mgp only glpi and 
mgp still pay very attractive dividend yields with glpi currently and mgp

key themes for 
trade related concerns potentially overdone 
industrial reit investors are concerned that potential disruptions existing trade 
agreements under the new administration could result higher vacancy rates and 
slower leasing velocity key port markets while our economics team base case 
for protectionism see shot the arm only little further than threats 
volatility could elevated the near term given the associated uncertainty could take 
its toll business investment and capex but shifting the lens industrial reit 
portfolios shows different picture believe industrial reits fundamentals are still 
insulated from this short term shock for the following reasons 
most the trade related throughput warehouses ports are usually owned 
the local port authorities and not the reits thus the reits are shielded from 
the first and most direct degree demand shocks 
reits not own much the inventory smaller border related markets such 
paso and mcallen along the mexico border discuss detail our 
recent collaboration with our mexico fibras analysts all boxes are created almost 
equal 
reit warehouses are driven largely consumer demand and retail activity 
noted our analysis the impact warehouses post brexit see brexit 
industrial reit portfolios are largely dominated retail and ecommerce related 
logistics facilities which are driven consumer demand and favor stable 
and defensive tenants such food and beverage and retail and groceries while 
most the reits have not quantified their trade related exposure pld for 
example disclosed that import export related trade less than its global 
portfolio and other management teams emphasize their distribution and business 
logistics activities 
strong sources non trade related demand exist larger markets even 
assume short term shock demand markets such and the inland empire 
nynj and san francisco and portland are located adjacent some the largest 
consumer markets the with deep pipeline demand from other tenants 
other themes are watching 
given view the trade related uncertainty short term impact chose focus 
the sector fundamentals which are still resilient see the following themes drive 
noi growth 
rent growth remain solid around driven robust demand and rising 
land prices the top markets are all occupied and nationwide availability 
continues record lows reits themselves are average occupied 
suggesting conditions that strongly favor landlords the development front 
rising land prices over the last months are pushing rents new 
projects 
bulk warehouse demand continue bulk warehouse developers such dre 
lpt and pld should continue benefit retailers such target wal mart and 
best buy continue reconfigure their supply chains compete with ecommerce 
players such amazon amazon itself has grown its warehouse footprint 
mil over this year and expected continue expand 
limited availability key urban markets later the year move into 
and beyond expect more emphasis and activity the last mile urban fill 
warehouse category intuitively this makes sense rent costs are usually less than 
retailer fulfillment costs the largest portion the cost transportation and 
the next wave supply chain reconfiguration would likely involve moving distribution 
nodes closer consumers order reduce transport costs all which suggests 
greater demand for urban fill warehouses closer cities fact sign

this the perfect storm for bear case view storage one the sectors with

three main factors the potential for renter fatigue mounting new supply and

decelerated throughout the low single digit range for

deceleration from their reported looking existing

significantly order allow them target longer staying 
customers such the average length stay has increased with

exr now reporting customers have been there longer 
than months from just years ago while this has 
allowed companies reach higher levels occupancy also means that existing 
customers are now more valuable than ever they are paying average rents above 
market with both psa and exr now reporting rent rolldowns move outs 
additionally inherent the company systems are limiters that prevent absolute rates 
from stretching too far above market given the risk losing increasingly valuable 
customer 
new supply continuing accelerate with both and seeing jumps

figures seem manageable context they represent just total existing 
inventory note that building appears concentrated handful markets 
such dallas denver houston new york and miami while the degree 
concentration may provide some offset these are important markets for most reits 
with exr and psa each exposed just these five msas 
property taxes and payroll are both seeing pressure and account for

pressures are expected remain and even increase over the next year property taxes 
property costs have been for both psa and exr with both
