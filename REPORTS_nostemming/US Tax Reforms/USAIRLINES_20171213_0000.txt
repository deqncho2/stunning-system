each week publish our thoughts topical question for 
airlines with tax cuts looking likely the examine 
the implications for the group believe the potential 
notable where top line bottom line and fcf could see 
boost potential standout beneficiaries are alk luv jblu 
jonathan morales 
tax reform where does our firm stand should the tax bill pass proposed 
see notable benefit for airlines start our expectation that tax reform 
progresses and finalized around earlier though will adjusted 
from what has been put forth congress specifically our strategists 
believe could see federal rates lowered based senate and 
house bills interest deductibility ebit consistent with the senate 
draft ebitda for the house bill added deductions from capital 
expenditures and additional global and excise taxes international profits 
with repatriation opportunities and for our analysis model gaap tax 
rate interest ebit threshold and full capex expensing overall 
believe the implications skew positive given healthy balance sheets elevated 
gaap tax rates and notable capex addition the group could see demand 
boost which not considered our analysis net net believe the potential 
notable where top line bottom line and fcf could see uplift alk jblu and 
luv stand benefit the most while the legacies and save stand out less 
relative basis note however that key risks our projections include any 
potential bill changes delays 
from headline tax rate perspective all carriers could record rate which means eps could the range our gaap tax 
rate forecast shown the exhibit below and even when 
considering any limitations interest deductibility all the carriers fall below 
the threshold today environment should note however does 
create added leverage those the cusp aal algt save and ual such 
the universal impact would for benefit eps from the lower rate 
example luv looks set pay tax rate per mse which 
assume goes thus leading eps pick nearly 
but the airline stocks just rate that shouldn the case our view 
not believe that the group would just rate post tax reform and trade 
the current ntm basis this because believe the 
benefits tax reform are real and will create value over the coming years 
addition reform would aid those who not pay cash taxes today there was 
high likelihood that decade end that would not have been the case aal dal 
save and ual and discussed below are not the view that it given 
exhibit the group currently pays high effective tax

their investment decision 
for analyst certification and other important disclosures 
refer the disclosure section located the end this 
report 
that the benefits will bid away and show lower fares higher capacity 
rising labor costs relative our base case the net these dynamics means that 
believe airlines should continue trade the broader 
market which consistent with the past several years assuming the market 
post tax reform trades basis airline shares should trade 
and would argue for the lower end due decelerating margins 
well late cycle capacity aggressiveness lastly would advocate for more 
dispersion multiples particularly for the lccs leisure players they would 
have the stronger and more sustainable fcf profiles post reform

and from cash flow perspective the impact across carriers fairly dispersed 
though fcf yields for the industry from start 
note that the majority the industry does not pay cash taxes aal dal save 
and ual which represent revenues that said each was position 
start making cash payments for example dal was going start making 
payments early albeit low level gaap rate 
nonetheless from our perspective determine the winners assessing 
the fcf yield each the players post reform our base case and what 
found was that lccs alk jblu and luv performed relatively well now 
offering yields worth pointing out that algt and also showed 
notable improvement but off relatively low base and thereby making the 
benefits less compelling per yields conversely the legacies and save 
did not screen having much improvement because they have limited cash tax 
payments already though discussed below the benefit does accrue 
eventually despite being less conviction given the timeline

there also potential for demand boost which don factor with regard 
demand believe there are two opportunities that could have favorable 
impacts the first relates gdp trends history has shown that demand 
grows economic demand but this instance our firm not calling for 
meaningful uplift and only sees due the current late cycle backdrop 
more saving and less spending nonetheless with travel and experiences 
remaining high demand any annual boost household income may show 
higher rate onboards the other hand eps per our equity 
strategist could see uplift based existing proposals which 
believe could support corporate profits and thus business demand couple 
points history for the airlines show clear linkage here per the exhibit below 
such assume there could modest price demand tailwind with the 
carriers most exposed being aal dal luv and ual 
exhibit demand boost could come from higher corporate profits 
corporate profits lhs 
system prasm rhs 
source louis fed revenue report morgan stanley research note corporate profits with iva and adjustments 
will all these benefits simply passed via lower unit revenues our current 
thinking no investors approach tax reform benefits for the airlines 
skeptically given their experiences with lower fuel this because least half 
the fuel windfall was passed passengers the form lower fares despite 
commitments the contrary however with over half the industry revenue 
base position see direct cash benefit from reform are reluctant 
believe that carriers not retain large portion moreover the industry more 
disruptive players aal save and ual not pay cash taxes currently and are 
largely not projected until post decade end finally and though always 
subject change believe that carriers have shown level commitment 
maintain capacity growth certain range and prevent margin degradation 
dal and for instance save has already guided capacity and 
noted significant deceleration into about half support pricing 
margins trends going forward and jblu alk have committed growth 
effectively the msd hsd the current environment that being said 
dynamic worth monitoring particularly with pilot deals open becoming 
amendable decade end 
though taxes were follow fuel estimate the prasm impact would 
basis estimate that cash taxes potentially paid the 
airlines relative the status quo will lower which compares 
revenue base and the event half like fuel was passed 
via lower unit revenues would result pressure pricing all 
else being equal this would equate eps that being said these are 
likely the direct benefits tax reform and exclude any indirect impact 
demand boosts that further the pressure based our firm estimate the 
impact tax reform will have gdp believe prasm will likely 
increase using the long run average gdp however corporate 
profits are expected rise and have historically correlated well with 
airline revenue trends thus discipline the system were lacking the impacts 
pricing could notable via capacity price costs though our view 
remains for limited portion benefits passed the near mediumterm

alk jblu and luv stand benefit the most while the legacies and save are 
less preferred below review each carrier greater detail again our 
assumptions are gaap tax rate interest ebit threshold and 
full capex expensing alk jblu and luv benefit the most given high effective 
tax rates and larger cash tax rates while the legacies and save see less 
impact they currently make zero cash payments 
aal extending the nol benefit the upper end legacy peers 
and with gaap tax rate the eps benefit likely 
and implies shares are trading currently however from 
cash flow perspective benefits are likely limited nols and 
accelerated depreciation shield payments until after and are likely 
further extended post reform 
alk notable fcf yield now with gaap tax rate the 
eps benefit likely and points shares trading 
currently and from cash flow perspective benefits are likely 
material given that estimate cash tax rate and see 
opportunities around full capex expensing given annual spending 
the net this implies that fcf yields from making one 
the better plays tax reform 
algt significant fcf benefit but off low base given 
gaap tax rate the eps benefit likely thus leaving 
shares trading currently and from cash flow 
perspective estimate just above break even levels under the current 
regime due fleet transition investments though with the benefits 
lower tax rate and full capex expensing the figures improve notably 
specifically see the cash tax rate going zero from that said 
the fcf yield only goes from 
dal push out cash tax payments the carrier has one the 
lower gaap tax rates the group due some its international 
operations nonetheless the eps benefit notable leaving 
shares trading prior moving over cash flow dal has 
stated set begin paying taxes sometime whereas now 
that pushed out years however our estimates fcf yields 
are unchanged though the carrier still leader within the 
group 
fcf benefit overshadowed low starting point with 
gaap tax rate the eps benefit likely thus leaving

lower tax rate and full capex expensing the figures improve notably

the fcf yield only moves 
jblu respectable fcf yield now the highest gaap tax rate 
the group creates eps benefit and points 
shares trading currently and from cash flow 
perspective benefits are significant given that estimate cash tax rate 
and see opportunities around full capex expensing due annual 
spending that take the payments zero these dynamics imply 
fcf yields that from and put the carrier amongst the better 
plays the group 
luv fcf generation becomes industry leading with 
gaap tax rate the eps benefit likely and points 
shares trading currently and from cash flow 
perspective benefits are likely material given that estimate the 
highest cash tax rate and see opportunities around full capex 
expensing given annual spending nearly the net this implies that 
fcf yields from making the strongest fcf generator 
amongst the industry while also the highest quality 
save not cash tax payer begin with similar peers the 
airline has gaap tax rate creating benefit eps 
and lowering the multiple though cash flow 
save not cash tax payer which attributable high capex levels 
and moderate pre tax income result fcf levels 
remain negative which project the case over the coming years 
with deficits 
ual nol benefit pushed the right given lower gaap tax rate 
compared peers the eps benefit likely thus 
leaving shares trading currently but from cash flow 
perspective benefits are likely limited nols and accelerated 
depreciation shield payments until after and post reform this 
likely further extended 
overall our stock preferences are unchanged the potential benefit from tax 
reform outlined above reinforces our preferences within the group are 
still comfortable with our overweight stances alk dal and luv 
continue prefer higher quality airlines with idiosyncratic revenue potential 
later the cycle our preferred pick alk due bottoming trends solid 
relative fundamentals and discounted valuation all all continue 
believe that upside potential exists the near term the demand and pricing 
environment showing signs improvement heading into recently 
updated revenue guides support this stance and should continue aid the 
seasonal rally

what investors think they are mixed beneficiaries tax reform though 
lean toward luv over the past week polled investors for their view 
which airline likely benefit the most the event that tax reform 
implemented while all investors saw the event positive for the group they 
were mixed the biggest beneficiary the largest group cited luv the 
biggest winner given its high cash tax rate and domestic skew another contingent 
favored alk for similar reasons though noted its exposure the california 
market where individual tax rates likely move higher and could restrain some 
the upside others preferred the ulccs algt and save the 
grounds that they would see pick demand given their customer base the 
remaining respondents were roughly split between jblu and dal
