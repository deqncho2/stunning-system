paying for profitless 
growth early look into 
vast majority our companies are growing eps due 
tax reform but about half have declining ebit against this 
backdrop multiples have modestly risen what happens 
when tax reform lapped stick with companies that 
can grow ebit including home low ulta and eye 
focus but not too early talk about there unique set for 
retail stocks tough topline compares are cycled and there are worries 
over the sustainability consumer spending momentum part the 
set there profound change coming when the tax reform benefit 
cycled and eps growth set slow across the board 
putting tax reform into context for our coverage eps growth for expected 
average compared the bulk growth being 
driven financial leverage tax reform stock buyback not operating profit 
ebit growth for expected average contribution only 
eps growth with companies growing ebit declining fair some 
companies have reinvested tax reform savings above the line but the overall trend for ebit growth has not been favorable 
paying for profitless growth potential eps growth slowdown 
matters because multiples have increased slightly particularly among our 
large cap stocks where they are half turn higher 
market cap basis stocks have been rewarded for eps growth inflated 
financial leverage much which will lapped several companies with 
declining ebit trends per year from like wmt tgt wsm and 
bbby have seen their multiples expand turn ytd whereas 
home low and ulta have been growing ebit mid teens rate and 
have seen their multiples contract turn essence the market paying 
more for less profit for the first group and vice versa for the second 
does ebit growth matter think historically ebit growth has driven 
stock price performance and lesser extent multiples these relationships 
are now decoupling since changes ebit have explained changes 
stock prices for our coverage since the correlation has significantly 
weakened changes ebit have explained only changes stock prices 
since ebit has also contributed median eps growth 
and ebit contribution eps decreased just this data implies stocks 
are rising financial leverage not profit growth 
yet ebit still declining and consensus estimates seem optimistic

are not forecasting big inflection ebit growth thus tax reform 
lapped eps growth should decelerate model deceleration eps 
and ebit average across our 
coverage while have slightly fewer companies with declining ebit 
last year growth remains lackluster addition the consensus modeling 
steeper acceleration ebit growth within this some the 
consistent decliners are expected show the greatest improvement which 
seems optimistic our view for example companies like dks and wsm have 
averaged ebit declines and respectively over the last four years but 
consensus calling for meaningful improvement and 
recognize some companies are rolling off tax reform investments but ebit 
growth will likely difficult come 
how can investors navigate this setup would focus companies growing 
their ebit dollars which should explain much higher percent eps growth 
like rated home ulta low and eye because they will 
compound ebit growth the other hand multiples for 
tgt wmt wsm and bbby have appreciated turn without delivering ebit 
growth declining year over last years for wmt flipkart expected 
partially responsible for ebit declines but for the others their multiples bear 
watching profit outlook remains challenged 
paying for profitless growth 
benefit from financial leverage model eps growth step 
from this step mainly driven financial leverage tax reform and 
stock buybacks rather than operating profit for which model growth only 
exhibit eps growth benefit from financial leverage and not operating profit
