since the presidential election utility valuations have trended more expensive relative

tax reform could negative for utility dividend yields relative bond yields and 
this underappreciated dynamic our view under the house blueprint the tax 
rate taxable bond income would reduced from including the 
income tax rate and investment income tax for those the top tax bracket 
and dividend tax rates would also fall but from lower level base 
dividend tax rate plus investment income tax the difference between the two tax rate 
reductions leads substantial benefit for after tax interest compared after tax 
dividends average since corporate bond after tax yields have traded 
above utility after tax dividend yields driven modest valuation premium for utilities 
growth currently corporate bonds are yielding just more than utility dividends 
below the average signifying that utilities screen attractive relative fixed income 
investment opportunities after tax basis our estimates the tax reform 
proposals the house blueprint would flip this relationship resulting utility after tax 
dividend yields trading below corporate bond yields well excess the 
average and relatively more expensive compared the historical rate thus utility 
income may less favorable relative fixed income investments following this tax

disconnect between private and public valuations continues tax 
reform uncertainty likely slow regulated transactions 
continue see large disparity between public market and private market 
values for unregulated assets including merchant and renewables assets but tax 
reform uncertainty likely slow regulated our view there are several 
elements within the tax reform proposals that could impact companies eps growth 
rates cash flow trends credit metrics such ffo debt and even cost capital 
eliminating the deduction interest expense all these metrics are important 
considerations utility and since the uncertainty around which proposals will 
survive final tax reform package will likely last until mid believe regulated 
more likely slow next year that said still think useful exercise 
consider which utilities exhibit metrics that are reflective more attractive acquisition 
potential believe regulated utilities with especially large capex potential relative 
their market capitalization present more attractive acquisition candidates despite the 
initial acquisition price often implying low returns the existing asset base once 
acquired all future spending achieves the more attractive earned roe the utility

utilities the sum dividend yield and expected eps growth low standard deviation 
means that the market assigns higher multiples for higher growth and lower 
multiples for lower growth interestingly the current standard deviation for utilities

deviation was and believe this reflects the turmoil the utility sector caused significant passive capital inflows into the utility sector believe this 
capital flow often indiscriminate with respect eps growth addition view the

tax reform 
expect tax reform key focus and expect reduction federal 
corporate tax rates the most likely outcome most diversified utilities and ipps 
benefit from lower taxes our view this would improve earnings and cash flow for 
the unregulated businesses many stocks the group however this contrasts 
regulated utility peers which are unlikely see sustainable positive benefit from 
lower taxes 
key elements republican tax reform proposals focus three elements 
republican tax reform proposals that would have important implications for utilities 
reduction the corporate income tax rate from the specific rate 
varies across the proposals elimination the deductibility interest expense 
for tax purposes which would implemented exchange for full and immediate 
expensing capex note that currently unclear whether the latter two 
provisions may elective mandatory for all industries based our dialogue with 
numerous parties believe reduction the corporate tax rate has the highest 
chance being passed while expensing all capex and eliminating the interest deduction 
are likely face heightened pushback from lawmakers given the widespread 
ramifications these policies would have across numerous industries 
diversified utilities and ipps generally benefit from lower tax rate while regulated 
utilities would likely experience lower cash flow but modestly higher eps growth 
regulated utilities would likely pass through the benefit lower tax rates their 
customers resulting lower pre tax income and cash inflows for utilities whose parent 
companies hold large nols cash taxes were already shielded the nol the 
reduction pre tax income has negative impact cash flow the other hand 
earnings power would modestly higher because the nol balance the utility would 
used more slowly and this results higher net rate base level though this 
temporary dynamic through the period which the nol used our estimates for 
hypothetical regulated utility with nol that would shield the utility from paying 
taxes for years reduction the tax rate would reduce cash flows during the nol 
usage period while the annual earnings growth would rise conversely for 
diversified utilities and ipps profitable unregulated operations will benefit directly from 
the decrease the corporate tax rate and this benefit does not get passed through 
customers 
regarding the immediate deduction capex and the loss the deductibility 
interest expense see potential risk the customer benefits such approach are 
sufficiently positive donald trump proposed approach would allow companies 
elect whether fully expense capex immediately the offset would that the 
company could not take deduction for interest expense while the house blueprint 
does not specify whether these elements would elective mandatory assuming 
that these elements are elective believe utilities would prefer opt not take this 
approach and remain with status quo tax treatment unless the net customer benefit 
greater result view this potential risk factor consider could lead 
reduction rate base and earnings growth and utilities with lower debt cap ratios 
and lower current nols would most risk 
overall see several business model qualities that maximize tax reform benefits 
high percentage positive unregulated earnings small nonexistent nol 
positions and minimal non utility debt companies with large unregulated losses high 
parent interest expenses and large existing nol benefit less some cases are 
worse off from the tax reform proposals
