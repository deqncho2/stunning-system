new item the report pertaining foreign domiciled companies has caught 
the attention investors this could have implications for medtronic the plan 
includes provision that payments from subsidiaries foreign companies 
will taxed when sent the foreign parent since the new proposed 
statutory rate this could limit potential tax savings from inversions 
and could have implications for transfer pricing believe this new 
legislative item that may come surprise investors since medtronic 
domiciled ireland following the covidien acquisition and inversion the 
company could see outsized effect our coverage only grifols spain

also domiciled 
excerpt under the provision payments other than interest made 
corporation related foreign corporation that are deductible includible costs 
goods sold includible the basis depreciable amortizable asset would 
subject percent excise tax unless the related foreign corporation elected 
treat the payments income effectively connected with the conduct 
trade business consequently the foreign corporation net profits gross 
receipts election made with respect those payments would subject 
full tax eliminating the potential tax benefit otherwise achieved source 
ways and means committee 
our preliminary read this provision suggests could move medtronic tax 
rate towards eps impact but visibility into the mechanics the 
provision are low given that medtronic the only one our companies that 
has inverted foreign domicile have taken preliminary look the effect 
this legislation might have the company our working understanding this 
provision that would practice push medtronic corporate tax rate closer 
versus the have modeled for given that general taxadvantaged geographies that likely hold and manufacturing could get 
penalized the tax rate related products are sold the and 
international markets likely have tax rates modestly above per the 
oecd which could offset from exposure annual corporate tax rate 
would impact eps with change the corporate 
tax rate equating eps while this could significant 
caution investors ascribing too much this latest news flow given visibility 
into the mechanics the provision are low the final form the tax bill 
passed may include additional changes and medtronic may effect structural 
changes mitigate exposure
