meghan robson cfa 
house gop tax bill introduced last week would limit interest deductibility this 
has led concerns over the future private equity which uses leverage and the 
potential for reduced supply the high yield bond market what does the tax 
bill propose the bill limits interest deductibility adjusted taxable 
income expected add roughly tax revenues over the next years 
payfor item cutting corporate tax rates real estate and utilities are 
exempt well companies generating under revenues 
what are investors worried about stress the high yield market issuers 
could face higher after tax cost interest especially with grandfathering 
existing debt scarcity high yield bond market supply the proposal deters 
companies from increasing leverage and impact the private equity business 
model and investment returns private equity represents significant portion 
earnings power the publicly listed alternative asset mgrs 
billion potential reasons thrive from dislocation regardless what 
final tax bill would include change could create market dislocations believe 
there will winners and losers which could generate attractive new investment 
opportunities for the alts bolstered their locked capital and over 
dry powder sitting the sidelines overweight oak best positioned for 
dislocation given their skew distressed investing and dry powder 
overweight and equal weight apo also well positioned 
not game changer our work suggests incrementally higher lbo 
funding costs tax rate layering interest deductibility limitations 
implies incremental lbo funding costs this should not major 
headwind for supply the marketplace additionally limited interest 
deductibility would impact private equity irrs only tax 
rate but would boost irrs with corporate tax rate though 
not significant for most the market this tax change fundamental headwind 
for the most levered corporates and may also deter companies from 
becoming too highly levered leading greater use preferred equity

limiting interest deductibility not game changer 
potential impact credit markets 
capping the interest expense deduction percentage ebitda opposed 
haircut the interest expense deduction for all companies more insignificant 
outcome for credit only issuers have interest expense ebitda 
repatriation will bias supply lower but not think this interest expense 
deduction cap will alter behavior material way for the story bit different 
about one third the high yield universe would see interest deductibility capped 
however note that even with this change for majority the market 
business usual and remember not companies will shut off issuance just 
because they get close above this threshold 
for most names the market even those above the cap the cost debt still 
very low for now and remains cheap way fund businesses for example for 
company with interest expense ebitda assuming yield and 
corporate tax rate the after tax cost debt would rise given cap 
cap interest deductibility not enough materially move the needle overall 
supply 
fact corporate confidence typically bigger driver debt growth cycles than 
the cost debt arguably business activity and capex has been restrained 
due heightened uncertainty around tax reform tax reform passes and uncertainty 
drops while business confidence keeps rising issuance for this type activity could 
actually pickup that said there pocket the market the most levered issuers 
well above the cap where balance sheets would become less viable some cases and 
see this tax change additional fundamental headwind that could weigh 
this part the market however this less supply question and more one 
many factors that will continue drive underperformance for ccc bonds part 
the market that continue underweight 
two other considerations remember the amount interest expense that these 
companies can deduct would fall when they are performing poorly and hence ebitda 
lower and fed rate hikes would disproportionality penalize leveraged loan issuers 
above the cap given floating rate structures

potential impact alternative asset managers 
our lbo analysis suggests that concerns over interest deductibility are overdone 
isolation limitations interest deductibility would modestly negative for alternative 
asset manager investment returns and could reduce irrs roughly 
deductibility limited adj taxable income current tax rate 
alternatively interest deductibility fully eliminated that could reduce returns 
the impact capping interest expense for private equity essentially equivalent 
bps higher funding costs after tax current tax rate tax rates drop 
then the impact would equivalent about bps higher funding cost aggregate 
believe that interest deductibility does not pose major headwind while the cost 
debt may move modestly debt still relatively cheaper within the overall capital 
structure 
isolation limiting deductibility interest without reduction corporate tax rates 
could broadly result possible markdowns portfolio values from corporate 
valuations and longer term reduction private equity returns would reduce carried 
interest revenues but mentioned above and show the tables below the 
estimated impact returns are modest 
tax rates decline addition the interest deductibility see net 
benefit private equity returns due the lower corporate tax rate earnings and 
estimate bps boost irrs interest deductibility fully eliminated the 
context corp tax rate still see net benefit private equity returns and 
estimate bps boost irrs that scenario 
estimate the impact longer term and returns flex our year lbo model 
private equity assume debt equity split the capital structure 
coupon rate and tax rate 
private real estate under the current proposed tax bill real estate companies are 
exempt from the new interest deductibility thresholds hence there likely 
impact private real estate 
opportunity for overweight oaktree oak tax law changes could result additional 
fundamental headwind for the most levered corporate issuers well above the cap 
interest deductibility where balance sheets may become less viable some cases 
such stressed situation view oaktree best positioned across the alts 
capitalize the distressed opportunity set given their track record and leadership 
distressed investing along with their expertise and track record various other credit 
strategies including high yield and upside earnings from fees turning for their 
opportunities fund oak able identify more investment opportunities 
currently forecast management fees turning for the fund result 
limited distressed investment opportunities the credit environment has been benign 
with last four quarter high yield bond default rate less than half the long term 
average with committed capital opps should boost management 
fees fee related earnings and assuming 
margin and eps this currently our estimates but the 
environment changes and fees turn sooner that could drive upside our
