another but still positive 
defense budget outlook 
each week look publish our thoughts topical 
question for the industry this note visit where 
are dod budget resolution given recent action 
congress and engagement the president that said 
believe step with moderate growth thereafter 
remains probable 
not too concerned about impact another temporary delay budget 
resolution our supportive defense stance congress passed short term 
stopgap funding bill thursday while president trump met with congressional 
leaders late afternoon attempt accelerate negotiations 
comprehensive deal that said continue anticipate step into 
dod spend and growth per annum over time which should 
support sentiment premium multiples and our forward estimates this leaves 
comfortable with our favorable stance and our rank order preference remains 
lmt rtn noc and then 
it possible that congress requires extension the continuing 
resolution into the new year congress averted government shutdown 
thursday afternoon passing two week extension the current which 
will now expire december while progress has been made with the house 
and senate agreeing the ndaa conference report november tax 
reform the current priority and such the budget taking somewhat 
backseat given the prioritization believe possible see additional 
short term extension the into january while push resolve tax reform 
made mse and despite the delays the current the shorter side 
historically weeks weeks year average and unlikely have impacted 
orders meaningful way just yet 
though continue expect budget step with least 
normalized growth level thereafter the president and congress have both put 
forth national defense spending proposals which imply healthy growth 
passed the president request the lower the two calls for increase 
while the version the national defense authorization act ndaa 
congress agreed calls for though investors could argue that these set 
the floor and ceiling for spending levels the budget control act bca needs 
altered order realize those levels since considerably lower and for 
this occur there will likely comprises with increased funding for nondefense discretionary spending accordingly the budget may come closer 
that the president request mse and consistent with consensus our 
view will serve reset for defense spending and growth from there
