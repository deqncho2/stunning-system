takeaways from bizjet 
conference stable yet not 
inflecting 
each week look publish our thoughts topical 
question for this report provide highlights from 
the nbaa conference that pointed more stable market 
trends and optimism around tax reform stimulus but 
growing slate competitive products and lack confidence 
upturn 
nbaa broadly reinforced our preference for commercial aerospace and 
defense over bizjet though acknowledge lack further deterioration 
the latter the general news flow from the conference was relatively light 
though note gulfstream appears progressing well its 
aircraft introductions and bombardier solidified its learjet program with new 
orders while dassault announced delays its falcon due engine 
setbacks meanwhile from our meetings came away with four key takeways 
secondary market trends are more stable but are not pointing quick 
turnaround any recovery new jet sales not believed meaningful 
until key markets like the achieve sustainably higher gdp the most 
product disruption taking place the long range end from new entrants and 
sentiment remains optimistic and furthered potential for tax reform 
that being said and while encouraging extent believe the risk reward 
remains more favorable commercial aerospace given the strong traffic trends 
cancellations deferrals near lows and forecasted production hikes boeing 
and airbus and defense the budget cycle upturn annual total return 
and upside potential from any conflict keep more interested here accordingly 
remain txt and erj 
secondary market trends are more stable but are not pointing quick 
turnaround disciplined oem pricing has supported stable supply demand 
levels for new aircraft which has likely helped clear used inventory fact 
heard that activity levels the used market this year have been close 
average meanwhile the percent active fleet for sale approaching year 
low the discipline naturally self serving oems are mindful the residual 
values for their aircraft but more importantly they have refrained from entering 
into significant price cuts across jet sizes the improvement has been most 
noticeable light and medium jets inventory levels were already fairly 
stable the heavy jet side and supporting commentary from companies for 
multi year backlogs another data point honeywell business jet survey that 
also pointed improvement inventory levels however still sees

competition and apart from small variant changes comfortable with its 
portfolio legacy certified management also 
expects recovery the light medium jet market where has seen the 
most investment phenom and legacy and used inventory cleared
