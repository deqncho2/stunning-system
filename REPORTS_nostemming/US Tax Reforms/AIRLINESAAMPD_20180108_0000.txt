discuss the following this week pilot dal investor update that 
was largely line with expectations our view that airlines will have 
better narrative expectation for steadiness legacy 
unit revenues thereby maintaining healthy pricing guides that should remain 
largely unchanged except for aal and save for there still lot 
goodness going within the sector and got tax reform and now it 
likely get some pension pre funding

dal investor update was largely line with expectations last week dal 
provided its last investor update before reporting earnings within the 
update the carrier maintained recently refreshed prasm mse 
the same which has been driven strength every entity and improvement 
the competitive environment expect the strength continue and forecast 
prasm despite tougher compares and rising capacity 
additionally the airline lowered asms for the quarter prior result the recent power outages atlanta and winter storms 
casm fuel was maintained down flat recently highlighted and 
continue believe that dal the legacy airline thus remain 
believe airlines will have better narrative start 
many the negatives are known the market relates capacity 
competition and costs these create upward pressure around pricing trends 
when compared more modest investor expectations and when layering 
benefits from tax reform that are not yet eps fcf alongside multiples that 
will below the norms recent years the risk skews favorably fact can 
envision the seasonal rally carrying into all that being said are unlikely 
see margin expansion above average eps growth relative the broader 
market later point the cycle thus making major rate lower 
probability when taking these dynamics into account believe the quality 
plays which coincidently also benefit from tax reform continue make the 
most sense for investors alk dal luv all see year ahead outlook 
the trend your friend 
and investors anticipate steadiness legacy unit revenues thereby 
maintaining positive pricing pricing accelerated sequentially into the 
competitive environment improved due more select price matching global

demand trends saw slight pick and international trends finished strong 
the dollar continued slide move into trends from the major 
airlines indicate that the competitive environment has continued show 
improvement with carriers fine tuning their pricing strategies and thereby leading 
better close yields addition anticipate carriers will attempt pass 
along some the fuel increases and the demand boost from recent tax reform 
could push pricing higher that being said compares are tougher 
year basis though closer flattish year basis following the corporate 
demand rebound that saw last year along with domestic capacity ticking 
according current schedules such forecast legacy 
prasm yoy above the lccs flattish given number 
idiosyncratic headwinds that these carriers are set face all which discuss 
more detail below all all believe these trends should still remain 
supportive airline shares and coincide with our belief that the seasonal rally 
should continue into early see expecting pricing stability into 
guides likely remain largely unchanged except for aal and save recent 
updates have indicated carriers are seeing improvement the competitive 
environment well increase demand additionally dal called out 
surprising strength the transatlantic that expect carries over aal thus 
moved aal rasm forecast the upper end its current range mse 
guide and consistent with previous expectations 
remain the upper end for save mse rasm down guide down which believe was conservative its initial expectations and should also 
benefit from the rising tide within the industry these dynamics should support 
the narrative the near term building off the strength that have seen 
recently see our views december traffic updates 
aerospace defense 
there still lot goodness going within the sector 
look forward our expectation for more tailwinds than headwinds for the 
group starting with end markets for aerospace see significant growth 
potential over the next years from rising narrowbody production and healthy 
air traffic while there boost military spending for defense moving tax 
reform although appreciated the markets should provide step eps 
fcf consensus and roll through above average benefits 
rates going from nearly and then there strategic activity ranging 
from straightforward noc partnering bbd air and 
erj divestiture potential arnc simply potential aggressive pension 
funding lmt and rtn that could create support for the stocks finally 
regard our stock preferences for now continue prefer value oem plays 
spr over bizjet and services tdg and txt are also favoring lmt 
rtn within defense idiosyncratic value creation opportunity below walk 
through our key debates for the industry and views each the companies 
under coverage see year ahead outlook still comfortable being there 
got tax reform and now it likely get some pension pre funding lmt 
and rtn management have been open with the investment community about 
taking opportunistic approach around pre funding their pensions which 
have been supportive given how the market values their stocks and fcf 
yields fact lmt management its recent earnings call noted fact tax 
reform initiated will clearly look potentially accelerating our pension 
contributions and regard rtn though management has been less direct 
its comments has history accelerated pension funding albeit modestly 
and noted openness various approaches our opinion the large change 
federal tax rates and high likelihood industry bellwether lmt prefunding raises the potential for the company follow suit accordingly our 
updated models now reflect accelerated funding and 
for lmt and rtn respectively account for paying down three additional 
years pre tax pension this has the impact raising eps and fcf thus 
driving our pts upward see tax reform here now what pension for lmt

sentiment slowing but not rolling over aero cycle and 
robust fcf made shares compelling believe will 
difficult for shares move too far above peer market 
multiple given that has the strongest cash flow profile

half trillion dollar backlog view the premium 
justified and more than offsetting the cycle risks 
having successfully addressed the relative pricing 
narrative remain constructive dal dal 
deteriorated revenue premium and peers own accelerating 
initiatives restrained shares and while the outlook 
may somewhat aspirational are encouraged nearterm revenue trends close yields improve 
management commitment rein supply meet margin 
targets and investor expectations that are more modest

discounted valuation relative peers are 
debates 
will alk continue see unit revenue weakness competitive capacity levels have come down significantly 
from prior double digit levels though the trend looks like it starting reverse the carrier adds significant 
capacity through the first half that being said following the addition these new markets comparisons 
should prove much easier and unit revenues likely outperform 
does alk ability manage costs advantage peers alk has one the most effective cost control 
programs relative peers fuel unit costs continue come down from modest wage increases aboveaverage capacity growth and aircraft gauging which has put the company position reduce casm

risks network related competition macro trends rising fuel prices integration related setbacks 
can arnc delever with cash hand there are significant opportunities for capital deployment 
can topline growth improve stocking trends and technological difficulties surrounding its core 
aerostructures and engine component businesses simply teething issues have weighed the company

competition from substitute materials broader economic slowdown potential legal implications 
has sentiment improved past share underperformance has been due part cyclical concerns tough

these being addressed having already played out applying peers well 
will margins expand the boeing backlog impressive nearly half trillion dollars and more diversified

our target and not the current line figure 
while appreciate resilient pricing trends that have 
consistently outpaced the industry for some time view 
this more difficult sustain given the potential for its 
relatively benign competitive environment turn along with 
peers improving trajectory moreover the rising

when combine these dynamics with relatively full

jblu clearly executing upon the necessary initiatives 
restore rasm outperformance and maintain improve its 
relative cost advantage that being said competitive risks 
are present and rising within focus cities thus threatening 
jblu revenue trends and wage increases both announced and 
potentially upcoming given ongoing pilot negotiations 
threaten cost management over the near medium term 
when combine this with valuation that line with lcc 
peers are 
can withstand pressure from competitive capacity growth competitive capacity has been relatively benign 
since mid and schedules are starting show inflection all three regions internationally continental

how does valuation compare peers generates operating margins more less line with peers and 
has significant percentage its network higher risk international markets addition see cost inflation 
ahead the above factors coupled with its underfunded pension liability are likely limit multiple expansion 
our view 
risks stronger than expected capital returns non passenger revenues exceeding our forecast rising fuel 
prices route maturity international markets better than forecasted management labor related costs 
how does jblu network positioning compare peers going forward the potential exists for increased 
competition core markets yields remain strong which bares monitoring furthermore with its major terminal 
investment fort lauderdale the airline set expand its latin america footprint leading more overall 
international exposure which also poses another level risk over time 
how initiatives stack jblu management introduced number initiatives that are set provide 
additional operating income over the next few years our view there could upside these

and shareholder friendly approach although 
underperforming pricing trends late have lagged the 
industry and weighed share performance see 
improvement with the implementation the new 
reservation system and the upcoming fleet transition this 
dynamic reinforced heavy domestic presence which 
view preferable international and upside exposure 
potential corporate tax reform when consider this 
the context with well hedged fuel position broadly 
rising oil environment are 
can luv regain pricing outperformance pricing should get back track although southwest has recently 
underperformed its above industry average rasm growth expect trends revert back the norm due 
decelerating supply profile the fleet transitions and close yield improvement primary driver the previous 
lag 
there are number offsetting factors that drive our more 
neutral stance when compared our coverage the 
company has light fcf yield and margin growth profile 
relatively speaking addition there more moderate 
visibility the outlook due sales coming from 
classified work that said noc will have leading sales 
growth profile the tune cagr and healthy 
capital returns profile conjunction with this growth would 
drive fcf eps expansion annually 
how does valuation compare its peers believe that may difficult for the airline return prior 
growth levels may dilutive unit revenues given its size and expansive network plus require further 
increasing its footprint beyond the continental the emphasis growth fades the historical ntm 
not applicable our view 
risks growth story materially accelerates decelerates wage increases exceed expectations unit revenue 
resilience subsides the macro environment and falling rising fuel prices 
will the encounter developmental issues along the lines the usaf organization charged with 
running the source selection and early stages the program has track record for delivering within contract 
terms that paired with rumors noc investing heavily upfront lead believe the program currently 
good shape and will remain that way 
will classified programs grow faster than the broader defense market when high threat environment arise 
such the one find ourselves today highly classied programs tend emerge for that reason our 
opinion that classified will continue see healthy funding possibly excess those accounts have visability 
into 
risks increased scrutiny classified programs major technological breakthroughts major downturns the 
economy 
our opinion raytheon substantial international 
will international growth continue see international defense investment continuing higher clip 
exposure and leading solutions high demand areas the supported nato nations asia pacific and the middle east given the regions respective security threats 
market such missiles defense cybersecurity and others given rtn highly exportable portfolio their success should continue 
rtn make well positioned for solid top line growth and upside 
surprises addition margin expansion solid fcf 
will the north korean missile threats translate additional missile defense sales saw eastern 
generation conversion and one the best 
europe threats grow counties ramp spending see rok japan and the all bolstering their defensive 
balance sheets set strong narrative for shareholder 
systems the already see the administration pushing for increased mda funding

grown revenues and capacity well excess the overall group times all while maintaining aftertax 
spirit provides investors with one the better capacity 
save growth stories the group per year addition roics going forward project this continue the airline has the aircraft order book cost 
the airline has one the lowest cost structures which structure network opportunity and funds continue executing its asm growth objective 
expect remain that being said the carrier strategy can save multiples move higher our estimates show that eps will increase going forward fuel more 
than offset unit revenue pressures nonetheless the capacity growth story remains intact which should drive 
target volume and profits over unit revenues and unique 
multiples higher versus the industry 
fare structure should weigh margins the current 
competitive environment accordingly are equalweight risks increased competition from other carriers ancillary growth slows labor uncertainty macro environment

post favorable resolution master contract 
negotiations spr has fewer overhangs and greater 
capacity focus execution programs that are 
ramping production through the end the decade 
moreover believe the new management team solid 
progress troubled programs and improved cash flow 
execution can justify rating closer peers 
tdg stand out relative peers given margins that are 
higher and eps growth target almost double 
along with defensible operating position through 
proprietary sole source products that being said 
valuation appears appreciate this dynamic and leverage 
levels peers are quite aggressive the net these 
dynamics keeps neutral the company 
debates 
how will negotiations with turn out consistent with our positive stance spr the risk reward looks 
supportive our assumption that average pricing boeing shipsets come down the status quo 
and partially offset going productivity benefits thus leaving margins essentially unchanged 
can valuation move higher spr trades discount the group and nearly discount 
boeing despite essentially being extension the oem and our opinion having better growth prospects 
the form further airbus penetration and defense wins 
risks further charges development programs new management team and execution issues production 
rate increases 
can tdg aftermarket continue perform tdg business well diversified due the broad range 
products offers customers and has product lines via its decentralized operating companies 
are there risks margins although high mix proprietary and sole source products constructive for 
margins think continuing commentary from boeing regarding both wanting capture higher margins and 
more aftermarket content has caused some concern suppliers broadly 
risks air traffic slowdown causing weaker than expected aftermarket demand high leverage pipeline 
slowing down margin compression through pricing pressures 
can bizjet and helo markets perform even bizjet has been stabilizing growth may limited our view 
the bizjet segment the aerospace sector reflects low growth expectations the near medium term our 
projections show that with this backdrop growth revenues and margins will likely limited even with the 
introduction new products 
have generally cautious view the company 
particularly given the challenging bizjet and helicopter end 
markets which together make revenue both 
markets are arguably tied the same drivers factors 
txt fairly valued our valuation view limits the upside see shares perform sum the parts 
relating the health the economy such gdp and analysis utilizing mix bizjet helo defense and industrial multiples reach our target 
global corporate profits and equity market values closely 
correlate fleet levels 
risks bizjet and helicopter demand rebounds significantly international defense orders materialize sooner than 
anticipated rising competition productivity and price improve drive margins higher 
can ual reach margin parity speed bumps likely path margin parity the path margin parity 
the current backdrop ual low margin profile and 
elevated debt levels create cyclical leverage that bodes well impressive and possibility over time but potential obstacles including outsized international exposure 
system peers and growing focus domestic exist note that significant upside exists the 
for shares moreover the long term outlook identifies 
clear path towards margin parity with peers scenario that airline can deliver its goal margin parity 
implies significant upside eps that being said such how does valuation compare peers historically shares have traded discount peers namely dal 
opportunity multi year nature and elevated valuation range metrics primarily due subdued margins and somewhat elevated leverage but this not the case 
late skews the risk reward unfavorably when combine late 
this with elevated debt balance difficult exposures
