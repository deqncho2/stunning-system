tactically positive discount brokers and traditional asset mgrs given cyclical 
tailwinds and earnings boost from tax cuts however enthusiasm will eventually

executive summary 
what happened 
supportive financial and capital markets backdrop drove strong stock performance 
across the brokers and asset managers during the year with the group rising 
average outperforming the about points and outperforming our 
expectations our outlook about points 
discount brokers were the best performing sector our coverage rising with 
points out performance the and points ahead our 
expectations brokers benefited from interest rate hikes stronger retail client 
engagement the context supportive financial markets and prospects for tax reform 
that could boost earnings significantly lpla and etfc outperformed while amtd 
underperformed lpla which rated underweight was our worst stock call 
looking back see the company was more rate sensitive than previously thought 
regulatory costs and impact were under control and market expectations had troughed 
all setting for earnings beats that were further bolstered accretive our 
overweight schw call worked slightly better than expected with accelerating organic 
growth and margin expansion 
alternative asset mgr stocks advanced average for about points 
outperformance and points ahead our expectation the alts saw strong 
organic asset growth boosting management fees and robust capital markets 
environment supporting crystallization cash performance fees apo and were the 
top outperforming stocks while ares notably underperformed our overweight 
call worked better than expected improving trajectory for fee related earnings 
growth and still see room for upside our overweights and oak 
disappointed leaving room for significant upside 
traditional asset mgr stocks rose average for about point 
outperformance and points ahead our expectation traditionals benefited from 
cyclical tailwinds that overpowered secular headwinds rising market values and 
improving active manager performance lifted fund navs and management fee revenues 
organic asset growth improved and prospects for tax reform that could drive significant 
earnings upside helped lift the stocks trow and blk were the top outperformers 
while vrts and ben notably underperformed while our overweight blk call worked 
better than expected with organic asset growth accelerating and coming above 
management target overweight ivz call disappointed slightly trow wdr all 
performed significantly better than expected driven improving flow trajectory and 
expectations higher earnings from lower taxes they key beneficiaries tax cuts 
but underweight wdr still lagged the group 
the winding road ahead 
see supportive backdrop for brokers and asset manager stocks with global 
synchronous growth slow and gradual unwind rising front end the curve 
potential higher volatility and lower corporate tax rates 
near term expect strength discount brokers and traditional asset mgr stocks 
the market digests significant upward earnings estimate revisions for stemming 
from corporate tax cuts euphoria will likely give way uncertainty and caution 
becomes clearer that meaningful portion tax cuts could competed away over 
multi year period via pricing changes and investments the business required 
address secular changes expect earnings estimate dispersion widen and multiples 
contract estimates look less achievable 
alternative asset mgrs may continue lag near term they not viewed tax 
reform winners but expect sharp reversal and outperformance becomes 
clear that they benefit from tax reform via their portfolio companies and they may 
convert corps which could expand their investor base and lead rating 
their higher multiple management fee stream wouldn surprised see the first 
corp conversion announcement from ares the coming weeks which could 
followed other structural changes from peers during 
our top picks schw benefit from improving organic growth trajectory with 
stock specific catalysts that should lead higher earnings has best class 
franchise with unparalleled fundraising ability and laddered fund profile drive more 
consistent and higher cash earnings which think will drive multiple expansion expect 
new initiatives including permanent capital vehicles across various strategies 
accelerate asset growth new insurance initiatives infrastructure longer dated 
core funds well continued push into the retail channel will create growing 
source sticky management fees that should command higher multiple 
upside target plus dividend yield for total return continues thrive 
the goldilocks era for alternative asset managers and also restructuring story asset 
growth should inflect their fee related earnings the end the 
current run rate upside target plus dividend yield for total 
return schw asset growth story with upside from rising rates and major 
beneficiary tax reform balance sheet growth will accelerate into expect 
them onboard client cash currently held money funds total 
return all three top picks play the theme synchronous global growth with

certain goals were not met media reports have

some have focused amtd potential buyer etfc 
given amtd historical role consolidating many discount 
brokers over the past decade including its recent scottrade 
acquisition the market has chosen focus outright 
sale the company the most likely strategic alternative 
the board etfc would pursue and given that have 
focused that potential outcome here however likely 
that there are other potential strategic steps the company 
could consider strategic alternative outcome pursued 
recent the discount brokerage space has also 
renewed market focus etfc which has publicly stated 
its intention refocus its business and hit growth targets 
explore strategic alternatives 
our view among our covered companies think etfc 
could potentially attractive platform for schw 
amtd should etfc not meet internal growth objectives 
and consider such strategic alternatives 
for amtd hypothetical deal could look strategically 
similar that its recent scottrade acquisition which 
increased scale and physical footprint etfc could offer the 
highly sought active trader demographic plus large
