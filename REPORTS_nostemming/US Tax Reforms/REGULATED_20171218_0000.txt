tax reform takeaways from 
the final conference agreement 
the latest draft tax legislation takeaways for utilities 
exempted from full expensing and loss interest expense 
deductibility amt eliminated dividend and capital gains rates 
unchanged renewable tax credits unchanged and shielded 
from minimum tax under beat nuclear credit not extended 
friday december congressional republicans issued their final 
conference agreement the tax cuts jobs act should the tax bill pass 
proposed the following would key takeaways 
relative investor expectations the final conference agreement modestly 
more positive for utilities and yieldcos driven renewables growth nee nep 
pegi aes and more negative for due lack extension the 
nuclear ptc and more negative for utilities with significant holdco debt due 
lack specific language including utility holding companies the exemption 
from the loss interest deductibility etr ppl duk nee xel sre 
though believe ultimately that this last issue will clarified and 
believe holding company interest expense will allocated utilities different 
business units with the only potential negative impact being utilities whose 
merchant power businesses have very low ebitda where such interest might 
fail the ebitda test notably and etr 
the corporate tax rate would reduced from most utilities 
earnings will relatively unaffected this because lower taxes will passed 
onto customers according our analysis the best positioned stocks from 
eps perspective appear exc nee peg sji and sre due lower tax 
rate their profitable non utility businesses the worst positioned stocks from 
eps perspective appear aee cms duk etr ppl and xel due 
higher parent leverage balances see etr duk ppl and screening 
relatively weak credit metrics post tax reform and see risk that the 
companies could require incremental equity over time maintain target credit

from 
source morgan stanley research note that the latest tax bill includes corporate tax rate and the above chart assumes the prior 
tax rate included prior tax bills 
utilities would exempted from the immediate expensing capex well 
the potential loss interest deductibility utility capex would treated 
under the standard macrs depreciation system instead being immediately 
expensed which will have the effect increasing utilities rate base but 
potentially reducing their cash flow the lower tax rate will passed onto 
customers which helpful our view reducing bill pressure however for 
some utilities this reduction cash flow revenue lower and many utilities 
effective cash tax rates have been low will our view weaken their credit 
metrics the utilities where see meaningful reductions credit metrics 
should this legislation pass drafted are etr ppl and duk while 
unclear whether any these companies will need issue equity bolster their 
credit statistics the margin believe this reduction cash flow near 
below their targeted ffo debt metrics will reduce their financing flexibility 
should they seek increase their capex budgets 
exhibit most utilities face decline ffo and weaker ffo debt metrics under 
tax reform 
percentage point change ffo debt metrics from loss 
bonus depreciation and lower tax rate 
source morgan stanley research note that the latest tax bill includes corporate tax rate and the above chart assumes the prior 
tax rate included prior tax bills 
addition there some uncertainty regarding whether utility holding company 
debt exempted from the loss interest deductibility provision there 
specific language the latest draft tax bill covering the treatment utility 
holding company debt this debt not exempted would subject the 
test there limit the deductibility interest equal maximum 
business ebitda from followed ebit post 
however believe likely that the treasury will develop guidelines which 
allocation methodology would developed for utility holding company 
debt the extent this debt allocated the utility business believe such 
interest would exempted from the potential loss interest deductibility 
the extent the debt allocated non utility businesses believe most 
such interest expense would fall below the threshold with the potential 
exception and etr the ebitda their non utility businesses very low 
dividend and capital gains tax rates would remain unchanged 
renewable related provisions are more constructive the latest draft bill 
relative prior bills the wind ptc and solar itc are unchanged the latest 
draft tax bill the corporate alternative minimum tax amt which was set 
the corporate tax rate under the prior draft senate tax bill would eliminated 
under the final conference agreement tax bill this important change for the 
renewable energy sector because the senate language would likely have 
reduced the tax equity market because some renewable energy tax credits 
would not reduce corporations effective cash tax rate the minimum tax rate 
set the corporate tax rate addition the latest bill includes constructive 
change the prior language relating the base erosion anti abuse tax 
beat under the latest language renewable tax credits can offset 
the tax that would otherwise owed under the beat provision this change will 
our view alleviate some investors concerns that the tax equity market might 
negatively impacted potential tax reform legislation passed drafted 
these provisions are our view positive for companies whose growth part 
driven renewable energy most notably nee nep pegi aes and solar 
development companies spwr run and fslr would also benefit from these 
changes the extent they become law our view however regarding solar 
power would caution investors that there still uncertainty regarding the 
level tariff that may imposed the imported solar panels and 
this uncertainty will persist until late january when president trump due 
make decision this matter see our note here for deeper dive into this 
topic 
the nuclear production tax credit ptc for newly constructed nuclear 
plants was not extended which view modest negative for southern 
company but this negative our view outweighed likely positive 
decision from the georgia regulator december believe the georgia 
public service commission psc its decision coming december will 
approve georgia power and its owners moving forward with the vogtle new 
nuclear project most respects under the terms proposed georgia power 
this will our view positive catalyst for stock expect that the 
psc will require that shareholders partially absorb the economic loss from the 
nuclear ptcs the deadline not extended the time the plant comes into 
service which cannot claimed for the vogtle project due delays 
constructing the plant this would total value our calculations 
that being said the overall terms that subsidiary georgia power proposed for 
continuing move forward with vogtle are our view positive relative what 
reflected stock the longer term however remain concerned that 
the vogtle project costs may continue rise that shareholders may held 
liable for these costs likely the case our view scg for the 
abandoned summer nuclear project are also concerned regarding the 
implications engineering report that was recently disclosed report that 
southern management received this report highlights several issues with 
the vogtle project for example that the design not complete and 
therefore subject the ongoing risk large number expensive change 
orders and have some concern that this document could gain greater 
attention and focus 
next steps believe the house will complete its consideration the latest 
tax bill this wednesday with the senate completing its consideration process 
this thursday the bill then signed which view likely expect the 
president would sign the bill into law shortly after passage the house and 
senate 
potential tax reform impacts exploring the impacts utility 
earnings cash flow and growth 
tax reform the extent passed into law would our view have mixed 
implications for utilities overall with our analysis suggesting that several companies 
appear likely experience higher eps and rate base growth but most face lower 
cash flows and thus weaker credit metrics analyzed the latest tax reform bill and 
extended our prior analysis eps impacts also consider the cash flow and rate base 
implications for our coverage lowering the corporate tax rate from could 
benefit eps for several utilities with profitable non regulated businesses and raise 
regulated rate base growth due the reduction utilities deferred tax liabilities 
however cash flows could lower for most utilities due the loss bonus 
depreciation reduced customer payments from lower tax rate and flowback the 
dtl reduction the stocks see most risk facing weaker credit metrics and 
possible incremental equity needs over year period are duk etr ppl and 
while unclear whether any these companies will need issue equity 
bolster their credit statistics the margin believe this reduction cash flow near 
below their targeted ffo debt metrics will reduce their financing flexibility should 
they seek increase their capex budgets 
potential eps impacts appear mixed across our coverage stocks with likely eps upside 
our estimates exc nee peg sji and sre due lower tax rate their 
profitable non utility businesses companies with higher parent leverage would appear 
negatively exposed aee cms duk etr ppl and xel given that lower tax 
rate would increase parent drag allowing more parent interest hit the bottom line 
exhibit wide variation potential impact utility earnings from reduction the corporate 
tax rate 
eps impact from reduction the corporate tax rate 
from 
source morgan stanley research note that the latest tax bill includes corporate tax rate and the above chart assumes the prior tax rate 
included prior tax bills 
tax reform could boost rate base growth utility deferred tax liabilities have been used 
source financing for regulated rate base investment and would likely 
revalued lower given the lower corporate tax rate the reduction the value utility 
dtls would estimate result increase rate base since this component 
typically subtracted from utility rate base for ratemaking purposes the change the 
dtl would need refunded customers over time but would also refinanced 
with debt and equity the higher debt and equity financing costs would charged 
customers thus resulting higher earnings power the timeframe over which the 
refunds and corresponding increase rate base would occur has not been finalized but 
many companies expect this would occur over the remaining year life the 
assets resulting modest tailwind for earnings and rate base growth and modest 
drag cash flow note that for some companies deferred taxes are included 
regulated rate base and the equity ratio reduced account for the deferred tax 
liability for these companies the total rate base would not increase but the equity 
layer would rise over time supporting greater earnings base for the utility assuming 
year period for refunds and rate base increases average this would lead 
higher annual growth utility rate base across our coverage secondarily the 
elimination bonus depreciation for utilities could also modestly increase rate base 
deferred income taxes are subtracted from most utility rate bases the elimination 
bonus depreciation could lead smaller reduction rate base 
exhibit potential rate base increases per year average above the baseline under tax 
reform 
source morgan stanley research sre rate base levels excludes non rate base ppl rate base includes 
longer term lower customer bills could also give utilities additional headroom grow 
rate base two potential effects tax reform specifically lower tax rates and dtl 
refunds could benefit utility customer bills this dynamic could potentially allow 
utilities increase rate base growth and accelerate investment plans given less 
inflationary pressure customer bills key concern utility regulators think 
this would particularly beneficial for utilities states with low sales growth since 
there lower sales volume spread rate increases over these regions and for 
utilities with substantial capital programs that are constrained near term rate 
increases 
cash flow impacts would likely tend negative for most companies there are 
several drivers lower cash flow for utilities lower corporate tax rate would likely 
result lower customer revenues since the utility would need cover less federal 
income taxes think this benefit would typically passed through customers 
soon after tax reform policies are passed though the timing would likely managed 
state state basis because many utilities are already not paying cash taxes but are 
still charging customers for taxes the lower customer revenues should lead lower 
cash flow for most companies the loss bonus depreciation would reduce utilities 
ability shield income from cash taxes for companies whose primary cash tax shield 
came from the use bonus depreciation this should increase cash taxes and lower cash 
flow most utilities though have other tools that lower defer cash taxes including net 
operating loss carryforwards accelerated depreciation renewables investments and 
tax credits such production tax credits ptcs and investment tax credits itcs 
wind and solar projects these would presumably remain place many companies 
would continue pay cash taxes the near term though they may become cash 
taxpayers earlier than previously expected the following chart shows the cash flow 
impact our coverage and the resulting implication for ffo debt metrics important 
criteria for credit rating agencies 
exhibit most utilities face decline ffo and weaker ffo debt metrics under tax reform 
percentage point change ffo debt metrics from loss 
bonus depreciation and lower tax rate 
source morgan stanley research note that the latest tax bill includes corporate tax rate and the above chart assumes the prior tax rate 
included prior tax bills 
some stocks face only minor potential changes cash flow from tax reform generally 
driven having unregulated subsidiaries that benefit from lower tax rates from 
more muted changes cash tax forecasts this group includes eix pnw scg and 
those with the largest cash flow impacts are aee exc nee pcg and xel
