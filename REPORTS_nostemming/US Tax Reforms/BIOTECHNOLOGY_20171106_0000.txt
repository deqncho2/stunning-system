updated tax provisions available here for biotech focus the change 
the overall rate corporate tax rate the repeal the orphan tax provision 
and the tax credit which now permanent for our coverage biomarin 
alexion and celgene have the biggest potential impact their tax rates from 
both credits however only biomarin breaks out the impact the orphan credit 
the vast majority related the orphan credit that said for biomarin the 
lowering the statutory rate will likely overshadow any upside pressure 
from the repeal the orphan tax credit less clear for alexion and celgene 
given their overall current tax rates are well below next steps include the 
senate plan and the likely back and forth that follows 
potential impact repeal orphan tax credit section the newly 
proposed tax bill named the tax cuts and jobs act proposed repeal clinical 
testing expenses for certain drugs for rare diseases conditions commonly 
known the orphan drug tax credit manufactures can currently claim 
qualified clinical testing expenses while the new provision fully repeals the 
provision starting note below exhibit revenue generating
