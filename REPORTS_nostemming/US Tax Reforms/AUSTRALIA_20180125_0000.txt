assessing tax reform for australians 
historic tax reform the tax reform bill passed late last year promises significant 
changes the tax system see public policy wrap tax dec key 
changes that are relevant australian corporates include lowering the corporate tax 
rate from immediate expensing non real estate depreciable assets and 
limiting interest deduction earnings 
overall the policy sees the year deficit expand trillion but the policies are 
more front loaded than expected and our economics team upgraded their 
forecast yoy terms markets our view that tax reform will 
near term positive for markets currently since the bill was 
passed however the expectation that these changes will not fundamentally change 
the earnings cycle over the medium term 
first asx responders generally positive here summarise the guidance provided 
all companies that have outlined the potential impact and uncertainties following the 
tax reform

that this will create estimated benefit profit after tax around 
million primarily result lower direct tax expense previously the 
company guided increase the group effective tax rate from the current 
after incorporating the current estimates the effect

reform package that any change the group effective tax rate unlikely 
material 
qbe statement from company january qbe will take

rate qbe may look restructure its reinsurance program optimize its tax assets 
and capital expect further update the result 
rmd statement from company january rmd recognized 
one offs the transition tax imposed accumulated foreign earnings resulting 
additional income tax expense million and the write down the 
carrying value net deferred tax assets with lower corporate tax rate which 
resulted additional income tax expense million excluding these one offs 
the company had budgeted for cash repatriation but the tax attributable 
repatriation will longer due result reform this results 
effective tax rate for for the year prior 
however rmd group effective tax rate will rise back result 
draft legislation australia likely enacted regarding base erosion 
profit shifting beps initiatives related hybrid mismatches 
analyst estimates other beneficiaries estimating the impact australian corporates 
made difficult the complexity the tax code with the headline cut from 
partly funded reforms broaden the tax base well the limited corporate 
disclosure tax and earnings the geographic level however our analyst team has 
made the following assessments the potential impact for major earners 
coh comment from analyst cut the corporate tax rate and itself 
doesn provide much benefit they have advanced pricing agreement between 
the ato and irs which recognizes most the profit australia this where 
the generated result coh pay corporate taxes australia 
all see aristocrat leisure ltd tax reform implications dec all 
highly exposed the through both slots and digital with its 
operations derived out the based our estimates but with all 
only paying tax group earnings estimate all group blended tax 
rate would reduce from and deliver eps accretion across 
based the proposed federal corporate tax rate cut from 
cpu comment from analyst cpu operates net debt equity and 
incurs interest expense the company benefits from numerous 
deductions including interest expense limitation anti base erosion and anti hybrids 
rule the net impact remains unclear and cpu will likely provide update its 
result 
jhg see janus henderson group upgrading estimates jan the 
cut the federal corporate tax rate reduces jhg tax rate 
project that lifts jhg earnings tax reform could 
also lead higher stock dispersion and lower correlation potentially giving active 
stock pickers more opportunities generate alpha

group earnings generated from understand that btt splits revenues 
into distribution based manufacturing which based out singapore 
running tax rate only handful investment teams are based and 
their fum remains relatively small for now however think the based 
earnings will grow the medium term and the tax benefit overall boost

company ownership structure complex mqa equity ownership effectively 
via secured loan independent entity via loan domiciled bermuda 
view the impact tax reform mild negative for stock sentiment 
albeit with low valuation impact 
nws comment from analyst expect nws will beneficiary lower 
corporate tax rate but our view possibly not large positive may appear 
prima facie whilst its operations will account for total sales 
estimate they will account for lower share pre tax and post tax profit 
with large contributors the bottom line accounting profits notably being the 
highly profitable australian based businesses rea group owned and 
associate foxtel owned for example estimate owned rea which 
pays all its taxes australia and consolidated nws will account for 
nws total reported revenues but rea will account for closer

five clearer australian beneficiaries have created list likely beneficiaries from 
the tax reform identifying those companies that should have material 
boost eps which includes twe mqg jhg all and flt caveat this list noting 
that have excluded material earners that believe may face mixed 
immaterial net tax impacts and also note that others may not see much benefit 
initially expect given the complexity the tax code 
australia proposal assessed 
tax cuts passed for small business proposed for big business the coalition went 
the previous election proposing cut corporate tax rates from 
progressively over the years however without majority the senate 
this stage they have only been able pass legislation cutting the small business tax 
rate from those with annual revenues under the coalition 
continue advocate cutting the corporate tax rate for larger business costing 
billion for the years 
potential form election issue the coalition can deliver corporate tax cuts 
they convince the majority the senate cross bench support the legislation this 
appears the strategy for the sitting year based early comments from 
treasurer morrison company tax cuts vital for australia succeed scott morrison 
daily telegraph january however the next phase business tax cuts for 
revenue not due come into effect until which after the next federal 
election held may this means corporate tax cuts have the potential 
feature again central election issue 
assessing the impact putting aside the any debate about the prospects the proposed 
tax cuts the parliament assess the potential impact market earnings they 
were passed universal cut the corporate tax rate from 
would lift headline eps across the market but also impact the generation valuation and 
distribution imputation credits for domestic investors 
median eps boosted estimate the impact reduction the corporate 
tax rate using estimated earnings and tax paid and accounting for 
international exposures and partial pass through the reduction this results 
median boost eps compared with boost for those who receive 
the full benefit the tax cut 
australian tax rate lower than appears australia unique imputation system 
often overlooked the debate about its tax competitiveness put simply domestic 
investors effectively pay corporate tax any profits that are distributed with 
franking credits franking basis some estimates put the revenueequivalent classical australian corporate tax rate well below the 
headline and the oecd average 
offshore investors clearer winners while headline cut australia would 
see earnings increase around the increase value the hands domestic 
investors would not large given less franking credit generation result 
offshore investors stand the largest beneficiaries australian corporate 
tax cut the value lost franking credits non tax resident nil limited 
potentially reducing withholding taxes while they would benefit from higher 
potential eps dps the grattan institute estimate that reduction the 
corporate tax rate would increase the rate return foreign investors and 
domestic investors stagnation nation feb 
distribution behaviour may change reduction the headline corporate tax rate 
would proportionately reduce the benefit imputation for domestic investors 
the short run companies may quick distribute any excess franking credit 
balances the potential for cap the franking rate dividends longerterm this might the margin shift the preference domestic investors away from 
dividends they receive less advantages from them which could see payout 
ratios lower and greater share profits reinvested into the company
