quick thoughts three drivers statutory rate our analysis suggests 
pdco mygn hsic ilmn stand potentially benefit the most benefit 
eps from assumed lower corporate tax rate given their high 
effective tax rates and large percentage total company ebit the 
repatriation benefits wat agilent brkr the most potential eps benefits 
and respectively our eps analysis assume that all 
company unremitted foreign earnings are taxable and that companies use 
their foreign cash buyback shares premium current stock levels 
base erosion and anti abuse tax beat proposed the senate the beat 
provision the senate bill that intended act backstop against 
related party transfer pricing and debt domiciling strategies that erode the 
tax base the mechanism seeks tax companies that engage base erosion 
activities the difference between their modified taxable income which 
excludes deductibility certain related party payments taxed rate and 
their regular tax liability that includes deductible related party payments 
taxed rate important note that under the house excise tax 
inventory cogs would have been included potential disallowed payment 
but not considered disallowed payment the senate bill except for 
inverted companies would highlight that little intercompany data 
disclosed regarding royalty other payments foreign affiliates thus make 
several simplifying assumptions account for the likelihood that minimum 
taxes apply some unknown subset modified income assume 
company ebit mix equivalent its sales mix for purposes beat 
evaluation and assume the difference between ebit taxed 
based filings and our calculated proforma ebit taxed our 
modeling implies beat would not have material eps impact our 
coverage discussions with certain large cap companies the space also suggest 
that cash taxes may higher than gaap taxes which imply our analysis 
sec filings not representative likely outcomes there not likely 
scenario where the net impact tax reform negative 
all priced knowing the market view any specific company 
challenging but analysis broader market trends suggest that potential tax 
reform significantly the price outline exhibit inside the median 
multiple among companies the highest tax rates the surged 
post election and now back prior peak levels the strategy team view 
that this confirms tax reform significantly assumed buy side expectations 
revised our hsic and pdco tax assumptions our recent downgrade report 
embed roughly half the theoretical benefit from reduction the rate 
while used the same approach for mygn and ilmn our outlook 
deep dive tax reform 
below review the three key tax items lower statutory rate repatriation 
eps benefit and npv liability and iii beat provision that believe have the most 
significance general tax reform passes would have significant impact our 
broad coverage estimate weighted average eps benefit our coverage

assumptions behind our analysis now assume statutory rate through all tax 
options analyze the effects lower statutory rate and repatriation with 
assumption that foreign cash used for buybacks eps basis 
analyze the repatriation tax liability npv basis impacts the intrinsic value the 
companies but will not have direct impact adjusted earnings companies have 
years pay off 
certain companies were excluded from parts our analysis nstg and ntra were 
excluded from analyses the basis earnings estimates they are not profitable 
our analysis excludes qgen due the lack disclosures specific margins 
and taxes still important note that while certain elements tax reform may not 
impact these companies forward earnings they still can have large impact the 
intrinsic value the companies 
ranking system explained calculate the sum the net change eps from lower 
statutory rate and repatriation share buybacks arrive our potential eps 
benefit separately analyze the repatriation tax liability npv basis 
percentage the company market capitalization though our rankings only consider 
eps benefit companies that have the largest net benefit result have the highest 
rank rank 
have removed the following items from our analysis interest deductibility the 
senate proposed bill limits deductibility net interest expense adjusted 
taxable income similar concept ebit house proposes ebitda none our 
companies appear have interest expenses exceeding the mark border 
adjustability this provision was initially proposed but does not appear making its

our price target for agilent based fcf yield our fcf estimate 
our view based upon organic growth with organic ebit expansion 
given the runway see margin expansion and fcf growth agilent shares are 
increasingly attractive and are compelling play cyclical momentum our reflects 
premium multiple given the company strong balance sheet net cash position and 
strong free cash flow growth 
key value drivers include organic operating margin expansion 
and the oligo plant colorado relieving capacity constraints nucleic acid solutions 
risks our price target the upside include recovery academic end markets 
operating leverage proves more than anticipated and clinical penetration better than 
expected risks the downside include margin expansion weighed down lower top 
line growth and industrial energy end market strength slows faster than anticipated 
algn 
our price target price for algn implies eps based our dcf 
analysis our valuation methodology takes longer term view the business which

growth spending larger than anticipated and competitive threats implants and 
orthodontics 
ilmn 
our price target based fcf yield our estimate our view based 
uptake ngs for clinical applications remaining concentrated academic and not 
community hospitals through refinements for ease use with new software 
and sample preparation systems are ongoing regulatory approvals and guideline 
inclusion are anticipated but not emerge research market growth remains 
limited and competition emerges through the medium term 
key value drivers include physician group support for clinical guideline evolution and 
broader adoption ngs systems including publications from expert consortia and 
clinical trial groups fda and insurer support including regulatory approvals 
standardized tests and positive reimbursement policies expanding interest research 
support and tailor genomically guided therapies and rapid innovation sample

commercialization such vectra and prolaris albeit lower gross profit products 
risks price target include that clinician stickiness and slower public database 
buildout lead less significant market share loss and price drop for bracanalysis and 
myrisk and greater penetration breast ovarian and colorectal cancer asymptomatic

value and revenue based multiples analysis generating sales multiple 
yielding per share value and balancing the execution risk associated with 
emerging company with its superior growth profile our valuation fueled the 
differentiated features both ncounter and prosigna which believe will drive 
market penetration their respective endmarkets 
downside risks include failure gain commercial traction for prosigna competitor 
platforms technologies outperform outprice ncounter and critical expansion into the 
clinical market not achieved iii sprint not successful anticipated and 
sequestration upside risks include rapid adoption ncounter for diagnostic 
applications accelerating use ncounter for immunotherapy development and iii 
recovering life sciences instrument spending trends 
ntra 
our price target based base case revenues for its nips business 
multiplied composite revenue multiple based the growth outlook 
across different end markets multiple range and then adding incremental 
implied equity value associated with the liquid biopsy program yielding 
revenue multiple our valuation line with comparable diagnostic companies 
considering the differentiating technology utilized natera while considering the 
commercial uncertainty around its diagnostic solutions 
key risks our price target for ntra include slower transition panorama the
