overview tax reform likely modest positive for life insurers earnings 
and cash generation that said expect their risk based capital ratios which 
the key measure capital strength come under meaningful pressure how 
rating agencies will view such changes remains difficult assess this point 
but some the companies with weaker capital ratios could see their capital 
management plans impacted 
capital and required capital the risk based capital the most widely used 
measure capital adequacy and the ratio total adjusted capital 
authorized control level capital what commonly referred required 
capital under regulatory rules portion deferred tax assets can included 
total capital which under taxation reform may need written down 
required capital also includes tax offset the value which would decline 
driving required capital higher under taxation reform the net result could 
sharp declines reported risk based capital ratios across the industry 
industry wide impact much larger than just dta adjustments average 
see rbc ratios declining percentage points while many investors speak 
focus dtas find that impacting rbc ratio only points rather the 
significantly larger impact higher required capital from the lower embedded tax 
offset which impacts rbc points average 
offsetting factors tax reform were pass most companies are likely see 
least temporary improvement their profitability further most companies 
are also currently risk based capital ratio substantially above their target 
levels making the sharp declines lesser concern last matters more how the 
rating agencies view these declines and expect they would view tax reform 
aggregate industry positive not fresh area concern 
individual company details prudential and brighthouse are the two companies 
see being impacted most although both currently have very robust capital 
levels while being less impacted the changes could push the rbc ratios for 
companies such torchmark rga and unum down levels which may look 
concerning some are already underweight torchmark and rga with

overview 
generally most investors view tax reform positive for the life insurers that 
lower effective corporate tax rate could benefit the profitability legacy operations 
that said lot depends the specific details have discussed prior research 
what happens with the dividend received deduction and other exemptions the 
corporate side addition potential changes the tax advantaged status various 
products the personal side remain factors the air further while most the 
focus has been the potential impact earnings also believe investors should 
consider how changes the tax rates could impact capital across the industry based 
our research find some relatively large potential impacts while doubt this will 
have sizable impact capital management activities for most companies does push 
the capital ratios for some companies down level where their capital flexibility 
could challenged 
how capital adequacy measured 
the key measure capital across the life insurance industry the risk based capital 
ratio rbc measure total adjusted capital tac divided two times the 
authorized control level capital commonly known the required capital 
total adjusted capital tac equals the statutory capital plus the asset valuation 
reserve and half policyholder dividends under statement statutory 
accounting principal ssap deferred tax assets reasonably expected used 
the next three years subject limitations can included admitted assets 
and accordingly capital 
required capital the required capital accounts for four different types risk 
factors asset risk insurance risk market risk while business 
risk determining the amount capital the insurers are permitted incorporate 
tax offset the statutory rate for asset based charges and the full 
statutory rate for other required capital the logic for the tax offset that the 
insurer faces loss will least partially offset reduced corporate tax 
liability asset based tax offsets are reduced capital losses and are typically 
more difficult utilize than operating losses 
exhibit current rbc ratios 
show exhibit the average rbc ratio across the life 
insurance industry currently stands although varies 
significantly among the various companies ranging from

proposed the administration would impact both the tac and the required capital 
with the tac the hit would from reduction the value the deferred tax assets

whom spoke have focussed both from gaap and statutory capital perspective 
across the industry estimate the potential impact from writing down the value 
the dta roughly percentage points 
second can look the impact the change the tax asset asset based charges 
mentioned previously insurers get credit for only the tax offset assuming 
this remains unchanged the tax offset would decline from across the 
industry estimate this would raise required capital

profitability accordingly even though the capital ratios will taking hit their ability

does this imply capital management will sharply curtailed

years while there have been some changes the various rules 
which have led some inflation reported ratios 
nonetheless consider the capital position across the industry 
robust 
third expect rating agencies will adopt rational approach their current level 
none the life insurers are anywhere near approaching capital ratios where regulators 
would involved rather the reasons for maintaining capital ratios well above the 
regulatory minimums maintain strong debt and financial strength rating from the 
major rating agencies the extent that all insurers see move their capital ratios 
without any real change their underlying risk profile expect the agencies are likely 
just move the bar the level that they consider appropriate for certain rating
