smid cap dimensioning small 
cap earnings potential 
currently recommend smid cap stocks over large and 
mega cap stocks because currency taxes and trade despite 
the recent strong outperformance research the magnitude 
that changes currency and taxes have smid cap 
profitability today research 
expect eps growth for the between and fueled 
taxes and stimulus potentially offset stronger dollar think likely 
that smid cap eps growth will higher than that owing the cohort more 
centric exposures with smid caps strongly outperforming last month 
clearly some this now the price but valuation price forward 
earnings for smid caps relative the large mega caps remains reasonably 
compelling 
smid cap stocks have less exposure the dollar the median amount 
revenue that comes from domestic sales for smid cap companies versus 
for large and mega cap companies estimate that for 
strengthening the dollar against trade weighted basket currencies over 
the full year the relative benefit smid cap eps would the sector 
level the median amount domestic revenue varies sector within the smid 
universe smid cap finanacials reits telecom and utilities companies are 
essentially entirely focused whereas the smid cap energy sector largely 
global 
effective tax rates smid cap companies are larger than tax rates their 
large and mega cap counterparts this difference effective tax rates has 
generally grown over time large caps have become more international 
without considering offsets like changes interest expense deductions 
non tax rates lowering the corporate tax rate from should 
help smid cap earnings about relative large and mega caps all else 
equal 
the sector level the largest differences effective tax rates are 
technology and health care the industry group level the largest differences 
are consumer services and automobiles components 
for quantitatively derived smid cap ideas that would benefit from repatriation 
decompose three stocks whr arw and avt that stand benefit from 
repatriation and rank well our quant models

define mega cap stocks the largest stocks the large cap the next 
stocks mid cap the next stocks and small cap the next 
stocks smid cap stocks are the smallest stocks with market 
caps ranging from million billion 
small cap opportunities 
small cap stocks often work when the perception that their estimate achievability 
above average and potentially better than large caps this can come from economic 
expansion resulting risk trade from reduction cost capital like the 
recent strong rally from the expectation changes taxes currency and trade 
now seem more likely 
see about eps growth over the next two years for the though such 
estimate multi variable problem exhibit when assess some the puts and 
takes looks that positives likes lower corporate taxes fiscal stimulus program 
impacting revenue less impact from interest expense deduction and stronger 
dollar and lower impact trading penalties all directionally impact smid caps more 
higher interest rates the margin help large cap financials more than smid caps 
smids include more reits share reductions that result from repatriation will likely also 
directionally benefit large caps adding all the likely has higher 
eps growth two years from now than today and smid caps likely grow faster than that
