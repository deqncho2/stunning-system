believe the excitement will pass after this earnings season and stock 
performance will driven underlying fundamentals pending tax guidance 
for the quarter will focus end market commentary and core 
excluding tax guidance 
key highlights vertical are below 
rails fundamentals still prefer the canadians rails over the 
eastern rails while and cnr will likely miss this quarter due 
derailments and capacity expansion costs and will provide conservative 
rtm and eps guidances believe they have the strongest 
fundamentals due mgmt visibility volume growth pricing 
acceleration established precision railroading models and cheap relative 
valuation unp our preferred rail for the tax trade expect unp 
beat nsc inline and ksu and csx miss consensus investors 
may brush off earnings and turn catalysts with csx 
analyst day first march unp may and next spring tax trade 
apart believe fundamentals are choppy for rails particular 
with several key end markets including autos coal frac sand grain facing 
tough comps headwinds and intermodal eld benefits are likely 
smaller and come later than consensus thinks 
tls ltls truckers benefit from cyclical trends and potential eld boost

benefit from tight spot market but will not have material hurricane costs

our note here knx our top trucking and freight transportation pick and 
don expect mgmt provide eps guidance and updated synergy 
targets until mid positive catalyst for expect beats from

into earnings given our expectation driven upside line from 
saia and misses arcb and htld tls eld impact our top 
trade into 
brokers mixed bag for the back the spotlight for xpo 
are inline for chrw though see possible range from depending spot contract exposure and whether chrw was able 
pull forward contract negotiations expect nast pricing and 
costs accelerate from and respectively leading 
negative gross margins flattish sequentially always the focus will 
january date net revenues which expect low mid single 
digits assuming net revenues increase the range expect 
xpo fine tune guidance likely raise and not expect mgmt 
provide guidance yet investors will focus any comments from 
mgmt about and strategic alternatives will listen for any 
incremental color but believe mgmt will likely decline comment 
recent rumors see our thoughts reports about xpo here note 
that neither company has commented the reports and are not 
aware any discussions potential outcomes 
our views tax don distracted shiny objects based conversations 
with mgmt teams believe there still plenty uncertainty exactly how 
the tax impact will materialize are waiting for mgmt provide guidance 
tax rate adjust our models expect get early clarity the 
calls but caution that final tax impact determination could take much longer our 
conversations with companies suggest that gaap tax rates could range from low 
high our view clear that freight transports are obvious winners 
tax reform given high gaap tax rates and largely domestic revenue exposure 
but believe divergence stock performance will likely driven 
market fundamentals rather than tax our preliminary view picking stocks 
based tax impact that the range outcomes for the companies pretty 
narrow given high gaap tax rates across the board the asset based 
companies rails tls ltls parcels though there little choose between 
them are likely benefit more from fcf perspective than asset light 
believe that rails and ltls are equally likely keep pass through the 
benefits tax reform given the eld driven capacity tightness trucking well 
the competitive environment for rails that has limited pricing upside the 
last months have valued every stock our coverage including the 
rails year dcf since initiation but don think investors will suddenly 
shift their valuation methodology from ebitda fcf because tax 
reform this means eps impact likely matters most and outside the canadian 
rails all companies our coverage will see similar benefits

rails 
cnr 
are below cons for cnr recent investor conference mgmt telegraphed that they are experiencing capacity pinch points 
driven industry leading volume growth such rtm growth has decelerated and cnr will facing cost headwinds until 
they invest capacity believe mgmt will provide conservative rtm guidance and eps growth hsd including 
buybacks estimate buybacks add annual eps and excluding lower tax are modeling rtm and eps growth 
are below cons for due derailments november which caused rtm growth decelerate despite the incidents 
will still hit their target msd rtm growth and dble digits eps growth for expect mgmt guide msd rtm and ldd 
eps growth limited impact from buybacks excl lower tax which think conservative are modeling rtm and eps 
growth will hold analyst day spring which will likely positive catalyst for the stock 
csx 
are below cons for csx and the low end mgmt eps guidance for this quarter will messy csx had one 
extra week believe the street mismodeling this expect vol decline and lingering cost headwinds from csx psr 
transition think mgmt will point least eps growth for and save long term guidance for their investor day march

the gap between total company vol and revenue growth mse also believe flood new mexico led 
incremental costs related network congestion and car hire will look for ksu volume outlook recall last year mgmt had 
favorable view vols and neutral

productivity savings while vols were partially driven share gain from csx train speed and terminal dwell deteriorate 
materially will focus mgmt updates financial targets which believe are too aggressive and their assumptions 
for volume rpu and productivity savings 
are above cons for unp unp has had strong track record this year they beaten cons revenue for the past two qtrs and 
ebit since unp traffic was consistent with mgmt guidance and expect pricing and for 
expect mgmt guide lsd vol growth pricing above inflation rail inflation last year improved and 
productivity savings above 
are above consensus for gwr gwr october and november traffic has been stronger than expected driven america and 
europe and could reach the high end mgmt carload guidance which bodes well for margins could the first quarter that

elds with added layers merger synergies expect knx report improved yield and utilization metrics showing investors that 
the merger with swft going well given lack clarity ahead bid season and the eld hard enforcement deadline april not

ltls 
are below cons for arcb arcb tonnage has trended opposite from its peers and likely negative though 
are modeling deceleration from decline result pricing actions mgmt has taken expect deterioration within the 
normal bps sequentially with offsetting impacts from negative tonnage and stringent cost control measures from mgmt and 
thus are skeptical cons expectations for asset based beat seasonality 
are above cons for odfl tonnage through october and november accelerated from growth and expect total 
tonnage per day increase leading mdd topline growth the quarter the main driver the beat will come from operating 
odfl leverage expect sequential deterioration less than the seasonal bps odfl has not seen these levels tonnage and top 
line growth since which only deteriorated bps sequentially are modeling bps seq degradation cons 
bps 
arcb 
saia 
are inline for saia similar odfl saia has reported robust tonnage growth through november and expect total tonnage day 
for the quarter with increased contribution from allentown and baltimore terminal openings however believe the street and 
investors are cognizant these trends and are also modeling flattish sequentially guidance flat modest deterioration

exposure and expect slight sequential total company gross margin expansion dat dry van spot rates fuel increased over 
chrw avg while contract rates were providing scope for pricing accelerate from growth and thus 
leading mid high single digit total company net revenue growth believe investors are already there however the stock price 
nearly the quarter

the first three weeks october and the environment showed material signs slowing down nov dec similarly expect slight 
echo 
sequential gross margin improvement consistent with mgmt commentary through october despite coming the high end 
guidance well see upside consensus expectations for

expd 
increase hsd ldd while gross margins should see modest sequential compression slightly better than seasonality 
are above cons for hubg and within mgmt guidance believe jbht preannouncement and the current tight market 
hubg are positive read acrosses for hubg mgmt will likely provide eps guidance but their track record has been spotty and think this time 
around will similar given lack clarity ahead bid season and the eld hard enforcement deadline april 
jbht preannounced ebit range that beat cons the midpoint excluding one timers jbht preannounced revenue range 
came above cons which bodes well for hubg and other trucking exposed names expect jbht and segments robust while 
ics and dedicated will see some drag from start costs not think mgmt will provide guidance until after their board meeting 
are inline with cons for lstr expect continuation the robust trends lstr saw september rev load 
lstr expect revenues slightly above the midpoint guidance though expect gross margins come the low end 
guidance driven primarily fuel thus leaving inline

least expect xpo fine tune guid likely raise and don expect mgmt provide guidance listen for any
