macro meets micro europe 
assessing the impact tax 
reform 
estimate the impact european eps from tax cuts 
just earnings revisions for exposed companies 
have risen sharply and are likely rise further short term 
but our detailed analysis company commentary suggests 
that the ultimate impact eps likely modest 
cut the corporate tax rate from could imply much 
boost european earnings european companies generate their 
revenues the and have similar proportion based operating costs 
europe enjoyed the full effect the tax rate being cut from this 
would theoretically boost european earnings around 
but think the boost likely lower around the report 
summarise the main considerations for investors the tax reform bill 
some which are positive for earnings corporate tax rate cut immediate 
expensing capex while some are less helpful interest deductibility 
restrictions base erosion provisions repatriation taxes these measures coupled 
with the likelihood that the effective tax rate european companies well 
below the headline rate start with mean think the ultimate impact 
likely much smaller than the headline tax cut might imply 
european companies with high exposure are now seeing stronger earnings 
revisions than the wider market for the first time year while not all the 
measures the tax reform bill are positive for european corporate 
earnings our basket exposed european companies msrereus has 
outperformed the market since early september around the time that market 
expectations tax reform bottomed out earnings revisions for the basket 
have also risen sharply and are now better than the wider market for the first 
time year and are likely rise further short term companies provide 
more clarity through the upcoming earnings season 
company commentary highlights that the boost european earnings diluted 
other aspects the tax reform bill this report collate all the 
company level commentary have found from european corporates relating 
tax reform since the bill was passed aggregate the commentary 
suggests modest boost profitability but not uniformly given some the 
issues discussed above

from top down perspective estimate the impact european 
eps 
the accounts for both european company revenues and operating costs 
have detailed data both the revenue and cost exposure european corporates 
from our proprietary global exposure guide databases exhibit shows the 
accounts for european company revenues and approximately the same figure for 
european company operating costs shown exhibit health care pharmaceuticals 
and diversified financials have the highest revenue exposure the while real 
estate retailing and utilities have the lowest exposure 
which would imply most boost european profits from tax cuts given 
that the revenue exposure and operating cost exposure european companies towards 
the could assume the pre tax income exposure europe the 
likely very similar exhibit calculates the impact european profits cut 
corporation tax rates assume that european companies currently pay the full 
rate then the profitability european companies businesses could rise 
much given this about overall profits would mean boost overall 
eps however think that the overall boost will lower given that 
the effective tax rates paid european companies likely below the 
headline rate although there hard data the effective tax rates paid 
european companies the exhibit shows the effective tax rate msci 
europe the european companies with the highest revenue exposure the 
and the all are well below 
the figure ignores the impacts from other aspects the tax reform limiting 
interest deductibility likely lower the boost european earnings and while 
immediate expensing capex could help this the area where our policy 
experts are least bullish relative consensus 
our analysis company commentary suggests lower boost later this report 
collate commentary the impact tax reform the corporate level this 
also consistent with view that the impact likely much lower than the 
boost 
from top down perspective estimate the impact european earnings 
the order instead assuming that the tax rate paid european companies 
the the headline rate use the average effective rate paid 
the then the boost european earnings would just this 
would appear much more realistic figure given the reasons list above 
our tax policy team sees the final tax package adding eps 
however the opinion our strategy colleagues the figure likely best 
case scenario they doubt that companies will see full pass through tax benefits 
their analysis management incentives and early guidance company commentary 
supports this view and they think the way make money from tax analysis this point

not all elements tax reform are positive for european 
earnings 
following the passage the final tax cuts and jobs act tcja the reform bill 
contains elements that are both positive and negative for the earnings european 
companies with exposure the briefly summarise the main considerations for 
investors from the reform bill below and more detail can found our colleagues 
recent note public policy wrap tax dec 
corporate tax cut from the headline corporate tax rate has been cut 
from however worth noting for reference that the average 
effective tax rate for msci europe was and that the average 
effective tax rate for the was for variety reasons european 
companies are unlikely enjoy the full boost profitability that the 
headline tax cut might imply 
impact dtas and dtls addition the impact earnings from the lowering 
the corporate tax rate also affects the balance sheets number 
companies through one off revaluations both deferred tax assets and deferred 
tax liabilities 
interest deductibility the bill limits interest expense deductibility 
ebitda for the first four years switching ebit thereafter for european 
companies have systematic way quantifying how much their interest 
expense ebitda ebit are based however given the has for many years 
had higher corporate tax rate than most europe would make sense that 
disproportionate amount european companies interest expenses would 
located the note that average over the last years usd corporate 
bond issuance has accounted for european corporate bond issuance 
contrast the accounts for revenues although this figure will not 
account for the entirety usd revenue exposure given that much exposure 
for example likely dollar denominated 
immediate expensing capex full expensing will permitted for 
qualifying investments put service before this will phased down 
per year until while the provision for immediate expensing capex 
the face positive our policy experts think that this the area the 
bill where the impact most likely disappoint investors this only applies 
qualifying investments non property investment with asset lives under 
years also expensing has existed since and for two years 
inbetween and this sits top already accelerated depreciation schedule 
also for companies where immediate expensing investment results taxable 
loss the subsequent use these losses more limited going forward this view 
consistent with recent survey our sector analysts our economists 
report business conditions where capex and hiring plans did not show 
meaningful change analysts broadly anticipate more companies will allocate 
gains from tax cuts increased share buybacks dividends and 
other considerations the tax reform bill also contains number other 
measures such repatriation taxes which are more relevant for companies but 
still have impact some european companies well number base 
erosion provisions these include the foreign derived intangible income provision 
fdii which retains incentive for mulitnationals retain and locate within 
the and the base erosion anti abuse tax beat that seeks combat base 
eroding intercompany transactions that concentrate deductions with the united 
states 
corporate commentary impact tax reform 
this section detail all the company level commentary that have far 
tracked from european corporates since the successful passage the tax reform 
bill include all relevant commentary that have found from european companies 
with market cap over looking press releases earnings calls and results 
presentations the following tables provide much relevant detail have but 
also summarise few broad observations 
the lowering the corporate tax rate supportive for many but not all the 
majority companies have mentioned positive impact from the lowering the 
corporate tax rate but this isn uniform wpp for example had flagged that their 
effective tax rate already lower than the new lower headline rate and 
could actually rise from here large proportion companies highlight some 
the other aspects legislation interest deductibility base erosion repatriation 
taxes diluting the boost from the lower tax rate 
one off revaluation dtas dtls common theme 
interest deductibility restrictions offset some the gains for example weir 
mentioned that interest deductibility may largely offset the ongoing impact from 
the lower corporate tax rate did lse 
base erosion and repatriations effects remain important considerations for 
example sodexo commented repatriation taxes given its canadian business 
subsidiary the lse made comments base erosion offsetting some the 
positives 
surprisingly few companies talking about the benefit immediate expensing 
investment christian hansen was amongst the few that mentioned the positive 
influence from the immediated expensing selected capital investment
