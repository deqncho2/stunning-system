buybacks axp base erosion tax complex but 
unlikely have major impact dfs may have most tax

proposed tax reform could give banks leg international peers the

highest the world one the lowest banks are already running very 
efficient levels despite both higher banking regulations the post crisis era 
and higher tax rates foreign banking peers with lower tax rates potentially 
soon become reality would expect banks fare well competitively

corporates 
median eps upside taking the fte effective tax rate down from 
our estimate eps upside from tax reform now includes low 
reduction from deductibility fdic insurance premiums going away 
longer include offsets from interest deductibility commercial borrowers given 
the caps the proposed tax bills given more complex tax issues the large 
cap banks such the base provision tax and dta write downs will increase 
our base case eps estimates the final tax bill signed into law 
biggest potential beneficiaries tax reform consumer names namely dfs 
among the banks see the most potential eps upside consumer focused 
lenders with the highest tax rates today way play dfs which estimate 
has the most eps upside from tax reform 
one time capital hits banks from tax unremitted foreign earnings 
dta writedown manageable for most think but axp could slow 
buybacks across banks assuming tax unremitted foreign earnings 
and immediate write down dta estimate the median impact 
ratios would very manageable however axp could 
see larger hits and respectively causing their capital 
levels fall below implied minimums potentially driving slower buybacks 
which banks would pay the proposed base erosion anti abuse tax beat 
unclear but structure international operations important the beat 
provision intended prevent companies from significantly reducing their 
tax liability making cross border payments affiliates but does not 
specifically exclude repos securities lending the senate proposal remains 
unchanged could raise the cost conducting these businesses outside the

caveats our dta analysis the senate timing lower corporate tax rate wins 
out pushing the cut and not would expect see dta write downs 
both and why any shorter term dtas dtls that are resolved

within the dta bucket fast turning items such the allowance for loan losses would 
likely not require write down until 
the case delayed decline corporate tax rate believe the card 
names particularly axp cof could see more write down over instead 
much their dta includes shorter term items such allowance for loan 
losses and credit card rewards card names could also take larger dta write downs 
given they have less the way dtls offset such mortgage servicing rights and 
lease transactions 
only dtas related timing differences would impacted the lower tax rate since

what tax credits banks utilize today 
low income housing tax credits believe low income housing tax credits comprise 
most the tax credits utilized banks both the house and senate propose leaving 
the low income housing tax credit untouched however the house version would 
remove private activity bonds pabs another important source financing the 
affordable housing market our knowledge none our banks are materially 
involved pabs 
renewable tax credits potentially diluted but less important banks see our 
utility team note nee nep well positioned for tax reform dec one 
consequence the base erosion anti abuse tax provision beat would that makes 
claiming tax credits for renewable energy investments tax equity investments more 
difficult and less attractive for tax equity providers such large banks the 
renewable tax credits specifically are the production tax credits wind and investment 
tax credits solar 
why the beat provision essentially says that for banks with cross border 
payments more than their deductions the total tax rate paid taxable income 
including adding back cross border payments must least such banks that 
are utilizing these renewable tax credits and coming out below this tax 
threshold will effectively cancel out their renewable tax credits further the beat tax 
calculation done year end complicating decisions whether invest tax equity 
deals during the year itself wind projects are also years length meaning tax 
credits from investments already made years ago could also retroactively impacted 
this issue not resolved during the reconciliation process could reduce benefit 
usage renewable tax credits for our banks per bloomberg new energy finance the 
most active players solar wind tax equity deals were jpm bac usb citi 
mufg stt wfc and pnc however not believe there would 
meaningful impact for our banks our banks only wfc and disclose the size 
their energy investments and compared and low 
income housing tax credit investments respectively 
electric vehicle credit the house proposed removing this tax credit only among 
our names utilizes this tax credit has historically benefited the effective tax rate pts 
new markets tax credit federal historic rehabilitation tax credit the house 
proposes removing both the new markets tax credit and the federal historic 
rehabilitation tax credit the senate leaves both unchanged the only bank 
providing financial disclosure wfc with nonmarketable equity investments 
new market tax credits other other banks make mention the new markets credit 
their filings press releases however not believe this meaningful none our 
banks appear utilize the federal historic rehabilitation credit 
salt and lower mortgage deduction limited impact 
see our fixed income team note for more housing and resi credit outlook 
nov 
proposed removal salt deduction and cutting mortgage deduction half would 
likely only small impact for the banks our view one area focus has been 
whether the removal salt and lower home mortgage deduction would affect 
either loan growth the credit quality mortgages banks the senate house 
both propose repealing the state and local tax deduction for individuals but would 
allow property tax deductions yet only the population makes

muni bonds 
another issue related tax reform whether the banks would pull back their muni 
investments given that lower corporate taxes could mean there lower need 
offset these taxes think there some potential for banks pare back demand 
however think any reduction could modest 
why historically tax rates have not been significant driver muni bond demand 
banks more important indicator loan deposit ratios when banks are flush with 
liquidity deposits they have capacity buy assets and make loans when loan growth 
insufficient that when banks not perceive profitable lending opportunities 
banks are compelled buy fixed income assets earn net interest for more see muni

interest deductibility corporate borrowers longer 
meaningful concern for banks 
see our fixed income team outlook for more details credit outlook when the 
levee breaks 
are longer assuming offset eps our bull case previously were 
concerned about interest deductibility being completely eliminated tax reform and 
had been estimating offset eps benefits from lower tax rates from both 
higher losses and slower loan growth are longer baking this modest offset 
lower corporate tax rates 
key reasons while proposed deductibility caps could impact issuers only interest 
expense ebitda ebit would capped not all the proposal 
would leave good portion issuers unaffected while most not all investment 
grade issuers would see little impact the senate interest deductibility cap would 
impact issuers however when including the benefit lower statutory tax 
rates this would impact issuers those affected are most likely more 
highly levered issuers issuers can carry forward unlimited unused interest 
deductibility the senate bill and for years the house bill 
important note banks utilities and real estate companies are exempted from interest 
deductibility caps 
exhibit for most high yield companies even those above the cap the cost debt still fairly 
low for instance issuers with interest expense ebitda would only estimated see
