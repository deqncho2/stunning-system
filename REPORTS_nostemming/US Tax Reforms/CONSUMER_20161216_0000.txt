staples should outsized beneficiary potential corporate tax reform 
measures although the ultimate changes tax policy are clearly uncertain 
this point expect corporate tax reform become increasingly important 
theme for staples given the sector outsized tax rates 
average and geographic dispersion the sector based our discussions with 
tax experts well our morgan stanley colleagues todd castagno 
accounting tax policy analyst and michael zezas election municipal 
strategist who have separate note out taxes knowing half the battle 
believe changes potentially implemented may include 
reduction the corporate tax rate from one time 
repatriation holiday and iii other revenue generating measures including most 
likely the elimination interest deductions 
highlighting companies that are potentially advantaged elf buff rai apfh 
and disadvantaged wtw tup mdlz across staples the

discussed later this report the tax policies outlined the ryan brady house 
plan would imply significant eps increase across our coverage based 
potential tax rate net the removal interest deductibility

potential eps impact from tax policy changes most stocks appear have 
adjusted somewhat reasonably tax changes among names think have not 
seen efficient reaction cite buff the positive side which has the 
second highest potential eps benefit from tax changes our base case 
and not subject cross border taxation risk the negative side high interest 
expense puts wtw risk from tax policy changes with net eps impact 
also note that secondary consequence policy tax reform will likely 
stronger dollar one could argue this may priced hurting multinational 
companies and benefiting centric companies note given the high uncertainty 
around any potential tax reform are not incorporating eps changes laid out 
above our base case earnings estimates this note are also marking

estimating the potential impact tax reform staples 
following the november elections with the victory donald trump and the 
republican party success maintaining majorities both the house and senate many 
policy experts expect broad based corporate tax reform likely become 
effective starting calendar year tax reform likely happen the key 
question what kind tax reform there are currently two concrete proposals 
donald trump proposal which ran his campaign and the ryan brady 
house gop blueprint the called better way our vision for confident 
america published june the following section examine the key points 
each plan 
donald trump plan while lacking many details donald trump website here 
includes some key points his business tax plan 
reduce the corporate tax rate from and eliminate the corporate 
alternative minimum tax rate 
deemed repatriation corporate profits held offshore one time tax rate 
eliminate most corporate tax expenditures except for the research and 
development credit 
firms engaged manufacturing the may elect expense capital investment 
and lose the deductibility corporate interest expense election once made can 
revoked only within the first years election revoked returns for prior 
years would need amended show revised status after years the election 
irrevocable 
note there border adjustability component trump plan his website 
despite his commentary advocating for tariffs penalties imports during his 
campaign trail 
the ryan brady blueprint june the gop under the initiative 
speaker the house paul ryan and rep kevin brady published the tax blueprint 
called better way our vision for confident america the document lays out the 
following proposals 
reduce the corporate tax rate from and eliminate the corporate 
alternative minimum tax rate 
deemed repatriation corporate profits held offshore accumulated foreign 
earnings will subject tax the extent held cash cash 
equivalents and otherwise will subject tax 
the immediate deductibility capital expenditures 
eliminate deductibility net interest expense 
net operating losses nols will allowed carried forward indefinitely and 
will increased interest factor that compensates for inflation and real 
return capital maintain the value amounts that are carried forward 
preserve the last first out lifo method accounting 
move toward destination basis tax system territorial tax system under 
destination basis approach tax jurisdiction follows the location consumption 
rather than the location production 
the gop proposal would introduce border adjustments way pay for the 
proposed reduction tax rates the proposal would exclude imports from 
deductible expenses the expense side and would exclude export sales from 
taxable income the revenue side 
assuming the gop proposal the base case given that it the most articulated plan 
view the likelihood each the key points follows 
lowering the corporate tax rate under the republican plan from the 
current assign high probability lower corporate tax rate given 
the republican party united this front and there broad based support 
across the business and political community terms the rate assuming political 
compromises see range most likely use our base 
case 
eliminating the deductibility interest expenses believe there high chance 
this proposal implemented way fund the lower corporate tax 
rate even introduced expect phase period measure apply the 
provision prospective debt assign low probability the removal interest 
expense deductibility immediately general expect budget deficits fund 
most the tax policy changes but believe there needs some offset sell 
the plan not fiscally irresponsible interest deductibility our minds the most 
likely funding mechanism for the tax policy changes 
allow repatriation foreign profits after one time tax assign high 
probability this measure given broad based support and because many 
constituencies would benefit this scenario the implementation would benefit 
corporations which could bring back cash the well the government 
which would benefit from the one time tax way fund the lower 
corporate tax rate the labor market would also benefit from more 
investment 
introduction border adjustments see this wild card with low 
probability happening for the following reasons higher prices 
consumers most retailers and some other industries have substantial mix 
imported products under which prices would increase under this plan likely 
resulting much higher prices consumers and regressive tax strong 
opposition from large part the business community particularly retailers and 
net importers the reported the wall street journal link david french 
senior vice president for government relations the national retail federation 
stated that retailers are very concerned about practical effect the border 
adjustment provision profits jobs and operation addition philip ellender 
president government and public affairs for koch companies public sector llc 
issued statement december link saying the proposed border tax 
adjustment will distort the market increase consumer prices and create uneven 
playing field for companies and consumers alike and adding the long term 
consequences the economy and the american consumer could devastating 
the transition period would extremely complex and costly implement 
changes the manufacturing base would staggering companies have set 
their manufacturing base for decades much different system potential 
international repercussion from other countries which could perceive the 
measures tariff their exports response could mostly negate the aim 
the plan boost manufacturing violation wto regulations which could 
require the exit the wto the wto generally allows consumption based 
taxes indirect taxes border adjusted but does not allow income based 
taxes border adjusted result corporate tax system even post the gop 
proposed changes likely not eligible for border adjustment treatment according 
current wto rules the lack concrete proposal for how treat border 
adjustments for financial institutions the business model most financial 
institutions based the free flow capital therefore introducting border 
adjustments cross border financial transactions could put jeopardy the entire 
financial services business model but the same time excluding the financial 
sector could viewed preferential treatment currently there has not been 
concrete proposal how the border adjustment provision would apply 
financial institutions the provision would subsidize pure manufacturers 
putting them perpetual loss position for tax purposes the provision combined 
with the gop proposal carry forward nols indefinitely and increase them 
interest factor would imply that pure domestic manufacturers would never 
have pay taxes economic theory would indicate that exchange rates will 
adjust for the tax policy change potentially negating the impact 
manufacturing 
allow capital expenditures deducted immediately being depreciated over 
time assign medium high probability this measure occur but see 
less relevant the consumer staples group 
who benefits 
summarize our base case tax reform expectation includes lower corporate tax 
rate financed repatriation foreign profits after one time tax the 
removal interest rate deductibility with phase period and increase the 
budget deficit also expect the immediate expensing capital expenditure although 
believe this topic will less relevant the consumer staples group 
the sector level tax reform particularly important the consumer space given 
staples companies average enjoy relatively few tax breaks today and therefore 
should benefit more relative basis from reduced corporate rate other 
sectors

potential impact changes interest deductibility 
under the gop tax reform companies would not allowed deduct interest 
expenses for tax purposes providing important source revenue generation help 
partially offset the higher deficit associated with lower corporate tax rates importantly 
existing republican tax plans have generally indicated that such change would 
phased over much years and would apply all debt not only prospective 
debt however for simplicity sake have assumed all once impact across our 
respective coverages this would disproportionally hurt highly levered companies our 
coverage such wtw with net debt ebitda 
believe limitation interest deductibility may pursued any reform scenario 
lower tax rate needs funded partially order argue some fiscal discipline 
even though assume budget deficits increase interest deductibility the third 
largest corporate deduction after wages and cost sales billion irs soi tax 
stats corporation complete report further policymakers both sides the 
aisle perceive the code favoring debt financed investment over equity financed 
investment due the deductibility interest but not dividends 
important note this change will likely phased the last major tax overhaul 
the tax reform act contained over special transitions rules many industryand even firm specific for instance perhaps can take cue from the proposed 
american business competitiveness act sponsored devin nunes who 
member the ways and means committee and serves president elect trump 
transition team his legislation would eliminate the deductibility interest but also 
provides ten year transitional phase where would disallowed the first 
year then and 
beverages and hpc assuming interest deductibility were removed and applying

repatriation foreign profits 
trump has proposed one time deemed repatriation accumulated deferred foreign 
income tax rate contrast the house gop blueprint advocates one time 
deemed repatriation with differential rates for cash and noncash assets 
which could paid ratably over eight years the taxpayer election thus looked 
percentage cash held outside the per disclosures identify companies 
that would most benefit from repatriation foreign cash 
within beverage and hpc companies general carry significant their total cash 
balance foreign jurisdictions thus reform could catalyze increase cash returns 
shareholders the biggest beneficiaries include epc tup enr and pep 
all which have total cash held overseas addition believe the 
probability could increase with repatriation holiday permanent program 
which think underappreciated the market specifically repatriation holiday 
international cash the may encourage consolidation companies albeit 
partially offset the potential loss interest expense deductibility believe 
investors could credit strategic potential among perceived niche companies with high 
growth high margins and barriers entry particularly names where large multinational could build out its international presence screening through our coverage 
mnst and buff fit these criteria most closely 
within food and tobacco opportunities for repatriation appear relatively modest 
although four companies our coverage sjm mjn and gis disclose holding 
their cash foreign jurisdictions importantly however this only represents 
material potential benefit across our coverage for mjn foreign cash which 
after applying presumed tax would represent the company current 
market cap additionally two companies our coverage that also have significant 
amount foreign earnings have been deemed permanently reinvested mdlz 
and the event that the companies faced forced tax tax 
payment these assets would expect any resulting charges treated onetime nature and represent one time cash flow headwind

border adjustments 
believe the largest wild card the house republican tax plan the called 
border adjustment mechanism the proposal would exclude imports from deductible 
expenses the expense side and would exclude export sales from taxable income 
the revenue side note that imports would not limited physical imports but 
would include any purchase from person entity outside the companies 
paying royalties foreign subsidiaries while the exact mechanics the proposal have 
not been explained yet clear that companies who are net importers the would 
disproportionally hit significantly border adjustment overall think the 
proposal wild card the gop tax reform and think the chances border 
adjustment pass are relatively low the range 
border adjustability vat 
most the united states major trading partners utilize vat systems generate 
revenue addition direct taxes such corporate and personal income taxes vat 
tax indirect tax similar national sales consumption tax and thus ultimately 
paid the consumer the taxing jurisdiction the vat tax accrues each stage the 
production process and function input costs less sales price times the vat tax 
rate vat taxes are designed tax consumption within taxing jurisdiction they are 
generally border adjustable for goods imported and exported that means exporters 
receive rebate for any vat taxes incurred their production process while 
corresponding vat tax levied all imported goods and services 
the key feature the gop tax reform blueprint radically transform the current 
business taxation system destination based cash flow system with border 
adjustability 
destination system the proposal seeks locate the tax incidence the place 
consumption sense converting the business income tax system into 
synthetic consumption tax 
cash flow based system the proposal would remove many the accrual 
accounting structures today code such amortization capital investment 
and would also eliminate most taxation from financing flows this why the house 
blueprint requires immediate capital investment deductions and the near 
elimination interest deductibility 
the gop blueprint clearly states that the proposed system not vat but 
structurally very similar subtraction based vat system the blueprint proposes 
apply border adjustability the destination based cash flow system 
not taxing the value exported goods and services including intangible rights and 
property 
disallowing deductions for any imported good service including intangible rights 
and property 
the system would apply both foreign and domestic taxpayers thus 
multinationals with international supply chains would incur tax importing goods 
and services into united states this includes rights and fees paid foreign subsidiaries 
that control intellectual property for instance 
who would most impacted 
within the food industry see relatively modest impact from border tax 
adjustments given that the vast majority finished product manufacturing for the 
market takes place domestically one noteworthy exception within our coverage mdlz 
which has recent years invested both based manufacturing upgrades lines 
the future well the construction greenfield manufacturing facility salinas 
mexico which was expected have high efficiency lines operational mid and 
produces significant albeit undisclosed portion the company volume the 
opposite end the spectrum border adjustability results export volume being nontaxable this could drive modest eps tailwinds for companies with higher concentration 
sales canada khc sjm the extent these products are produced part 
within the across all these scenarios however would again note that our 
discussions with tax experts have suggested that border tax adjustments present 
significant practical hurdles which result relatively low likelihood the measure 
ultimately being implemented 
beverages hpc see the highest risk stz given their beer portfolio 
ballast point imported from mexico beer total profit with largely 
fixed manufacturing base due the nature the product mexican imports must 
produced mexico also see risk nwl and elf given both companies 
revenue stream supported imported products almost all elf and 
nwl however see less risk here given their imported products are largely 
sourced through third parties almost all elf nwl and thus each 
company could reconfigure much their footprint third parties fairly easily the 
biggest potential beneficiaries our coverage include bfb with jack daniel 
total volume production and other smaller brands woodford reserve occurring the 
and exported internationally slightly offset imported vodka and tequila epc 
should also benefit given believe they are net exporter products outside the 
with their razor blades and feminine care manufacturing base used supply 
international markets 
net are not overly concerned the border adjustability proposal given the low 
probability ultimately occurring addition stz case pricing power could 
negate much the pressure from border adjustments and nwl and elf could 
reconfigure third party manufacturing mitigate much but certainly not all the 
impact 
mapping out the border adjustability impact stz start caveat our stz 
analysis below given little public details how the concept border 
adjustability would implemented practically speaking let alone the question 
will included any sort tax reform package nonetheless assuming 
implemented bear case scenario forecast impact our eps 
estimate while base case scenario see more modest impact the three key 
drivers analyzed include the addressable beer cogs base from which assess

would equate only increase retail assuming markup

however this situation would unique given the magnitude the step change
