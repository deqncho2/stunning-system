note all references tax reform within this note relate the tax bill currently 
proposed but which remains yet unpassed 
key thoughts 
even the proposed bill passes tesla doesn need the federal tax 
credit extension both the current and proposed federal tax credit are 
only good for the first deliveries before phasing out over period 
time our understanding that tesla will achieve this milestone 
early mid such have not factored any extension the 
credit for tesla customers our tesla earnings model from 
demographic perspective given tesla high average transaction price near 
per unit for and and for model the value the 
retained tax credit percentage purchase price relatively lower for 
tesla than for the makers other evs the market the nissan leaf 
and the chevrolet bolt overall view the retaining the tax credit 
more important for other players who are much further away from the 
sales mark and where the pricing and exclusive nature brand 
may not par with the average tesla 
extension the tax credit could seen avoiding sending the 
wrong message economic rivals the wrong time our 
discussions with investors and corporates the topic evs emerging 
theme that there are two subdivisions the global market china 
and everyone else this stage see the part the latter 
category and our working assumption that china will achieve global 
dominance future propulsion systems and battery storage over time 
see china achieving this due the extremely high volumes the domestic 
market the aggressive policies from powerful central government and 
the strategic urgency for renewable energy from both environmental 
and economic perspective comparison believe that the will have 
more uphill battle encourage change the transportation 
hegemony 
for buyers see policies for developing infrastructure far 
morgan stanley does and seeks business with 
companies covered morgan stanley research 
result investors should aware that the firm may have 
conflict interest that could affect the objectivity

report 
more important than tax credits infrastructure the elephant the 
room our opinion any car company government targeting aggressive 
penetration without plan for infrastructure will risk the 
policy and investment implications cut across autos capital goods 
chemicals electric utilities metals mining and specialty chemicals 
geographically the most significant regions change are india and china 
the incremental electricity drawn off the global grid evs will 
nearly the equivalent the current electricity demand 
for more the morgan stanley global autos shared mobility team views 
penetration please see our recent foundation pieces infrastructure 
tesla footprint maps industry problem october and new 
energy vehicles charging into challenges october well our 
recent global blue paper electric vehicles the charge august 
the morgan stanley infrastructure firms engaged with the build out 
global infrastructure represent one way for investors play the theme 
growth evs with this mind previously worked with morgan stanley 
research analysts across five regions asia pacific europe north america japan 
and latin america compile list names across autos capital goods 
chemicals electric utilities metals mining and special chemicals this list was 
initially published our idea piece the infrastructure diversified way 
play critical enabler the theme october 
exhibit infrastructure 
source shutterstock morgan stanley research 
the industry implications for building out sufficient infrastructure support 
rapid growth sales parc and miles traveled extend beyond the auto 
industry affecting large tranches the economy and the investment landscape 
arrive the infrastructure evi asked our global research 
colleagues simple question which the names under your coverage would 
best positioned world moving towards electrification requiring substantial 
private and public investments infrastructure morgan stanley global 
research team settled global stocks across seven industries consumer 
discretionary energy industrials information technology materials metals 
mining and utilities throughout north america the asia pacific europe japan 
and latin america sorted the names into six distinct sub groups autos 
capital goods chemicals electric utilities metals mining and special 
chemicals commodities the majority the names the list are owrated although analysts could also include rated names the time horizon 
this theme extends beyond the morgan stanley research month price 
target rating timeline 
what resulted was the global evi which believe represents unique and 
diversified way for investors gain exposure this important long term and 
global theme would note that there have been changes the initial list 
since original publication october morgan stanley has since dropped 
coverage two the companies included the initial evi list eaton and
