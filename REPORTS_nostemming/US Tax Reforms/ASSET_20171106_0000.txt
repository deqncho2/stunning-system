tactically more positive traditional asset mgrs given 
potential double barrel benefit from tax cuts see 
potential earnings boost from cutting corp tax rates 
and additional upside from incremental alpha opportunities 
beta tailwinds more positive equal weights trow 
wetf 
alpha opportunities growing potential for the biggest sweeping tax changes 
decades could create winners losers this could lead higher stock 
dispersion and lower correlation and ultimately create more opportunities for 
stock pickers generate alpha ytd large cap mgrs are beating 
benchmarks performance improves meaningfully active mgrs could make 
inroads towards turning the tide passive however secular challenges remain 
double barrel benefit lower tax rates could boost gdp growth and fund navs 
thereby growing asset mgr revenue pools further our coverage group has 
fairly high tax rate average tax rates are cut see 
earnings boost traditional asset mgrs but they invest the savings 
back into the business including price cuts see boost hlne trow 
wdr wetf benefit most and ivz least details inside with sensitivity table 
more positive equal weight wetf and raising eps estimates and 
raising our valuation implies target multiple towards the 
higher end historical valuation given improving flow trajectory technology 
and distribution initiatives that could inflect differentiated growth and among 
the best positioned benefit from tax cuts also ivz recently announced 
acquisition guggenheim etf business supports wetf valuation see our note 
for details given the revenue multiple paid wetf currently trading 
more positive equal weight trow given improving flow trajectory early 
green shoots from investments distribution that could sustain flows and 
among the best positioned benefit from tax cuts 
overweight blk and ivz blk growing technology focus broad product 
offering and positioning both ends the asset mgmt barbell position them 
for compelling growth opportunities and premium multiple also like ivz 
given their positioning for above peer earnings growth and sustainable flows yet

tax reform impact traditional asset mgrs brokers 
lower corporate tax rate could boost traditional asset mgr earnings and 
ebrokers enacted statutory rate current 
with the unveiling the gop tax reform proposal run through various scenarios 
below show the potential eps boost our traditional asset mgr and brokers 
coverage exhibit show the boost eps assuming the proposed 
corporate tax rate different flow through levels the bottom line the 
incremental tax savings discount brokers benefit more than 
traditional asset mgrs given their predominantly domestic footprint and higher 
current tax rate 
who benefits most hlne wdr trow and wetf would see the biggest boost among 
the traditionals and schw etfc and lpla among the ebrokers 
who sees least upside from lower tax rates ivz given their already low tax rate 
due offshore domicile and operations would see the least benefit and blk given 
their global footprint and relatively lower tax rate peers 
our analysis assumes flow through lower tax rate but what brokers and 
asset mgrs reinvest some the incremental tax savings into the business into 
pricing technology data new product distribution traditional money mgrs reinvest 
the incremental tax savings and let flow through the bottom line see 
boost earnings instead and they reinvest half then the earnings 
boost for more information various impacts the tax reform bill please

franklin resources value ben using multiple earnings plus tax 
affected excess cash probability weighted which implies overall 
multiple discount the due subdued growth profile and premium the 
group reflecting large cash position despite historical group discount upside risks are 
accelerated capital return accretive acquisition and flows stabilize downside risks are 
that flows and performance deteriorate more rapidly than anticipated and secular fee 
pressure takes hold 
blackrock value blk using multiple eps premium the 
group due their unrivalled product breadth well their ability generate 
positive organic asset growth most environments upside risk includes flows higher 
fee products and ishares penetration into fixed income and international markets 
greater than expected downside risks include decline organic revenue growth and 
designation non bank non insurance systemically important financial institution

market occurs faster downside risk that the retail market proves more challenging 
and enough offset institutional progress rising cost pressure traction slows with 
fixed income and alts products and the vote exit from the has greater impact 
than estimated

rowe price value trow using multiple eps premium 
the group historical this reflects their stickier aum with skew retirement money 
that partially offset weaker organic growth and expense uplift upside risks are that
