while increased capex could improve growth prospects mitigate inflation pressure through capital deepening the near term

big picture believe the recent volatility markets should remind 
think the analysis this note supports that view yes there have 
investors that fiscal stimulus this stage the expansion risks 
been some announcements around using tax cut benefits pay 
shortening rather than extending the economic cycle forcing cen 
down debt and they have received lot attention among credit 
tral banks remove accommodation faster this key since our 
investors however reality only companies our analysis 
view central banks have been the most important driver credit 
cited debt paydown use tax cut benefits with the majority 
markets this cycle the headwind central banks speed the 
citing less credit friendly uses like distributions shareholders 
liquidity withdrawal bigger our view than the tail wind from 
capex and remember too that when push comes shove 
modest boost gdp growth and think markets are now coming 
companies may choose behave even less conservatively than they 
that realization well 
are currently suggesting 
focusing how companies may act while the tax cuts are clear 
finally from supply perspective have assumed that zero net 
fundamental tail wind have pushed back the view that tax 
issuance from companies with the most offshore trapped cash would 
reform will incentivize big wave voluntary delevering very 
lead lower issuance and this does seem playing out with 
simply confidence tends one the largest drivers debt 
supply down materially year over year although think recent 
growth cycle and right now confidence soaring have been 
market volatility and the rise rates are also contributing lower 
skeptical the view that companies will suddenly choose behave 
supply microsoft comment pleased obviously able 
conservatively and delever balance sheets environment 
access the cash more easily and not have through the debt 
booming growth where animal spirits are rising and when compa 
market able make these choices speaks this effect lower
