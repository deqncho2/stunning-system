preliminary analysis average impact eps thanks 
fall effective tax rate this early stage few companies our coverage have 
provided guidance the impact tax reform and the reduction the 
corporate federal tax rate for large corporations from however 
based our preliminary assumptions and the company comments made far 
think our sector could see almost eps uplift our current 
estimates published pre tax law vote led decrease from 
for the average effective tax rate our sector this benefit would come from 
average sales exposure the and related amount group 
ebit share generated the according our estimates 
why the benefit not higher other accounting items come into play with 
operating earnings exposure the close our coverage and 
reduction federal corporate tax may legitimate expect more 
upside indeed hypothetically assuming the current tax rate going 
across the group the uplift would closer average however 
see elements temper this effect large amounts deferred tax assets that 
mean many companies already pay much less than tax the even 
before the reform impact state taxes and specific tax schemes and 
headwind the interest deductibility intra group financing our work 
the topic continues other factors could emerge 
stock implications landis gyr and smiths could larger beneficiaries gea 
and zumtobel less based our preliminary analysis see upside eps 
potential above many exposure eavy lifters but this not 
necessarily the norm and other names with large exposure such electrolux 
philips philips lighting may not benefit the full eadline amount 
what keep mind ahead some companies have disclosed already 
there could non cash adjustments numbers notably around deferred 
tax liabilities which affect reported eps also note ongoing changes tax 
policies several european jurisdictions that could affect the overall effective 
tax rate our coverage and which are not factored into our analysis finally 
while focus here federal corporate tax there could other provisions

our methodology 
tax reform some general points consider 
december the passed into law the tax cuts and jobs act tcja 
which among other measures created single rate all taxable corporate 
income the previous systems tranches with different rates 
between depending the tranches until the tranche for taxable 
income above 
essence most taxable income the companies under european capital 
goods coverage were large part taxed the tranche federal level 
however see the move from unlikely linear across 
companies for the following reasons 
companies specific situation terms related deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities indeed large related deferred tax assets may have led 
effective tax rates much below the threshold 
impact state tax and specific tax schemes notably related industrial 
investments specific parts the depending business exposure 
state and footprint companies may have had different tax profile for their 
income than the federal tax income rate alone 
interest deductibility there could tax related impact headwind interests 
deductibility from intra group financing loans 
the change federal corporate tax very recent and expect most companies 
still working out the technicalities also note that historically very few them 
have provided even information earnings generated the alone and 
details their specific tax rate related deferred tax assets liabilities 
operations financing 
such the absence concrete information many moving parts and formal 
guidance our analysis based our best assumptions around exposure for each 
company consider the following 
sales and ebit exposure group estimated for based previous 
disclosure and comments and assumptions 
our current published effective tax rate for each company for well items 
between ebit and pbt and any equity minorities adjustments the last two remain 
constant while the effective tax rate will impacted the change our 
assumed corporate tax rate 
assumed tax rate this analysis the default case but assumptions 
have been made notably when information about potential deferred tax assets 
benefit was available the difference between theoretical impact and assumed 
impact the tax change highlighted exhibits and above 
net deferred tax liabilities sales indication around potential benefit 
our analysis does not account for other tax changes that could happen other 
jurisdictions outside the well other parts the tcja provisions and 
solely focused flexing what assume the federal corporate tax rate paid 
each company 
what have companies said far 
our analysis the section above very preliminary and many companies are yet 
communicate publicly the benefits impacts this change their effective tax 
rate for and beyond potential impact cash tax and adjustments balance 
sheet items related deferred tax adjustments inter company loans policies 
some this could take place early results 
however give here snapshot what some companies have already commented 
the topic and this already insightful terms showing how consideration 
deferred tax items important
