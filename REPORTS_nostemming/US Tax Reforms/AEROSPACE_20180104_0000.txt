tax reform here now what 
pension for lmt rtn 
with tax reform now passed our expectation for lmt rtn 
both accelerate pension funding which should 
supportive the valuation outlook such take 
eps fcf and our pts for both 
what happened got tax reform and now it likely get some pension 
pre funding lmt and rtn management have been open with the investment 
community about taking opportunistic approach around pre funding their 
pensions which have been supportive given how the market values their 
stocks and fcf yields fact lmt management its recent earnings call 
noted fact tax reform initiated will clearly look potentially 
accelerating our pension contributions and regard rtn though 
management has been less direct its comments has history accelerated 
pension funding albeit modestly and noted openness various approaches 
our opinion the large change federal tax rates and high likelihood 
industry bellwether lmt pre funding raises the potential for the company 
follow suit accordingly our updated models now reflect accelerated funding 
and for lmt and rtn respectively account for paying 
down three additional years pre tax pension this has the impact raising 
eps and fcf thus driving our pts upward which discuss further below 
and that will raise our forward numbers and valuation for lmt rtn 
start shown exhibit both lmt and rtn have some the larger aggregate 
pension obligations the group and respectively and thus 
through front end loading their expected payments the forward year 
earnings and cash flow improve walk through the pluses and 
minuses from these strategy shifts below 
exhibit pre funding adds point fcf yield moving rtn lmt higher

lmt raising eps fcf management 
largely telegraphed its potential actions assume lmt raises 
debt years worth obligations per year pre tax 
capture lower tax rate points the impact eps should 
somewhat limited but for the higher pension asset net the 
incremental debt rate raises earnings and fcf while 
cash generation reduced dramatically our and beyond figures 
improve notably particular raise our fcf base 
per share assume annual contributions are 
eliminated per our discussion with the company the net this raised 
nearly prior account for some portion the 
now leading fcf yield 
rtn raising eps fcf assuming 
they follow lmt likely actions though less aggressive extent given 
rtn solid balance sheet assume during the company will raise 
debt cover obligations relatively cheap rate 
this would allow them capitalize the tax rate spread 
points the impact eps should minimal while the higher 
pension asset net the incremental debt raises earnings 
and fcf cash generation reduced substantially though our 
and beyond figures improve notably particular raise our 
fcf base per share assume 
annual contributions continue year zero lmt per our 
conservatism the resultant improved earnings and cash leads raise 
our prior account for some portion the 
stronger fcf yield 
what makes compelling accelerate funding there are several reasons 
expand each below 
boost forward valuation pension expense and cash contributions 
suppress eps fcf thus hindering share price performance optically 
reduction the tax rate the former corporate statutory tax rates 
offers meaningfully greater tax benefit than the new rate 
and can utilized retroactively 
growing forward fcf and creating more flexibility elimination future 
contributions increases fcf substantially albeit mainly due timing but 
provides greater flexibility capital deployment 
healthy spread between asset return and funding costs current spreads 
between long term expected roa and debt yields are which drives 
notable eps accretion the earlier years our base case forecast 
lower insurance premiums reducing pension underfunding also reduces 
variable pbgc insurance premiums that are pegged underfunding 
adding eps accretion 
reducing the risk liabilities exchanging pension underfunding for debt 
reduces stock volatility corporate debt perceived lower risk 
supportive political dynamics the event that defense companies 
accelerate pension funding may well received from political 
perspective given the support shows from labor standpoint 
from here expect more color from the respective management teams 
their earnings calls few weeks acknowledge that are broadly ahead 
the curve regard our approach adjusting eps fcf and valuation ahead 
any management announcements however given the public comments and 
our dialogue with the respective companies are comfortable taking leap 
faith given the compelling nature the opportunity addition the 
upcoming earnings calls expect such items will topics discussion 
suspect the management teams will provide more clarity their approach since 
now have finalized tax reform legislation specifically lmt will report 
earnings and rtn will report where this will key focal point 
especially since guides have largely been given and budget resolution may 
still pending and for the stocks believe broader projections have the 
potential move upward and support our thesis since are above consensus
