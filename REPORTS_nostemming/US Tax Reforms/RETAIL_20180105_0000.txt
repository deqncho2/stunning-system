tax reform raising 
estimates and price targets 
given the passage the federal corporate tax rate 
raise our and out year eps estimates well price 
targets across our coverage chs jwn and jill look benefit 
the most from corporate tax reform but with the group 
since some tax upside likely priced 
our coverage group has rallied since november the probability 
passing corporate tax reform materially increased just after thanksgiving our 
view accordingly since black friday our stocks have rallied average 
market cap weighted basis while difficult quantify how much this 
rally has been driven what likely better than anticipated versus 
anticipated tax reform think least some tax upside already priced into 
our coverage universe since november jill aeo and kss have rallied the 
most while chs and tjx have lagged exhibit expect excess cash will 
primarily used for reinvestment the business likely through both 
promotions and omni channel investments infrastructure etc 
share repurchases and lesser degree dividend increases while retailers 
are unlikely compete away their tax benefits year one continue believe 
retailers profitability will erode each and every year while tax reform should 
drive positive one time eps and cash flow boost does not change the 
investment case for most our stocks our view 
key company conclusions 
tpr kors and lulu likely see limited tax reform upside given 
already significantly lower tax rates than the domestic retailers kors 
tpr lulu exhibit our eps estimates remain 
unchanged just higher exhibit 
the other hand chs jwn and jill likely benefit the most from tax 
reform given they operate largely domestic businesses and have some 
the highest tax rates within our coverage exhibit these retailers could 
see eps boosts exhibit
