tax reform better travel 
than arrive 
recent policy optimism helped equities rates and usd 
approach our targets yet the path for tax reform 
deliberations suggests meaningful stimulus appears unlikely 
with scenario weighted outcomes close our targets these 
markets are approaching levels where tax optimism should 
faded 
focus outcomes over timing believe 
legislative efforts tax reform are likely wrap 
the end given the practical implications 
midterm election campaigning that means resolution 
tax reform within six months and markets are 
likely behave anticipatory fashion regardless 
the precise nature the tax action date hence 
place primacy how incoming news impacts the 
probability action the level stimulus and key 
legislative details for the record though still think 
tax reform story 
tax stimulus pathfinder most roads lead limited stimulus map our 
expected outcomes decision tree that allows investors adjust probabilities 
the situation evolves our prior work laid out the rationale for why 
tax outcomes point toward limited deficit expansion potential particular 
senate budget politics and rules appear constrain the number possible 
outcomes and risks remain skewed toward legislative failure that said 
remain vigilant for the emergence all none scenario high stakes vote 
substantial deficit expanding bill that follows republicans inability moderate 
their existing tax framework via higher rates and key pay fors while such 
outcome would likely signal higher odds legislative failure would also 
accompanied higher odds substantial deficit expansion and implied 
stimulus 
strategy better travel than arrive expected tax action mostly the 
price further risk rallies create opportunity fade while previously 
noted that investors should take comfort the notion that any progress toward 
tax reform would likely create investable risk opportunities changes key 
market valuations have thinking that risk moves could shorter lived 
hence while equities ust yields and usd could still rise progress toward tax 
action the limited fundamental impact that action and the risks failure 
act suggest that investors should look fading risk and adding duration

key risk our view the chairman mark tries ground surround fiscal 
hawks the extent that fiscally hawkish senators appear either increasingly 
flexible deficits isolated permission narratives around broad deficit 
expansion willing accept rules workarounds like changing the official 
legislative scorer then paths the decision tree that point toward substantial 
stimulus are more likely taken pressure create such conditions could 
arise early this week the legislative draft implies deficit expansion beyond 
the senate budget allowance for investors the key implication such shifts 
that they would increase both the odds failure stimulus and substantial 
deficit expansion hence fading risk would not yet make sense since the 
prospects for more meaningful tradeable rise yields and equities above our 
base case targets would increase

outcomes

key takeaways 
see three potential outcomes modest deficit boost chance 
legislative failure substantial deficit boost hence think 
outcomes are skewed toward little stimulus impact 
the chairman mark november important indicator but see 
opening offer deficits not final one the fully marked draft legislation key 
shows bill with static revenue loss far excess the senate budget 
resolution the odds scenarios and rise creating all none choice 
other catalysts political stalemates over pay fors signs that republicans are 
losing the messaging war and process that threatens drag into midterm 
campaigning increase odds failure signs senate leadership indicating they 
are willing break with procedure replace the official budget scorer 
improve odds significant stimulus 
crunch time for tax reform outcomes 
the coming weeks expect learn great deal more about tax reform details and 
consequently likely legislative outcomes draft legislation from the house expected 
released november with markup and potential vote slated occur before 
the thanksgiving recess which starts november senate leaders have also stated 
their intent release draft and hold mark before the recess hence the 
coming weeks news flow should offer greater clarity the market relevant details 
tax policy this section map how that news flow could impact probabilities for tax 
outcomes specifically around deficits and potential stimulus 
bringing order tax process chaos 
recent research laid out the case for how tax legislation likely come 
together this includes key provisions the plan the level potential fiscal stimulus 
and events that would lead failure pass tax reform see life the slow lane 
september and tax reform deficits moderate raise the stakes october 
this report build decision tree that lays out the path and catalysts 
for various outcomes which can grouped into three buckets modest stimulus 
legislative failure and material stimulus the decision tree considers several questions 
the order they most likely will addressed news flow exhibit 
the key initial question will the house produce bill that statically scores revenue 
loss materially higher than the answer important because sets early 
marker about whether viable political path toward tax reform passage has been 
found congress has set course for riskier all none deficit path producing 
bill whose net static revenue loss within the allowance the budget resolution 
keeps legislation conventional track towards passage even though leaves plenty 
execution risk around defending key pay for items from special interest lobbies 
loss salt corporate interest deductibility etc and moderation tax rate cuts 
the chairman mark opening not final offer deficit 
expansion 
the chairman mark the first legislative draft the tax bill before committee 
consideration scheduled released november yet could modified 
substantially goes through the markup process expect the mark will 
include most not all the controversial pay fors under consideration 
rothification salt deduction etc and then chairman brady and speaker ryan 
will adjust the bill secure the votes they need therefore the first node our 
decision tree contains both the initial mark and the bill that ways and means 
settles this because the deficits implied the mark could meaningfully 
smaller than what settled after the markup hence the mark will tell 
lot about deficit direction and size but will monitor the markup process 
closely until the deficit debate settled 
this style bill would also limit potential deficit expansion signaling that 
ceiling for revenue loss with the potential for number considerably lower the bill 
attempts appease key deficit hawks like senator bob corker who would like see 
bill that dynamically scores net revenue loss given the somewhat conservative 
scoring methodology the joint committee taxation jct some aspects which 
penalize deficit expansion complying with corker demands suggests that dynamic 
effects are unlikely more than said differently static revenue loss the inverse 
dynamic effects would likely have less than hence even front loaded 
that level deficit expansion consistent with gdp estimate which our 
economists believe generates only modest gdp increase for full details 
this analysis please see tax reform deficits moderate raise the stakes 
however producing bill whose revenue loss substantially greater that 
somewhere between the net and gross revenue the recent 
framework would suggest republicans have already failed find way navigate 
these difficult politics and have chosen produce legislation that does not abide the 
senate deficit ceiling this would force the senate either make hard choices that may 
not survive house scrutiny take the unprecedented step working around the 
budget rules the latter would require deficit hawks like senator corker and rules 
purists like senator john mccain act against their publicly stated positions something 
consider unlikely given their prior pattern behavior similar votes and the fact 
that both appear longer bound electoral concerns hence the choice produce 
draft with substantial deficit expansion beyond the senate budget static allowance 
would move the process toward greater odds failure according our decision tree 
yet the emergence this choice between deficit expansion and something excess 
gdp which would deliver more substantial gdp uplift would likely have 
ramifications for volatility higher rates and yield curve shape steeper also note 
that the senate may also face similar difficulties regarding how modify the bill 
drafts its legislation but our decision tree focus the house because its draft 
appears poised released first therefore revealing political tone and feedback that 
may influence senate proceedings

given this framework note the following key takeaways 
place good degree confidence the political and rules constraints the 
senate and believe congress will hold the deficit ceiling see moderate 
raise the stakes 
hence the gravitational pull policy toward either modest deficit expansion 
none legislative failure 
failure reaches high probability not any one particular event but because 
myriad opportunities for failure throughout the process 
further detail these takeaways our three scenarios the table below

wisdom from the tree what takes off our path moves 
markets 
based our decision tree and outcome scenarios note the following regarding 
people and policy issues that may receive media attention the coming weeks and 
could provide clues which outcomes are becoming more less likely also note 
some broader market implications which are fully fleshed out subsequent sections 
the report 
fiscal hawks getting grounded leads greater odds both large stimulus and 
failure rates volatility would expected the extent that fiscally hawkish 
senators such corker and paul appear either increasingly flexible deficits 
increasingly isolated less vocal hawks like senator enzi begin spinning 
permission narratives around broad deficit expansion then paths our decision 
tree that point toward the all dessert vegetables outcome are more likely 
taken this could include comments from fiscal hawks about changing the 
official legislative score tax from the jct though would distinguish this from 
senators using unofficial dynamic scores talking point which would not change 
the deficit potential actual legislation for investors note that the key 
implication shifts toward the all dessert vegetables scenario that they 
increase both the odds failure stimulus and substantial deficit expansion 
the all none scenario that would introduce more volatility into rates markets 
particular 
unwelcome surprise pay fors increase failure odds opportunity fade risk and 
add duration key challenge this bill success the heretofore unknown payfors that will turn the previously announced tax framework into bill that fits the 
senate deficit allowance under the budget resolution that means finding about 
fresh revenue beyond what already been disclosed hence may see tax 
rate targets rise and fresh loophole closing proposals like rothification 
the extent that any these become substantially polarizing new rate levels 
violate white house red lines the retirement lobby puts good fight 
rothification etc negotiating way forward will take more time that risks the 
process running against the practical constraint midterm election season 
kickoff spring 
procedural purists cry foul increase failure odds and opportunity fade risk and 
add duration key contributor the effort repeal aca was the objection 
key senators like mccain the senate rushed and partisan approach notably 
mccain voted against the bush tax cuts the basis that their benefits were too 
skewed toward the wealthy hence not inconceivable that could similar 
aca call for more bipartisan approach address similar concerns this time 
around while our base case that such objections could isolated one two 
senators with tax given more deliberate though still partisan process this 
issue can dismiss the possibility the emergence other rules workarounds 
enable the bill like switching the official legislative scorer might also raise the ire 
senate rules purists hence procedural criticisms and fresh calls for bipartisan 
process from republican senators could signals rising failure risks

equities still have modest upside our scenario weighted fiscal expectations while 
both rates and the usd sit line think this means market pricing now largely 
line with our policy expectations and that further fiscal excitement should most

our other key message better travel than arrive think most investors would 
view larger than expected stimulus even the passage any tax cut 
bullish catalyst but think this would short lived after large scale tax cut 
struggle see another catalyst make investors even more optimistic and such 
surprise opens the door tighter monetary policy potential negative for multiples 
the latter cynic might say that the fed about have new leadership who would 
loath conduct policy counter the administration think that dangerous 
assumption assumes break the long held independence the central bank 
assumes that wouldn bring with plethora other uncertainties and risks there 
little precedent for large scale fiscal easing current levels unemployment the late 
may the closest comparison maybe this won problem maybe will 
note think this goes both ways while failure tax reform would likely cause 
short term market pullback this scenario actually the best one for extending the cycle 
reducing the risk overheating conditions and allowing policy tightening remain 
gradual this one reason why there less downside our equity team 
bear case than one might expect 
considering other deficit expansion potential 
beyond tax cuts may see deficit expansion from government spending 
due increase defense spending and supplemental appropriations for 
disaster relief while too early put precise number the defense 
and non defense spending deal the total needed for disaster relief 
believe there potential for spending boost making tax cuts retroactive the 
start which feel unlikely also consideration 
defense both the house and senate have passed their own defense bills which 
differ the details but increase overall defense spending base budget and 
overseas contingency operations about billion over funding 
however both bills have appropriated significantly over the existing bca caps 
which can only raised with legislation and therefore need negotiated with 
democrats who years past have wanted increase non defense 
discretionary spending deal can reached raise the caps defense 
spending would essentially flat from the continuing resolution covering 
current funding expires december will learn more congress turns its 
attention the funding negotiations 
disaster congress has already passed two disaster spending bills totaling 
billion and the white house expects congress pass third disaster spending bill 
before the end the year recently omb director mick mulvaney has indicated 
wants the third disaster bill have offsets which may make the process 
passing the bill harder and may affect the net spending amount for the third 
disaster funding bill may end being included the end year december 
funding deal 
retroactivity think congress unlikely adopt tax reform that retroactive 
the start because costs money and they already struggling 
find pay fors don believe would assigned much economic value 
dynamic scoring and could force republicans address statutory paygo 
rules earlier than republicans are ready that said given republicans are 
advertising ambitious timeline possible the chairman mark would initially 
point retroactivity 
strategy impact don expect these factors meaningfully change the 
fundamental calculus investors incremental defense spending likely small 
relative gdp and relative expectations given the norm forecasting 
government spending growth yoy basis disaster spending can paid out 
over long time frame fact fema still making grants for hurricane sandy 
retroactivity generally considered academics little change incentives 
hence these impacts are likely already reflected investor expectations 
equities right sized expectations

bottom line base case outcome tax cuts with moderate stimulus line with our 
target 
tax reform should boost earnings and incentivize increased late cycle activity like

multiple modest expansion since this the scenario have been baking into our 
base case think that earnings the appropriate multiple this state the

forward while allowing for some contraction surge late cycle activity like

tightening cycle and bring forward the end the cycle which should discounted into 
what the market willing pay for earnings 
trades sectors watch once have some certainty tax would expect that 
small and mid caps would among the larger beneficiaries due their higher tax 
savings and the uplift expect see policy clarity should also allow for 
follow through elevated capex investment plans which should benefit tech and cap

actually causes the forward multiple come down major fiscal stimulus added 
economy that already running hot with unemployment low and sentiment readings

bottom line expect our deficit scenario probability weighted ust notional

absorbed expected year end the increase supply 
given the rise yields experienced already late and ahead the 
fed september announcement balance sheet normalization and speculation tax 
reform would guess that modest increase ust notional equivalent

one little understood aspect government bond markets that quantitative easing 
brought the forefront investors minds how bond markets respond changes 
supply the quest understand how impacted government bond yields 
necessitated deeper understanding stock and flow effects while the conclusions 
how and now quantitative tightening impact government bonds via stock 
and flow effects remain debated academic circles and even among investors our view 
straightforward and one hold with confidence 
government bond markets price probability weighted and present valued expected 
changes the future stock government bonds available private investors ahead 
and usually well ahead actual changes the stock this conceptually different 
from what most academics call the stock effect the flow effect that not say 
that the traditional views the stock effect and flow effect aren useful believe 
that the stock bonds available private investors matters prices yields but more 
ante basis than post basis and believe that the flow effect also 
matters bond market prices yields but less noticeable because occurs slowly 
over time and usually ahead supply events auction concessions 
today context the increasing probabilities investors have placed larger stock 
treasury securities available private investors and beyond pushed yields 
treasury notes and bonds higher what exactly the price today for higher 
deficits can provide confident answer other than say higher deficits than were 
the price month ago the market price today represents the average all future 
deficit scenarios which investors place non zero probabilities simply don know 
all the scenarios that investors are considering today and certainly don know the 
probabilities investors assign those scenarios 
know from context that over recent weeks investors either placed higher 
probabilities deficits than before adjusted higher their deficit projections both 
but suggest knew the degree which those probabilities rose which deficit 
projections they rose would intellectually dishonest the forward looking nature 
government bond markets vis vis expected changes the future stock bonds also 
makes creating model practically impossible given the difficulty controlling for the 
other exogenous shocks that move bond yields around time inconsistent basis 
nevertheless this publication have described three outcomes for the deficit and 
assigned subjective probabilities those this section calculate the amount 
treasury issuance would associate with each outcome then combine the two 
and calculate probability weighted amount treasury issuance the level 
yields needed clear the supply will depend how the economy evolves response 
the deficits and how the fed responds the economy 
see three potential outcomes for the deficit and hence treasury supply 
base case modest deficit boost chance 
bear case legislative failure 
bull case substantial deficit boost 
exhibit and exhibit show our base bear and bull cases for treasury coupon 
issuance both par and equivalent terms matching those issuance 
projections with our subjective scenario probabilities gives the following 
base case ust notional equivalent chance 
bear case ust notional equivalent chance 
bull case ust notional equivalent chance 
exhibit coupon treasury net issuance projections

note values for notional equivalents are larger than actual net issuance figures from the 
chart the left this because net issuance gross issuance redemptions but 
redemptions carry close zero 
thus expect our deficit scenario probability weighted increase ust notional 
equivalent supply relative the amount supply the market 
absorbed expected year end the increase supply 
given the rise yields experienced already late and ahead the 
fed september announcement balance sheet normalization and speculation tax 
reform would guess that modest increase ust notional equivalent 
supply and large mostly the price 
say mostly because again don know all the scenarios that investors are 
considering today and certainly don know the probabilities investors assign 
those scenarios also don know exactly where yields would fiscal deficit 
expansion was not the table for the coming years don know exactly how 
investors will multiply the effects additional deficits the economy and how 
investors will expect the fed react 
also don know how investors will present value the higher deficits relative 
whatever current base line investors had before the years beyond investors 
should less willing sell bonds today prepare for issuance given 
the expense associated with maintaining those shorts addition fed policy tightens 
more quickly response stronger economy investors should expect term 
premiums fall the fed combats the prospects for higher inflation making 
investors less willing play for supply induced upside yields the out years 
legislative failure 
the case legislative failure treasury coupon issuance unlikely increase 
the increase funding needs result fed balance sheet unwind would 
mostly offset lower redemptions privately held usts 
relative the difference would likely met through increase net bill 
issuance 
bill issuance would also required bring the treasury operating cash balance 
back and meet expected additional disaster relief funds all 
all expect increase net bill issuance that scenario 
the case legislative failure would expect treasury yields decline from 
recent trading levels the and would suggest that investors get 
long duration the rally

increase the deficit the range accounts for the fact that the deficit impact 
might front loaded the figure also includes additional federal 
disaster relief funds 
after accounting for lower redemptions fed balance sheet unwind and the needed 
increase the treasury cash balance expect net increase bill 
issuance and total increase coupon auction sizes that would 
translate total net coupon supply compared 
exhibit illustrates 
however since almost half the increase net supply result lower redemptions 
the adjusted increase net supply for only higher than that 
for shown exhibit given that the treasury has typically increased auction 
sizes short tenors more than longer tenors when necessary expect most 
the increased supply come and specifically expect month 
increase auction size for and starting february and increase for 
and exhibit 
our projected increase coupon and bill issuance the base scenario would increase 
the share bills percentage total outstanding debt from the current 
the end this compares average ratio during the years prior 
the financial crisis the increase roughly line with tbac projections 
from the august presentation the treasury

substantial deficit boost 
for the bull case which fiscal stimulus from tax reform reaches gdp 
forecast increase the deficit this figure incorporates both the additional 
disaster relief funding but also increase defense spending 
meet that funding need the treasury would likely have issue net tbills during addition gross coupon issuance increase the net 
coupon issuance increase would translate increase supply the 
market relative shown exhibit 
note how our forecast increase gross coupon issuance this scenario only 
higher than the forecast increase issuance the base case scenario despite 
difference the deficit forecast for each scenario the reason that expect the bull 
case require further increase bill supply that would allow less abrupt 
increase auction sizes above the values show exhibit 
our bull case the increase coupon ust auction sizes the range 
which around the tbac projections for increase coupon auction sizes 
sudden increase issuance above that ratio might not desirable for the 
treasury could push its financing costs higher hence our projections for higher tbill issuance the bull case 
the case substantial deficit boost would expect treasury yields rise 
new ytd highs above the but would suggest that investors get long

textbook analysis suggests tax reform leads usd appreciation textbook analysis 
suggests that fiscal expansion all else equal should lead currency appreciation rising 
demand for capital puts upward pressure bond yields and higher capacity utilization 
leads higher growth turn leading tighter monetary conditions and currency 
appreciation therefore seems plausible that usd should correlated with news 
flow related the anticipated tax reform package and the implied deficits therein 
but history tells more mixed story history shows that usd has reacted very 
differently fiscal expansions when president reagan first tax reform kicked off 
usd broke higher supported rising interest rate differentials however the 
second tax reform passed saw usd stay offered the tax cuts and deficitboosting policies provided president george bush also saw usd under continued 
selling pressure 
exhibit the evolution dxy and fiscal expansions 
relative global returns are what counts here usd the main 
funding currency suggesting that usd funding costs relative 
returns investment abroad will disproportionately impact usd 
demand tax reform increases capital costs but changes the 
cost capital need contextualized the relative returns 
for investors outside the 
fiscal expansion gdp excl recession periods

dxy index 
when row relative returns are high rise capital costs may 
slow down usd funded inflows into the row but this only 
comes standstill once the marginal funding cost 
risk adjusted basis equals the marginal row return thus when 
row investment returns are low may not take major rise 
rates for usd break higher capital flows back the 
strong growth and low capacity reserves boost row returns when president reagan 
launched his first tax reform there were substantial global capacity reserves 
which depressed row investment returns additionally the economy faced 
significant global tailwinds eliminating the self financing effect the tax reform the 
federal budget deficit more than doubled from increasing capital 
demand while capital demand outside the remained weak this why usd rallied 
yields rose while row yields remained offered this kept demand for usd funded 
investment abroad low which turned usd from liability into asset currency the 
tax reform came when the global economy was strong allowing the tax reform 
self finance and the deficit fall from the same time the 
row demand for international capital was also rising this environment usd came 
under selling pressure the state the row that matters for usd

our analysis increasingly justified and important 
exhibit synchronized global growth

tax reform comes time when the global economy has 
entered into synchronized expansion eating global capacity 
reserves rising investment spending should drive capital costs 
but likely boost returns investment requires financing and for 
this has often been generated via usd long the global 
growth outlook including remains strong and synchronized 
usd should remain weak with the tax reform only providing 
temporary bounce against the backdrop the fundamental usd 
downward trend result expect usd only see 
temporary support from these seemingly usd bullish tax reforms 
scenarios viewing them selling opportunities

what would the short term reaction different tax 
reform scenarios the directionality our expectations for dxy are based how 
would expect interest rate differentials perform more aggressive deficit and fiscal 
expansion should lead higher rates and dxy while tax reform would disappoint 
markets the tune lower rates and weaker dollar 
however our bias towards usd downside this because more aggressive tax 
reform process which likely put upward pressure rates would also support 
global risk sentiment turn leading usd funded investments abroad conversely 
tax reform results greater certainty and confidence that policy changes washington 
are unlikely and the environment strong growth policy certainty favors external 
investment using our scenario weights and point estimate ranges for dxy view the 
most likely tax reform outcome for dxy modest decline

the base case modest stimulus should lead rally dxy but this should 
fade this part because passage has been largely priced but also because the 
actual impact the outlook would fairly muted the deficit expansion 
should result only increase gdp which view largely line with 
the consensus impact but also unlikely move the needle against the backdrop our 
broader framework 
passage would likely lead decline dxy due disappointment but also 
bolstered external investment beyond the pricing out fiscal stimulus lack 
progress tax reform would concretize expectations for gridlock and limited policy 
action from washington limited policy uncertainty washington coupled with ample 
liquidity would result investment abroad supporting usd selling result see 
usd likely sell off more than what one would expect based purely interest 
rate differential analysis 
the bull case would lead rise dxy initially but this would likely fade 
more aggressive than expected stimulus would find reaction higher bond yields 
however believe that the initial usd rally would blunted and subsequently 
reverse this because more aggressive than expected tax reform proposal and deficit 
would lead rising global risk sentiment turn leading more usd funded carry 
trades abroad this end see that the positive impact reflected rates selling 
off would not translate into stronger usd would implied interest rate 
differentials
