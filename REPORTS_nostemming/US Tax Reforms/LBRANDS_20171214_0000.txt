should provide the answer the key debate are the issues seen 
victoria secret over the last months the result self inflicted strategic 
changes structural industry pressures while believe strategic changes 
victoria secret implemented early have driven negative comp sales and 
earnings pressure the market believes weak fundamentals have 
been driven structural pressures the industry declining mall traffic 
ecommerce disintermediation market share loss channel shift and falling 
margins 
recent results support our turnaround thesis while the turnaround taking 
longer than the market expected recent results support our thesis that 
the business finally the road positive comps and improving margins 
notably the underlying year victoria secret comp swim and apparel 
returned positive territory october after nine months flat negative 
results exhibit and the year underlying victoria secret comp swim and 
apparel has been gradually improving since june exhibit november faced 
slowdown given the most difficult comparison the year however 
was the last difficult compare before the brand begins cycle negative sss 
additionally november was the first month all year that the merchandise 
margin was significantly bps another guide post the turnaround 
track 
alphawise survey work also suggests the victoria secret brand remains 
healthy bears also argue victoria secret sexy supermodel brand image 
losing traction with new generation millennial women who prefer more 
natural and realistic advertising but our survey work suggests otherwise each 
year conduct apparel survey and ask respondents indicate they feel 
each brand the way the way down arrive proxy for net

the stock has rallied over the past six weeks yet investor sentiment 
remains very bearish improved october and november comp results well 
industry data points strong november cold weather tax reform progress have 
driven the stock higher since november ytd the stock still down 
top decline however while have seen some small long only 
buying our trading desk hedge fund sentiment remains extremely negative 
and most long onlies speak are still hesitant get involved nevertheless 
recent results suggest management strategies are delivering the intended 
results including attracting younger consumers into the brand reducing 
promotional activity and growing market share within sport while prefer 
keep our base case eps forecast appropriately conservative and the 
range where management likely guides see equal likelihood our bull 
case forecast playing out thus are raising our price target from 
reflecting the midpoint our base case eps and 
bull case eps remain confident the company long term 
competitive position attractive categories with strong brands and committed 
annual regular dividend yield 
estimate eps our base case forecast implying eps 
growth week given management historically conservative 
guidance pattern prefer keep our eps estimate the range where 
think management could guide eps our base case forecast 
assumes comp bbw and total revenue growth given 
the anniversarying the week the week forecast 
bps gross margin recovery top bps and bps decline 
assume slight buying and occupancy deleverage comp given store 
remodels and net square footage growth offset bps 
merchandise margin expansion which could prove conservative given bps 
two year cumulative decline forecast dollars bps 
deleverage likely growth driven china 
investments increases marketing primary targeted direct mail and store 
selling costs taken together model just bps increase total company 
ebit margin assuming bps increase north america ebit 
margin bbw ebit margin bps roughly line with the two year average 
run rate and international ebit dollars profit this 
year which again could prove conservative also assume tax rate 
bps above but line with where management initially guided the 
year all this yields our base case eps eps growth 
week even this could above where management conservatively 
guides given volatility and inconsistency over the past months historically 
management has guided next year eps within band 
typically cent range thus depending where final eps shakes out 
think management could guide eps even 
consensus 
victoria secret north america one key driver our bull case victoria 
secret north america ebit margin likely ends bps below 
estimate roughly bps this decline was driven lower merchandise 
margin clearing through swim apparel and rebalancing intimate apparel 
inventory bralette pressure beauty and additional promotional 
activity attribute the remaining bps decline buying and 
occupancy deleverage our base case assume just bps ebit 
margin recovery but our bull case could recover nearly double 
that amount driven bps merchandise margin recovery and bps 
leverage comp likely takes more than two years fully recover 
bps ebit margin decline but bps recovery next year possible 
victoria secret can deliver consistent comps lower promotions 
while china the other the second upside opportunity not contemplated 
our base case model the china operating loss with forecasted see the 
deepest international loss estimate china will lose this year the 
entirety this year international ebit dollar decline plus additional 
due pre opening rent and infrastructure investments our bull case 
china should generate revenue the end and this year 
operating loss could improve loss this alone 
provides pre tax profit boost most which 
not contemplated our base case model exhibit 
bull case eps times our maintained multiple stock 
upside from here embedding the above two factors into our bull case 
model yields eps growth week 
recovering bps likely bps ebit margin decline our bull case 
forecast comp bbw revenue growth 
week reversal and gross margin bps bps 
decline assume flat buying and occupancy rate comp given store 
remodels and net square footage growth and bps merchandise margin 
expansion driven almost entirely although also note bbw could 
recover some decline forecast dollars 
bps leverage together this yields bps ebit margin 
recovery assuming bps increase north america ebit margin 
bbw ebit margin flat and international ebit profit 
also assume tax rate line with all this yields our bull case 
eps assign bull case multiple line with where the stock traded 
when and bbw were delivering consistent msd comps exhibit 
return consistent positive comps should give investors confidence the 
brand better protected from industry headwinds and drive the multiple back 
global brand territory 
corporate tax reform passes our base case estimate could move 
higher could one the largest beneficiaries corporate tax reform 
our space given tax rate and interest expense below both 
ebit and ebitda while are not embedding federal tax rate our 
numbers until legislation officially passed assumed tax rate 
federal rate plus state and local taxes our eps estimate would rise 
while there likely some tax reform upside already priced into 
the stock believe less baked than other stocks our coverage given 
genuine fundamental improvement over the past few months further unlike 
other companies who have cited share buybacks possible use excess tax 
reform cash would likely pay special dividend february 
guaranteed return for shareholders note all references tax reform within this
