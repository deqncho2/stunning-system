policy tools which could act the same capacity section and benefit the steel

what the range outcomes since initiating the investigation the doc has provided 
limited guidance what its determination could include leaving uncertainty over which 
products and countries may impacted below outline some possibilities 
our base case calls for determination that limited scope targeting only select 
countries but effective enough further curtail imports based comments from 
inside trade the department defense seems oppose strict section 
determination because could aggravate relations with allied nations media reports 
suggest countries such australia mexico canada the united kingdom japan and 
south korea may exempt from any trade restrictions applied result section 
such outcome would nevertheless raise steel import costs from several 
emerging market countries and provide additional support for steel prices along with 
targeting select countries the doc may also target select steel products targeting 
some with tariffs quotas both 
our bull case though unlikely calls for all inclusive determination impacting 
imports all steel products from all importing nations the best case scenario the 
doc section determination all inclusive its recommendations would farreaching subjecting nearly all steel imports from all nations tariffs and quotas 
the most strict determination the tariffs and quotas might even applied retroactively 
april when the doc initiated its investigation the tariffs could high 
our bear case results direct tariffs quotas but more anti circumvention and 
self initiated trade cases the bear case scenario either the doc does not recommend 
any tariffs quotas its section determination the president chooses not act 
the report instead the doc expands its use other trade policy tools like anticircumvention combat directed trade flows and self initiated trade cases 
target specific products from certain countries these alternative trade remedies can 
achieve some the same goals section and continue foster steel trade 
environment that remains accommodative for pricing while non implementation 
strict section measures may dampen sentiment other trade measures are viable 
alternatives section particularly with strong steel market conditions china
