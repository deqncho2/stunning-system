preliminary discussions with companies our coverage highlighted some 
provisions that could have limited the benefit from tax reform but these 
provisions look have been removed the reconciled bill clear there

report 
limited visibility the myriad mechanics under the hood and our analysis 
make assumptions attempt simplify the various dynamics involved 
early discussions with companies our coverage following our december 
analysis indicated that there were two dynamics our analysis failed take into 
account which could have limited the benefit from tax reform efforts limit 
the effects transfer pricing and rules that attempt limit the leverage 
debt assigned subsidiaries multinational corporations for interest 
deductibility purposes these the latter seems have been removed the 
reconciled bill further additional item that involves higher tax rates 
dividends from inverted companies would only apply prospective basis 
medtronic the only inverted company our coverage would not affected 
the individual mandate repeal included the reconciled bill but are not 
concerned this will have impact device utilization have discussed 
repeatedly and medtech medtech relatively insulated from the 
effects aca most device intensive procedures are being performed older 
populations that are likely have insurance regardless aca fact our 
analysis attributes minimal benefit from reform over the past few years see 
multiple intrinsic factors that have driven device acceleration over the last 
several years mitigating price improving approval cadence economic recovery 
easing mco utilization pressures greater acuity emerging markets etc which 
together have resulted improved organic sales and earnings growth rates 
across the space 
the device tax separate issue congress seeking extend the repeal 
the device tax years reminder the device tax excise tax 
eligible device sales part aca that was delayed the beginning 
and absent any legislation set take effect january last week 
forbes article indicated that new legislation from the house separate from tax 
reform was looking extend the repeal the device tax years have 
maintained our confidence another extension permanent repeal the 
device tax per our diligence with industry leaders and our models currently 
not include reinstatement the device tax previously estimated that the 
device tax implemented would have had average eps impact 
across range our coverage see our december note 
will keep eye additional updates and commentary surrounding tax 
reform now that the reconciled bill has been released believe unlikely 
there will material changes but the rushed legislation process could lead 
some surprises companies and investors continue read through the fine 
print the legislation acknowledge that addition limited visibility 
around the intricacies the tax code our analysis heavily dependent our 
assumptions and methodology which may not adequately reflect all the moving 
parts involved currently not embed any upside from tax reform our 
models for and will continue monitor the situation and update our 
analysis receive incremental color and commentary
