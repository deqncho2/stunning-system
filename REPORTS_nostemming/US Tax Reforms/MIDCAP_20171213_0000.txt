lower corporate tax rate drives upside bank eps

sell side analysts sometimes many times have make assessments and 
estimates what might happen based incomplete information the impact 
potential tax reform the midcap banks one those times 
the move reform the individual and corporate tax system progressing with both 
the house and senate passing their own versions tax reform bills however there are 
still several outstanding issues that need addressed reconciliation including the 
corporate alternative minimum tax currently which the senate retained 
secure passage its bill but the house did not include and the deductibility state 
and local taxes these issues and others are likely addressed the coming weeks 
with many congress indicating that they think final bill can delivered the 
president for signing into law before year end 
based this progress are now assuming that some measure tax reform will 
happen irrespective happens the end early and are 
comfortable enough build tax reform into our base case eps estimates

raising our eps estimates 
are raising our eps estimates average with the vast majority 
that coming from tax reform our estimates assume that congress agrees some form 
tax reform the coming weeks including corporate tax rate with 
implementation date the beginning also assume the corporate 
alternative minimum tax either eliminated reduced well below the current 
rate the tax rate were instead our eps estimates would closer 
rather than and were the eps benefit would closer our 
eps estimates are just average for the group the positive impact 
marking our eps estimates market for the higher fed funds futures curve bps 
higher year end fully offset the early adoption lack 
fdic assessment deductibility emphasize again that there remain many 
uncertainties the ongoing tax reform process 
what are the potential offsets lower tax rate 
calculating the potential eps impact from lower statutory tax rate relatively easy 
feel free request our tax reform analysis spreadsheet form assessing the 
secondary impacts lower corporate tax however little more challenging 
see four primary offsets that could mitigate some the potential upside tax reform 
lower net interest margins competition erodes after tax product returns many 
banks price their products based after tax return with lower tax rate those 
returns increase which could spur loan pricing competition the return capital 
hurdle but the bank now gets due tax reform may choose 
reduce loan yields undercut competition and still earn above return 
assume this happens part our base case scenario which driving modest 
bps nim compression versus our prior estimates 
rising operating expenses several banks including key mentioned investing some 
the potential tax savings back into the business drive incremental loan fee 
income growth others have indicated that the vast majority would likely fall the 
bottom line perhaps both statements are true believe banks would choose 
invest least portion their newfound net income back into the business with 
higher operating expenses being the primary offset tax reform gains 
non deductibility fdic assessments appears likely our view that banks 
over bil assets will not able deduct their fdic assessments for tax 
purposes beginning based the current bills banks with assets between 
and bil will allowed deduct declining percentage their fdic 
assessments deductible bil but bil overall the annual 
eps impact relatively small just for our coverage universe with most 
the banks cover below the bil asset threshold 
write off deferred tax assets the statutory tax rate declines from 
the value bank deferred tax assets would decline the proportionate change 
the tax rate for example bank with mil dta equal tax 
mil earnings would need write off mil mil which 
mil the anticipated tax benefit using lower tax rate reduced net deferred 
tax liability position would result gain consider this one time writeoff gain below the line item our models happening

what matters potentially more our view how well those banks with the higher 
deposit betas have been able offset their higher deposit costs with higher loan 
yields exhibit broadly speaking the wider the gap between the deposit beta and 
loan yield the more disadvantaged the bank was during rate basis both 
ozrk and asb have very high betas but have largely offset that with higher loan yields 
with deposit costs and bps and loan yields and bps respectively for 
positive core loan spread ozrk for example has seen bps increase its core loan

overall expect deposit costs continue move higher although not 
necessarily line with the path rate hikes this point expect deposit costs 
increase more gradually and consistently both commercial and consumer clients 
demand more yield from their banks given the prior rate hikes for example

bucking the trend 
expect roughly quarterly loan growth 
this last year was bit disappointment for industrywide loan growth for the banks 
wasn bad necessarily but loan growth was definitely slower than expected with 
total loan growth and trailing prior year growth closer 
the midcap banks however performed noticeably better than the industry overall 
with loan growth shown exhibit roughly sequential growth 
per quarter below the prior three year average why weak part can 
likely attributed some way political and economic uncertainty including 
regulation and taxes although other factors included borrowers paying down debt 
tapping the capital markets alternative bank loans 
compare small bank lending that the largest top banks mostly larger 
than our coverage universe the smaller banks have meaningfully outperformed 
they are less affected large scale and more attractive credit spreads the 
capital markets that act competition for bank lending essence core middle market 
and consumer lending performing reasonably well 
heading into recognize that are taking perhaps overly cautious view 
our loan growth expectations although this has only negligible impact our 
valuation expectations for the stocks expect average quarterly loan growth 
roughly broadly line with the last few quarters primarily due greater clarity

there very real possibility that capital return the banks could higher than 
expected given the bipartisan agreement lift the sifi threshold positive for banks

looking forward the fasb issued the final current expected credit loss cecl standard 
mid cecl changes how banks will reserve for credit losses the new standard 
requires forward looking expected loss approach instead the incurred loss 
approach used today implying significantly higher provision expense loans are 
added but less bank progress through the credit cycle theory the effective date 
the asu with early adoption allowed beginning this shouldn 
issue for the banks but expect increased discussion around this issue 
the year progresses the initial impact the banks will cumulative adjustment 
retained earnings thus adoption the new standard will not impact bank income 
statement the initial period 
the outlook for increased bank improving 
the outlook for larger bank improving our view the biggest driver our 
more positive view the recent bipartisan bill that was passed the senate 
banking committee margin that would essentially ease regulations 
the smaller banks those with less than bil assets raising the threshold for 
what considered systematically important financial institution sifi 
think the most likely outcome that bill should eventually enacted into law 
that the larger regional banks could have more flexibility around their 
decisions and the impact might have their capital positions specifically the stress 
tests one the more common concerns among sifi banks that have completed 
acquisitions the last few years has been that they were penalized the ccar 
submission for incomplete year data sets the acquired bank which reduced their 
ability return capital shareholders this would largely apply banks between 
bil assets 
also expect increase smaller bank acquisitions particularly those with 
bil assets under the current regime bil bank acquired bil bank would 
become sifi received approval from regulators case point new york 
community with bil assets announced its failed acquisition astoria financial 
october the deal was pending regulatory approval for roughly months before 
the acquisition was called off with lack regulatory approval create new sifi 
being the primary headwind with increase the sifi threshold bil 
believe deals like the nycb deal would have had easier time being approved 
merger activity happening just mostly among the smaller 
banks

reasons that support potential increase bank 
after years minimal among the larger banks and downward pressure 
profitability believe bank consolidation could accelerate see six key reasons why 
activity could increase 
less fear regulation are already seeing signs less regulatory burden 
including increase the asset threshold that would trigger extensive 
regulatory review the fed bil well the recent bill passed the 
senate banking committee increase the sifi threshold bil this could 
give bank managements more confidence and clarity when seeking combinations 
psychology higher valuations given higher valuations bank managements may 
now feel they are selling the bank for appropriate price even the core 
economics the deal are unchanged given increase the buyer stock price 
well 
interest rates rising interest rates will positive for asset sensitive banks but 
many others could benefit far less due their funding loan profiles these 
banks will need acquire core deposits improve profitability may consider 
selling 
reduce expenses bank allows banks cut meaningful amount 
expenses from the combined entity particularly back office and 
branches personnel our prior work suggests that most buyers expect remove 
seller expense base acquisition although some can reach 
opportunities for revenue growth revenue opportunities exist banks get 
access new products and markets this can come from access faster growing 
markets and improved product set capabilities with which cross sell 
the combined customer base 
allows rapid return capital while banks may now have more flexibility 
return capital still provides ability immediately utilize bank excess 
capital driving sharply higher eps through less stock issuance and improved
