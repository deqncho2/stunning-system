device tax repeal delayed 
dead 
recent meetings with industry participants and advocates 
suggest medical device tax repeal another moratorium 
will put into place but there are risks timing slips later into 
the risk reward bit asymmetric consensus assumes 
repeal but absolute risk remains low our view 
continue expect device tax repeal extension moratorium 
reminder the device tax excise tax eligible device sales part 
aca two year moratorium went into effect ending the start 
and the first installment the reinstated tax due the end january our 
outlook maintained our confidence permanent repeal least 
extension the moratorium our models currently not reflect 
reinstatement the tax and while company specific exposure has shifted 
somewhat over the last two years recent diligence suggests that still has 
nominal eps impact median across our companies 
eps basis reinstated this year exhibit shows the potential impact across our 
coverage 
congress and advamed are working for near term resolution these efforts 
include incorporating device tax delay into short term government funding 
bill and stand alone bill aimed repealing the tax short term 
government funding bill needed this week avoid government shutdown 
and gop leaders may include delay the medical device tax the bill the 
latest effort repeal the tax from bill repeal the medical device 
excise tax and for other purposes this bill was filed sen markey dmass but its important note that the repeal the medtech excise tax has 
seen broad support from both sides the aisle this includes 
sponsored rep erik paulsen minn aiming extend the suspension the 
tax additionally advamed the medical device trade association sent letter 
president trump asking for relief including waiving deposit requirements until 
the device tax repeal can addressed are still expecting near term 
resolution but there risk that slips later into 
the medical device tax repeal was one five key topics identified our 
outlook the others were the amazon threat capex and utilization 
environment iii international price cuts and tax reform overall see 
concerns amazon international price cuts and medtech tax more fiction 
than fact amazon disruption more likely felt distribution price cuts 
should have minimal impact growth and the device tax should repealed 
least delayed further utilization and capex see stable not 
improving environment and initial performance has been better than
