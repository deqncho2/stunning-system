expect companies with higher tax rates realize greater benefit 
follow our recent tax analysis for our services coverage are outlining 
our expectations for magnitude impact from tax reform impact our vertical 
software coverage universe our estimates are based understanding that 
corporate tax rates will fall interest deduction will limited 
ebitda through permanently reinvested foreign earnings will face 
one time tax for cash and non cash and transfer pricing will 
penalized through base erosion anti abuse tax beat information have 
work with meaningfully limited public filings and commentary with 
estimates expected change upon additional disclosure however believe 
the magnitude change are estimating the right ballpark while many 
stocks cover carry low effective tax rate none all several 
companies report non gaap numbers fully taxed basis rate higher 
than their effective gaap tax rate most our vertical software coverage 
evaluated adjusted basis focused the impact non gaap numbers 
estimate that mdso elli and cdk will see the greatest benefit nongaap eps estimates exhibit within our coverage 
morgan stanley does and seeks business with

source company data morgan stanley research notes companies currently have artificially inflated non gaap tax rates the 
profitability sabr business meaningfully different than the rest the company represents estimate percentage profit 
the beat impact may offset portion benefit from lower corporate taxes gddy largely insulated due structure expecting 
minimal impact canadian companies 
complexity operations sabr tvpt and eigi will require additional 
disclosure sabr could face number offsets benefits from lower 
corporate tax rate including potential transfer pricing headwinds and interest 
rate deductibility limits while tvpt generates approximately revenue 
within the believe the segment could operating near break even 
negating any potential benefit from change tax rate here too must 
wait see the company will impacted transfer pricing interest 
deductibility issues which are difficult evaluate with publicly available data 
eigi remains unprofitable with high levels nols expect little impact the 
near term but the company relatively high debt levels may impact future 
periods 
expect structure shield gddy from benefits prior heg gddy 
billed most international business out the leaving little cash and earnings 
trapped overseas while this arrangement would normally translate into benefits 
due lower corporate tax rates gddy has corporate structure 
with different than many its peers such many the benefits 
potential headwinds tax reform should concentrated the partner level 
insulating gddy from much the noise expect the company will benefit 
but believe the magnitude benefit will relatively low 
valuation methodology matters although are focusing the impact tax 
reform non gaap earnings believe differences valuation methodology 
will lead different outcomes for stocks across our coverage noted above 
several companies report their non gaap numbers with full inflated tax 
rates and may need wait for guidance regarding any adjustments these 
companies may make reporting methodology expect rates will move 
lower additionally several companies carry leverage ratios net 
debt ebitda greater these cases believe investors are more focused 
ebitda for valuation impact non gaap eps likely matters less that 
said also maintain dcf models for most our companies and anticipate 
lower tax rate will have positive implications for these models 
companies within our coverage universe may not have the ability repatriate 
great deal cash but unlike large cap mutinational companies believe 
most the companies within our coverage universe will not able take 
advantage repatriation increase share repurchases meaningful 
way however certain attributes vertical software companies can make them 
attractive targets for larger vendors the extent that consolidators within the 
industry become more acquisitive the back tax reform may see better 
support for multiples across our coverage
