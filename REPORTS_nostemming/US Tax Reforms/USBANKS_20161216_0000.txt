banks 
doing our taxes early 
the question been getting ahead the holidays what the impact 
lower taxes banks this note dig into different scenarios taxes and 
delve into who best and least positioned key offset the elimination 
interest deductibility which hurts borrowers and raises bank provisions risk the 
street not baking banks still benefit net basis 
scenarios matter while know tax rates are going down don know 
how much and what the offsets will different banks benefit depending 
how low tax rates and whether tax exemptions tax credits remain run 
number scenarios our note 
biggest risk interest expense becomes non deductible our view the street 
not factoring this order lower the corporate tax rate congress has 
broaden the base taxable income interest deduction one the biggest pay 
fors eliminating interest deductibility does not impact bank tax rates but 
expect will lower eps through higher provisions lower interest deductibility 
can pressure levered corporate and cre investor cash flows driving provisions 
and loan growth down 
net basis banks still benefit even taking into consideration the higher 
provisions and lower loan growth that would come with elimination the 
interest tax shield median bank earnings rise 
best least positioned consumer models win any scenario syf dfs and cof 
have very little tax exemptions tax credits and consumers already are not 
allowed deduct this interest expense from their taxable income the flip 
side certain banks with large and cre exposure such snv bpop and 
zion could negatively impacted interest deductibility eliminated 
want see the eps impact using your own tax assumptions ask for our 
model 
have attractive view large cap banks expect rising growth increasing 
buybacks lower taxes less regulation and laser focused expense management 
should drive positive eps revisions stock valuations are back pre crisis 
multiples higher quality earnings but tax rate and elimination 
corporate interest deduction push that multiple back down our 
eps expect the stocks pull back bit early rates stabilize 
and congress debates which tax breaks eliminate order lower corporate 
and personal tax rates and what infrastructure proposals run with but 
would use those pullbacks add exposures given higher probability for 
bull case outcome top picks are dfs syf cof bac 
have cautious view midcap banks while the fundamental backdrop 
positive overall particularly rates valuations remain stretched including both 
tax rate and the elimination the corporate interest deduction the midcap 
banks are still trading our eps key remains one the most 
attractively valued banks under these scenarios and remain positive our

house gop tax reform blueprint 
but why are banks affected interest deductibility goes away 
reducing interest deductibility hurts bank borrowers their cash flows decline 
commercial real estate values fall this drives bank provisions reducing the benefit 
lower corporate tax rate 
impacts are twofold 
lower commercial real estate valuations and corporate after tax profits would 
drive loan losses the medium term 
corporate deleveraging would reduce loan growth the longer run 
our cre research colleagues note cre inherently levered asset class and any 
reduction interest deductibility would drive decline cre prices investors would 
require lower purchase price offset the foregone interest deduction order 
produce the same after tax levered return banks would need mark down cre 
valuations through their provisions saw this and following 
periods cre valuation declines similarly reduction interest 
deductibility would negative for other highly levered corporates particularly those 
that would not benefit from lower taxes given their limited profitability 
what the earnings impact interest deductibility eliminated 
corporate interest deductibility were eliminated estimate the eps hit our 
covered banks would roughly this consists both the negative impact from 
increase commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge offs and the lower 
net interest income from less commercial and commercial real estate loan growth 
from credit standpoint start with our cmbs and reits colleague richard hill 
base assumption that cre property prices decline roughly where the negative 
valuation impact has already been partly mitigated the lower corporate tax rate 
exhibit assume cre property prices down corporate tax rate falls and interest deductibility removed per our colleague

calculate credit losses our models assume and cre ncos increase 
multiple our prior nco estimates for assume ncos increase 
while for cre assume ncos triple the rationale for lower ncos relative cre 
that commercial business borrowers get the benefit lower corporate tax rate 
which offsets some the impact less interest deductibility bank portfolios however 
are skewed high yield borrowers which have less profits benefit from the lower 
corporate taxes this shown below where our credit strategy team estimated the 
combined impact corporate earnings from lower interest deductibility and lower 
taxes the losses related cre borrowers are driven largely the lower collateral 
values the underlying properties also bake reserve build the higher 
credit losses 
exhibit bank portfolios are skewed high yield borrowers which have less profits benefit from lower taxes per our credit analyst

shown impact loss interest deductibility net against benefit from lower statutory tax rate net income before minority interest 
note assume that the tax value the interest deduction the current statutory tax rate multiplied the company gross interest expense and subsequently apply proportional reduction the corporate statutory 
rate the current tax expense plus the tax value the interest deduction are assuming that the entirety tax expense would benefit from reduction the statutory rates which could overstate the benefit from lower 
rates the degree that taxes paid are non 
core our analysis the belief that banks aggregate are better underwriters now 
than they were prior the financial crisis having considerably tightened underwriting 
standards relative and should thus experience lower credit losses and there 
wide gap underwriting ability among the banks shown exhibit the 
difference credit loss experience substantial nycb for example has charged off 
average just bps annually over the last years its entire loan portfolio which 
includes the financial crisis period this bps less than the midcap bank average 
our credit loss analysis take each bank underwriting history into account implying 
the better underwriters should experience less losses than those with weaker track 
records 
the eps impact from lower loan growth tends considerably smaller than the 
impact credit losses assume the loss interest deductibility reduces commercial 
loan growth resulting average reduction eps calculate 
losses our models apply net interest margin the lower commercial loan 
balances both and cre make slight adjustment for lower operating costs 
less variable commission paid for example and lower reserves the forgone loan 
balances then tax effect the result arrive the reduction our eps 
combine the impacts higher credit costs and slower loan growth exhibit
