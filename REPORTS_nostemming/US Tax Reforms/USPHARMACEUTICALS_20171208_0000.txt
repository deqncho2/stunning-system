see both positive and negative factors impacting pharma companies from 
the tax bill proposals positive factors our view include potentially lower 
corporate tax rate possible one time repatriation tax rates 
proposed lower tax rate based with foreign income indefinite life 
nol carryforwards and immediate expensing capital expenditures negative 
factors include base erosion prevention features such global minimum tax 
interest deduction caps inbound excise taxes and uncertainty around 
corporate alternative minimum tax amt some these features are only 
present either the senator house version and await final provisions 
following the conference process

corporate amt would negative for tax credits the biggest 
surprise from the latest senate bill the retention the corporate 
alternative minimum tax amt instead eliminating the 
house bill does with corporate amt the negative consequence pharma 
that tax credits would longer apply but some observers expect 
modification preserve tax credits

not disclosed companies but among our coverage agn recently 
commented that intercompany debt and interest deduction limits could 
one the major variables that may negatively impact its tax rate 
generally speaking new interest deduction limits tied ebit and 
consolidate leverage ratio would hit more highly levered companies and 
companies with higher intercompany debts for the interest expense 
limit the senate proposal calls for maximum ebit the 
house ebitda for the leverage threshold the house bill sets 
the company consolidated debt ebitda leverage ratio 
while the senate bill ties debt equity ratio 
pharma companies with low pretax profits relative revenue and high 
interest expense are potentially more exposed higher tax burden 
directionally believe that companies with disproportionately high sales 
pretax profits could more risk higher tax burden from proposed 
mechanism limit base erosion the house and senate bills few screening 
criteria that look are company ratio sales and ratio 
pre tax profit currently domiciled companies may achieve high 
sales profit ratio through transfer pricing while foreign multinationals and 
inverted companies achieve through transfer pricing and intercompany 
leverage

abbv communicated dec follows need see the specifics 
what comes out the house senate conference process before can comment the 
specific impact but are encouraged the prospects tax reform given the potential 
for lowering the overall rate and the ability repatriate cash more efficiently based 
everything seen far believe have the ability adapt necessary 
optimize our tax profile with appropriate tax structure 
bmy communicated dec follows are waiting see what the final 
bill that passes both houses looks like before commenting 
mrk communicated dec follows expect there conference 
reconcile the differences between the two bills can say for sure until that process 
complete however both the house and senate bills make based companies more 
competitive moving the territorial system allowing repatriate foreign 
earnings reasonable rates and lowering the corporate tax rate 
pfe based our conversation with and assuming the senate bill provisions pfizer 
currently expects non gaap tax rate percentage points below the statutory tax 
rate the statutory tax rate then non gaap tax rate could 
the statutory tax rate then non gaap tax rate could pfizer views 
the excise tax the house bill significantly negative item for pharma and 
considers big positive the excise tax does not make the final tax proposal 
specialty pharma 
agn quotes from investor conference dec and the senate bill think there 
probably one the big variables that will ultimately impact our tax rate how ultimately 
the treatment intercompany debt and interest comes out and again these are drafts 
still don know what the ultimate impact and then there other proposal there the 
treatment dividends for inverted companies that obviously wouldn impact our tax rate 
but would impact shareholders with respect the tax rate just given what see 
today again bear mind that our tax structure not static and have flexibility and 
ability take measures manage through some the proposals but with the bill kind 
could potentially see impact couple hundred basis points but that 
could also see over time being able continue reduce that thereafter 
alks communicated dec follows the precise impact will dependent 
the final legislation thematically lower corporate tax rate will benefit the net 
tax expense that record reflects blend the and irish taxes that pay since 
our business profitable will pay lower taxes those profits this legislation 
successful and our blended tax rate will come down result our irish domicile also 
allows for greater flexibility our corporate structuring need make certain 
adaptations following the legislation 
jazz communicated dec follows will have wait and see how this 
pans out positive whole currently corp tax cut the low does not look like 
would roll until this point looks like the part the bill interest deduction 
will kick while overall corporate tax cut the seems only effective 
that happens tiny bit negative due interest deduction being reduced 
but corporate tax cut comes overall positive 
endo communicated dec follows tax reform area keen 
focus and attention for are monitoring the developments however cannot 
speculate any potential implications this point generally speaking any tax 
reform would have unfavorable neutral impact our cash effective tax rate 
will provide update and when appropriate 
mnk based our conversation with mnk currently expects roughly net neutral 
impact its tax rate 
myl based our conversation with mylan currently expects net neutral slightly 
negative impact its tax rate mylan plans give more specific comments during its 
earnings call 
vrx cfo paul herendeen stated during investor conference nov 
follows will certainly increase the amount tax pay the united states and 
company but will change way that materially alters the cash generating ability 
our company answer would 
excise tax paul said that and you put tax top those payments and 
you continue exactly what you did after reform that would big number not 
just but anybody but here comes the critical part company will stand still 
after know what tax reform looks like every single company will its level best 
within the rules within the law order reshuffle the deck way that the impact 
won great interest deductibility paul stated already been subject 
something called which limits the amount interest could deduct the 
that was already thing like you change well you can only deduct 
sure change but here comes the important part one the overwhelming majority 
our external debt not the our parent and the second part this 
also something where been living with constraint and will have new 
constraint will defined different way and learning live with that well 
pahc communicated dec follows phibro sees overall tax reform 
positive obviously there positives and negatives lower corporate rate will positive 
some interest expense might not deductible and this will partial negative offset 
change the global territorial system definitely positive overall believe 
directionally positive but have not quantified the magnitude 
zts communicated dec follows are still digesting all the changes 
and need see what the final bill will before make any new comments net net 
should positive for 
key takeaways from our tax reform call 
recap from our pharma tax reform implications conference call with strategist 
todd castagno dec hosted call with morgan stanley tax expert todd 
castagno monday december discuss washington tax reform including potential 
implications for domiciled and domiciled pharmaceutical companies 
pharma companies with low profit relative revenue and high interest expense are 
potentially most exposed higher tax burden directionally believe that companies 
with disproportionately high sales pretax profits could more risk 
higher tax burden from proposed mechanism limit base erosion the house and 
senate bills few screening criteria that look are company ratio 
sales ratio pre tax profit currently domiciled companies may 
achieve high sales profit ratio through transfer pricing while foreign multinationals 
and inverted companies achieve through transfer pricing and leverage 
corporate tax rate cut with deemed repatriation tax unremitted foreign 
earnings the corporate tax rate expected lowered the 
senate bill and the house bill mandatory tax accumulated foreign 
earnings involves bifurcated rate higher rate for cash and investments and lower 
rate for all other operating assets the senate version proposing rates and 
while the house version and the retained earnings foreign 
subsidiaries are will the basis for tax for example company has debt and 
retained earnings components total asset only the part taxed the 
company assets comprise cash investments and ppe intangibles 
goodwill then earnings are taxed the higher rate while the other taxed 
lower rate the tax due over the next years the senate bill backloads the 
obligation while the house provides for equal payments 
transition territorial system with the transition the will longer have the 
concept deferral which exists the current worldwide system profits from 
active income will not taxed the government but the catch the needs 
protect its tax base there are key mechanisms designed prevent base erosion 
including global minimum tax excise inbound taxes and interest stripping limitations 
global minimum tax applies only domiciled companies similar rate 
structure for both house and senate versions for example company has passive 
income from domiciled low tax jurisdictions global basis the tax rate 
global basis company has some earnings low tax jurisdiction and some 
high tax jurisdiction then the average tax rate could balance out the gmt 
designed target companies that have the majority its low tax regions via 
shell companies true multinational companies with real operations may not 
affected since its tax rates various regions average higher than 
interest deductions limits designed reduce interest stripping both and 
domiciled companies generally speaking new interest deduction limits tied ebit and 
consolidate leverage ratio would hit more highly levered companies and companies with 
higher intercompany debts for interest deduction limits there are two thresholds 
considered interest expense percentage profit and leverage ratio with the 
worst one applies for the interest expense limit the senate proposal calls for 
maximum ebit the house ebitda for the leverage threshold the 
house bill sets the company consolidated debt ebitda leverage ratio 
while the senate bill ties debt equity ratio the house pointing gaap and 
ifrs but the senate appears use tax accounting principles additionally note that 
there could accounting differences and the treasury may have craft regulations 
defining what leverage and what not strategist todd castagno expects the 
senate plan the most likely prevail unless policymakers give ground the 
rate 
excise tax house bill designed limit transfer pricing excise tax the 
second leg round tripping and designed prevent companies from charging the 
parent subsidiary high transfer price other words excise tax designed 
address transfer pricing and minimize the intercompany mark that may erode profits 
the excise tax will apply both and foreign mncs only the house bill has 
excise tax provision the senate bill does not however the senate bill does contain 
similar but relatively diluted system that would tax certain related party payments 
foreign affiliates rate 
implication repatriated cash and new expensing rule may incentivize more asset 
acquisitions both senate and house plans allow for immediate expensing certain 
new acquired assets such capital equipments the current treatment 
upfront deduction plus amortization over the following years the new immediate 
expensing rule will also permit application acquired assets and may drive more asset 
deals acquired assets count new assets 
future nol carryforwards will have indefinite life both senate and house bills 
eliminate nol carrybacks and the year limit for nol carryforwards for nol 
carryforwards the senate limits nol carryforwards taxable income while 
the house bill allows for indefinite nol carryforwards which increases over time 
inflation related factor and the real return capital and limit the nol deduction 
current year taxable income the new provision only applies post nols 
corporate amt retained the senate bill will offset existing tax credits the 
biggest surprise from the latest senate bill the retention the corporate alternative 
minimum tax amt instead eliminating the house bill does with 
corporate amt the unintended negative consequence pharma that tax credits 
would longer apply but this widely seen inadvertent policy error and will 
likely adjusted the final tax bill
