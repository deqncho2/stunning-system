underweight both the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors

strategy view 
morgan stanley chief equity strategist mike wilson and his team established 
year end price target expects earnings growth peak 
and reaffirms his belief are late cycle environment for the economy and 
equity markets while does not predict recession thinks the equity 
market will begin discount its arrival the next year and sees volatility picking 
more sustained manner mike price target based paying his 
earnings estimate the end this implies slightly lower price toearnings ratio from the team previous target given expected earnings growth 
deceleration post mike bull case price target and his bear 
case target for more detail please see equity outlook attention 
road ahead narrows nov 
from consumer perspective mike wilson team recommends underweight 
consumer discretionary and staples below are key strategy highlights from the recent 
note consumer discretionary consumer staples underweight for strategist top 
picks from analysts nov 
recommending underweight consumer discretionary and staples due 
poor relative eps revisions discretionary and mix structural cyclical concerns 
discretionary typically enjoys its greatest outperformance when coming off cycle 
trough and this stage the cycle more relative downside come 
mike view that the consumer outlook fine though there are some nascent 
signs rising pressures for low income consumers and unlikely inflect 
meaningfully higher this late the cycle 
despite trading below median valuations the team does not see basis for mean 
reversion this time rather they believe the low relative multiples reflect 
structural concerns underlying industries the sectors and that markets are 
the window the cycle where these sectors struggle perform line with the 
market 
macro view 
the following excerpt from the economic outlook authored the 
economics team and includes update forecasts post tax reform see ringing 
year for the pre tax reform full outlook ellen zentner robert rosener michel 
dilmanian and molly wharton are economists and are not opining any equity securities 
their views are clearly delineated 
have further revised upward our forecast for and 
raise bigger relative corporate cuts drive modestly higher 
gdp benefit than previously forecast earlier drop withholding also provides 
near term lift consumer spending 
consumer forecast highlights 
little slack the labor market should translate into additional 
upward pressure wages which expect grow 
the tax policy front personal income tax cuts provide early lift 
real disposable income stemming the late cycle slowdown 
income growth however the consumer impulse fades 
together with tax policy minimum wage increases set positively 
for low income consumers 
increased housing wealth should also provide support 
consumption spending mortgage equity withdrawal has turned 
positive this year for the first time since the crisis 
after growing estimated real pce 
growth remains robust growing then 
decelerates 
though the aggregate household balance sheet very good shape 
declining credit quality non mortgage debt points late cycle 
consumer with the best days for consumer credit quality behind 
remain watchful the low income consumer who increasingly appears 
under stress while the average consumer remains good shape
