within this note walk through key topics investors are 
debating early along with discussion where 
differ from consensus 
david arcaro cfa 
debate tax reform most investors believe that the corporate tax rate will 
lowered between and but not believe investors have fully 
taken action this view beyond lower corporate tax rate there 
consensus what will the tax reform package and clear concern the 
loss interest expense deductibility stocks believe are best positioned for the 
lowering the corporate tax rate peg exc sji nee sre for investors 
concerned about the risk loss interest expense deductibility believe the best 
stocks are peg sji and exc while stocks that would likely materially 
impacted appear sre nee duk etr and 
debate merchant valuation and strategic dynamics investor interest pureplay merchant power stocks low point driven stock volatility small 
market cap the fact that these stocks are not any index and therefore these 
stocks are not investor performance benchmarks the growth renewable 
energy and special payments provided allow unprofitable nuclear plants 
remain online which hurts the economics for all non nuclear generation there 
also skepticism that there will significant strategic activity the merchant 
power space while interest pure play merchant stocks low investor interest 
diversified utilities growing especially for exc and lesser extent peg 
our view have very different view from consensus and believe now 
ideal entry point for several these stocks among pure play merchant 
stocks our favorite remains dyn note that sparkspread industry news 
source has reported that dyn may exploring the sale multiple assets and 
the proceeds from such potential sales could our view exceed the market cap 
dynegy note that the company has not commented this media report 
and have knowledge any pending transaction for dyn believe 
there striking difference value for dyn assets the private market 
relative what the public market see our deep dive this dynamic our 
merchant power outlook here among diversified utilities our favorite picks are 
exc where the implied free cash flow yield the merchant business now 
approaching and where see exit from the merchant business 
and the stock trades discount its utility only value using 
conservative valuation also see upside peg where the implied free cash 
flow yield its merchant generation business the teens also like that 
peg likely the largest beneficiary lower corporate tax rate benefit 
eps the corporate tax rate were lowered 
debate firstenergy remains the most debated stock the sector with 
broad range views among investors speak with our view while have 
written extensively prior reports can distill our view why are

morgan stanley does and seeks business with 
companies covered morgan stanley research 
result investors should aware that the firm may have 
conflict interest that could affect the objectivity 
morgan stanley research investors should consider 
morgan stanley research only single factor making 
their investment decision 
for analyst certification and other important disclosures 
refer the disclosure section located the end this 
report 
overweight the stock few key points the stock trades discount 
peers using discounted valuation factor the risk from tax reform 
and from concerns regarding parent leverage and two other utilities who 
went through similar exits from merchant generation eix and aee their worst 
traded discount based public commentary company 
management appears highly likely our view that exits the merchant 
business either through sale reorganization have not heard 
compelling legal argument regarding why there would liability owed 
bondholders the merchant business think utility business higher 
quality than appreciated with positive rate case outcomes most key 
jurisdictions and high probability our view succeeding rate basing the 
pleasants plant and has large tax basis the merchant 
business which can more than offset the remaining merchant pension liability 
debate the california utilities sense growing investor interest sre 
given that the stock trades significant discount the earnings power postcameron coming online already well owned stock but trades 
discount peers eix has received less investor interest given the 
recent opening the songs settlement general are sensing continued 
investor nervousness regarding the lack settlement extension the 
california roe mechanism our view are overweight sre and pcg and 
equal weight eix but even for eix where are equal weight are seeing 
improved risk reward for sre believe the stock cheap peers when 
looking the full earnings power the company and see several positive 
earnings drivers while some investors are concerned about the ienova business 
believe likely that natural gas will continue flow from the 
mexico the benefits from the sale does mexico regarding pcg like 
the new ceo geisha williams operations background and her ability forge 
compromise among many constituents and like the growth outlook for the 
company over long period time expect rating over the next 
months the company executes its plan regarding eix while appreciate 
concerns regarding the potential cost closing the songs dispute when 
compare this potential cost the potential cash eix may receive under its 
litigation with mitsubishi heavy industries eix seems have strong case 
maximum damages are and the split any cash received 
between customers shareholders believe the net outcome could positive 
eix and this our view not eix stock any way this coupled with 
strong organic growth outlook puts positively biased towards the stock 
regarding potential settlement the california roe mechanism are 
concerned that have not yet seen settlement and have not seen one 
the end will become very concerned that being said the 
current interest rate curve implies that the current mechanism remains 
appropriate even there review this mechanism believe the result 
will line with the current mechanism 
debate new nuclear cost overrun risk and impacts and scg utility 
investors are our view still fact finding mode after the recent news that 
toshiba likely record charge for its new nuclear business that 
several billion dollars size are concerned that scg shareholders may 
required fund cost overruns the event that estimated construction 
costs the new nuclear units exceeds the forecasts agreed upon the 
latest epc contracts and westinghouse owned toshiba unable fund 
these cost overages scg trades discount peers implying perhaps 
cost overruns trades discount peers but 
believe that largely due other factors such concerns about fundamental 
eps growth our view believe both scg and stock should reflect larger 
potential cost overrun not covered toshiba especially scg where the 
project market cap and scg has maximum letter credit from 
toshiba westinghouse only southern has greater degree 
protection relative scana from potential inability toshiba honor and 
pay for cost overruns has letters credit lcs totaling while scg 
currently has received lcs totaling with maximum amount 
while there are other protective mechanisms the epc contracts believe 
those mechanisms are not helpful the event financial distress toshiba 
see our joint note with kazuo yoshikawa who covers toshiba here 
debate impact utilities from renewables growth post the election 
regularly hear investor concerns regarding the growth outlook the for 
renewables well specific concern whether congress might repeal 
the tax credits available for solar and wind assets nextera nee has 
underperformed peers since the election primarily due these concerns 
our view other utilities have become increasingly bullish their ability 
drive eps growth from renewables investments and investor views that are 
generally lukewarm our view the solar itc and wind ptc are unlikely 
repealed congress because was republican controlled congress that 
extended these credits the first place and these credits naturally sunset 
without congressional action are more bullish wind developers relative 
solar because the barriers entry wind are much higher would 
highlight nee where the company has achieved high teens low 
percentage equity returns wind and expect this continue the 
negative end the spectrum has included per year capex 
renewables return level above their utility return level implying 
returns while like the wind development agreement recently 
announced believe that may challenging achieve targeted return 
levels when acquiring projects largely completely developed others 
away from the big investor debates where worry could wrong 
there are number stocks where see potential upside that could warrant 
more positive view than our current view namely 
entergy the court review the zero emissions credits zecs requires 
the elimination the financial need provision see our review the legal 
dynamics here see outcome which this provision eliminated and 
indian point would receive zec payments for period time but this 
scenario believe likely that shut down date between and years 
from now would required for every year zec payments that entergy 
receives indian point our valuation entergy would increase just under 
share this very meaningful dynamic that will watching 
pseg while exelon screens more attractive relative pseg stock current 
prices pseg should bigger beneficiary from lower tax rate and pseg has 
less negative impact interest expense deductibility eliminated like 
pseg utility strategy and the company has excellent track record above 
average utility earnings growth while understand investor preference for 
exc current prices there doesn need either decision between 
these two stocks and see some potential for catch trade peg our 
fundamental valuation peg remain equal weight but tactically believe 
there chance that investors will increasingly turn their attention peg stock 
after initially focusing exc among diversified utilities addition see the 
potential for the emaac zone break out the may pjm capacity 
performance auction and this could differentiator well though exc also 
has meaningful emaac exposure and believe the comed zone another big 
driver for exc will also break out 
edison international given the size the potential damages owed eix 
mitsubishi heavy industries coupled with what believe 
very strong legal arguments that eix has that dispute investors might 
under appreciating the benefits this dispute net the potential damage from 
closing the songs settlement 
elimination the deduction for interest expense this included tax reform 
several stocks could meaningfully impacted most notably nee eps hit 
sre exc all eps hit etr and eps hit see the following chart 
showing these impacts plus the impacts from lower tax rate
