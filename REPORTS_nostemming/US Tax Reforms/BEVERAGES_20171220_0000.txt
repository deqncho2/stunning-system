topline woes more secular than temporary ytd sales 
growth for key public cpg companies each the household products 
beverage and food sectors all slowed sequentially roughly bps 
with company commentary pointing more temporary rather than secular 
reasons while highlight few short term pressure points from 
particularly with wmt inventory cuts which will create easy

drivers behind the slowdown are brand demand fragmentation well pricing 
pressure from retailers pressing suppliers for price concessions challenging

compelling than household products with key hpc companies trading premium

colgate 
recently upgraded colgate our top household products pick see 
our note titled reasons smile again here behind our call for expected organic 
topline acceleration back near going forward after flattish trends 
expect this acceleration driven temporary issues which impacted over the 
last few quarters moderating which alone could add nearly bps topline 
growth and much easier comparisons market share payback from sharp 
increase spend and forecast growth and 
more favorable emerging market trends with macro rebound and reduced competitive 
intensity expect the topline inflection also play out the bottom line with 
favorable and after reinvestment last valuation still looks compelling

strategic potential and superior growth

transitory issues that estimate were near bps drag organic growth

key point spending should drive market share payback 
colgate eps guidance implies significant increase spend the back half 
with the already reported being the first quarter with higher spend expect 
this inflection will drive forward market share gains after prior years cutbacks 
spend increased yoy bps sales and management 
indicated that would see even greater increase estimate yoy increase 
similar bps sales importantly this increase spend reversal 
from prior hsd cuts average for over the last few years 
exhibit spend increased and should increase even more driving share

moderating spend shown the chart below estimate marketing spend 
declined bps yoy sales the last two quarters bps yoy rise

also believe the external environment turning more positive for emerging 
markets macro trends accelerate and headwinds turn into tailwinds over the last 
several years emerging market growth for cpg companies has slowed significantly 
but believe are clear turning point with emerging markets macros improving

consumers shift greater consumption the traditional sit down meals 
much less pressure from health and wellness concerns snacks than beverages other 
food items given salty snacks derives more its taste profile from salt rather than 
sugar sugar the prevalent health and wellness concern consumers and pep has 
leading share within snacks very fragmented competition driving pepsi market share

ahead other cpg categories bps average including bps ytd 
addition outperformance has been steady with the lowest gap being bps 
exhibit salty snacks category growth has outperformed peer cpg categories 
source nielsen xaoc morgan stanley research 
attribute this outperformance numerous reasons most important being that the 
time stretched consumer eating more the run and the this evident 
census data which reflects growth single and two person households millennials 
delay marriage and starting families relative previous generations single and dual 
occupancy households grew yoy year cagr which bps 
faster than the average decline households with four more people cagr larger families are more likely have traditional sit down meals while one 
and two person households are more likely consume the items instead 
traditionally cooked meals 
addition health and wellness trends have broadly been headwind across food and 
beverages but salty snacks have faced less incremental consumer pressure than sugary 
foods and beverages such csds given heightened focus reducing sugar 
consumption compared salt google search trends illustrate searches for the 
term lower sugar the have consistently increased over time while searches for 
the term lower salt have trended flat for the past decade lower salt searches are 
only the current level sugar searches highlighting increased consumer

pepsi and coke have been widely discussed potentially being interest anheuserbusch inbev please see links above which has disclosed management incentives

acquisitions detailed our insight note strategic halo and higher growth should 
close pepsi valuation gap believe the csd category could the most logical 
category for abi enter into outside its already consolidated beer category given 
abi historical experience within the sector bottler for csd companies numerous 
markets particularly brazil the csd and beer categories also could distributed 
together given similar turns retail many emerging markets although this limited 
third party bottlers being responsible for most coke and pepsi beverage 
distribution internationally would not expect combined distribution the given 
regulatory challenges lack full channel coverage beer soft drinks and all these 
companies already have large scale limiting the economic benefit from additional scale 
believe there could greater synergies hypothetical abi deal for pepsi the 
current ebitda base given greater cost inefficiency and relative low 
pep operating margin base coke pro forma coupled with pepsi 
ebitda discount coke estimate much higher roic eps accretion with pepsi 
than coke for hypothetical acquirer khc could also conceivably take interest

this includes potential eps accretion pep and roic both above our

pepsi pep coke 
for background anheuser busch inbev covered olivier nicolai supported its 
main shareholders brazilian and the belgian families interbrew has historically 
led the consolidation the beer industry post the sab miller deal abi has elevated 
debt leverage but they will able pay the debt down the end the decade 
moreover considering the level consolidation and the family ownership structures 
the remaining players abi has seemingly exhausted natural large consolidation 
candidates the beer industry extending into non alcoholic beverages seems like the 
next natural extension their strategy finally executives are incentivized reach 
sales although this excludes the executive committee with ntm 
abi sales large transformational deal would required reach the 
internal threshold pep and both fit the profile 
therefore once abi reduces its high level net debt post the sab miller transaction 
and could more likely consider large acquisitions which our minds still probably 
couple years away from debt leverage standpoint conceivable that abi may look 
move outside beer with other beverage categories and snacks being potentially 
logical fit within other key beverage categories view the csd category 
reasonable hypothetical fit given abi historical experience within the sector 
bottler for csd companies numerous markets particularly brazil the csd and 
beer categories also could distributed together given similar turns retail many 
emerging markets although this limited third party bottlers being responsible for 
most coke and pepsi beverage international distribution would not expect 
combined distribution the given regulatory challenges lack full channel 
coverage beer soft drinks and all these companies already have large scale limiting 
the economic benefit from commingling distribution out the large global beverage 
categories view csds more likely interest than spirits wine spirits 
companies have different consumers occasions marketing distribution and velocity 
than beer well higher relative valuation levels wine companies are less likely 
interest given wine operates less attractive segment with agricultural volatility 
lower roic and less branding potential albeit with greater growth potential looking 
remaining beverage categories they are likely not sizeable enough satisfy abi 
appetite 
given abi plausible interest large scale csd acquisitions when abi debt leverage 
lower couple years from hypothetical standpoint analyze potential eps 
accretion returns from acquisitions the two large global csd companies coca cola 
and pepsi has been reported possibility the media including cnbc here 
and pepsi bloomberg here from numbers perspective estimate that pep would 
more attractive hypothetical consolidation scenario than with much higher 
eps accretion and roic 
contrast the apparent market view believe pep has superior consolidation 
attributes given offers higher roic eps accretion abi were acquire soft 
drinks this stems from two pronounced and clear financial positives including less 
efficient pep cost structure with lower pep margins than which offers greater 
synergy potential initial deal value although some the gap structural well 
much lower pep valuation net estimate hypothetical eps accretion 
for abi from pep acquisition far ahead coke dilution and roic 
for pep far ahead for 
exhibit eps accretion roic fully synergized for hypothetical pep deals 
source company data morgan stanley research 
believe the market has historically focused potential consolidation 
candidate for three reasons has arguably great brand though believe abi 
more focused deal economics behind compelling businesses and the value that 
can generated from brands incrementally the starting base which our minds 
would higher pep while many investors feel buffett ties both 
coke and could help facilitate deal buffett has historically not supported 
hostile deals which could make hypothetical abi combination difficult given coke 
new ceo could unwilling deal early his tenure theoretical 
strong pricing power the csd company 
that said view pepsi having more attractive hypothetical consolidation attributes 
based the following 
pepsi operating margins below coke with pepsi less 
efficient cost structure this will widen pep and coke 
but the increased gap mainly due coke franchising bottling whereas pep 
will likely remain company owned this means the same amount synergy 
dollars pepsi coke worth much more pepsi starting ebitda base 
areas like job cuts etc would have much more impact the current ebitda base 
pepsi 
pepsi valuation lot lower ebitda coke which 
when combined with greater synergy potential relative its existing ebitda base 
drives much higher potential returns eps accretion for hypothetical pep 
deal 
pepsi also has snacks business that could separated from beverages activist 
trian argued potentially satisfying consolidation appetite both food 
and beverages from the related abi entities and offering optionality value from 
pursuing future roll strategy snacks 
pepsi has strong pricing power and leading share snacks and 
global share despite being the company beverages and 
global share and csds and global share aggregate pep has 
realized more corporate pricing than over time 
the notion that abi would hypothetically buy coke ebitda 
assuming least premium for above for company with 
operating margins given much abi historical success had 
been due high level synergies relative the existing margin base strikes 
unlikely all else being equal 
addition see more willingness engage strategic considerations pep 
given young new ceo years age may less likely engage given his 
tenure has just started 
from more near term long term standpoint have also looked khc 
potential acquirer hybrid food beverage company such pepsi given its bid for 
unilever hybrid food hpc company earlier this year although believe khc 
more focused the food industry the early unilever bid indicates they are open 
entering other industries such hpc and beverages plausible khc 
consolidation scenario hypothetical pep transaction would potentially stack well 
other cpg companies that khc could interested given could provide accretion 
and roic levels line with food peers and greater than hpc while also providing 
much higher long term growth potential relative food line with hpc which over 
time could ultimately lead higher roic thus while other sectors could well more 
likely see few strategic paths khc could explore that could involve pep which 
believe importantly are not being factored into pep valuation these include 
outright purchase pep perhaps purchase pep snack business while abi
