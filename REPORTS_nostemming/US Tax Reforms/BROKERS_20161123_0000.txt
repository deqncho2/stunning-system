tax reform deregulation 
approaching what the impact 
explore the potential impact tax reform and 
deregulation given increased likelihood the next 
administration key issues for sector include elimination 
carried interest loophole interest deductibility lower 
corporate tax rates repatriation and the outlook for the dol 
fiduciary rule 
see growing potential for tax reform and deregulation with new trump 
administration that could boost earnings unlock trapped cash held abroad 
slow migration passive and fee based advice instead accelerating and 
entice alts convert from partnership structure corporation the 
group overall could benefit from these potential policy initiatives wetf jns 
and schw should benefit most from lower tax rates ben appears best 
positioned for repatriation wdr ben and lpla should benefit most from 
changes dol fiduciary rule and kkr should benefit most among the alts 
convert corps brokers including schw and amtd also should benefit 
from higher interest rates which discuss more detail our recent 
collaborative report global banks and diversified financials how play higher 
interest rates across global financials nov 
dol fiduciary rule could put hold changed repealed under trump 
administration which would near term tailwind for traditional asset 
managers but this seems largely the price and doesn change direction 
travel toward lower fee passive index products fee based advisory and 
fiduciary services all headwind for active mgrs 
traditional asset mgrs have outperformed the broader market bps 
since election day rallying recall the fiduciary rule 
was finalized earlier this year and goes into effect april the rule 
requires financial advisors act the best interest their clients when 
providing advice the context retirement accounts specifically brokerage ira 
accounts our view that delay change the fiduciary rule could 
potentially slow the shift towards passive and fee based advisory services 
opposed accelerating the shift this should positive for traditionals with 
skew toward active mutual funds sold into brokerage channels such wdr

the incoming trump administration could allow the rule into effect 
april delay the fiduciary rule following the footsteps the obama 
administration which delayed and then repealed earlier fiduciary rule that was 
proposed under president bush withdraw and propose the rule right away 
prior april which would require the new administration present costbenefit analysis supporting their actions think the delay route the most likely 
outcome near term and wouldn surprised the see revisions made the rule that 
would make less onerous operationally perhaps coordination with the sec 
recent rulemakings and proposals from the sec could put hold amended 
repealed including the sec final rule liquidity risk management and proposed 
derivative rule specifically implementation dates for the following regulations could 
delayed rules scaled back sec liquidity risk mgmt rule expected 
implemented dec for large firms and june for smaller firms with 
assets under sec derivatives rule which had previously expected 
finalized and sec stress testing which expected proposed 
will likely delayed and proposed with less stringent regulatory measures 
elimination carried interest loophole 
alternative asset manager stocks could initially come under pressure proposals gain 
traction end tax advantage known the carried interest loophole this loophole 
allows alternative asset manager unit holders pay long term capital gains tax rate 
performance fee earnings known carried interest opposed higher ordinary 
income tax rate recall the alts are flow through partnerships with taxation borne 
investors the stocks reported financial results the firms themselves are unlikely 
impacted the elimination the carried interest loophole taxable investors the 
stocks would bare the tax burden and would pay higher ordinary tax rate instead 
long term capital gains rate their proportionate allocation carried interest 
estimate this could reduce the after tax cash economics for investors 
assuming the tax rate applicable for carried interest rises from current high 
the highest ordinary tax rate firms with less earnings skew carry such apo 
and ares are better positioned than firms with greater earnings skew carry such 
and 
but elimination carried interest loophole increases probability alts converting 
corporations which would positive for the sector our view view the 
probability alts converting corporations higher corporate tax rates are 
lowered the companies should benefit from less tax leakage ultimately believe 
that alts were convert corp from current partnership structure that could 
expand the universe eligible investors and likely result index inclusion after tax 
earnings power should weaker for the alts with corporate tax rate applied the 
carried interest portion earnings however believe the stocks would benefit from 
broader potential investor base the corp structure would help alleviate the tax 
hassle with reporting and could attract new investors some are restricted from 
investing limited partnerships today corp structure could also allow for inclusion 
leading benchmarks and indices from which the stocks are currently excluded index 
inclusion could drive major rating the group with potential multiple 
expansion upwards turns due increased liquidity and broader investor base for 
more information benchmark inclusion alts see our note asset managers 
benchmark inclusion alts what jan 
elimination interest deduction 
limitations interest deductibility should negative for alternative asset manager 
earnings not offset material reductions the corporate tax rate the two main 
areas impact would likely immediate markdowns portfolio values from lower 
commercial real estate and corporate valuations and longer term degradation 
private equity and real estate returns that would reduce carried interest revenues 
estimate impairment could result one time earnings impact for alternative asset 
managers 
longer term and fund returns could come under pressure there are limitations 
interest deductibility most and funds target high teen net returns and 
generate their returns from leverage financial engineering the remaining 
returns are generated through operational improvements that lead 
ebitda growth and multiple expansion our work suggests limitations interest 
deductibility could result bps decrease long term and returns 
assuming corresponding income tax rate and holding everything else constant 
this could potentially reduce alternative asset manager long term earnings 
however estimate that reduction corporate tax rates high teens would 
fully offset the impact long term returns from eliminating interest deductibility 
firms that are more geared toward real estate and private equity could relatively 
more affected than firms that are more credit distressed focused market dislocations 
resulting from regulatory change could yield attractive new investment opportunities 
broadly for the alts bolstered their locked capital 
lowering the statutory rate 
according tax plan section president elect donald trump website the trump 
plan will lower the business tax rate from percent percent and eliminate the 
corporate alternative minimum tax this rate available all businesses both small 
and large that want retain the profits within the business many pundits however 
believe tax rate more likely scenario rate the current proposal paul 
ryan and the house republicans 
tax reform timing could sooner than some expect point reference shortly 
after his inauguration january president bush proposed the economic 
growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra which was the first wave the 
bush tax cuts this relief program was passed congress may and enacted 
month later june fast forward the present with the republican sweep 
election day could see tax reform move quickly through congress

impacted the most with average accretion eps within traditional 
asset managers under coverage wetf currently pays effective tax rate and 
appears best positioned for tax rate cut estimate accretion

repatriation 
repatriation would likely beneficial for ben the near term but business 
reinvestment critical fill product gaps jump start growth and ultimately boost 
ben stock price longer term ben management has reiterated their intent 
repatriating excess cash held abroad the opportunity were present itself the 
trump administration has not necessarily offered repatriation holiday but rather 
proposed one time mandatory tax all accumulated offshore earnings shift 
towards more territorial tax system estimate ben has total cash and 
investments held abroad with estimated considered excess cash worth 
per share and ben market cap that ben does not need run their 
international business and can repatriate back the ben were repatriate all 
excess cash that would translate per share cash net 
one time taxes that they can bring back the 
see two potential options for ben put this cash work capital management ben could distribute all some the capital back shareholders through special 
dividends buybacks which believe would help boost the stock the near term 
but could ultimately longer term value destructive the multiple asset mgt 
historically growth sector but organic growth has inverted outflows that show little 
sign improving ben large cash position presents unique opportunity stem the 
tide and chart course sustainable growth the alternative our view for 
longer term rating value stock lower multiple return ben historical 
multiple need see growth which requires substantial investment the business 
reinvest the business ben could use the cash fund acquisitions fill product 
gaps and help drive growth which more long term accretive for their business larger 
cash levels also suggest ben can use less debt fund investments which would reduce 
the cost capital when making acquisition
