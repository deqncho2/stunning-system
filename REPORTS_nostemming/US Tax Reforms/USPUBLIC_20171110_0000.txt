public policy brief 
tax reform senate driving not 
yet arriving 
time and moderation are needed resolve differences 
fit the byrd rule credit risks come into focus keys timing 
success salt fiscal hawk reaction dynamic scores 
shutdown showdown 
yesterday the chairman the senate finance 
committee orrin hatch released the senate draft 
tax bill the house the ways and means committee 
voted their tax bill out committee and will head 
the house floor next week with the house and 
senate bills far apart some details here are our 
takeaways 
the senate constrained reconciliation rules 
they are the driver seat however their current draft not compliant with 
the byrd rule likely further revised consistent with our base case 
moderate stimulus 
because the senate needs adhere their process rules they are the 
driver seat they need formulate bill that fits with the cap 
trillion deficit over years and does not increase deficits beyond the year 
budget window compliant with the byrd rule therefore the bill 
develops believe investors should give greater weight the provisions 
included the senate bill over what was included the house bill the 
exception salt detailed below 
senate finance committee aides have acknowledged that their draft bill not 
byrd rule compliant and changes will have made there word yet 
how they intend alter the bill but think likely that there will 
increased number phase ins and sunsets overall believe the plan will 
more moderate than the senate draft bill and the bill that the house ways and 
means committee passed 
both the senate and house are working fit their bills under the trillion 
deficit ceiling the jct score the house plan was slightly front loaded mostly 
due family credit that expired after years and not included the 
senate bill the jct score the senate plan showed much lower deficits the 
first year the plan due the delay the corporate tax cut and overall the 
cuts were not front loaded overall believe these scores are consistent with 
our base case moderate stimulus see tax reform better travel than 
arrive october 
the senate bill differs from the house bill significant ways making delays 
likely the two chambers work out their differences conference committee

the senate draft differs from the house bill significant ways but the senate 
will change their bill their mark next week the key differences are the 
delay the corporate rate decrease state and local taxes salt and interest 
deductibility both bills are able pass their respective chambers the real 
work will done conference committee there chance that the house 
could pass the senate final bill and done with but the differences are 
large that feels unlikely this point

source morgan stanley research 
while the senate the driver seat politically the house the driver 
seat salt 
the senate draft fully eliminates the state and local tax deduction and clearly 
considers key pay for the bill whereas the house maintained the deduction 
for property taxes with cap according the hill six house 
republicans were not happy with that compromise however and have 
announced they will vote against the bill more may oppose the bill the 
deduction repealed entirely particularly because many the republicans who 
care about salt risk losing their seats the midterm elections 
however salt compromise risks key senate pay for and the math 
critically important the senate comply with reconciliation rules therefore 
salt compromise should force them include other pay fors and raise the 
rates once again causing the bill become more moderated line with our 
base case 
corporate tax rate cut delayed for one year the senate draft could 
altered further 
the senate bill delays the drop the corporate rate one year the house 
reduces the corporate rate immediately still think that the corporate rate 
could altered further make the math work over the years phase 
would way raise money and consistent with prior tax reforms the 
rate could move higher towards 
interest deductibility capped ebit not ebitda 
the senate proposal sets cap interest deductibility ebit 
opposed ebitda change that clearly raises additional revenue 
over years the house plan the difference how the cap 
calculated important credit markets our view for example capping 
interest expense ebitda would impact virtually companies 
capping interest expense ebit would impact roughly our 
universe excluding exempted sectors for the impact even bigger with 
over half all companies above the cap many well above roughly one third 
the house plan thinking about slightly differently using very rough 
approximation applied bottom our credit universes find that most 
companies would still get net tax cut incorporating tax rate and 
assuming the senate version the cap all else equal however estimate 
that companies would now not benefit from the tax cut with decent 
chunk the market seeing sizeable hit along these lines calculating 
interest deductibility using ebit ebitda not only impacts highly levered 
companies but also starts impact companies with leverage only 
modestly above the market average 
note two additional considerations first capping the interest expense 
deduction percentage ebit opposed ebitda could actually 
disincentivize capex for levered issuers heavy capex spending would lower 
ebit reducing the interest expense deduction the process second the fact 
that the tax cut not put place until would make the interest 
deductibility cap more painful year one net net find the senate plan 
bigger fundamental credit headwind than the house version particularly for 
more levered companies 
territoriality and repatriation another mixed bag 
expected the senate also proposes transition territorial style tax 
system repatriation the senate proposed mandatory tax accumulated 
foreign earnings much lower than the revised house plan the senate plan 
includes tax cash back foreign earnings and all others while the 
house recently revised their rates higher and respectively believe 
the senate proposed repatriation rates will ultimately drift higher both 
chambers are struggling meet budget constraints 
the senate plans includes similar and controversial base erosion features the 
house bill but they would operate differently the senate proposes global 
minimum tax foreign subsidiary earnings ultimately targeting passive 
income from intellectual property low tax jurisdictions this slightly higher 
than the house feature which would effectively tax this income near the 
senate also includes thin capitalization rules prevent over levering 
subsidiaries the senate effectively seeks cap subsidiary leverage the 
aggregate company leverage ratio under the proposed tax inbound base 
erosion payments taxpayer would required pay tax that equal the 
difference between modified taxable income and the tax liability paid 
after being reduced certain credits taxpayer concentrates significant 
amount their pretax income low tax jurisdictions this would result 
divergence between taxable income and the tax liability which could trigger this 
tax like the house bill this mechanism effectively backstop against transfer 
pricing strategies that erode the tax base 
the surprise kicker the senate proposal patent box like incentive for 
companies domicile intellectual property the united states foreign derived 
income from such intangibles would receive deduction resulting 
effective rate 
impact housing largely unchanged despite differences between senate 
and house proposal 
with respect housing the senate proposal differs from the house 
few notable ways first and foremost the senate proposal does not change the 
cap for the mortgage interest deduction from million the house proposal 
reduced that number while this does not impact large percentage 
mortgage holders maintaining the current deduction level would not 
disincentivize current homeowners with mortgages above from selling 
their home the way the house proposal did thus removing slight headwind 
existing home sales 
the senate proposal maintains the near doubling the standard deduction 
from the house proposal and completely eliminates state and local tax 
deductions removing even the property tax deduction that was 
maintained the house proposal this probably makes even less likely that 
homeowners will incentivized itemize deductions and therefore less likely 
that household will receive tax incentive own rent however 
stated our previous work the implications tax reform there are many 
more reasons own home than the tax incentive but the margin this 
negative 
another potential headwind housing contained both proposals 
extension the length time taxpayer must own home qualify for 
exclusion gain from sale principal residence both proposals extend the 
time from house being used principal residence from two out the last 
five years five out the last eight years this modification could serve 
decrease transaction volumes lowering turnover and thus mortgage 
prepayments 
ultimately written this proposal appears modest negative for home 
prices and headwind for sales activity 
munis still good for investors improvement for issuers 
both the senate and the house bills remain about good outcome for the 
muni market one could expect from comprehensive tax reform effort put 
simply individual tax rates are not going down significant amount and tax 
writers both the house and senate have preserved the core muni interest 
exemption the impact muni issuers has been more mixed evidenced 
several issuance limiting provisions the house bill yet the senate bill allowed 
issuers breathe partial sigh relief unlike the house plan the senate bill 
maintains existing laws authorizing the issuance private activity bonds pabs 
and tax credit bonds issuance nonprofit hospitals and private 
universities would remain unaffected well does maintain the house 
prohibition advance refunding bonds however the senate could afford 
spare pabs and choosing fully repeal the deduction for state and 
local taxes paid salt its entirety instead following the house partially 
preserving the deduction for property taxes but full repeal salt may prove 
anathema house republicans who represent high tax states this underscores 
the fact that differences both bills broadly and muni provisions specifically 
are likely linger until joint house senate conference committee hammers 
out final details sometime early next year the risk therefore remains that muni 
provisions like pab repeal are put back the table the conference 
committee negotiators finalize the tax plan 
commercial real estate cre second verse same the first sort 
our preliminary read suggests that the senate proposal similar not identical 
the house proposal from last week particular the senate proposal also 
allows for the continued deduction interest expense for cre permits 
exchanges and maintains the existing depreciation levels 
the senate proposal less straightforward than the house when comes 
reit dividends the house proposal calls for max tax rate reit 
dividends the senate suggests that there deduction qualified 
income but taxed rate which believe equates effective 
tax 
what should markets watch execution risks the dynamic scoring feedback 
loop and the upcoming government funding debate 
once again await more details the senate marks their bill next week 
particularly for changes that make the bill comply with the byrd rule this 
introduces execution risk changes make the bill byrd rule compliant may 
require politically unpopular pay fors raise the corporate rate which the 
white house opposes the house will vote their version the bill next week 
and will watching for the number votes due salt well 
members who say they will vote against the final bill does not have the 
property tax cap compromise 
also suggest keeping eye out for dynamic scores from the jct and outside 
groups jct may release their dynamic score the house bill before the house 
votes late next week and the tax foundation will release revised score soon 
watch for the reaction from senate fiscal hawks corker flake lankford 
these dynamic scores hawks deem the scores insufficient may signal the 
senate bill will fail further moderated 
congress will also need turn their attention funding the government after 
the current continuing resolution runs out december they need 
democratic senator votes pass the funding bill and democrats are eager 
achieve their goals parity for defense and nondefense spending daca fix csr 
payments the negotiation these debates take time and could delay 
republican leadership timeline for passing tax reform
