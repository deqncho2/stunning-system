market optimism meet policymaking reality republicans 
should deliver some major changes yet conflicting motives 
unintended consequences mean less confidence that policy 
supports risk appetite over time examine tax reform 
options border adjustment consequences how compromises 
may emerge 
high risk high reward agenda execution risks around the policy 
agenda mean wider range outcomes positive stimulus possibilities are 
now accompanied greater risk gridlock for example think 
republicans will ultimately achieve tax reform forgoing permanence 
allow some near term deficit expansion this moderates some their 
more controversial proposals while preserving tax rate cut targets and 
likely risk positive however concede that risks this view have risen 
internal party disagreements could bog down the legislative agenda 
furthermore the potential for unintended consequences blunt the 
macro positives tax reform may underappreciated while our global 
strategy team sees more room for risk asset performance the near term 
note that this policy uncertainty could over time become catalyst for 
the fade phase our outlook this supports key strategist views caution 
credit based tight valuations preference for and equities

confidence that positive growth policies like tax cut driven fiscal 
stimulus and increased infrastructure spending will occur though that 
confidence appears have cooled recently tax rate sensitive equity

the takeaway market optimism meets policymaking reality 
when donald trump won the presidential election market reaction was strong and 
positive the possibility clearing path fiscal stimulus alongside transformative 
tax trade and infrastructure policies inauguration day however the stakes were 
raised trump took the oath office his administration transitioned from the thrill 
victory the agony governing the days ahead should reveal the mix 
sometimes conflicting motivations and disagreements within the republican party which 
make for fatter tailed outcomes for markets said differently see the policy path 
high risk high reward for markets given optimistic valuations key sectors the 
emerging risk that investors will see these conflicts and find increasingly difficult 
believe their faith policy will rewarded 
consider tax reform object lesson our view this appropriate approach 
because tax reform attempts intertwine the president central goals and his party 
message tax cuts boosting economic growth disincentivizing overseas production and 
fiscal conservatism yet these goals can conflict important ways given the path 
required legislate tax reform 
for example consider the debate over border adjustability the proposal included 
part the larger house republican etter way tax blueprint proposes eliminate 
corporations ability deduct import costs while also eliminating taxes export 
revenues explain this policy detail here and here but believe the simplest way 
think about this relative the current tax system pairs tariff with export 
subsidy the policy allows republicans achieve several their goals because 
addresses the president desire incentivize domestic production and raises 
revenue offset that which will lost through lowering the corporate tax rate 
bolstering the party fiscal conservative bona fides the latter additional 
importance given that tax reform likely requires use the budget reconciliation 
process overcome democratic filibuster risk the senate tax reform using this 
approach made easier when fresh revenue options are available limiting the need for 
fiscally conservative republicans consider voting for higher deficits that ease 
though comes the risk near term economic and corporate disruption given its 
potential boost the dollar tighten financial conditions and rotate wealth from 
certain sectors the economy others that could easily manifested political 
opposition perhaps most acutely felt the senate where only three republican 
dissenters could hold the process 
our base case republicans enact tax reform around threading the 
needle situation created the sometimes conflicting motivations fiscal 
conservatism business friendliness and legislative rules the difficulties referenced 
above regarding border adjustability are likely applicable debates over other pay 
fors being proposed elimination corporate interest deductibilty elimination most 
personal itemized deductions etc unless one believes that republicans will 
successful convincing all affected interest groups and consequently nearly their 
entire caucus the benefits these changes which not point are willing 
concede then final legislation likely must follow one two paths 
less ambitious but permanent tax reform make tax cuts permanent while 
using the budget reconciliation procedure any tax action must comply with various 
laws including the yrd rule and the congressional budget act among other 
things these rules mandate that actions taken through reconciliation must not 
increase the deficit beyond the budget resolution window currently years 
hence unless spending substantially cut which may difficult given the 
president goals such maintaining entitlement programs while raising 
defense spending then republicans must preserve projected tax revenue 
above current levels given the political difficulties including the pay fors 
discussed earlier republicans would have accept smaller rate cuts they 
wanted those cuts permanent 
ambitious but sunsetting tax reform conversely the republicans are willing 
allow the tax reform sunset the end the year budget window they 
have flexibility cut rates levels nearer their current ambitions while curbing 
some the most contentious pay fors consider for example the possibility that 
republicans could use budget resolution pair lower revenue number with 
even larger declines later year expenditure numbers this could consistent 
with news reports that trump and republicans are exploring substantial cuts 
the size and scope the federal government this case and when compounded 
with dynamic scoring see strategy border adustability how tax reform 
could boon for usd december one could compared current law 
increase near term deficits while lowering deficits the later part the budget 
window achieving both near term fiscal stimulus and long term revenue neutrality 
versus the baseline 
exhibit difficult midterm election for

note includes two independents who caucus with democrats 
given that the president populist appeal least partly built message making 
bold changes boost economic growth and implicit faith that this will lead better 
outcomes think republicans will ultimately opt for number two republicans might 
find this approach has merit that works voters may reward them the midterm 
election which they already have numerical advantage putting filibuster proof 
senate majority reach and with the opportunity make tax cuts permanent 
hence now think republicans still have enough room maneuver deliver 
stimulus line with our economists expectations supporting gdp growth about 
and see economic outlook shot the arm november 
yet the risks are meaningful that these tensions lead one two outcomes that may 
disappoint markets 
tax reform changes too much too quickly emboldened the need hold the 
line deficits following the challenging optics permitting deficit growth the 
budget resolution albeit with the intention that permission being shortlived deficit hawks could exert their authority over the tax reform process order 
satisfy their demands while working within the confines the budget 
reconciliation process tax reform includes all currently proposed tax expenditure 
curbs and other revenue raisers the house blueprint others may considered 
addition given the potential need satisfy dynamic scoring demands see 
public policy taxes knowing half the battle december these tax 
changes border adjustability and limits interest deductions particular risk 
corporate finance disruption rotation wealth from certain sectors the 
economy others and potentially tighter conditions from stronger dollar 
hence there are several outcomes that could lessen the economic incentives 
created reforms 
tax reform failure becomes option the politics tax reform weren 
complicated enough there rising risk that becomes collateral damage the 
debate over how repeal the affordable care act aca obamacare rising 
displeasure among republicans about the risk increasing the uninsured they 
repeal aca without immediately replacing could delay this legislative process 
and tax reform consequence 
hence considering optimistic valuations and rising execution risks think would 
naive assert that this policy path definitively positive for risk markets rather 
think prudent recognize that investors may see these maneuvers and come 
less than optimistic conclusion return gridlock and negative unintended 
consequences are meaningful risks this would align with the sparkle and fade theme 
our global strategy team whereby envision investors optimism being exhausted over 
the course the year leading suboptimal performance key markets 
strategy usd strength cadmxn downside border adjustability represents 
potential large shock import and export competitiveness boosting usd through

interest deductibility could lessen the benefits lower tax rate that uncertainty 
could also reflected lower multiples see equity outlook the 
tension between higher earnings and lower multiples will you know when 
get out november hence while our cross asset strategy team believes 
global equities will continue perform the near term they prefer expressing 
that view through and japan markets over the 
credit strategy tough risk reward skew for corporate credit corporate credit 
leverage remains high and optimism that tax reform executed could alleviate 
this problem overdone our view interest deductibility goes away capital 
structure shifts would likely take years materialize while the headwind 
earnings could immediate furthermore animal spirits are rising that should 
drive more debt issuance all else equal not less given heightened uncertainty

taxing the border adjustments and alternatives 
todd castagno 
our base case that the etter way border adjustability proposal would not survive 
intact was bolstered recent days cautionary statements from key republican 
leaders president trump himself recently criticized the measure too complicated 
the senate primary choke point only takes three republican defectors derail 
reform perhaps telling sign senate leadership has yet fully weigh the 
specifics the house tax reform draft appearing take wait and see approach 
instead 
house leadership entrenched keeping their border adjustability feature given that 
fulfills key trade policy objective and estimated raise trillion revenue 
over years fund lower corporate tax rates however votes cannot secured 
then leadership may have pivot explore adjustments and alternatives the fully 
adjustable destination based cash flow tax proposed 
phase the border adjustment gratuitous transition period may ease tension 
the business community and serve policy objective incentivizing immediate 
onshoring production allowing companies front run the border adjustments 
however such transition would negatively impact budgetary scoring and likely require 
deficit financing corresponding phasing lower corporate and business tax rates 
long transition period would subject the reform effort the election cycle and 
potential unwinding political power shifts 
partial border adjustment another potential option would keep the broad 
structure the destination based cash flow tax but limit the effective rate the 
border adjustment allowing partial deduction for imports and partially tax 
exports president trump adviser tom barrack recently suggested reduced border 
adjustment versus however this limitation would likely add complexity 
already complex system and would have negative implications for revenue neutrality 
would also distort the economic underpinnings pure destination based cash flow 
system 
targeted tax outsourcing policymakers could also pursue targeted approach 
applying import tax multinationals that shift production abroad and import 
back into the marketplace president trump appeared support such policy when 
recently said company that wants fire all its people the united states 
and build some factory someplace else and then thinks that that product gonna just 
flow across the border into the united states that not gonna happen they gonna 
have tax pay border tax substantial border tax combined with lower 
corporate rate this carrot and stick approach may help achieve policy objectives 
however see perhaps even more difficulty securing votes for targeted tax than 
broader border adjustability 
income tax and vat hybrid system perhaps the most practical and sensible but most 
politically inconvenient approach hybrid taxation system consisting business 
income tax supplemented with traditional sales type destination vat tax this would 
put the system par with nearly all other industrialized trading partners the salestype vat would act national sales tax and would easier design and administer 
than the untried subtraction based vat the house gop proposal however 
republicans have long opposed adding another layer tax due fears that will 
eventually result revenue grab and will increase government bureaucracy 
tax reform possible unintended consequences 
highlight four potential nintended consequences tax reform that aren yet part 
the investor consensus our view these aren necessarily our base case but worth 
illustrating risk factors the markets could begin countenance policymaking gets 
into full swing washington 
corporate tax reform cuts interest deductibility making 
current leverage levels even less manageable 
note two strains optimism around corporate tax reform the first belief that 
limiting the deductibility net interest expense will prove positive for corporate 
credit incentivizing lower leverage the second the hope that corporate tax reform 
will ignite growth thereby extending the cycle see the potential for disappointment 
both points 
first although firms may tweak their capital structures think that any material 
changes would take place over many years not months rather the hit earnings 
could immediate the tax rate would have fall for the median high yield 
issuer break even given the loss interest deductibility all else equal 
addition are fact heading into environment better growth and less 
regulation this should drive more debt issuance the near term not less even the 
tax shield goes away the cost debt still relatively low versus historical levels and 
thus could fuel spending capex and stock buybacks especially animal spirits 
are rising 
exhibit even assuming the loss the tax shield the cost debt still reasonably low 
after tax cost debt 
yield

source morgan stanley research the citigroup index llc note assumes tax rate calculate after tax cost debt 
most importantly leverage already very high levels and for much this cycle 
many have argued that the high leverage manageable because rates are low 
show below and outlined uncovering rising interest january based only 
leverage many the largest issuers would rated quite bit lower average 
than they are today sense the ratings agencies are giving companies with too much 
leverage pass because elevated interest coverage among other factors 
therefore the ability deduct interest expense goes away making more 
challenging for companies service their high debt loads current leverage levels may 
become less manageable especially rates keep rising can see how this good 
thing the short term holding all else constant while leverage may trend lower over 
many years our guess that the biggest decline leverage will come after the next 
credit cycle this almost always how works 
exhibit some cases low rates are justifying better ratings than what leverage levels would 
imply 
implied ratings financial strength metric

second though lower tax rates could fuel stronger growth are skeptical that this 
dynamic would extend the cycle fact quite the opposite the extent fiscal 
stimulus drives increased animal spirits while leverage already high and pushes 
central banks withdraw liquidity faster think that anything this risks earlier 
turn the credit cycle 
summing are not arguing that corporate tax reform bad thing for our credit 
universe any means simply believe that the reality may turn out less 
exciting than what markets are pricing with some unintended consequences 
corporate tax rates will fall but likely not all the way the tax preference items 
that could away like interest deductibility are clear offset lower tax rates 
border adjustability would net cost for companies with obvious winners and losers 
certain tax changes could lead lower leverage over many years but pressure already 
highly levered balance sheets the short term and finally better growth could lead 
less central bank support which credit markets have relied for many years our 
view uncertainty has rarely been higher this cycle and credit valuations have rarely 
been richer think this combination argues for improving the quality portfolios 
into this rally not chasing yield 
border adjustability backfires and stagflation takes hold 
proponents border adjustability assume that the dollar will adjust offset 
effective tax imports but the dollar fails adjust fully our strategists 
believe net importing companies will have raise prices avoid losses the effect 
may also compounded the fact that importers won immediately benefit from 
lower import costs most these goods are already priced usd given that many 
companies lack comparable domestic supply chains higher costs could passed onto 
consumers inflationary result 
this could put the fed difficult spot particularly consumers respond higher 
prices cutting back spending causing growth falter our economists though 
constructive the consumer also contend that the household sector remains one that 
cautious and very much price intolerant see economics and equity strategy 
consumer outlook january rising inflation and unemployment would 
bad combination for risk appetite 
key issue with the gop blueprint the inadequate proposed treatment business 
losses net exporters and capital intensive firms abnormal growth stages would incur 
more frequent and greater taxable losses relative today income based tax system 
conceivable that net exporter may never generate domestic taxable income recent 
treasury study estimates that nearly firms would have incurred losses under 
destination based cash flow tax system the gop blueprint proposes that operating 
losses carried forward indefinitely with compensating return for inflation however 
this likely insufficient policy without immediate rebates the inability monetize 
losses breaks the symmetry the border adjustment mechanism where imports will 
bear the full burden the import tax but exports will only recognize partial subsidy 
could also lead perverse corporate behavior such activity and the creation 
joint venture entities motivated import export balancing 
stronger dollar leads lower eps despite 
repatriation fueled buybacks 
further dollar strength could weigh eps our equity strategists estimate 
that rise usdeur impacts eps about larger question for markets 
therefore whether repatriation fueled buybacks can outweigh the eps impact 
stronger dollar 
stronger dollar leads stress emerging markets and 
china 
usd rallies close the textbook case trade weighted basis importer 
and exporter prospects may relatively unchanged and the economy may not 
significantly impacted the aggregate however such sharp rise usd risks 
destabilizing emerging markets and china particular have written that the pboc 
would allow usdcny rise under border adjustment scenario but less than the rise expect for the broad usd see strategy how tax reform could 
boon for usd december expect that would successful dealing 
with capital outflow pressure tightening the capital account further and using 
intervention necessary however possible that significant rise usd would 
cause severe stress china leading substantial capital outflows and increasing the 
likelihood large devaluation for broader emerging markets sharp rise usd 
poses risks for companies with large amounts usd denominated debt see 
global fixed income outlook alpha trumps beta november stress 
particularly from china could easily spill over into global financial markets and cause 
fall risk appetite and even recession
