that the bill excludes real property trade business from the term trade 
business the term real property trade business defined under code 
any real property development redevelopment construction 
reconstruction acquisition conversion rental operation management leasing 
brokerage trade business please see our tax reform thoughts for our 
prior views after the release the tax reform framework from the big six 
why important our october report entitled losing interest 
argued that potential elimination reduction the interest deduction would 
remove one the two primary benefits owning cre depreciation being the 
other and have negative implications for cre valuations various degrees 
general rule you may deduct interest but not principal money you borrow 
for the purchase improvement property our sensitivity analysis estimated 
reduction property prices depending the reduction the 
interest deduction under various tax rates 
reit dividends taxed also note that the legislation applies 
maximum percent rate certain dividends from real estate investment 
trust reit currently they are taxed ordinary income that currently carries 
maximum tax rate but proposed max under the current 
legislation 
also bullish for multifamily high cost areas also note that the legislation 
preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages and 
maintains the home mortgage interest deduction for newly purchased homes
