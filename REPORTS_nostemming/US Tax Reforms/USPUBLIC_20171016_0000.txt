tax reform deficits 
moderate raise the stakes 
will tax reform blow out the deficit think not given 
senate constraints risks our base case skewed toward 
legislative failure yet while this base case isn gamechanger remain vigilant for certain signposts that seen 
set bond market drama all none deficit choice 
there appears understandable confusion over 
how much tax legislation could expand the deficit 
there increasing embrace the idea growthfinanced tax cuts permission narrative for deficit 
expansion some republicans who had been vocal 
deficit hawks during the obama administration that 
key administration officials have suggested 
revenue losses will made growth only 
further fuels speculation that bill which substantially increases deficits looms 
the likely outcome moderated plan with limited deficit expansion because 
the alternative higher risk failure the senate the key understanding 
outcomes because their budget rules and thin majority you only need 
handful deficit hawk voices force bill whose expected deficit expansion 
far more modest than levels implied the recent tax blueprint hence cohn 
mnuchin and conservative republicans may continue embrace their inner 
laffer and advocate for the idea that tax cuts will fund themselves through 
substantial growth however there likely not sufficient faith that view the 
senate drive votes change budget rules and adoption similarly 
aggressive growth assumptions for the tax bill scoring hence the proposal 
either moderates probabilities tax legislation failure begin rise 
our base case moderation doesn develop then likelihood success falls 
higher stakes volatile moment could emerge for the bond market signposts 
moderated plan would include least some the following smaller rate 
cuts new pay fors approach the end the year without some those 
details emerging then the dynamic could shift higher stakes choice 
deficits without lower rates more pay fors senate republican leadership 
could feel pressure abandon their current awk friendly approach adopt 
aggressive dynamic scoring and enable legislation with substantially higher 
potential deficits while that would alienate key members reducing the odds 
passage would set all none style vote deficits relative our 
current base case which neutral for bond markets this would risk volatile 
curve steepening moment before returning trend investors consider 
potentially boosted gdp expectations and the fed reaction function

senate deficit downer 
common question being asked how much could tax reform legislation increase 
the deficit next year important question helps define the potential for 
gdp boost next year and consequently the fed reaction also source confusion 
given the increasing embrace the idea growth financed tax cuts permission 
narrative for deficit expansion some republicans who had been visibly hawkish 
deficits during the obama administration our view that key administration officials 
like gary cohn and steve mnuchin have suggested revenue losses will 
made growth only further fuels the perception that bill which substantially 
increases the deficit the offing 
given this confusion want offer deeper breakdown our view that the 
senate budget rules and prevailing politics should restrain deficit expansion and 
accordingly near term gdp effects the punchline this cohn mnuchin and 
conservative republicans may continue believe and advocate for the idea that tax 
cuts will fund themselves through substantial growth however there likely not 
sufficient faith that view the senate drive votes change budget rules and 
adoption similarly aggressive growth assumptions for the tax bill scoring hence

source morgan stanley research unified framework for fixing our broken tax code committee for responsible federal budget 
let start breaking down how the senate position helps define deficit 
expectations from tax reform you might aware the senate budget committee 
passed budget resolution permitting deficit expansion over years order 
accommodate tax reform this begged the question from some investors about 
whether this actually set the table for much bigger deficit expansion and 
consequently more meaningful boost growth and inflation expectations 
particular the theory deficit floor went 
the senate can change the budget rules allow for dynamic scoring currently 
senate rules prohibit the use more than one set economic assumptions 
and overrule the parliamentarian she tells them dynamic score cannot 
used for rulings points order under the byrd rule 
then the can deficit left over after accounting for growth risking actual 
deficits even higher those dynamic effects don work 
potential deficits are further augmented the senate replaces the jct and its 
more conservative dynamic scoring approach official scorers the tax 
legislation something senate budget chair enzi appears have the power 
while recognize this floor theory hypothetically possible think more 
likely that actually deficit ceiling consider 
senate rules don currently allow dynamic scoring for budget reconciliation 
compliance think has the most any bill can scored add 
the deficit under any method 
the vote count change those rules doesn appear reliable when you consider 
the positions deficits hawks corker enzi and senate process purists mccain 
collins murkowski further that similar rule change was not considered 
facilitate aca repeal despite its political urgency tells something about the 
chamber reluctance change its rules 
elaborate senator corker has been vocal his declarations about not 
supporting tax action that increases the deficit think that corker comments 
should read wanting dynamic scoring pay for that brings the cost 
the bill down not allow for increased deficits above that are brought 
back down that level 
senator todd young has echoed these sentiments 
the senate budget committee chairman mike enzi has final say over score and 
according the new york times thus far does not appear inclined make radical 
changes the rules 
for what its worth independent budget analysts with more direct experience than 
like bill hoagland the bipartisan policy center have stated their agreement 
with the idea ceiling 
yet even you agree more with the floor than the ceiling theory deficit expansion 
expectations still appear consistent with our range gdp you assume the 
jct stays the official scorer then their recent history scoring tax cuts would suggest 
they likely give credit for gdp growth 
exhibit dynamic revenue estimates likely relatively modest

further appears that the jct and cbo dynamic scoring models assume crowdingout effect which may dampen the benefit any deficit financed tax cut from 
scoring perspective for example the cbo noted its life cycle growth model that 
the model requires specification future fiscal policies that put federal debt 
sustainable path over the long run forward looking households would not hold 
government bonds they expected that debt share gdp would rise without 
limit said differently the cbo noted that when the deficit goes one dollar 
private savings estimated rise cents national savings falls cents and 
net capital inflows rise cents ultimately leaving decline cents 
investment although the jct and not the cbo scores tax legislation the cbo 
explanation appears similar the jct overlapping generations olg model the jct 
says its olg model that perfect foresight means the model cannot solve fiscal 
policy not sustainable though its meg model may feature myopic individuals and 
business which turn could allow simulation nonsustainable fiscal policy 
paper three economists the jct discussed how model five percentage point 
reduction the corporate income tax rate financed entirely deficits the economists 
concluded that gdp would rise only they argued the longer run the 
accumulated capital stock supports higher employment and consumption maintaining 
increase gdp but increasing interest rates due increased government 
borrowing slows the build the capital stock reducing saving result the fiscal 
picture begins deteriorate brief deficit financed tax cut increase investment 
may end having little effect investment and therefore growth higher deficits 
lead higher interest rates which makes borrowing invest more expensive now 
worth noting that the relationship between debt and interest rates controversial 
topic record high deficits occurring concurrently with record low interest rates 
remains striking contrast earlier quantitative studies from the mid but 
not think recent experience will cause the jct and cbo substantially work their 
dynamic models 
further consider this simplified example the degree which deficit expansion 
could enabled growth assumptions legislative scoring not possess the 
information replicate the dynamic scoring process the jct and others but offer 
this simple conservative approach show how deficit expansion potential limited 
first start with the principle that the score assumed growth tax revenue equal 
the potential deficit growth either absolute terms ceiling addition the 
senate approved deficit floor said differently assumed tax revenue growth 
potential deficit growth should dynamic effects not materialize then add fixed 
percent current year cbo baseline gdp very roughly approximate how 
dynamic score might change then calculate the hypothetical score assumed tax 
revenue growth mutilplying incremental gdp the current share gdp that 
goes federal tax revenues finally assume that the average the annual implied 
tax revenue growth year deficit growth capacity this straight line approach 
consistent with dynamic deficit scores for prior tax actions given their phases 
approach which assume will apply this action 
the table below then shows deficit expansion assumption covers most 
reasonable outcomes you assume the range jct growth assumptions will apply 
even the deficit expansion more front loaded for example twice the annual 
average extra deficit the deficit growth not substantially higher this instance 
assuming that forecasted gdp growth not realized then the increase deficits 
would range between versus 
exhibit deficit growth potential gdp 
ceiling 
floor 
dynamic scoring assumption gdp step 
source morgan stanley research 
hence key takeaway from our admittedly simplified analysis this for deficits 
expand more meaningful impactful way narrative must develop that causes 
republicans see other way forward but battle senate deficit hawks and their 
explicitly stated views and intentions while certainly not our base case explore this 
possibility and signposts for the next section investors can prepare for this 
possibility 
what would make wrong the high pressure hail mary 
scenario 
the key vulnerabilities our above analysis are 
the power the senate budget chair enzi substitute more aggressive dynamic 
score for the expected conservative score the jct thereby increasing potential 
deficit expansion for example the tax foundation scored the house gop blueprint 
increasing the level gdp which least four times greater than how 
the jct scored the tax reform act the camp plan 
the potential for conferenced budget resolution that raises the deficit ceiling 
above extends the budget window beyond years 
yet given the evidence above that such moves would risk alienating enough votes 
imperil the bill would interpret such move gambit bill whose prospects 
are waning said differently would attempt force republican senators 
register public vote expecting that they would not vote against party orthodoxy 
tax cuts this similar the dynamic that played out aca repeal replace 
what would suggest that tax reform prospects are falling while this high pressure 
hail mary approach becoming more likely watch for the following signs that 
suggest the current framework can effectively moderated 
red lines key rates the corporate rate proposal fail moderate 
existing pay for proposals like elimination salt deduction and limitation 
corporate interest deduction are watered down removed without 
commensurate reduction proposed rate cuts 
congress starts without making substantial progress key tax debates 
perhaps due government shutdown and daca deliberations december 
while this not our central expectation think investors should attuned this 
narrative packs greater potential market impact than our base case moderated 
tax bill bear case tax failure our cross asset and equity strategy team continue 
argue that risk assets the relative and absolute basis are not pricing 
expectation positive growth shock from tax driven stimulus hence think our 
base case modest expansion and bear case tax failure would likely not change the 
current market dynamic however the igh pressure hail mary brings different 
dynamic argued earlier shift this dynamic would likely skew the odds against 
tax reform happening but did happen would now likely come with substantial 
enough deficit expansion matter for example simple annual average the 
revenue loss the cost the current framework without any pay fors would suggest 
potential deficit expansion around gdp hence the tax legislation 
vote would become more meaningful all none event deficits for markets 
this would set dynamic where vote uncertainty causes the bond market start 
pricing some meaningful fiscal stimulus and reactive tightening from the fed while 
this likely supports our rates strategy team outlook for continued bear flattening 
the yield curve could become more volatile ride arrive there 
specifically the choice was looking like all nothing affair expect bond yields 
would rise led longer maturities risk premium both real rate and inflation for 
higher deficits and uncertainty would begin price but investor skepticism would 
prevent disorderly move first given the precedent failure healthcare reform 
the event passage the subsequent move higher rates would depend the size 
the static increase the deficit over the next few years investors would likely 
assume higher coupon issuance across the curve with the treasury continuing its 
strategy extending the weighted average maturity issuance the long end would 
initially suffer from speculation over ultra long issue resurfacing 
ultimately the increased issuance likely would pressure intermediate maturity 
treasuries more than other sectors the curve intermediates would also suffer from 
related expectations either consequent faster pace rate hikes and speedier 
balance sheet normalization profile depending the inclinations the next fed 
chair 
once the increased deficit was the price the yield curve would continue its flattening
