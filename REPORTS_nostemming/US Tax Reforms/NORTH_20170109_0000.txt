potential tax changes and the border adjustment would boon for 
most energy stocks have received large number requests during the 
first week the new year related the proposed tax reforms while there 
gordian knot permutations related how the proposed tax rate 
reduction would funded and implemented analyze the key elements 
the house brady plan reduction the corporate tax rate and the 
imposition border adjustability the border tax adjustment the element that 
would significantly affect energy companies because crude oil the single 
largest import into the economy the key potential effects for 
energy include increase the price oil wti above the price 
international oil brent which bbl the current front month brent 
price refiners arbitrage the value cheaper crudes increase the 
price gasoline and all refined products gal driven higher 
costs with modestly negative effect gasoline demand and the retail 
consumer increased financial incentive export higher volumes 
refined products with higher margin than current helping offset the lower 
utilization effect moderately positive effect natural gas prices 
canadian gas imports are lowered based price exporting mexico becomes 
more attractive and limited effect lng exports and some downward 
pressure global crude demand based potential net upward effects the 
usd from tax change and higher domestic product prices 
who would win oil producers highlight mro clr and all 
companies levered higher producer activity oilfield services and oily 
midstream companies would the clearest beneficiaries with higher relative 
commodity prices the changes would also translate higher future 
production growth and more resilient production profile given the new effective 
tax cushion for commodity prices for instance expect bbl increase 
crude prices would result production response one year

midstream advanced oil growth rates would positively affect the demand for 
infrastructure see boon for for relative exposure and leverage price 
and price mix changes overall border adjustment tax would support 
progression from our base bull cases for affected names for refiners 
that can meaningfully sell product offshore psx mpc and vlo the potential 
beneficial tax treatment for exports could prove net positive 
who would lose refiners that rely imported oil and lack the ability 
materially export would realize modest negative effect pbf tso hfc yet 
far less than initial consensus this not inversion the golden age 
expect modest negative impact the transitionary quarter higher oil 
prices and modest effect from lower demand due higher product prices 
with positive offset from higher exports the consumer would lose with 
higher product prices brent negatively affected from both higher usd and 
lower domestic demand and non oil resource negatively affected 
rises further the relative cost curve affecting both international activity and 
relative asset value cdn producers would face the risk wider crude and 
natural gas differentials with production being incrementally less competitive 
the market the biggest export destination while the strengthening usd 
provides some offset 
what actually happens unclear what and what form anything will 
enacted new tax law with limited current guidance other than the house 
brady plan there also debate whether wto and nafta provision will 
prevent the change believe there policy support for oil tax help fund 
the corporate rate reduction and support energy independence and related 
job growth there also policy against border tax because would raise the 
price gasoline price hike borne essentially all voters historically 
political third rail third party and our external sources handicap the border 
adjustment probability see our earlier piece the potential impact 
the trump administration energy making refining great again 
what the border adjustment import tax 
the border adjustment provision that associated with the republican plan 
reduce the corporate tax rate believe corporate tax reform priority 
for the incoming trump presidental administration and with newly elected republican 
and house majorities believe there high likelihood tax reform passage the 
border adjustment becoming more broadly debated and unclear this feature 
its current form will enacted june the house gop proposed its tax 
reform blueprint better way convert the corporate income tax into 
destination based cash flow taxation system where the tax jurisdiction follows the 
location consumption rather than the location production eliminate the 
self imposed export penalty and import subsidy given many its trading partners that 
have value added taxes vats place 
achieve this border adjustment proposed that excludes exports from tax and 
disallows deductions for the cost imports the intent this adjustment combined 
with the lowering corporate taxes from and switching the worldwide 
tax approach territorial system attract domestic investment and halt reverse 
the trend american business moving overseas theorized that the policy trade 
neutral the usd should appreciate offset the border adjustment 
credit exports and corresponding disallowance for import deductions absent full 
foreign exchange offset border adjustability would benefit net exporters and hinder net 
importers retailers and multinationals with international supply chains are particularly 
exposed

what are the potential consequences for energy 
higher domestic crude prices and potentially invert the brent wti spread the 
currently imports mmbpd oil almost all imported refiners who import 
foreign crude for feedstock domestic barrels would have higher value the refiner 
than imported barrels and exported barrels would have more value the producer 
differing amounts the effective tax difference believe there are two ways that 
the value could arbitrage producer exporting the domestic barrel exploit 
the lower tax rate exports largely applies majors the refiner running 
more domestic crudes the expense imports due the tax difference believe 
the range that domestic crude price need move close the arb ranges 
bbl relative international prices with the range reflecting whether the refiner 
imports crude feedstock export product see exhibit below 
the proposed border adjusted tax policy passes believe refiners would 
incentivized shift towards using much domestic crude possible avoid losing 
the tax deductibility feedstock costs holding all else equal estimate domestic 
crude prices would need increase much bbl the point refiners are 
agnostic between using domestic oil imported oil arb closes refiners are also 
incentivized sell product overseas much possible given export revenue will not 
taxable such the high end the aforementioned range potential domestic 
crude movement bbl represents the incremental higher domestic feedstock 
cost exporting refiners will tolerate before the arb closes the end expect some 
sharing this margin between upstream and downstream with the low end 
representing the likely maximum appreciation our view today wti price

the potential net benefit the producer more complicated yet for tax paying 
producer major estimate bbl benefit exporting the reason the benefit 
lower because deductions remain for the exported barrel loe and transportation 
costs other markets bbl for instance gom barrel sold bbl with 
operating cost would worth bbl bbl transport more export 
than domestic sale most are not tax payers given capex spend yet majors are 
and would balancing mechanism the arbitrage also volumetrically limited the 
ability back out imported light crudes currently the ability the existing 
refining system further tilt lighter crude slate given economic incentive and 
lastly production tax paying producers ultimately once all levers are 
maximized crude the premium domestic crudes ends 
higher gasoline prices and potentially higher cracks anticipate the relative higher 
level feedstock cost will eventually passed through the consumer the 
form higher product prices gasoline distillate etc mathematically hold 
refining crack constant increase feed stock cost would translate 
increase product prices hold the crack constant today gasoline and diesel 
prices this translates increase gallon furthermore believe there the 
potential will see higher overall cracks margin product imports are disincentivized 
and refiners will export much possible given the economic benefit drawing down 
domestic product inventories expect higher exports ultimately offset the 
decrease domestic demand from higher prices yet also put downward pressure

higher activity estimate that bbl increase wti rounded for 
illustrative purposes would accelerate production growth the 
first full year after being implemented our estimate conservatively based 
managements sticking the same level percentage outspend under both base case 
strip and border tax scenarios see further upside volumes higher crude price 
environment improves availability funding beyond that generated organically via 
more even more receptive equity and asset markets accelerated activity should 
flow through greater oil field services demand lifting land drilling day rates 
and pressure pumping prices top the base case strip escalation 
our numbers higher production growth turn should incrementally loosen global 
crude supply demand exerting bearish pressure pricing yet discussion these 
second order implications beyond the scope this note addition expect these 
moderate given the tightness crude balance see for dearth fids 
during downcycle begins reflected offshore production and the market ability 
absorb annual production increases out the during the prior 
upcycle 
inland differentials are likely expand over the long run with higher domestic crude 
prices would anticipate increase activity highlight the permian bakken

the company level could see some negative impact oil price realizations 
relative wti are forced resort trucking oil where gathering not yet 
place most likely the permian and stack however also believe infrastructure 
solutions are easier texas especially with new administration may also see 
widening and more volatile canadian crude differentials are focused wcs and 
sco here refiners shift preference domestic crude sources much they can 
and the return crude production growth combined with continued canadian 
volumes cause takeaway concerns canada reemerge canadian heavy crudes are 
largely price takers would expect downward price action clear the markets 
also expect canadian natural gas prices aeco face headwinds with wider 
basis becomes incrementally less competitive domestic natural gas 
production particularly the eastern market chicago dawn where already facing 
market share competition from the marcellus and utica 
usd expected rise but not enough completely neutralize impact our 
strategists believe the border adjustment would likely cause large usd appreciation 
reasonable their view but unlikely fully offset the effects the border 
adjustability provision textbook model would say that usd would immediately 
appreciate offset the full effects border adjustment economically similar 
export subsidy combined with import tariff however the empirical 
breakdown purchasing power parity ppp the short run global supply chains and 
concerns about sharp wto led response will likely limit full usd offset please see

refining impact would less severe than first appears with 
many net beneficiaries 
anticipate for the proposal act near term overhang for refiners until 
there clarity the border adjustment tax proposal has created concern for the 
refining industry many refiners rely imported crude feedstock and the proposed 
policy would remove the ability for the cost those barrels deducted when 
calculating taxable income making those barrels incrementally more expensive pbf 
mpc and psx import the most relative operations our coverage exhibit 
however believe the ultimate impact would not bad first seems 
think there could some potential negative impact the initial adjustment period 
the proposal put place the short term refiners would likely shift towards using 
domestic crude much possible avoid losing the tax deductility feedstock 
costs believe this would bid domestic crude prices the point where refiners are 
agnostic between domestic and imported oil anticipate the higher absolute level 
cost will eventually passed through the consumer the form higher product 
prices gasoline distillate etc mathematically for brent based crack bbl increase crude prices translates gallon increase gas prices holding 
all else equal our view the two determining factors how much refining margins 
would impacted during the transitionary period the time takes for product 
prices correct the new equilibrium the faster the response the less squeeze for 
refiners one may argue this could happen immediately given its policy driven change 
and not gradual market evolution and the product price response not 
immediate the amount and time refiner can shift towards domestic source the 
interim expect more complex refiners less nimble shifting away from 
heavy slates run less optimally the long run higher product prices may have 
negative impact demand which would met with overall lower refining utilization 
rates 
and likely net positive for select few believe the policy proposal exempt 
taxation export revenues would highly incentivize refiners sell their products 
offshore the economics provide strong offset the loss tax deductibility 
imported feedstock and some cases net benefit estimate psx can export 
its production vlo can export with plans increase 
although timing unclear and mpc can export with plans increase this 
exhibit see exhibit the economic advantage exporting 
provides broadly speaking estimate for every barrels crude refiner imports 
they can offset the higher feedstock stock exporting barrels product holding 
all else equal exhibit estimate the potential net effect the border 
adjustability tax policy for each company with their current import trends and known 
export capacity holding all pricing constant and not accounting for the ability shift 
alternate crude sources see psx and vlo potentially experiencing net benefit 
given their respective ability export meaningful amount products pbf tso and 
hfc would face the greatest headwinds given their limited ability export and relative 
use imported crude exhibit layer the impact the proposed lower 
corporate tax and see that when combined the majority refiners would largely 
come out ahead with these two new tax proposals from broader market basis 
believe the increased incentive export products combined with less product being 
imported into the more expensive would likely lead the drawing down 
domestic product inventories providing offset the aforementioned risk 
domestic demand decrease 
wider differentials over time may emerge with higher domestic crude prices higher 
domestic crude prices may induce production growth leading the potential wider 
inland crude differentials permian and bakken benefiting refiners that are the 
position capture the wider margin while the widening many domestic crude 
differentials should benefit inland refiners are cognizant that the sweet sour 
differential could narrow due the higher level production sweet when opec 
production sour expected decline thus for refiners like mpc who generally run 
meaningful amount sour crude could see less margin capture for the barrels they 
are unable shift domestic source 
impact refining stocks the tax change does happen believe pbf would 
the most vulnerable the potential negative impacts the border adjustment tax 
alone given its merchant refining structure high weight the refining business exhibit 
reliance imported crude feedstock and limited ability currently export product 
although the company looking increasing this side the business already 
believe psx and vlo both potentially may see net benefit given their abilities 
export companies with more diversified business structures would also have less 
concentration risk while the ones with strong mlp midstream exposure would benefit 
from the higher upstream activity and production the long run mpc wnr and
