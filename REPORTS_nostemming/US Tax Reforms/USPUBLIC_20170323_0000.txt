public policy brief 
fish cut bait 
the ahca vote matters less than why delayed what 
republicans next fiscal conservatives seem emboldened 
risks are the long side our already delayed tax timing 
this supports our view that the odds market friendly tax 
outcomes are eclipsed the sum less friendly ones

healthcare politics impact the timing content 
tax fiscal policy republicans are 
attempting pass the american health care act 
ahca and tax reform through budget 
reconciliation order sidestep democratic 
filibuster because they have already approved 
the budget resolution with reconciliation 
instructions that are intended for repealing aca 
unlikely that they pass tax reform until ahca either approved 
abandoned hence delays the ahca process risk delays tax reform 
the timing which already pushed out based its own 
complexity further ahca difficult path passage despite republican 
majority function heretofore unmet demands conservatives this 
signals bolder stance for fiscal hawks which may limit the potential for 
tax reform meet market friendly goals 
timing fish cut bait the success the house vote matters less 
than what republicans must decide next they spend considerable time 
pursuing bill changes which may not possible that are both 
reconciliation friendly and pass muster with all republican factions 
they move either giving the bill quick down vote the 
senate should the house approve the bill going back the drawing 
board bill that can pass through regular order the former certainly 
increases risks the long side our tax expectation and could cause 
push back our expected timing further the latter keeps pace with 
our timeline but still longer than republicans current stated 
intentions given anticipated complexities 
content hawks soar either situation the result demonstrates that 
conservatives who also tend fiscal hawks are not easy persuade 
about softening their key demands the read through for tax that 
outcomes conforming deficit hawk desires which cut against market 
optimism are meaningful probability smaller than expected cuts 
inclusion border tax and interest deduction curbs are all ways 
achieve non fiscal stimulus reforms 
risks skewed toward delay disappoint hence affirm our view that 
due the nature the fixed income market the issuers 
bonds the issuers recommended discussed this 
report may not continuously followed accordingly 
investors must regard this report providing stand alone 
analysis and should not expect continuing analysis
