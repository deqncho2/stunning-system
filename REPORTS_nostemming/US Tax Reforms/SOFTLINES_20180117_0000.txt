available through their own store fleet website and certain cases wholesale

brands given superior performance characteristics stringent fit requirements

these brands possess some element emotional content customers are not 
simply buying bra bracelet there aspirational component while not all

forecast eps our base case growth including tax reform benefit

guidance pattern prefer keep our eps estimate the range where 
think management could guide eps our base case forecast assumes 
comp bbw and total revenue growth given the anniversarying 
the week the week forecast bps gross margin recovery 
top bps and bps decline assume slight buying and 
occupancy deleverage comp given store remodels and net square footage 
growth offset bps merchandise margin expansion which could prove 
conservative given bps two year cumulative decline forecast dollars

together model just bps increase total company ebit margin 
assuming bps increase north america ebit margin bbw ebit margin 
bps roughly line with the two year average run rate and international ebit 
dollars profit this year which again could prove 
conservative also assume tax rate line with initial management guidance 
all this yields our base case eps eps growth even this could 
above where management conservatively guides given volatility and inconsistency over 
the past months historically management has guided next year eps within 
band typically cent range thus depending where final 
eps shakes out think management could guide eps even consensus which includes mix estimates including excluding tax 
reform 
two key drivers could yield upside our base case forecasts 
victoria secret north america one key driver our bull case victoria secret 
north america ebit margin likely ends bps below estimate roughly 
bps this decline was driven lower merchandise margin clearing through 
swim apparel and rebalancing intimate apparel inventory bralette pressure 
beauty and additional promotional activity attribute the remaining 
bps decline buying occupancy and other expense deleverage our 
base case assume just bps ebit margin recovery but our bull 
case could recover nearly double that amount driven bps merchandise 
margin recovery and bps leverage comp revenue growth 
excluding the week likely takes more than two years fully recover bps ebit margin decline but bps recovery next year possible victoria 
secret can deliver consistent comps lower promotions 
while china the other the second upside opportunity not contemplated our 
base case model the china operating loss with forecasted see the deepest 
international loss estimate china will lose this year the entirety 
international ebit dollar decline plus additional due preopening rent and infrastructure investments our bull case china should generate 
revenue the end and this year operating loss could 
improve loss this alone provides pre tax profit 
boost most which not contemplated our base case model 
special dividend could return spring has strong history paying regular 
and special dividends and has paid least one special dividend the last fiscal 
years given financial underperformance not expect special dividend 
however with the incremental cash flow from lower tax rate

noted midwest store volumes won fully catch the chain average store 
volumes mature markets continue comp positively driving the chain average higher

outperformance enhancing overall company ebit margin 
investment home within existing stores likely boosts store productivity home 
represents only revenue for rost for tjx and management sees 
opportunity for growth new and existing categories rost plans grow the category 
within existing stores rather than operating standalone store fleet and inventory 
reductions have freed more room for larger home categories like furniture our view 
this likely the right decision for shareholder value and roic over the medium term 
and coulensus drive near term boosts store productivity 
valuation optically rich however tax reform not yet consensus estimates 
rost currently trades eps turn premium its year average 
while valuation seems rich believe consensus estimates have not yet factored tax 
reform driving multiple expansion eps estimates trail market expectations for 
lower tax rate model tax rate eps consensus 
consensus begins take the lower corporate tax rate into account 
expect industry wide multiples return pre reform levels that said rost 
demonstrated can consistently deliver where peers have faltered considering

these factors well strong consumer confidence but also stated some kss 
strategic initiatives may contributing well however until see evidence kss

skeptical therefore not forecast positive full year comp beyond kss 
has partially mitigated declining traffic introducing under armour its

young leased store fleet years remaining leases average makes fleet 
rationalization less likely well finally kss does not have clear take out story such 
jwn though others have speculated about amazon purchase kss think 
this less likely because amazon has already successfully penetrated the category 
making pricey acquisition less attractive 
ultimately kohl just another department store story kss faces the same structural 
headwinds its peers department stores remain structural share donors kss 
private brand sales trends remain weak and greater penetration lower margin 
national brands now continue drive gross margin lower and store traffic and 
volumes continue shift online driving wall margin deleverage and higher variable

equate this letting wolf herd flock sheep commend management

ytd ytd not expect this trend reverse tax reform will likely 
increase kss ability increase buybacks however management has stated investing
