frequently asked questions faqs 
received many inquiries how tax reform impacts the reported effective tax and 
income tax accounting below compiled short list the most asked questions 
however please contact you have question that isn addressed 
many companies state they are booking provisional amounts 
due the change tax law what does that mean 
under gaap companies are required recognize the effect tax law changes 
the period enactment have seen far this earnings cycle companies are 
reporting the impact the accounting period that includes december for 
calendar year end companies this means fiscal year accounting for the change 
the enacted tax rate includes remeasuring deferred taxes and reassessing the 
sustainability tax carryforwards and reserve requirements 
recognizing that companies may struggle complete the accounting financial 
reporting deadlines the securities and exchange commission sec issued guidance 
allowing one year window for companies finalize their accounting companies are 
required book provisional amounts only when they can reasonably estimate the 
impact the new law adjustments provisional amounts are required 
recognized the period adjustment not retroactive thus investors should expect 
some degree volatility tax rates for instance there still high degree 
uncertainty how measure the deemed repatriation liability for multinationals 
the treasury and irs are expected issue guidance soon notice that will 
likely require companies true their liability estimate 
see wait see sec eases tax reform reporting requirements 
what the impact the fiscal tax rate for companies not 
reporting calendar year basis 
some investors have been surprised rate guidance for firms that report off calendar 
year end company does not follow calendar year they will use blended rate for 
their next fiscal year the rate would determined based the number days 
before and after january exhibit this important because peer groups that 
would normally have comparable tax rates may not have comparable post tax earnings 
metrics their blended rates may differ significantly due fiscal year timing 
differences investors should aware such differences when comparing multiples 
and metrics 
exhibit blended federal rates for 
ending 
blended rate 
source morgan stanley research estimates 
when companies record the deemed repatriation 
liability 
companies will record the earnings charge for the repatriation liability the period 
enactment can reasonably estimated even though the payment for the liability 
may span years there will impact earnings subsequent periods unless 
the liability measurement revised noted above 
for instance when announcing fourth quarter results johnson johnson recorded 
billion one time charge related the law substantially all which was related 
the deemed repatriation tax even though this charge was recorded has the 
option defer payment with the liability being paid the last three years 
exhibit there will impact this liability paid down however cash taxes 
will clearly higher than book tax expense during this period this dynamic may make 
difficult for investors assess the ongoing operating cash tax rate profile this legacy 
liability remains the books 
exhibit approximate repatriation payment schedule for jnj 
payment billions 
source johnson johnson press release morgan stanley research estimates 
the deemed repatriation liability operating liability 
debt like liability 
our opinion the deemed repatriation liability represents debt like liability the 
government has fixed claim and certain situations reorganization liquidation 
bankruptcy can accelerate the timing the payment requirement credit rating 
agencies such moody and have also announced they will consider the 
repatriation liability when assessing entity debt service ability and credit rating 
however don expect companies report the liability debt equivalent for 
data vendors include debt metrics and calculations companies will report the 
liability taxes payable deferred tax liability thus requiring investors manually 
adjust leverage and enterprise level metrics 
should the deemed repatriation liability discounted 
yes believe the economics the liability are akin debt equivalent and investors 
should discount the liability net present value based the expectation 
payment for instance johnson johnson liability estimated 
net present value npv 
however gaap will not align with this approach recent fasb meeting the board 
determined the liability should not discounted for financial accounting purposes 
they believe represents deferred tax amount additionally the board believes the 
liability estimation subject adjustment discussed above thus not fixed 
obligation such current accounting standards preclude discounting while 
understand the board position based the constraint current codified gaap 
disagree with this conclusion based the economic characteristics the obligation 
will new limits interest deductibility impact the reported 
effective tax rate 
maybe the new law limits interest deductibility taxable ebitda for tax years 
beginning before jan and taxable ebit thereafter however 
overlooked provision the law permits corporates carry forward any lost 
deductions any future period indefinitely 
for accounting purposes company can book that interest carryforward asset 
long the company and their auditors determine that the deduction more likely 
than not realized some point the future they believe the interest 
carryforward can realized then the recognition the asset will create income tax 
benefit that will offset any incremental tax expense due the loss the deduction 
that period all else equal cash taxes will higher than book taxes the period where 
the deduction was denied and book taxes will greater than cash taxes the future 
period when the carryforward used these offsetting entries will neutralize the impact 
the reported effective tax rate 
what changes were made net operating losses nols 
and how will they presented the financial statements 
while the act did not alter pre existing nols nols generated after december 
are subject new limitations new nols may longer carried back but can 
carried forward indefinitely like interest carryforwards however new nols may only 
used offset taxable income when applied future periods this limitation 
will reduce the time value nols 
with expiration date new nols there may less need for management 
reserve against federal nols long they believe they will profitable enough 
future periods use them their entirety reserve for nols may still necessary 
more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not realized the future 
easing the reserve requirement will reduce the volatility effective tax rates for 
companies incurring losses carrying nols 
where can investors find disclosure showing how the tax 
law impacts the reported effective tax rate 
under current sec guidance items that cause difference between the statutory tax 
rate and the reported effective tax rate must disclosed reconciliation table the 
tax footnote reconciling item greater than the pretax income multiplied 
the statutory tax rate must individually listed the reconciliation table when 
items not meet that threshold but still create difference between the statutory 
and effective rate they can aggregated 
currently any item that moves the tax rate more meets that threshold with 
the corporate rate decreased any item that moves the tax rate mere 
would now meet that threshold unless the sec alters its current guidance this will 
enable investors have more insight into how companies get their effective tax rate

unfortunately this tabular presentation only required annual financial statements 
however companies should discuss the impact narrative form the notes 
quarterly financial statements 
will immediate expensing impact the effective tax rate 
immediate expensing bonus depreciation will not lower the reported effective 
tax rate however will impact cash tax rates the effective tax rate isn impacted 
because companies must record deferred taxes for the difference gaap and tax 
accounting 
deferred tax assets dta liabilities dtl arise when there temporary timing 
difference between financial statement and tax recognition deduction taken for tax 
purposes that greater less than deduction taken for book purposes gives rise

existing amt credit carryforwards 
while corporate amt was repealed for all tax years beginning after december 
firms will find benefit for their pre existing amt credits subsequent years amt 
credit carryforwards can used offset regular tax liability years through 
additionally the amt credit refundable varying degrees beginning after 
the refund will equal the excess the minimum tax credit for the taxable 
year over the amount the credit allowable for the year against the regular tax 
liability subject certain limitations 
since amt credits will refundable any existing benefit the credits will realized 
the coming years this means that any valuation allowance can released resulting 
income tax benefit being recognized receivable can created for all amt

will corporate state taxes impacted because the 
change federal law 
the short answer yes but the exact extent difficult say there are different 
ways states choose choose not conform the internal revenue code four 
states texas nevada washington and ohio levy taxes gross receipts which 
different than corporate income tax three states mississippi arkansas and new 
jersey not conform the irc and have their own calculation determine the tax 
owed two states wyoming south dakota not have corporate income tax 
twenty one states and the district columbia have rolling conformity the irc 
meaning they adopt changes the irc they occur the remaining twenty states have 
static conformity meaning they adhere the irc specific date see tax reform 
moves the states what can said for certain that there will loss the state 
tax shield for federal taxes the state tax deduction now only worth cents the 
dollar compared cents previously this means state taxes will comprise larger 
portion company total tax obligation all else equal 
what are the changes that were made executive 
compensation deductibility and why are they impacting the 
effective tax rate 
under the previous tax code the deductibility compensation for the ceo and the 
three other highest compensated officers covered employees was limited 
million per year however there was exception that allowed deductibility 
compensation met performance based criteria thus most companies structured 
executive compensation performance based order maintain the deduction 
the act eliminated the deduction for performance based and commission compensation 
for covered employees addition expanding the definition covered employees 
include the cfo the compensation for any individual who serves covered 
employee during the taxable year subject the new limitation additionally once 
individual becomes covered employee they remain covered employee all future 
years loss deductibility will increase both cash and reported effective tax rates 
when looking the last reported fiscal year for constituents the consumer 
discretionary sector stands lose the most deductibility gross basis exhibit

should companies record deferred taxes for global 
intangible low taxed income gilti recognize the period 
incurred 
the fasb tentatively addressed this issue the january meeting the board 
decided for the time being that companies may choose whether recognize deferred 
taxes period cost for gilti taxes but must disclose the policy that chosen this 
treatment similar the current recognition subpart differences the board said 
that they will monitor how companies choose report gilti and revisit this topic later 
this year investors should note that divergence practice may reduce comparability 
for overview gilti please see appendix international base erosion provisions 
what tax rate will used measure the base erosion antiabuse tax beat impacts the financial statements

measure all deferred taxes that arise due beat this treatment similar the way 
the alternative minimum tax amt was accounted for the previous code 
for overview beat please see appendix international base erosion provisions 
appendix international base erosion provisions 
under the act the united states moved from worldwide tax system territorialstyle tax system with three key base erosion provisions the global intangible low taxed 
income gilti provision aims provide type global minimum tax foreign source 
intangible income earned low tax jurisdictions the foreign derived intangible income 
fdii provision serves counter gilti providing the incentive lower effective 
tax rates intangible income earned from foreigners via domestically held intellectual

although the title suggests this tax intangible income actually all global income 
can subject the tax gilti considered stick provision designed 
ensure that multinationals that generate high foreign earnings relative normal 
return their foreign fixed asset base pay minimum tax those earnings thus any 
excess return considered defacto intangible income and potentially subject the tax 
gilti taxed times deduction for income earned well the allowance 
offset the tax owed with the foreign taxes paid the end result 
effective minimum tax rate between and 
after the deduction for gilti income reduced bringing the effective 
range higher 
note the calculation determine company has pay the gilti complex and 
can vary dramatically based the following 
either the parent any cfc has net tested loss the qbai deduction 
arrive gilti not allowed 
taxes paid accrued cfc with tested loss are lost and cannot used
