regulatory changes could positive for some though believe odds 
meaningful change are low the key regulatory changes our radar are 
potential changes cfpb mandate and debit interchange regulation which

for the larger marketplace lenders 
impact from interest rates higher rates are not revenue driver for most our 
stocks but variable rate debt could drive higher interest expense for merchant 
acquirers fleet card and money transfer stocks rates rise considerably see 
modest eps risk and focus implications for potential adp and payx are 
the only direct beneficiaries given float income but upside appears baked

tax changes could create some relative winners leave others out several potential tax 
policy changes are being considered but focus the two most talked about that 
could more meaningful from long term valuation perspective 
lower corporate taxes should disproportionately benefit our stocks that have 
greater exposure and are current tax payers

what about cash repatriation tax holiday repatriation holiday could benefit but 
not likely material for payments stocks believe any impact from repatriation 
holiday unlikely material our stocks the ongoing impacts from corporate 
tax and interest deductibility that said while several our companies generate 
international earnings and repatriate the fund dividends buybacks debt 
think pypl and stand out the most meaningful material beneficiaries pypl 
had its cash and investments offshore market cap had 
its cash held offshore market cap and had its 
cash held offshore market cap but again think the one time tax 
savings are unlikely move the stocks meaningfully pypl for example could 
repatriate cash the but may not deploy all towards share repurchases given its 
priority use cash for suggesting near term eps benefit had already been 
repatriating cash the with minimal tax cost unlikely see observable 
benefit and for expect repatriation savings could result lower tax for given 
year but not think that changes valuation the stock meaningfully

what about rising rates mixed bag 
rates alone are not meaningful direct drivers payments stocks most our 
companies take limited any credit risk but note some potential upside exists for 
payroll stocks adp and payx both which benefit from large client float portfolios 
that are invested prevailing rates and would therefore see eps benefit the 
portfolios are reinvested but much this upside anticipation has been priced for 
both stocks our view 
for companies with leverage expect some modest impact from the increased interest 
expense variable rate debt interest rates rise materially this most meaningful 
for merchant acquirers fleet card networks and money transfer stocks though current 
yield curve does not suggest material headwind for fdc our most levered 
company rates rise considerably could also have implications for companies that 
rely heavily acquisitions for earnings growth 
indirectly interest rate hikes are accompanied improving macro scenario that 
could benefit consumer spending which could turn boost card spend
