for and 
reasons why we bullish apo 
permanent capital initiatives its credit business are gaining significant traction 
becoming larger and growing faster than previously thought new initiatives give 
confidence and conviction that apo can scale its credit platform grow permanent 
capital aum and earnings growth significantly better than expected expect apo 
double its credit business over the next years from current aum about 
aum with earnings from the credit segment also doubling from 
apo replicating the success had with athene 
strategically use limited amount its balance sheet and party capital create 
new platforms venerable athora midcap etc and accelerate growth existing 
platforms that will drive significant aum and management fee growth importantly the 
management fees are sticky long duration that should command premium multiple 
earlier this year apo announced the creation its athora platform and raised 
capital but has yet deploy and generate earnings expect apo garner 
billion aum from this platform via levered asset purchases from troubled european 
financial institutions over the next several years and see upside while conservatively 
assume low teens fee rate this capital most recently december apo 
announced the creation its latest platform venerable that with its first transaction 
announced will generate aum for apo worth eps and value 
the stock 
new initiatives the horizon across private equity infrastructure real estate could 
drive significant upside estimates apo has been very innovative creating new 
products vehicles with athene the best example recent investor conference 
apo ceo leon black discussed possible new initiatives cousin strategies that are 
currently the works specifically hybrid credit and equities for longer duration 
and mid teens returns and big game hunting looking for size companies 
with longer hold periods and compound return profiles not currently 
model growth from these strategies but given apos history executing new 
initiatives would not surprised see new announcements over the next year 
which could drive additional upside estimates also understand apo building 
out infrastructure business and has aspirations scale its real estate business 
apo entering its portfolio harvesting stage that should boost cash performance fees 
levels apo exited its harvesting stage back largely 
monetized portfolio holdings however apo has since invested it vintage fund 
viii that should begin see portfolio exits accelerate expect net cash 
performance fees their business grow from about over 
and and see upside those estimates supportive backdrop 
attractive valuation with upside plus dividend yield for total return 
our price target reflects sum the parts valuation and implies multiple 
eps reflecting premium historical valuation that warranted due 
accelerating growth and mix shift toward sticky fee related earnings for which 
investors ascribe higher multiple and apo entering their harvesting stage that will 
see portfolio monetizations accelerate driving stronger cash earnings generation our

competition intensifying with vanguard entry into smart beta etfs vanguard 
entered into the smart beta etf market this past november with average 
expense ratio bps which least below the industry average think 
this will accelerate pricing pressure the fast growing smart beta segment which could 
lead slower growth prospects for ivz powershares etf business and lower fee 
rates since vanguard announcement saw invesco cut pricing december 
two smart beta etfs from bps bps 
the combined impact and dynamics tax reform and intensifying competition make 
invesco recent guggenheim etf acquisition appear less accretive much the deal 
accretion from ivzs previously announced acquisition guggenheim september was 
from the creation deferred tax asset that resulted cash tax benefit with only 
minimal accretion from ongoing operations the acquired funds now that tax reform 
will take effect the value that tax asset has diminished and the deal looks less 
accretive than initially thought
