what drives fiscal outcomes too little 
bipartisanship too many loose ends too little time 
setting expectations for the fall fiscal agenda think 
important understand three principles 
wouldn conflate recent debt ceiling and daca deals with bipartisanship since 
substantive policy compromises were made republican negotiators still 
appear disagree key tax reform topics and there are many distractions 
remaining the near term legislative must list 
this dynamic constrains outcomes for tax reform see congress 
pursuing one party complex rewrite the tax code with little margin for 
political error internal policy disagreements and president whose approval 
numbers limit his ability arbitrate party disagreement hence while still 
think tax reform will get done also expect that these realities will dampen 
and delay the outcome even wrong and democrats sign for tax 
reform their demands would likely lengthen the process and further limit 
stimulus potential 
government funding and daca debates display this dynamic even though 
the treasury should not need raise the debt ceiling until least april 
expect the tax reform process temporarily take backseat some 
legislative must the latest continuing resolution and debt ceiling 
suspension expire december fix the former complicated the need 
raise expiring budget caps the latter while cash management measures 
should extend the drop dead date the debt ceiling until april with little 
luck june believe republicans will address this early and include the 
debt ceiling increase the end year deal avoid voting next year closer 
the midterms while they are finalizing tax reform december further 
complicated the democrats declaration that they will include daca fix 
all must pass legislation expect face saving resolution emerge 
potentially after series one week extensions but similar events have been

volatility inducing historically 
tax reform should survive but advance more slowly than the current proposed 
timeline passage est with data from historical tax cuts our guide 
continue expect modest deficit expansion that delivers little near term 
stimulus expect the tax reform effort survive the pitched policy battles 
about immigration and near term government funding republicans conceptual 
policy agreement the issue and desire avoid squandering one party 
control likely supersede any lingering divisions and help the party continue its 
progress however some management expectations regarding the timing and 
content tax reform order and outcome risks are skewed toward our bear 
case 
base case complex simplification our view reconciliation limits the 
ambition tax plans and waters down even the less aggressive proposal 
expect next week corporate reforms are phased with terminal rate 
paid for repatriation haircuts interest deduction and dynamic 
scoring personal tax code changes include permanent simplification and 
temporary but modest rate cuts paid for through dynamic effects and 
income based limitation itemized deductions first year deficits would 
projected rise modest gdp similar the year scores 
the bush tax cuts given that currently proposed rate cuts score similar 
deficit expansions 
bull case all dessert vegetables holdout fiscal hawks abandon 
caution and fully embrace supply side faith that tax cuts pay for 
themselves special interest groups push back initially proposed 
limitations deductions corporate tax changes remain similar the base 
case but deficit funded temporary personal cuts are accommodated 
either extending the budget window replacing the jct the official 
legislative scorer first year deficits would projected expand about 
gdp the high end the impact from recent similarly sized 
unfunded tax cuts 
bear case party foul legislative action before the midterm elections 
republicans fail clear any number hurdles key policy 
disagreements delayed response existing legislative needs like daca 
the debt ceiling and unforeseen crisis requiring congressional attention 
takeaways for investors stimulus may disappoint but progress enough 
for risk markets near term dollar flow from repatriation may disappoint 
relative fundamental equity sector winners include retail telecom energy 
utilities tbills issuance may grow prepared for 
volatility opportunity 
three principles set fiscal expectations 
before speculating the direction the current fiscal policy debate must first 
establish some principles that help narrow potential outcomes taken together these 
principles point outcomes that explain later the report will constrained 
their fiscal stimulus potential and take longer come together than republicans are 
currently advertising 
bipartisanship elusive and probably wouldn help 
some clients have asked president trump overtures toward democrats the 
debt ceiling and daca have established template that increased the chance tax 
reform that significantly increases deficits don think for few reasons 
the debt ceiling and daca deals don appear evidence bipartisan success 
the latter there evidence said deal taking legislative form any time soon 
underscoring the self preservation incentive speaker ryan account for his 
congressional base which may disagree with democratic deals the former 
democrats had all their demands met extending that template tax reform 
would require republicans acceding key democratic demands which would box 
out key republican goals like lowering investment taxes this incentivizes 
republicans alone 
wrong and plan came together pursue bipartisan deal does not 
bode well for the timeline adding more voices the debate means takes longer 
resolve key detail disagreements 
bipartisan deal implies agreement with democrats demand for revenueneutrality lowering the chance any meaningful fiscal stimulus 
ironically there may better chance fiscal stimulus with republican only 
plan statements from some conservatives favor leaning supply side 
interpretation the fiscal impact tax cuts however explain later 
think those sentiments will contained budget rules and competing views 
within the republican party 
key policy disagreements still resolved

corporate rate 
president trump continues call for corporate tax rate which republican 
congressmen and even members the six director the national economic 
council gary cohn treasury secretary steven mnuchin speaker paul ryan chairman 
house ways and means committee kevin brady senate majority leader mitch 
mcconnell and chairman senate finance committee orrin hatch have said 
unlikely treasury secretary mnuchin said with regard rate don know 
able achieve that given the budget level speaker paul ryan said thought 
getting the corporate tax rate the mid low range was more likely while 
republicans originally considered the rate the president opening offer 
negotiation recent press reports indicate that may more sticking point than 
previously thought the longer the white house calls for the harder may for 
the president shift more realistic rate our opinion 
individual rates and pay fors 
the individual side while negotiators will likely able come agreement the 
brackets and rates agreeing pay fors challenge media reports suggest that the 
big six are odds over eliminating the state and local deduction which ryan and brady 
support but face opposition from others including republicans the house 
eliminating reducing the mortgage interest and charitable deductions will likely also 
difficult which why believe the negotiators will ultimately consider incomebased cap deductions the difficulty securing pay fors for rate cuts and removal 
the amt and estate tax why negotiators have recently indicated that some the tax 
changes may temporary 
pass throughs 
the has two business tax systems the majority businesses and business income 
fall under the pass through system where business income allocated individuals 
under the individual income tax structure the top marginal rate for business income 
under the individual structure the top marginal rate for corporations 
corporate rate reduction the range lower creates the appearance 
favoring corporate formation over small businesses operating under the pass through 
structure 
with rare unanimity the big six all appear agree that pass through entities need 
preferential rate for business income the house gop blueprint calls for pass through 
rate president trump campaigned universal business income rate 
these business rate differentials appear incongruent isolation however what often 
missed this discussion that corporate income double taxed once the business 
level and once the individual level thus the total maximum marginal tax rate for 
business income for corporations versus for pass throughs 
exhibit maximum marginal federal rates for business income

key issue with special business rate for pass throughs that will incentivize 
sheltering and the conversion compensation income into operating profits this 
structuring opportunity could have significant impact the tax base and would likely 
require extensive and complex anti abuse rules mnuchin recently indicated that the 
special pass through rate would apply only non service manufacturing businesses 
you accountant firm and that clearly income you taxed income rate 
you won taxed pass through rate said you business that creating 
manufacturing jobs you going get the benefit that rate because that going 
passed through help create jobs and better wages 
special lower rate for pass through business may also come with the stigma giving 
significant break the wealthy further complicating this policy recent estimates 
indicate that pass through income accrues the top 
unprecedented expensing 
capital expensing policy appears potential wedge issue between the house and 
the administration the july joint statement called for unprecedented expensing 
it not clear how unprecedented defined but the term use lieu immediate full 
expensing may indicate disagreement among policy makers 
house leadership sticking core component its house gop blueprint which 
would transform the income tax system into cash flow tax system allowing full and 
immediate deductibility any investment post the joint statement house ways and 
means chairman kevin brady reiterated that immediate expensing remains critical 
component the house tax plan when businesses all sizes can immediately write 
off their business investment buildings equipment software and technology drives 
main street jobs drives productivity the american worker 
however the administration objective the lowest corporate rate possible noted 
above white house director legislative affairs marc short reiterated the position 
the expensing front not believe expensing should prioritized the 
expense rates more interested prioritizing lower rates think that more 
important actually getting the economy going 
many economists believe that full expensing better than rate cuts grow the 
economy however see two key issues with full and immediate expensing reform 
context 
expensive particulary within the confines budget reconciliation structure 
the tax foundation estimates that full and immediate expensing would cost 
trillion over years static basis and billion including generous growth 
assumptions while stimulative the budget consequences this policy would 
likely limit overall rate reduction significantly 
second immediate expensing effectively requires eliminating the interest expense 
deduction otherwise any debt financed capital expenditure will subsidized 
taxpayers believe that this the key political hurdle for immediate expensing 
policy full repeal the interest deduction likely too radical given the timeline 
and will met with significant opposition from the business community 
financial accounting rules may also play behavioral role policy preferences 
because immediate expensing purely timing incentive will not have any impact 
companies reported tax provisions effective tax rates furthermore limits interest 
deductibility will increase reported tax rates any debt financed investment thus all 
else equal the combination these two policies should lead higher financial 
statement reported tax provisions and rates 
compromise solution may include extending the current expiring policy called bonus 
depreciation which permits immediate expensing investment cost for 
instance senator john thune recently introduced legislation that would make 
bonus depreciation permanent and simplify existing cost recovery rules 
corporate interest deduction 
while full elimination the business interest deductibility likely prove too radical 
change for current reform efforts believe that haircut the deduction 
politically feasible given the revenue constraints and overall rate goals discuss 
losing interest there are simply too few preferences large enough move the rate 
materially the tax policy center recently estimated that elimination all corporate 
preferences would only pay for top corporate rates near 
rothification 
another option being floated revenue thirsty policy makers change the taxation 
retirement accounts being coined rothification policy makers could choose limit 
eliminate tax deferral associated with traditional and individual retirement 
accounts iras and require retirement savings funded with after tax earnings 
today most savers may generally elect save for retirement using traditional 
ira accounts roth style accounts with traditional accounts contributions are taxdeductible while withdrawals savings are taxed ordinary income tax rates 
contributions roth style accounts are not tax deductible but investment earnings 
and withdrawals are generally tax free 
get sense for the appeal the joint committee taxation jct estimates that the 
deferral effects traditional accounts will cost the government billion 
revenue between and republican policy makers have looked down this 
avenue recently the tax reform act former ways and means chairman dave 
camp proposed limited transition approach where contributions that exceeded half 
the annual contribution limit would require roth treatment the jct estimated that this 
limited approach would raise billion over years 
rothification mainly timing dynamic considered some budget gimmick 
and not genuine revenue offset assuming savings rates are held constant the policy 
would simply shift out year tax revenues into the budget window while perhaps 
appealing even gimmick the question then becomes how policy makers address 
consequential out year revenue losses which are effectively prohibited the senate 
byrd rule also question whether there enough slack the timeline garner the 
political support for such significant transformation the country retirement 
savings system 
too many legislative too little time 
the words rep mark meadows the enemy time congress already faced 
crowded fall legislative calendar which baked into our existing view that tax reform 
would passed however with the recent moves only extend the debt 
ceiling temporarily and the new request address daca the calendar has become 
even more crowded and increasingly politically fraught and there are only 
legislative days left the year 
addition typical congressional business authorizations confirmations there are 
five issues that need resolved this fall 
health care 
while not know yet the graham cassidy health care bill has enough votes 
pass the senate only has until september vote using reconciliation 
rules next week could focused health care does pass the senate the bill 
would the house where speaker ryan will attempt pass the bill without the 
flexibility make any changes 
the budget resolution 
order pass tax reform using reconciliation congress needs pass 
budget resolution containing reconciliation instructions the budget resolution not law 
and can pass with only republican votes but the same resolution needs pass the 
house and senate 
budget resolution passed the house budget committee july with instructions for 
deficit neutral tax reform but still lacks the votes pass the floor the house 
the freedom caucus pushing receive details the tax reform plan before passes 
the budget resolution even going far suggest that could pass the after 
passes tax reform which leadership dismissed unlikely the freedom caucus also 
wants additional cuts mandatory spending top the billion already 
included predictably the tuesday group opposed the cuts mandatory spending 
and warned speaker ryan that would not vote for budget until deal struck with 
democrats raise the budget control act caps traditional budget resolution 
cannot agreed upon plan pass shell budget simply pass vehicle for tax 
reform instructions but fiscal hawks the house are opposed that tactic 
earlier this week the senate budget committee said that had reached agreement 
pass budget with instructions that would allow for trillion tax cuts added 
the deficit over years because the house calls for deficit neutral tax reform 
this senate plan holds there still need negotiate with the house 
september brady said that the house planned introduce details plan 
during the week september and then pass budget october could that 
introducing the details tax reform will help smooth the way for the budget 
resolution but also could mean that divisions over the provisions tax reform could 
further delay passing budget and give members added leverage get what they want 
appropriations 
congress has pass fiscal year appropriations december the government 
will partially shut down while the house and senate need through the legislative 
process pass the appropriations bills likely combined into omnibus bill 
they also need complete the added step passing legislation raise the budget 
control act spending caps order avoid sequester republicans need 
secure eight democratic votes the senate pass both the increase the caps and 
appropriations and will likely odds over increased spending for non defense 
well other hot button issues such the border wall these negotiations have not yet 
begun and will take time the fall 
debt ceiling 
the deal that passed september suspended the debt ceiling until december 
hypothetically the debt ceiling shouldn issue until next year per our analysis 
cash management measures should extend the drop dead date the debt ceiling until 
april with little luck late july early august hence wouldn expect the 
treasury sound the alarm its own until but regardless how long the 
treasury states has before the drop dead date believe that republicans and 
democrats both have little incentive extend the debt ceiling fight beyond december 
putting yet another politically difficult item ahead tax reform the agenda 
however the reality may quite different the challenge the desire from both 
parties leverage basic governing needs like funding avoid shutdown achieve 
difficult policy advancements for example democrats have stated their intention 
attach daca fix all pending pieces legislation ahead its coming expiry 
take the party its word this means could withhold the necessary votes the 
senate avoid government shutdown republicans who are reportedly loath take 
vote raising extending the debt ceiling issue that divisive within the party 
could attempt use the shutdown and daca deal with this issue december 
ahead midterm election considerations emerging 
daca 
the president decision end the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca 
program and his request that congress address the issue through legislation has further 
complicated the legislative agenda some the dreamers will become eligible for 
deportation soon march putting six month timeline the need for action 
democrats have stated that they want stand alone bill before december they will 
attach every must pass bill december republicans the other hand would 
rather address daca after they address tax reform 
last week senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy 
pelosi announced that they and president trump had agreed work toward deal 
daca protections exchange for increased border security excluding the wall almost 
immediately following this the white house attempted walk back the idea deal 
the face conservative opposition the details and timing this deal matter 
amnesty part the deal will harder pass and congress meant address 
this right away could push back the timing for tax reform 
politically the republican party divided the issue immigration and the dream 
act specifically republican supporters tend from competitive districts often with 
large latino populations only three republican senators voted for the dream act 
and while was included the senate immigration reform bill that passed 
that bill stalled the house addition overwhelming majority house 
republicans voted end the daca program and the conservative wing 
the party against daca and any plan for amnesty which means that even 
bipartisan bill could pass the senate speaker ryan would forced pass the bill 
the house with democratic votes always hard decision for speaker make and 
one that promised would not make with regards immigration specifically when 
took over the gavel 
tax policy potential outcomes 
when applying our three principles from earlier the report our expectations 
conclude the following 
don see any likely scenario where tax legislation passed before given 
the legislative calendar and key lingering debates 
outcomes remained constrained the limitations put into place using 
reconciliation 
risks the base case are skewed the bear case given execution and timing 
concerns 
with those principles hand lay out three cases for how tax legislation could 
develop from here 
one important caveat believe are beyond the point where party 
estimators have details budget scoring tax reform that approach the reliability 
what congress dealing with said differently tax negotiators are position test and 
tweak budget assumption ongoing basis with the jct are not and congress 
not showing its details hence think more reliable the moment make some

what are watching for next week tax plan release 
good gets expect next week release new tax plan details from the 
six will likely highlight the good parts tax reform cuts and downplay the 
bad pay fors hence likely push back against initial positive feedback 
rates implied fiscal stimulus etc unless the document includes detailed 
credible and new approach tax policy 
quantity new details more specifics will mean there more consensus among 
the big six that could signal shorter time frame for passage than expect but 
that expectation must balanced against the notion that too many details opens 
the door for special interest criticism 
corporate rate the first cut the deepest expect the initial offering rate 
levels the lowest they can possibly initial offering would 
indicate progress toward plan that reflects legislative reality the draft includes 
rate which president trump reportedly pushing for may mean the 
corporate rate remains sticking point enhancing risks the long side our call 
for passage 
expensing interest deductibility does unprecedented expensing get 
definition continued ambiguity will signal that policymakers have yet reach 
consensus however commitment full expensing puts business interest 
deductibility the crosshairs likely setting off fierce lobbying battle within the 
business community 
investment tax rates often overlooked the tax rate debate are looking for 
objectives the taxation dividends capital gains and interest income the 
house gop blueprint proposed harmonize the taxation investment income 
half household marginal rate 
surprises watch out for surprises removing the estate tax rothification 
corporate integration the release may way float items gauge potential 
support 
base case complex simplification limited stimulus 
our base case remains unchanged tax reform becomes law believe that 
republican leadership and the white house have commitment reform not just rate 
cuts the corporate side this limits the potential for temporary tax action pushing 
close revenue neutral solution too ambitious relative the political damage 
caused finding pay fors fund rather think phased terminal rate 
politically achievable using dynamic scoring and phased limitations interest and 
other smaller deductions pass throughs are provided relief with the difficult work 
preventing kansas style base erosion offloaded regulatory bodies for post passage 
enforcement 
the individual side see permanent simplification and temporary cuts wage 
brackets and investment taxes the former achieved expanding the standard 
deduction the cost the personal exemption and trading amt for phased 
limitation deductions above high income threshold this satisfies the need claim 
simplification putting more filers simple tax filing form the lighter touch 
deductions represents special interest pushback issues like the salt deduction and 
satisfy some conservative demands for more supply side approach accepting 
deficits that sense the temporary cuts are source stimulus that they 
dynamically funded through deficits roughly estimated gdp based 
similarities the bush tax cuts recent reports that the senate considering similar 
level deficit expansion our economists however discuss below the rather limited 
level stimulus this provides 
recent tax cuts guide for year stimulus 
the loss the border adjusted income tax bat the most recent joint tax 
statement makes growth and deficit figures harder estimate appears that tax 
writers are somewhere between the camp plan and the house gop blueprint 
but exactly where remains open question moreover although white house 
and legislative leaders have priority for permanence they also hinted some 
deficit expansion within the context dynamically scored budget plan finally 
although various provisions have been scored individually over the years 
interactions between tax incentives means that estimating the cost plan 
summing the cost its individual provisions each scored isolation would likely 
inaccurate 
despite the lack hard details investors frequently ask how much fiscal 
stimulus expect from tax reform year with this mind look back

bull case all dessert vegetables 
congress unable unwilling pass the pay fors necessary make all 
tax reform permanent therefore passes temporary deficit financed cuts 
the individual side with greater fiscal stimulus 
our bull case tax reform turns into bush style largely temporary tax cuts 
republicans find themselves backed into corner the political and process 
limitations and feeling need pass something before the midterms pass temporary 
cuts the individual side accompanied some amount reform the corporate 
side not while this falls short the full reform promised would provide more 
stimulus than expected 
bear case party foul 
tax cuts tax reform 
this case divisions within the republican party deepen throughout the fall funding 
and debt ceiling fight and leave the party incapable coming agreement the 
budget resolution and tax reform and republicans run out time after expending all 
political capital fund the government and raise the debt ceiling december the 
party forced turn immigration reform before the deadline runs out march 
other risks the timing and content come into play complicating the political viability 
tax reform further 
econ view tax stimulus not game changer for near term 
growth 
late cycle economy tax stimulus that boosts aggregate demand likely 
have smaller output multiplier than might otherwise have earlier the 
business cycle with more slack the economy the net impact will ultimately 
determined the fed response the market reaction and the evolution 
financial conditions and where the tax cuts are targeted lower versus higherincome households given this background expect that the fiscal multiplier 
these scenarios likely less than one the near term 
the base case where tax cuts are projected lead modest rise deficits 
equal gdp would look for modest impact growth all else 
equal the base case tax plan would provide boost real gdp growth 
over the first four quarters after implementation all else equal 
the bull case where tax cuts come much larger and lead expansion 
the deficit equal about gdp would expect boost real gdp 
growth over the first four quarters after implementation all else equal 
the bear case where see tax reform the impact the economy would 
largely determined how much disappointment this relative market 
expectations and how financial conditions evolve response tightening 
financial conditions the back fiscal disappointment would make this more 
negative scenario for growth 
takeaways for investors 
stimulus may disappoint but progress enough for risk 
markets near term 
you read this far then you probably understand think its valuable push 
back the notion that tax reform will either come soon and meaningful 
positive exogenous shock the economy reiterate even though think tax 
action will include bush style temporary tax rate cuts they don increase deficits the 
point where gdp meaningfully boosted over reliable forecast time frame said 
differently there are likely other factors play that could more meaningful impact the 
growth outlook 
while not the most exciting take tax reform our view this not bad news for risk 
markets the near term tax reform progress without key details helps affirm existing 
biases tax direction further our equities team has argued equities are 
being driven more non geopolitical forces this best demonstrated our view 
the sector rotation that happened march following the first failed aca repeal vote 
away from tax and cycle sensitive sectors 
said differently the near term expectations are low enough that our base case 
timing and progress enough meet them hence don think the fiscal policy 
path gets the way our cross asset team view being constructive risk assets 
into year end see cross asset playbook constructive into year end september 
what would change this view rethink our framework providing near term support 
for risk assets tax and cycle sensitive sectors particularly small and mid caps 
outperform from here meaningful degree thereby baking too high confidence 
tax reform given our view that failure risks remain meaningful

exhibit shows the treasury cash balance now around which slightly 
below the treasury desired minimum operating balance the 
increase from the the treasury had the day the debt ceiling suspension and 
accounted for mid september corporate tax receipts 
going forward the increase both the month and month auction sizes will 
add additional through the end november total outstanding bills and 
would bring the treasury cash balance the range however some 
the bill supply will have cut early november and replaced with cash 
management bill expiring december allow the treasury meet the cash 
balance target december 
the increase bills outstanding far lower than the that market 
participants were expecting before the temporary debt ceiling suspension exhibit

thus the focus money markets would potential issuance after december 
which could follow one those scenarios 
our base case scenario longer term debt ceiling extension suspension extends 
the drop dead date beyond the mid term elections under this scenario the 
treasury would not have rely its extraordinary measures and would able 
increase bill supply early january during under that 
scenario the implications discussed usd liquidity into year end could realized 
that repo rates would face upward pressure and swap spreads could 
tighten 
that scenario would put the treasury the broad trajectory suggested the tbac 
increase the share bills total marketable debt from its multi decade lows see 
exhibit 
however under different scenario the debt ceiling fight continues beyond december 
while the treasury would able use extraordinary measures raise cash 
balances and bills outstanding after december the market would not view the 
increase permanent under that scenario the limit money market spreads and 
rates will likely muted 
deficit estimates 
expanded fiscal deficit under the base case scenario another reason for the potential 
increase bill supply 
our economists have adjusted forecasts for the budget deficit they now see the 
budget deficit falling slightly from gdp then rising 
and previously 
the updated forecasts primarily reflect smaller package tax cuts and later 
implementation than previously assumed morgan stanley economists have also 
incorporated hurricane relief included the recently passed 
hurricane harvey funding bill 
specifically they assume that about tax cuts gdp will deficitfunded and will begin impact the deficit july result expect about 
half the deficit expansion associated with the tax cuts recorded while 
the other half should pushed into 
dollar terms that translates about reduced personal income tax receipts 
before accounting for regular growth tax receipts combined with growth 
overall outlays outweighing higher corporate tax receipts that drives increase 
the overall budget deficit 
this deficit increase adds the needed raise the cash balance 
and needed compensate for the fed balance sheet normalization this sums 
increased funding needs relative 
however treasury security redemptions will lower compared 
result the increased funding need that will have met through 
increased gross ust issuance believe the bulk that would met with increased 
bill issuance rather than coupon issuance given the discussion above regarding the 
supply demand imbalance the bill market 
volatility possible 
discussed earlier december could get quite complicated negotiations keep 
the government funded could end including politically tricky issues like the debt 
ceiling and daca this yields unpredictable negotiation dynamic between the parties 
and inside each party explained recent report see shutdown debt ceiling 
risk deferred not deleted september post financial crisis this has tended 
catalyzed economic uncertainty market volatility and risk off sentiment the 
preceding weeks similar events and although the true debt ceiling deadline likely 
not until the spring this dynamic still heightens the drama around potential government 
shutdown which could blow economic confidence and market confidence the 
potential for positive fiscal policy
