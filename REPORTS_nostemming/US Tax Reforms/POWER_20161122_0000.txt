election analyzing the 
impacts potential tax reform 
elements company company 
this next iteration our election series and given the 
likelihood tax reform important topic the 
congressional agenda drill into the math behind several 
key reform elements company company basis 
expect comprehensive federal corporate tax reform key focus 
based our dialogue with numerous parties believe appropriate 
focus key elements the house republican tax reform plan key 
component the house plan percentage point reduction the federal 
statutory tax from second component the plan involves 
eliminating the deductibility interest expense exchange for full and 
immediate expensing capex the house plan does not specify whether such 
provision would elective mandatory have gone through our coverage 
company company and evaluated the potential impact both tax rate and 
deductibility changes net income and cash flow and found that the most 
likely beneficiaries would peg sji and for the most part these companies 
exhibit some combination high percentage unregulated earnings small 
nonexistent nol positions and minimal non utility debt the other hand 
those most likely see negative potential impacts are etr and these 
companies tend display structural characteristics that are inverse the first 
group 
most positively impacted 
pseg peg low levels debt meaningful non utility earnings contribution 
from pseg power and existing cash tax appetite make peg likely potential 
beneficiary the house tax reform plan the corporate tax rate were 
reduced from this alone would accretive peg earnings 
and ffo would increase our estimates the loss interest 
deductibility the other hand would lower earnings per share 
therefore when consolidating the changes see earnings accretion from 
cash flow standpoint including the net impact lower tax rate and the loss 
deductibility interest coupled with the ability expense capex for tax 
purposes peg would see boost ffo cash flow from operations the 
largest potential beneficiary within our coverage 
south jersey industries sji sji has similar characteristics pseg only 
modest amounts unregulated debt and meaningful non utility earnings 
estimate that reduction the corporate tax rate would result positive 
eps impact for sji though ffo would decrease the loss interest
