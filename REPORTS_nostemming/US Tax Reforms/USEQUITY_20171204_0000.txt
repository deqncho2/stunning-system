weekly warm cyclical 
smid call intact closer look 
tax effects sector size 
last week news progress tax reinforced our late cycle 
narrative and calls around cyclicals smid and energy while 
giving warning about the danger positioning crowded 
tech sector 
tax progress the next leg the cyclical trend busy week tax reform 
was the principal driver market moves markets seemed price higher 
probability ultimate passage expect that enactment tax reform will 
support the primary trend cyclicals over defensives the market addition 
like the outlook for smid caps stocks post tax reform given better earnings 
outlook higher potential for margin expansion and valuation that still has 
some room catch tax and smid specifically worked with our 
accounting valuation team provide top level view what tax reform 
could mean across sectors and size cohorts the market consumer energy and 
telco stand out among the winners well smid caps stocks which think 
will see higher boost net income than large caps 
warning shot tech tech big swings and underperformance this week were 
signs what can happen when trends change and heavy positioning comes 
undone not think there something more sinister afoot quite yet but 
think the positive tax reform news forced larger move toward cyclicals and 
relative tax beneficiaries that was funded what seems like the universally 
preferred sector the market tech the sector made back some its midweek losses but think investors would well remember this warning 
shot for what could happen when the end the cycle sets more severe 
rotation 
stay long energy following the opec non opec deal extension reiterate out 
positive view energy where strong demand outlook limited potential 
supply response equity performance that has lagged oil better earnings low 
relative valuations and light positioning should all supportive equities 
last week the blew through our resistance levels suggesting higher 
levels may reached the tax bill passed several weeks ago highlighted 
key resistance level were watching when the surged past 
that tuesday accelerated friday quick decline find notable that 
served support our new short term technical targets are and then 
not far from our original price target set out april expect 
these targets met the next few weeks

what focus this week 
our outlook devoted substantial time call for increased volatility 
admittedly did not expect the call play out quite quickly news around tax 
reform and opec met with positioning produce some big moves that injected some 
volatility the market the vix saw large percentage jumps off small base that may 
early look what store for ultimately think that everything 
saw last week reinforced our late cycle narrative and our calls around cyclicals smid 
caps and energy while giving warning about the danger positioning crowded 
tech sector 
remain bullish cyclicals positioning warning shot tech 
our call and sector preferences have been built pro cyclical call the global 
economic and growth story that began has been the primary underlying 
narrative the market prospects for additional stimulus have caused oscillations 
around this trend but ultimately think the economic cycle has been driving the 
return story for equities from early this year the month rolling cumulative

our view margins are unlikely expand enough justify nearly eps growth 
over the next year but expect the margin environment for small caps improve 
supporting better eps growth than large caps some context important here 
small cap incremental operating margins never experienced recovery post financial 
crisis whereas mega cap margins did exhibit attribute this the importance 
expense management during the era when top line growth was hard come due 
low nominal gdp growth large caps had the size scale cut costs more effectively 
than small caps furthermore large caps had access cheaper debt financing enabling 
them fund operations more freely and drive operating margins the era ends 
the dynamic may begin shift and small caps should able operate more 
level playing field importantly believe that deregulation the corporate sector 
could really start take hold relaxing financial regulation should also help 
drive loan growth this should help foster more active and dynamic operating 
environment for domestically geared small caps
