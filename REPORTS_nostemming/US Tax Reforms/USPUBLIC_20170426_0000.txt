starting point but don think the timing tax reform advanced 
today news the release signal that the white house taking more 
leadership role tax than they did healthcare yet that fact alone doesn 
change the barriers action and likelihood delays our estimated 
timing our view for the following reasons 
republicans still pursuing elusive healthcare deal until republicans cut 
bait repealing replacing obamacare they can practically start the 
detailed work advancing tax reform through the budget reconciliation 
process while see little practical reason for republicans remain 
focused healthcare the recently proposed macarthur amendment 
signals renewed dedication the effort such our concern that they 
become bogged down passing amendments ahca that satisfy the 
concerns moderates conservatives and senate reconciliation rules 
credible bipartisan path remains unclear the tax plan offers several 
talking points that garner bipartisan agreement but the policy details 
make that agreement more difficult than appears don see evidence 
credible bipartisan workaround reconciliation this document for 
example personal tax breaks appear favor the middle class some 
measures doubling the standard deduction but the wealthy high 
income earners others potential absolute dollar benefit rate cuts 
estate tax elimination this leaves the plan open criticism from the 
democratic base who have set bar for what constitutes acceptable tax 
reform infrastructure childcare plans have been suggested 
bipartisan carrots but were not detailed this proposal 
white house leadership doesn necessarily speed the process while 
executive leadership earlier the healthcare process might have been the 
right move not necessarily the case here given greater party unity 
around most tax reform concepts hence leadership just likely 
muddle and delay the process creating larger principles debates 
due the nature the fixed income market the issuers

source morgan stanley research 
while the release included some key details those details were mostly 
reiteration previous campaign proposals and did not say much about what 
the final package might look like 
consistent with the investor consensus the bat omission affirmed the 
low odds its inclusion but secretary mnuchin hedged language his 
morning remarks kept the possibility alternatives alive concede 
that the president lack endorsement house republicans border 
adjustment tax proposal bat notable but already assigned low 
odds that outcome for any kind border tax and believe 
most investors have come around that view well confusing the 
border tax debate however were remarks the morning treasury 
secretary mnuchin that signaled willingness consider alternatives 
the bat proposed 
the corporate and pass through rate starting point for 
negotiation but doesn tell much about where rates ultimately end 
unless you believe bipartisan approach possible and could 
somehow include this level corporate and pass through rate cut 
think very unlikely then achieving this level function what 
politically and procedurally possible through the budget reconciliation 
process that context level does not seem realistic our view 
and therefore tells little about what actually acceptable the white 
house for example paying for rate cut this deep would require further 
revenue raising efforts beyond the already controversial ones included 
the house republican plan further while some have suggested that 
deficit expanding but sunsetting corporate tax cut effort viable 
alternative approach not convinced key freedom caucus members 
have conceded they willing accept some deficit expansion get tax 
cuts done but posit there limit this flexibility that likely tested 
today plan given that the president campaign plan had been 
dynamically scored adding trillion deficits further the joint 
committee taxation pointed out letter speaker ryan yesterday 
temporary corporate tax cut would likely increase deficits beyond the budget window due carry forwards and repatriation hence this 
approach likely violates senate reconciliation rules unless congress takes 
time find way address these issues 
the individual tax proposals affirmed old principles without clarifying the 
president position key issues the proposal continues push 
simplification defining more terms ease filing implicitly achieved 
raising the standard deduction and pushing more filers toward 
equivalent the form than reduced code complexity limiting 
tax preference items not new theme but did not learn critical 
details which exemptions and above the line exclusions would

market takeaway expect delayed and disappointing fiscal outcomes but 
seemingly right sized investor expectations may make this point academic the 
near term concede that today release affirms that timely tax cut driven 
fiscal stimulus play but given the reasons above not inclined 
increase our current odds stimulus either reducing odds failure 
act timely manner limiting the odds outcomes featuring pay fors 
that alleviate potential deficits and carry near term downside risks the 
economy this point may academic though the near term investors have 
right sized their expectations permitting other factors drive markets our 
equity and treasury strategy teams have noted that this largely the case see 
after the fail april and our recent macro conference investors 
had muted expectations for fiscal boost did not believe fiscal stimulus 
would come the next months believed tax reform would not 
delivered before the end the meantime course will continue 
watch for signs that fiscal optimism becomes bigger market driver hence 
elevating risks fiscal tax disappointment
