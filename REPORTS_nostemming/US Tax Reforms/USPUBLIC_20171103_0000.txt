public policy brief 
tax reform still the drawing 
board 
takeaways outcomes skew toward modest stimulus with 
execution risk controversial international system limited 
loss corporate mortgage interest deduction now 
focus the markup whether pay for battles risk all 
none stimulus scenario 
today the chairman the house ways means 
committee representative kevin brady released draft 
tax reform legislation unlike previous summaries the 
draft constitutes full detailed piece legislation 
here are our key takeaways from the draft 
legislative makeup supports our base case modest 
stimulus and plenty execution risk 
the joint committee for taxation jct scored the bill 
costing billion over years and slightly more front loaded than our 
base case which given the lack previous detail assumed straight line 
average over years although this could certainly still change during the 
coming markup process and subsequent negotiations see this draft key 
indicator republican legislators intentions work within the trillion 
deficit ceiling the score shows deficits increasing they approach year which 
may indicate that there issue with byrd rule compliance for out year deficits 
that the senate will need address their draft this suggests takeaways for 
investors 
deficit expansion potential appears constrained senate rules see tax 
reform deficits moderate raise the stakes october 
risks failure are meaningful congress will continue negotiate 
contentious pay for provisions hence outcomes appear skewed away 
from material stimulus see tax reform better travel than arrive 
october 
one one out pay fors rates are far from settled 
the delay the initial rollout appears have been function lingering 
disagreements provisions being considered for the bill eliminating the 
salt deduction rothification corporate rate phase etc this makes 
sense considering legislators intention comply with allowances regarding 
static revenue losses under the budget resolution moving forward 
controversial pay fors are eliminated watered down money will have 
raised from changed new provision somewhere else the dynamic likely

report 
one one out terms changing provisions our view that drives three 
highlights from 
personal brackets could still shifted tax cuts could made 
temporary 
there will tremendous amount noise around bill provisions the 
coming weeks 
many surprise pay fors could still emerge recommend combing the 
provisions the camp plan from for potentials the senate will 
likely have different pay fors based their own political calculations 
corporate tax rate could still higher phased 
building the previous point many pay for provisions the bill are likely 
challenged members and lobbyists hence proponents immediate 
corporate rate cut may still disappointed phase would way raise 
money offset potentially lost pay fors that consistent with historical tax 
action rate closer our base case could also necessary maneuver 
compel votes particularly the senate given their reticence some pay for 
items under consideration 
bill included details pass throughs but are already getting pushback 
the draft included rate for pass through businesses and included 
guardrails prevent individuals from unfairly taking advantage the lower 
rate however those guardrails appear complicated administer and 
politically fraught general passive owners would able use the rate 
but active owners would only able apply the rate their income 
with the other being treated wage income there also option 
calculate capital percentage greater than most importantly the bill states 
that certain personal services businesses listed examples the bill include law 
accounting consulting engineering financial services and performing arts would 
not able take advantage the lower rate unless they use alternative 
capital percentage calculation based off capital investments and subject 
certain limitation 
the influential national federation independent business nfib has already 
come out against the bill because they believe the pass through provision does 
not help most small businesses this may continue subject debate 
mortgage surprise 
the surface today plan preserves the mortgage interest deduction 
however the devil always the details while the current mortgage 
interest deduction preserved for existing mortgages for homes purchased 
going forward the mortgage interest deduction will capped 
reduced from its current cap million however note that the change 
the cap does not change for refinancing existing mortgages other words 
the existing interest deduction cap grandfathered for refinancing 
our first cut analysis shows that the proposed change would scope 
mortgage holders outstanding loan count the share much larger 
regional level with some the largest shares mortgages between and 
million being found washington new york and california 
addition the change caps the loan amount for new purchase 
mortgages the near doubling the standard deduction from 
for married couples and from for individuals 
well changes deductibility state and local income taxes eliminated and 
property taxes capped have taken into consideration the 
analysis the impact the proposed legislation housing and mortgage 
markets thus the impact dependent upon both you took standard 
deduction previously and your current loan amount ownership households that 
previously took the standard deduction mostly starter homes are likely 
better off they will have more disposal income renter households the 
same category will also experience positive impact with more cash their 
pocket theoretically save more towards down payment thus the margin 
their ability purchase home may improve 
homeowners with more than loan value would have their next 
purchase more expensive from after tax perspective and should slightly 
worse off homeowners the middle the other hand may have slightly more 
money their pocket but now have less incentive own renting 
repatriation and territoriality trick treat 
expected the bill proposes one time favorable repatriation rate and 
transition territorial style system from today worldwide system however 
mandatory tax cash backed foreign retained earnings higher than 
expectations and prior republican proposals have discussed see tax 
reform implications for credit markets september repatriation should 
drive lower supply though that would part offset increased issuance 
for other purposes when tax reform longer source 
uncertainty believe companies will prioritize distributions shareholders 
and with the repatriated cash 
global minimum tax comes the low end the range 
expectations and appears limited passive income rents royalties etc 
however believe the most controversial component the surtax 
related party transactions with foreign affiliates expect significant opposition 
from the business community this particular component already being 
dubbed stealth border tax this surtax would apply both and foreigndomiciled multinationals importing into the united states 
interest deductibility capped ebitda 
today plan formally establishes limit interest deduction line with our 
base case the proposal sets cap interest deductibility ebitda 
effectively targeting only the most highly levered large businesses real estate 
utilities and financials are exempted 
capping the interest expense deduction percentage ebitda opposed 
haircut the interest expense deduction for all companies more 
insignificant outcome for credit only issuers have interest 
expense ebitda for most the universe this change should not alter 
behavior material way however about one third the high yield universe 
would see interest deductibility capped and for those levered credits this 
change headwind especially with grandfathering existing debt 
addition remember that the amount interest expense that these companies 
can deduct will fall when they are performing poorly and hence ebitda 
lower note that full expensing capex for limited subset assets 
economically very similar the status quo since 
better day for muni investors than for muni issuers 
though the draft far from done deal munis fared relatively well all things 
considered kevin brady tax cuts and jobs act drew heavily from former ways 
and means chair dave camp tax reform act considering news 
headlines had suggested last minute scurry for additional revenue were 
worried the outside chance that the camp act surtax muni interest 
would return instead the draft bill largely preserves the muni interest 
exemption moreover the top individual rate remained unchanged though the 
corporate income tax rate fell 
that said the draft proposed curbs the muni interest exemption for new but 
not existing pre refunded hospital and university and private activity 
bonds well additional taxation property casualty muni portfolios 
warrant consideration these think investors should monitor the repeal 
favorable tax treatment for advance refunding prerefunded bonds particular 
given the nearly prerefunded bonds currently outstanding repeal 
private activity bonds also bears mention given that nonprofit hospitals and 
private universities may blocked from issuing tax exempt debt the future 
course hospitals and private universities can already find attractive 
financing terms the taxable bond market with advance refunding bonds 
think these repeals would more concern muni issuance than muni 
credit quality itself though issuance could fall grandfathering should provide 
tailwinds existing bonds expect modest impacts muni valuations 
primarily based lower corporate income tax rates and somewhat higher 
proration rate for insurance companies 
bullish for commercial real estate cre 
the proposal allows for the continued deduction interest expense for cre 
additionally the proposal permits exchanges and maintains the existing 
depreciation levels further reit dividends are proposed taxed max 
our view the proposal bodes positively for cre 
what should markets watch the markup the bill implied deficit 
expansion 
will learn more information next week lobbying ramps and the house 
bill marked addition the senate plans release their draft bill next 
week although the timing may slip depending how the house bill received 
and may make different choices than the house fit their own political calculus 
thus while republican leaders have ambitious timeline this process only 
just beginning 
key risk our view that producing limited deficit expansion bill with 
pay fors that limit revenue losses the budget allowance becomes politically 
untenable contentious pay fors deny leadership the votes pass one 
either chamber congress this case republicans could attempt the ail 
mary option pursue all cuts bill that substantially increases the deficit and 
implied stimulus this all none scenario think legislative failure would 
likely become the base case there may enough deficit hawks and rules 
purists the senate deny passage but would also signal increased 
probability meaningful stimulus this dynamic could encourage rates volatility 
the markup process and adjacent politicking around key provisions may shed 
some light whether our base case holds this all none scenario starts 
emerge
