potential for bounce back potentially the high cash balances many large cap

increasingly risk averse market sentiment failed reverse the trend small cap software

saw the same time cash market cap actually falling companies 
ramp repurchase programs and dividends despite being singed trying step into the 
small caps earlier this year the combination strong fundamentals clearer paths 
profitability and compelling valuation levels has getting more aggressive some the 
strongest stories here 
business model transitions prove harder execute than imagined coming out 
and view the success adobe and intuit looked executing perpetual license 
subscription revenue model transition was easy way attract shareholder attention and 
drive multiples higher successfully executing these transitions proved more difficult than 
imagined names like autodesk and oracle have left investors transition man land

key themes update 
where will cios direct increased spend within security 
then with the heightened awareness increasingly dangerous security environment believe 
cios first reaction was update all existing security infrastructure likely driver the robust firewall refresh 
cycle saw the more durable increase security spend likely goes two broad directions our 
view consolidating the layers technology which made the traditional defense depth security 
architecture onto single platforms focusing minimizing the risk profile within their networks 
organizations now have operate with the working assumption they will breached already have 
security organization likely tighten their focus finding existing threats within their environment faster mean 
time detection remediating attacks more quickly and locking down assets within their network perimeters 
more tightly 
now demand drivers remained strong with security vendors our coverage universe reporting 
average revenue growth average growth this suggests that security refreshes 
have remained robust looking ahead continue believe that investment dollars will shift towards solutions 
which one more the following 
provide better visibility across the entire architecture and shorten the time detection 
threats within the network enterprises increasingly need operate under the assumption 
breach 
allow enterprises reduce expenses through either consolidated spend and cloud based 
infrastructure 
focus securing the assets themselves the sensitive data 
what changed have higher conviction the growing importance solutions which help enterprises find 
existing threats within their environment some cases leveraging big data technologies splunk acquisition 
caspida user behavioral analytics technology good example this trend while user insight 
solution another example palo alto network new solution autofocus also are starting see 
greater willingness enterprises adopt cloud based security solutions better secure the growing use 
cloud based applications better align deployment with the increasingly cloud based architecture and 
achieve greater cost efficiency through migrating data center infrastructure the cloud proofpoint the best 
play enterprises increasingly adopt cloud based solutions 
can small cap get back the game 
then small cap names our coverage group dropped excluding ipos this performance 
lagged our mid cap names which gained and our large cap companies which gained with 
some compelling valuations and potential for consolidation looks improved setup for our smallcap names upgraded overweight the potential for increasing focus some strong and 
overlooked assets the small cap software space

open source what does take have durable scalable open source business 
model 
then open source software defined any software product where the underlying source code visible 
and freely shared with the end user with limited ownership the code any software engineer free use 
optimize and extend the functionality open source programs open source software first came investors 
attention just over years ago with the ipo red hat rht however the failure any other open source 
software names subsequently reach the scale remain independent long enough ipo has made the 
notion open source business models seem relatively niche looking into thought investors would 
ask two questions will the ipo companies with open source models solidify traction with large enterprise 
customers what the impact the rising breadth and depth open source adoption for existing 
infrastructure software vendors believed consensus likely considers the impacts open source 
relatively limited today with few niche functionalities particularly infrastructure software seeing some 
competition from open source vendors the edges 
now we seen open source adoption continue gain traction with organizations according our 
june cio survey cios expect linux premise paid linux public cloud paid linux premise free 
linux public cloud free linux market share server operating systems rise from workloads today 
the next years late select open source solutions have also garnered traction with mainstream 
enterprise customers linux containers container management solutions hadoop openstack while 
key players have begun emerge there remains significant opportunity capture market share these 
young and our view fragmented markets 
container container management while container based technology has been around for some time dating 
back solaris and freebsd more than decade ago docker has sparked recent revival popularizing linux 
containers along with docker others like coreos rocket offering have seen momentum with large enterprise 
customers from our most recent cio survey vendors are incorporating linux containers with 
additional container management has grown hand hand with coreos kubernetes and 
mesosphere amongst others gaining traction

morgan stanley research 
make impact the data analytics market cios indicated that apache hadoop and cloud computing 
have had negative impact their traditional database and data warehouse spending according our most 
recent survey hortonworks recent ipo has solidified hadoop popularization the market however with 
hdp down ytd there remains room for growth from other hadoop offerings from players like dell ibm 
and amazon 
openstack started rackspace and nasa openstack open source project focused providing 
the infrastructure build and manage public and private cloud environments standard hardware traditional 
vendors like cisco ibm vmware and red hat each have their own versions the core openstack 
distribution leaving open the question whether the market will consolidate behind smaller set offerings 
what changed red hat original success the was predicated its ability provide world class 
support large enterprises adopting newer linux technologies for its mission critical functions user base 
that valued support for the software server administrators represent better target audience than software 
developers and the ability consolidate spending around few core distributions the linux technology 
foster application and hardware compatibility using red hat history template for upcoming open source 
technologies think these three attributes are likely prerequisites for the emergence another large open 
source vendor 
gartner estimates least all mainstream organizations will leverage some element open source 
software within their mission critical solutions over the past year some emerging new entrants have been 
able gain strong following forcing legacy vendors create their own open source solutions however 
despite some vendors showing solid customer traction remains unclear whether any today newer 
open source vendors have the promise reach the scale red hat and believe rht remains investors 
purest play open source trends our view even the most promising vendors such docker will take time 
show financial traction however the main impact their rising stature within the enterprise continues

business models transition 
transparent roadmap solid execution ingredients for successful migration the cloud and 
subscription based revenue models subscription pricing models have been viewed increasingly 
favorable light over the last several years customers who prefer opex over capex and investors and

multi year view the near term impacts and long term goals their business model transitions guide key 
metrics and execute well meeting beating those milestones garner investor interest and confidence 
leading trading multiple expansion 
the roadmap visibility into management business model blueprint including the expected timeline and 
metrics measure progress the transition key the transition formula maximize the effectiveness 
disclosing transition roadmap management should choose metrics that are highly relevant are usable 
analyst and investor models and can disclosed and updated regular basis ideal world 
management would give quantitative guidance arpu and number subscriptions however providing 
directional guidance arr and subscriptions would least center estimates reality giving annual 
guidance these metrics which management should have high degree confidence and then 
qualitatively providing updates quarter quarter should also give investors enough information model the 
transition 
execution setting believable goals managing investor expectations and subsequently exceeding those targets 
create the blueprint for successfully execution business model transition this also serves reinforce 
confidence management long term guidance and ability execute those targets over time although 
arr growth important the long term demonstrates increasing arpu ltv the key subscription 
transitions the early innings driving subscriber growth that could become base for monetization the 
outer years

company transition updates and takeaways 
adobe known the trailblazer for technology companies adobe the best example 
successful transition recurring revenue adobe transitioned large portion its business 
starting from low recurring revenue base while disclosing enough metrics help investors 
gauge success perpetual users migrate subscriptions and the creative cloud expands 
the user base adobe consistently has grown its paid subscribers for the last several years 
like the story but with the stock near all time highs remain until get more 
evidence success monetizing the rapidly expanding subscriber ecosystem 
autodesk management signaling faster transition towards subscriptions should 
represent fundamental positive for the company they realize that value faster however 
autodesk reported net new subscriber adds missing consensus expectations 
wide margin this misstep coupled with overall transition complexity and lack 
disclosed metrics will require management simplify the story providing more clarity 
arpu and seats and take action restore confidence the transition story that said 
also produced few data points very supportive our business transition model including 
total expense growth just yoy annual recurring revenue growth yoy and the 
company indication the end perpetual license options coming sooner than originally 
planned see opportunity for the company add clarity the transition and base the 
targets for the company the upcoming analyst day september real potential 
catalyst for the shares 
oracle investors are likely waiting for higher level granular visibility into the transition 
the cloud which see long term positive for oracle due higher customer lifetime 
value and faster pace innovation management going have provide much 
needed cloud transition roadmap and analyst day the annual openworld conference 
late october could venue for oracle provide this much needed clarity 
microsoft solid execution and durability overall revenue growth have allowed microsoft 
withhold the transparent and detailed plans its transition for now with clear mobilefirst cloud first strategy focusing the lifetime value the device user and application 
instead one time transactions microsoft rapidly increasing its mix cloud and 
subscription revenues transitioning from traditional office and from variety onpremises server and database products the azure platform all drive microsoft target 
billion annualized run rate cloud revenue although management has 
provided the big picture premises businesses become more challenged cloud 
revenues become larger percentage microsoft overall business fundamentals 
deteriorate due the transition microsoft will pressured increase visibility and disclose
