the european general data protection regulation gdpr increases compliance 
requirements for companies holding european data starting may this 
means companies will need clearly understand where their data held and 
who has access analysis ernst and young their privacy questionnaire 
indicates many may not have this information the new regulation will therefore 
require companies strengthen internal rules data minimisation security 
data and record audit trails data usage furthermore for the first time 
companies will required notify the local data protection authority data 
breach within hours and breach may result sizeable fines this will 
increase the visibility and cost non compliance for companies thus 
encouraging spending the security solutions offered software companies 
europe has traditionally lagged security investment when compared the 
united states but the gdpr could catalyst for incremental security 
spending here the currently represents total security spending 
today whilst emea represents roughly half the despite similar 
aggregate gdp between the two geographic regions emea spending equaled 
the americas gdp would see incremental spending 
almost increase europe today this could have implications more 
broadly any company holding european data even outside the 
subjected gdpr requirements 
believe vulnerability management security analytics identity and data 
protection technologies and storage software are the three security sector 
areas likely benefit the most these three areas support the stricter focus 
reporting and remediation vulnerabilities light the requirement 
report data breach better identity and control access the data and 
better data management and classification govern and manage data efficiently 
identify solution stocks play the theme proofpoint qualys sophos 
splunk and symantec are all well positioned benefit from gdpr all rated 
overweight other exposed stocks but rated equal weight are barracuda box

executive summary 
expect demand for security solutions increase 
europe companies focus compliance with the 
general data protection regulation gdpr 
security software has remained top priority our cio 
survey for the past several years with revenue growth 
the top security vendors ahead growth overall 
spending however spending has largely come from the 
total security spending today and europe has 
lagged despite similar aggregate gdp between the 
two regions emea spending equaled the americas 
gdp would see incremental spending 
almost increase europe today 
the gdpr could the catalyst increase security 
spending europe key driver investment 
cybersecurity solutions has been breach protection 
regulations the state level the gpdr introduces 
stringent data breach notifications for all companies holding 
data for the first time well stricter rules data 
security and processing already the netherlands have 
introduced new data breach notification law with higher 
requirements compared the gdpr which resulted 
more than breach notifications within the first 
days the combination new breach notification 
requirements and sizeable fines annual global 
turnover will increase visibility non compliance putting 
pressure companies comply 
vulnerability management security analytics identity and 
data protection technologies and storage software likely 
the key beneficiaries stricter regulatory requirements 
will drive need for better visibility software

framing the opportunity 
from may the will introduce the general data protection regulation which will 
replace the data protection directive providing companies with updated rules 
data protection will require companies understand the data that they hold and 
impose stricter rules their data security obligations believe this will create 
opportunities for the technology sector companies work ensure compliance 
the new general data protection regulation imposes stricter 
rules the use data 
the gdpr enhances many aspects the data protection directive ensure data 
protection keeps pace with the evolving digital landscape including mass processing 
data online retailing search engines and social networks for example clarifies what 
meant personal information take into account the growing use the internet 
such includes quasi identifiers these are online and location identifiers such 
address that can used pinpoint location for many companies these steps will 
covered adapting their normal framework 
however there are also number additional aspects for companies address 
including documenting procedures provide clear audit trails data usage 
strengthening rules data minimisation and notifying consumers and authorities 
data breach 
mandatory breach notifications will make non compliance more visible organisations 
must notify the supervisory authority without undue delay within hours unless 
the breach unlikely result risk for the rights and freedoms individuals 
which case they must report the public which likely have greater reputational 
impact furthermore the definition data breach breach security leading the 
accidental unlawful destruction loss alteration unauthorised disclosure access 
personal data transmitted stored otherwise processed goes much further than the 
they require greater disclosure from companies than many the state data 
breach laws which ask companies only report data breach the information 
exposed could lead fraud identity theft 
security recommendations are more specific particular article mentions 
pseudonymisation and encryption method ensure protection personal data 
the use encryption could result lower fines for companies and companies not 
need notify data subject data breach technical and organisational measures 
have been applied the personal data which will render unintelligible unauthorised 
persons such encryption such are likely see increase the use 
encryption technologies overall the focus the regulation companies 
implementing appropriate security measures protect personal data 
more extensive documentation the use personal data will require audit the 
data held for many this might not straightforward companies will have provide 
clear documentation categorising the types data they are holding recording details 
the recipients this information and indicating the time horizon for which the data 
will held for most this likely very time consuming analysis ernst and 
young its privacy questionnaire suggests that almost half privacy 
professionals are concerned that they not have clear picture where personal 
information stored processed outside their main systems and servers 
furthermore the gdpr will introduce significant fines the event breach 
making non compliance expensive proposition companies can fined 
annual global turnover for breaching gdpr million whichever higher the 
fine tiered but even this would substantial cost for most companies 
particularly those with low margins for context prior the gdpr the information 
commissioner office the could only implement fine 
perhaps even more material for company the supervisory authority can 
stop company from using certain type data which could fundamental the 
business model 
this should drive more security spending broadly particular 
europe which currently lags the 
more stringent data protection regulations form positive tailwind broadly across the 
security ecosystem given applies any company holding personal data however 
think increased spending the will the most notable with the average 
security stock our coverage universe generating revenue from europe 
versus from the americas whilst lower spending europe isn necessarily linked 
the revenues generated the the coverage universe note that almost 
all the stocks under our coverage have low revenue europe fortinet 
revenue emea check point and varonis are the most 
exposed europe within our security universe 
the represents more mature market terms cybersecurity investments with 
based companies already facing breach protection regulations the state level 
april states had enacted legislation requiring private governmental 
entities notify individuals data breach when involves pii with only alabama and 
south dakota exceptions however the has had much longer history 
reporting data breaches with the first these laws california coming into effect 
furthermore the has had number high profile breaches compared 
europe such the americas comprises total security software spending 
today according idc with emea comprising despite roughly similar aggregate 
gdp between the two geographic regions 
emea spending equaled americas spending gdp would see 
incremental spending security software relation spend today 
aggregate this represents the upward bound opportunity and note that the 
timing for companies invest security solutions result gdpr uncertain 
such the upside potential could materialise over longer period time european 
companies more heavily invest security technologies whilst many companies are 
having the conversations with the security solution companies expect some 
companies invest security solutions over the next year the lead the

creating opportunities for software security and storage 
solutions 
whilst believe that all cyber security stocks are likely experience some benefit 
from the introduction the gdpr have identified three key areas where see 
the greatest opportunity vulnerability management security analytics identity and 
data protection technologies and storage software 
potential winners companies offering data protection and detectionoriented technologies could key beneficiaries 
vulnerability management and security analytics stricter regulatory requirements 
should drive need for better visibility reporting and remediation for 
software infrastructure vulnerabilities these solutions help enterprises quickly identify 
threats well demonstrate compliance data protection officers our recent 
survey state security spending chief security officers highlighted the 
growing priority vulnerability management with csos identifying top 
priority compared which identified top priority for think 
key beneficiaries here could 
qualys qualys leading provider vulnerability management technology 
including tools for continuous monitoring environments policy compliance and 
web app scanning qualys also offers private cloud platform appliance which 
may benefit from local data residency requirements only revenue 
generated internationally but qualys recently hired new emea sales 
accelerate international traction and has datacenters worldwide 
also next gen vulnerability management provider that should 
benefit from gdpr result its broadening portfolio which includes web app 
scanning user behavior analytics and siem solutions addition vulnerability 
management these solutions help enterprises detect unusual activity and shorten 
time detection remediation has more limited presence internationally 
with only revenue outside north america but this growing 
faster clip yoy 
splunk gdpr will likely drive increased priority solutions that help identify 
security breaches early order mitigate the likelihood data breach and 
splunk enterprise security and user behavioral analytics solutions positions 
favorably for this with only revenue from international geographies 
see material growth opportunity for splunk outside the 
particularly with gdpr driver 
identity and data protection technologies the most obvious technology beneficiaries 
center around solutions better identify and control access data data protection 
broad term with number technologies directly indirectly enabling the ability 
control sensitive data including encryption data loss prevention and identity access 
management capabilities think key beneficiaries here could 
varonis varonis technology allows enterprises visualize control and protect 
their data with its dataadvantage platform think this positions varonis 
favorably enterprises will need demonstrate where data resides and who has 
control over addition its newer solution dataalerts helps provide visibility 
well alerts unusual user behavior around critical data varonis has had mixed 
results its emea business with only revenue growth emea 
however new sales leadership place along with the gdpr tailwind could drive 
improving emea growth for vrns 
symantec symantec broad suite positions favorably with solutions offer 
including data loss prevention encryption endpoint protection and cybersecurity 
services symantec also offers compliance solutions lending visibility into security 
controls and vulnerabilities symantec along with bluecoat has broad 
distribution channel and meaningful exposure europe with total revenue 
from emea emea revenue was yoy uptick 
european security spending could conceivably help symantec return this business 
growth 
proofpoint proofpoint offers email security including next gen malware 
protection email archiving email fraud protection and data loss prevention 
capabilities proofpoint could benefit from gdpr enterprises seek protect 
sensitive data transversing via email particularly enterprises move cloudbased proofpoint generates only its revenue from international 
geographies pointing sizeable opportunity for growth 
cyberark securing privileged access critical step protecting sensitive data 
favorably positioning cyberark with its leading privileged access management 
technology cyberark already generates its revenue emea yoy 
increased investments sales and marketing capacity should help 
continue penetrate this region 
imperva whilst are cautious imperva due increased competition its web 
application firewall business still see imperva poised benefit from gdpr 
due its database security segment approximately imperva product 
revenue which should benefit from greater focus data protection with 
securesphere imperva offers database activity monitoring and database firewalling 
control monitor and report database activity well identity unusual 
behavior with revenue from emea imperva already has the infrastructure 
place address this opportunity 
sophos sophos offers central device encryption sophos mobile extending 
encryption data mobile devices and sophos email appliance automatically 
blocking encrypting sensitive emails and attachments sophos generates 
its revenue emea positioning well grow further should gdpr result 
greater uptake its software 
storage software the gdpr will focus companies data management 
and classification govern and manage data efficiently expect storage 
solutions benefit from increase spending this area 
high level storage solution providers which focus more robust data lifecycle 
management and data classification capabilities should beneficiaries from the new 
regulation the new right forgotten request for erasure data and the right 
portability receive the personal data concerning them will require companies 
able identify individuals personal data which may stored multiple servers 
such storage solutions that allow enterprises discover the data they are storing 
reduce duplication and help with data classification and monitoring are likely benefit
