investment summary 
security for cloud based world enterprises computing environments are becoming 
increasingly decentralized and distributed given the growth cloud applications and the 
mobile workforce which brings computing outside the premises corporate data 
centers however traditional security architectures have focused securing 
perimeter around the corporate network with layered security functionality defense 
depth this architecture not fully efficient increasingly decentralized environments 
not fully effective more likely have gaps security coverage and offers poor 
user experience particularly for branch offices zscaler offers different approach with 
its direct cloud security architecture enabling the application security policy 
through zscaler cloud versus the network perimeter zscaler data centers 
enables greater scale which drives better user experience more robust threat insights 
and more efficient networking architecture this approach has enabled zscaler grow 
billings over the past two years

growth over the next several years well ahead security peers however

attractively grow into its large addressable opportunity this includes 
cybersecurity remains top priority for enterprises with increasingly 
malicious environment and growing compliance regulations spending 
cybersecurity remains priority for enterprises security has remained top priority 
the last cio surveys over the past years and see security spending

key investment negatives 
zscaler faces real competition from larger better resourced competitors 
zscaler exposed attractive secular themes and therefore doesn operate 
alone zscaler faces competition from three main categories legacy web security 
vendors such bluecoat part symantec and forcepoint formerly websense 
who are shifting their focus more cloud based web security solutions versus 
legacy appliance based broader network security vendors like cisco and palo 
alto who offer web security capabilities but address other areas zscaler market 
opportunity like vpn some cases subscription cloud form factor and 
emerging pure play cloud security vendors all private 
zscaler faces several patent lawsuits including two with symantec zscaler 
currently involved defending four patent litigation claims two symantec one 
finjan patent holding company and one bascom management believes 
has patent invalidity and non infringement claims and has not recorded 
liability with respect any the cases the markman hearings for the symantec 
cases are scheduled for the spring management expects legal 
expenses total expense base legal expenses 
and 
unprofitable and cash flow negative model operating margins

what could get more positive negative our bull bear scenarios flex 
assumptions across two factors new customer growth and growth spend per 
customer the upside scenario sees zscaler replacing the entire network security stack 
while the downside scenario suggests zscaler remains more niche web gateway 
replacement 
upside risks our with only customers compared palo alto networks 
and check point fortinet zscaler has room accelerate customer 
adds the same time zscaler has meaningful upsell opportunity with moving its 
base its transformational suites which captures more buckets security spending 
including network firewalls its zpa solution relatively new revenue but can 
meaningful given pricing the same level zia zscaler garners more market 
awareness and enterprises garner more comfort replacing more the physical network 
security appliances with cloud based solution zscaler could sustain current growth 
levels for the next several years this would line with our bull case 
downside risks our the next gen security platform zscaler will need 
make further inroads into the high end enterprise space financial services government 
etc markets where they face heightened competition very sticky incumbents and 
lower willingness adopt cloud increased competition from legacy web gateway 
vendors and sticky network security solutions could limit zscaler from extending 
beyond modest share gains the web security market this would drive top line growth 
the low for the next few years line with other small niche vendors and drive 
towards our bear case 
debate how large the addressable market 
bulls replacing the full network security stack zscaler cloud security 
platform able capture broader spectrum security spend including 
network firewalls which represent the largest bucket security spend today 
with lower cost entry and relative ease implementation zscaler able 
successfully address the full year network security spend today growing 
high single digits this market opportunity can grow higher given the amount 
greenfield opportunity and enterprises greater willingness spend with zscaler 
relative legacy solutions given lower tco and more effective platform 
bears sticking the web gateway replacement opportunity increased 
competition from legacy secure web gateway vendors blue coat cisco and sticky 
network security solutions limit zscaler opportunity its core web security 
market therefore zscaler addressing only annual web security spend 
today based idc 
our view see zscaler well positioned leader the web security 
and adjacent markets although materially addressing the network firewall 
market the total spending more line with our bull case than 
base given the stickiness the formidable competitive set that market 
however bottom view highlights zscaler sizable runway looking 
enterprise seats globally and assuming asps for zia secure business bundle yields 
total market opportunity with zia transformation and zpa attach driving 
the opportunity materially higher this bottoms view highlights that zscaler 
far from saturation supporting top line growth for the next several years 
top down view the total addressable market 
current spend today suggests long runway for displacements according 
industry analysts and our customer conversations zscaler best breed vendor 
web security which comprises estimated annual spend today based idc 
however the company has extended its cloud security platform into broader market 
opportunities such advanced malware protection data loss prevention dlp and 
network firewalls with the introduction its cloud based firewall taking these 
segments together this enables zscaler address larger market 
estimated annual spend based idc with the network firewall segment accounting for 
the total spend which for edge firewalls taking the most narrow 
definition its market opportunity zscaler has garnered only share the 
web security gateway spending 
while see continued rapid share gain for zscaler its core web security market and 
adjacent technologies believe long path materially address the broader 
enterprise edge firewall market spending within the given better 
positioned and stickier competitors the next gen firewall market palo alto 
networks fortinet longer term the roi from lower appliance costs begins 
resonate with enterprises could see more meaningful growth from zscaler cloud

players 
large addressable market typically met with number viable competitors the 
competitive set largely includes network security vendors who are typically appliancebased but increasingly shifting more software and cloud solutions while there are 
handful small private companies addressing the cloud based security market 
zscaler competitive set largely centers around two categories vendors 
legacy web security vendors web security functionality comprises 
zscaler total annualized recurring revenue but believe the primary initial sale 
for zscaler centers around web gateway replacements this case zscaler 
largely competing replace web security gateways the market leaders include 
symantec blue coat cisco and forcepoint websense 
other network security vendors zscaler initially sells web gateway 
replacement replacement for unified threat management utm appliance 
branch offices after the initial sale zscaler upsells with additional network and

how zscaler wins 
there are two relevant discussions around competition why does zscaler win relate 
appliance based solutions and why does zscaler win relative new cloud based 
solutions collected some qualitative feedback based our customer diligence 
why does zscaler win relative appliance based web network security solutions 
there are numerous advantages moving cloud based security solution and 
listed some the common themes below 
lower hardware management costs the move cloud based security solution 
eliminates the upfront cost appliances well the cost around implementing 
and managing the appliance the data center usually requiring ftes 
lower networking costs zscaler helps simplify the traditional hub spoke model 
where branch office internet traffic gets routed the corporate for security 
purposes this drives networking costs mpls costs that can reduced with 
direct internet architecture through zscaler zscaler customers typically see reduction mpls costs 
better user experience with the direct cloud architecture users connect the 
nearest zscaler data center taking the shortest path the application internet 
destination zscaler has also peered with number cloud vendors fiber 
networks like microsoft which results less latency this results faster user 
experience particularly for branch employees 
network effects global scale the scale zscaler global cloud data 
centers and the volume web traffic sees requests day provides greater 
visibility into advanced and zero day threats information that can leveraged 
broadly across the entire customer base 
why does zscaler win relative other cloud based solutions after enterprises 
decide adopt cloud based web security solution zscaler enters the short list given 
its the largest and most mature cloud web proxy this scenario zscaler largely 
competing against legacy vendors who have extended their portfolio into cloud based 
subscription solutions our customer conversations pointed number 
advantages zscaler relative cloud based peers 
operational expertise running cloud platform zscaler was started and 
has since built scalable cloud with multi tenant architecture which include some 
proprietary technology other words has year lead example 
symantec has been the market with its cloud delivered web security service for 
only years industry experts note zscaler leader with gartner identifying 
zscaler leader its web security gateway magic quadrant 
broad portfolio the customer relationship usually starts web gateway 
replacement but now offers customers wider breadth functionality 
including encryption data loss prevention sandboxing firewalling all cloud 
form factor legacy solutions generally don offer the same degree functionality 
delivered via the cloud zscaler architected its cloud can perform line 
inspection all internet traffic enabling the application multiple security 
functionality single pass reducing latency 
exhibit zscaler leader gartner magic quadrant for web gateways 
source gartner 
some the upsell opportunities like cloud firewall and advanced malware protection 
sandboxing are relatively new years enterprises generally tend reluctant 
adopt newer solutions particularly for tech like firewalls which sits the center the 
security architecture perimeter based firewalls are sticky and zscaler technology likely 
needs mature bit more before meaningfully replacing these appliances but did 
hear customer widely adopting firewall helper functionality like advanced malware 
protection which are generally easy add ons the web gateway capabilities 
exhibit the traditional perimeter based security model not 
effective efficient 
exhibit which zscaler addresses making its more efficient 
cloud where security policy applied 
source morgan stanley research company data 
source morgan stanley research company dat 
public cloud vendors compete this market could they public cloud vendors 
like amazon and microsoft azure not offer web security capabilities today 
effectively public cloud vendors would have the data path for all internet 
traffic all internet traffic gets routed through that one particular cloud which requires 
different architecture and different core competency than their current model the 
need for multi cloud and premises visibility drives the need for party security 
solution well this limits the cloud vendors ability make effective business model 
shifts address this opportunity 
debate what zscaler long term profitability profile 
bulls zscaler gains scale profitability should follow the company 
pursuing large market opportunity and investing aggressively growth 
begins slow attractive customer unit economics with renewal 
contribution margins should deliver inherent model leverage over time driving

business model and forecast assumptions 
high revenue visibility from recurring subscription model 
zscaler has experienced strong growth recent years with high visibility from their 
recurring revenue model combined with large addressable market ahead see 
long runway sustainable growth revenue growth has accelerated from 
and see multiple avenues growth the company targets 
estimated annual network security spend 
subscription revenue rev the vast majority company revenue 
generated from the sale recurring subscriptions which consists fees paid for 
zscaler seat based application bundles its cloud platform and other add 
options the company provides scalable pricing model based the number 
seats users per module with typical enterprise volume discounts typical 
subscription contract terms are around years with customers invoiced 
annually upfront billed monthly quarterly and the remainder multi year 
years upfront billing gross dollar renewal rates are approximately excl 
upsell with net dollar retention 
professional services revenue rev professional services are sold 
time and materials basis for the implementation and training customers using 
zscaler platform professional services revenue has historically been insignificant 
zscaler primarily leverages channel partners and system integrators the 
implementation process 
conservative forward estimates 
our model assumes revenue deceleration from yoy 
billings growth declines from yoy over the same period our forward 
estimates imply significant sales productivity declines with new subscription billings per 
productive rep down yoy and down although historically 
sales productivity has been stable are also estimating near doubling the direct 
sales force from zscaler pursues large addressable market our 
base case assumes operating margin declines from 
before improving and this scenario not expect 
zscaler reach operating margin profitability until which could also prove 
conservative revenue outperformance falls through the bottom line 
exhibit estimate revenue growth decelerates high range from 
reported 
source company data morgan stanley research estimates 
exhibit our estimates reflect declining sales productivity new subscription 
billings per rep new sales hires ramp despite historically stable sales 
productivity 
source company data morgan stanley research estimates 
key model assumptions 
sales productivity model decline sales productivity 
new subscription billings per productive rep with the pace yoy decline 
improving which may prove conservative new sales hires ramp 
our estimates reflect rapid growth quota carrying sales heads yoy 
before decelerating growth 
billings our billings growth estimate yoy represents deceleration 
billings growth reflecting conservatism around sales productivity 
model total billings growth further decelerate and stabilize yoy 
both and 
conservative revenue growth assumptions forecast revenue growth 
decelerate from reported and before 
stabilizing into the mid high range over the next few years revenue growth 
function billings growth discussed above which reflect upfront payments 
from customers under contract and recognized ratably from deferred revenue 
the balance sheet 
retention rate assume gross dollar retention rate excluding upsells remains 
near term through this could prove conservative growing mix 
enterprise customers within zscaler installed base drive down overall churn and 
gross retention closer mid range 
gross margin our model looks for modest improvement gross margin from 
and with current gross margins already 
best class and management long term targeted range between 
think more meaningful expansion unlikely given the ongoing data center and 
bandwidth costs associated with operating zscaler cloud platform 
operating margins operating margins remain negative for the next several years 
the company absorbs ipo costs and invests heavily expand capacity given 
bolstered spend preparation for its public offering believe margins likely 
bottom and could improve and 
start see leverage from slowdown new sales hiring expect 
positive operating margins new sales hires ramp become fully 
productive long term targets call for operating margins line with typical 
saas peers 
operating cash flow anticipate operating cash flow break even with 
free cash flow break even the following year this could also prove conservative 
revenue outperforms and combines with operating leverage deliver cash flow 
profitability sooner our fcf estimates assume ramp legal expenses due the 
symantec litigation and compared 
spent 
valuation overview and scenario analysis 
believe large addressable market for zscaler sets sustainable 
revenue cagr over the next years and perhaps longer investments expanding 
sales capacity and new technologies create the foundation for sustainable growth 
our view although profitability will likely muted over the next few years zscaler 
builds scale its recurring customer base growth trends toward our bull case 
scenario which estimates rev cagr over the next couple years and margins 
begin show leverage sooner believe the stock price could move towards our bull 
case growth below our base case limited margin leverage could drive the 
stock towards our bear case 
key drivers upside 
consistent outperformance conservative expectations model 
deceleration revenue growth from yoy reported and 
these estimates embed sales productivity declines 
which believe conservative given historically stable production 
numbers from the company sales organization the same time are 
estimating growth quota carrying headcount the current 
setting upside numbers head into given the sizeable tam 
growing sales capacity and accelerating rev growth believe our 
base case revenue growth and growth leaves ample 
room for estimates move higher upside revenue could flow through 
operating margins given inherent model leverage better than expected growth and 
profitability could either sustain drive multiples higher the company continues 
outperform expectations 
faster than expected expansion into adjacent market opportunities our base 
case assumes zscaler grows into market leading position within web security with 
more meaningful expansion adjacent market opportunities like advanced 
malware protection vpn and network security over time faster than expected 
share gain within the broader security market particularly the next gen firewall 
category could open much larger potential bull case tam based our

comparables analysis 
zscaler remains firmly its high growth phase with investment sales capacity and 
weighing down operating margins over the next few years such sales and 
growth adjusted sales multiples are the most appropriate comparable valuation 
metrics for zscaler our view sales and growth adjusted 
zscaler trades premium its overall peer group which believe already reflects 
our conservative model assumptions and expansion within adjacent market 
opportunities like network security while sustainability growth could also more 
durable than the peer average our view believe this largely reflected shares

had been made and ultimately rejected prior the ipo according sources familiar 
with the deal link article neither company has commented and are not aware 
any upcoming transaction based large strategic acquisitions made over the past 
couple years seen recent saas acquisition take out multiples ntm

limited view zscaler asset high strategic value which provides some
