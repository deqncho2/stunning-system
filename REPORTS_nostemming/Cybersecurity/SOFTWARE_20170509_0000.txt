chief security officers survey strengthens our view solid security demand 
our survey chief security officers csos highlights sustained 
security spending growth over the next few years driven the need refresh 
technology for better performance and incorporate new security technologies 
amid more frequent advanced breaches our survey shows expected 
growth security spending accelerating cagr over the next 
three years ahead overall spending growth according our cio 
survey stable improving commercial demand for security bucks concerns 
related secular headwinds from ineffective security technologies architectures 
and cloud adoption generally solid results for security suggest better 
demand environment anniversary the cyclical weakness seen 
and refresh technology picks modestly 
stocks have run but some areas for further upside with the average security 
stock ytd recognize that investors have already warmed bit 
the space however the average security stock still down since end 
from here investors should focus vendors consolidating security spend 
like symc and csco vendors well positioned categories garnering 
incremental spending security like splk security analytics vmw microsegmentation protecting cloud workloads like pfpt and stocks trading 
steep discount sustainable fcf growth like ftnt 
better firewall refreshes sets the base for healthy spending environment 
thirty percent csos note their organization plans has already refreshed 
majority their firewalls from who refreshed stable 
improving firewall refresh environment likely tailwind for broader security 
spending usually coincides with additional security 
decisions implementations csos identify refreshing technology for better 
performance new technologies top drivers incremental security spend 
along with the increased presence advanced persistent threats 
with incremental investments new technologies securing new vectors 
driving growth our survey highlighted adoption new technologies such 
cloud access security brokerage solutions well the continued secular shift 
towards consolidated network security solutions with csos expecting 
penetration ramp from today gateways years several

spending tech which enables better visibility and control increasingly 
complex computing environments endpoint security was within the top 
five priorities for spending suggesting continued endpoint 
security refresh cycle 
protection new vectors namely the cloud csos identify the move 
public cloud additive security spending the subsectors best 
positioned benefit include security analytics csos note that 
they plan spend more due the cloud spending less and

security with share today moving years microsoft loses share 
that market years our survey also showed sophos making 
strong grounds within the next gen network market albeit from low base 
increasing from share today the next months leading market 
share ahead expected firewall refreshes leaves positive cisco security 
business particularly its opportunity upsell the broader security portfolio 
and consolidate budgets our survey showed continued share gains for palo alto

industry takeaways 
maintain our more positive outlook security spend move past the 
cyclical slowdown seen against stable demand drivers increasingly 
malicious threat environment this fits well with our survey chief security officers 
csos who expect continued growth their security budget over the next three years 
this contrasts with the bear thesis that security spending faces secular challenges 
enterprises awaken the ineffectiveness current security technologies and 
enterprises move their data centers into the cloud 
highlight four key industry takeaways 
growth security spending should remain robust over the next years and 
ahead overall spend chief security officers report average expected 
growth security spending this compares software spending growth 
and overall spending growth according our april cio 
survey note csos average expect security spending growth improve over 
the next few years with average annual growth over the next months 
firewall refresh set improve thirty percent csos note their 
organization plans has already refreshed majority their firewalls 
from who refreshed stable improving firewall refresh 
environment could tailwind for broader security spending usually 
coincides with additional security decisions implementations csos identify 
refreshing technology for better performance new technologies top drivers 
incremental security spend along with the increased presence advanced 
persistent threats 
consolidated network security appliances remains top priority with 
significant inflection cloud access security csos note consolidated 
network security appliances the top priority for spending down from 
who identified top priority most notable the inflection the 
priority cloud access security brokerage technologies casb with 
identifying the top priority who noted the top priority 
almost csos identity casb least top priority rounding out 
the top five buckets security spending include security analytics 
endpoint security and intrusion detection prevention 
cloud remains additive for all buckets security spending microsegmentation 
emerging driver for network security vendors the csos identifying the 
move public cloud additive security spending continues outweigh the 
who believe will decrease security spending the subsectors best positioned 
benefit include security analytics csos note that they plan spend more 
due the cloud spending less and identity management csos will 
spend more due the cloud less network security appliances are more 
debate with csos expecting spend more less however virtual 
network security appliances will clear beneficiary with csos expecting 
add decreasing while close csos note adoption virtual 
firewalls from their primary premise firewall vendor also note the growing 
adoption microsegmentation approach the data center with csos 
adopting microsegmentation today expected increase over the next few 
years 
stock takeaways 
symantec endpoint protection platform leader 
positive 
symantec expected remain the mostly broadly deployed traditional 
endpoint security vendor today symantec retains the top spot endpoint 
security with cso respondents most broadly deploying symantec this 
should largely stable over the next months with csos expecting 
symantec the most deployed vendor 
while endpoint security remains priority for csos identified 
endpoint security one the top priorities for security spending the 
highest ranking across all security technology however this lower than 
who identified priority for 
our survey shows significant inflection cloud access security brokerage 
adoption casb csos report casb top priority for 
with the bluecoat acquisition symantec acquired the top casb 
solution elastica although elastica off small base today think this 
business forms piece our view that the good assets within symantec 
enterprise security business outweighing the bad 
neutral 
symantec expected remain the most broadly deployed next gen endpoint 
security vendor albeit losing share today csos indicate symantec 
their most broadly deployed next gen endpoint security vendor relatively 
line with share for traditional endpoint security symantec expected remain 
leader over the next months but lower share the market 
becomes more fragmented 
blue coat share web security gateway market expected remain stable 
behind cisco palo alto networks and web security remains relatively 
low priority with cso identifying top priority for however blue

positive 
consolidated network security appliances remain the top priority with 
csos identifying the top priority and identifying top 
priority for 
palo alto networks expected gain substantial share amongst consolidated 
network appliances csos expect palo alto networks their most 
broadly deployed consolidated network security appliance months 
from today 
csos are deploying virtual firewalls from premise vendors the cloud 
close csos note they use will use virtual firewalls from their 
primary premise firewall vendor when securing iaas paas workloads this 
should support continued growth palo alto network series solutions 
the series should also benefit from growth microsegmentation 
techniques with csos using firewalls when deploying 
microsegmentation 
negative 
cso responses suggest very little traction within endpoint protection today 
the next months csos currently use palo alto networks today and 
expected decline the next months 
check point software technologies mixed outlook check 
point loses share core network security markets 
positive 
cso responses suggest check point traction within the next gen endpoint 
market survey respondents indicate that check point share the next gen 
endpoint market will rise the next months from today this 
was surprising takeaway given limited traction endpoint security for check 
point date 
negative 
check point expected lose significant share the consolidated network 
security appliance market csos expect broadly deploying check 
point for consolidated network security applications months falling from 
share today this was the steepest share loss amongst vendors that 
saw network security

survey respondents suggest check point share the next gen network market 
decline the next months from today 
cisco systems expected remain the network security leader 
positive 
consolidated network security appliances remains the top priority 
and cisco expected remain the dominant leader within network 
security currently csos most broadly deploy cisco for their 
consolidated network security appliances which expected remain this 
level the next months topping the list 
csos are deploying virtual firewalls from premise vendors the cloud 
close csos note they use will use virtual firewalls from their 
primary premise firewall vendor when securing iaas paas workloads this 
should support continued growth cisco virtual appliances particularly with 
the added driver microsegmentation 
neutral 
although losing share cisco sourcefire expected remain the top next gen 
network security vendor alongside palo alto networks survey responses 
indicate cisco sourcefire share the next gen network market will decline 
from today however still represents the highest vendor share 
next gen network security alongside palo alto networks 
cisco expected stay far ahead the lead the web security gateway 
market csos indicated they will most broadly deploy cisco for web 
gateway security years down from today however this comes well 
ahead peers palo alto networks expected and blue coat symantec 
expected 
proofpoint continued share gainer its core email market 
opportunity 
positive 
csos expect proofpoint make gains within email security survey responses 
suggest that proofpoint will garner share the email security market 
the next months from share today

csos report using microsoft for email security today expected downtick 
over the next years 
sophos gaining traction within next gen endpoint 
positive 
sophos expected make strong grounds within the next gen network market 
albeit from low base cso responses suggest that sophos next gen endpoint 
deployment will increase from today the next months 
neutral 
share within endpoint protection expected stay current levels today 
cso respondents most broadly deploy sophos for endpoint protection

positive 
although from small base fortinet expected double share within 
consolidated network security appliances csos expect fortinet share 
consolidated network security appliances double the next 
months from today 
with the other firewall vendors fortinet should benefit from consolidated 
network security appliances top priority stable firewall refreshes 
and increased virtual appliance deployments for protection cloud 
workloads 
fireeye survey suggests declines within core advanced 
network malware market 
neutral 
fireeye share next gen endpoint expected remain stable current levels 
within the next gen endpoint market csos expect fireeye share remain
