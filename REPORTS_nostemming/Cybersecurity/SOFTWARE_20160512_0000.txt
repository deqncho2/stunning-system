our view for example the security the web applications and databases 
running within public cloud environments 
best positioned vendor proofpoint proofpoint plays two key trends 
consolidation data protection technology and securing cloud assets through 
its cloud based email and data protection platform the email security market 
mature and growing the low single digits but with the move office 
catalyst versus competitive threat and enterprises looking integrate basic 
email security with advanced threat protection proofpoint will continue gain 
share and grow average customer size share gains upsell into its existing base 
with expanding portfolio and new partnerships with palo alto networks

key conclusions 
revisiting our cybersecurity blue paper rethinking security 
the month since published our cybersecurity blue paper have met with wide range investors 
discuss our key conclusions the size and shape the cybersecurity industry and company stock implications many 
our investor conversations focused the implications the security landscape from the move the cloud software 
platform infrastructure service broadly see the move the cloud driving incremental but shifting security 
spending with some winners and losers and shifting delivery models for security vendors appliance service our 
broader key conclusions 
the cybersecurity market should continue outpace growth spend rising malicious threats growth digital assets 
and the limited effectiveness current security solutions will likely drive evolution the security paradigm wider 
digital surface area should bolster the market from today cagr well ahead 
mid single digit growth overall spend 
but incremental dollars set shift enterprises are favoring security solutions that enable consolidation and automation 
security functionality well greater visibility across the enterprise these trends require scale such believe the 
big will get bigger counter current trends best breed seeing greater share efficiencies from consolidation help 
enterprises fund security for new vectors such mobile and cloud 
large security platforms the best way play this trend garnering market share line with other mature tech markets 
today the top security vendors could sustain revenue growth through vendors such 
cisco systems palo alto networks sophos and symantec appear well positioned benefit 
some new direct and indirect beneficiaries security gets productized through cloud services amazon microsoft 
hardware components secure chips and security funding sources shift security will increasingly embedded 
product cost while also shifting towards security service capex opex and cybersecurity insurance 
moving computing the cloud via software service applications 
platform infrastructure service drives new security requirements considerations 
for the enterprise including expanding surface area beyond premise 
architectures limited visibility into data residency and concentrated risk with party 
vendors however growing cloud infrastructure has number benefits security 
well particularly related security deployed service the cloud versus the 
traditional premises security deployment method while there may some 
technologies and corresponding vendors that will face challenges this environment 
think the move the cloud largely neutral positive for most security software 
and services vendors 
while not believe that traditional premise security spending going away 
particularly end point and perimeter security see incremental security dollars 
going towards security service offerings and some incremental security for 
cloud applications with premise security becoming less strategic over time could 
see some commodization consolidation some the more mature technologies web 
security stateful inspection firewalls which will likely help fund enterprises increased 
investment cloud security this should help drive relatively stable security budgets 
despite the growing vectors that need protection 
see two main avenues through which the cloud impacts security spending clouddelivered cybersecurity and security for cloud workloads 
cloud delivered cybersecurity 
more computing moves the cloud and enterprises look reduce their data center 
footprint expect see greater adoption security service contrast the 
typical security deployment model often appliance premise software this 
includes solutions that are delivered entirely via the cloud well pieces 
functionality that leverage the cloud with software service saas the 
underlying hardware and software components are abstracted from the customer and 
delivered the customer service see increased adoption security delivered 
via the cloud due the growing sprawl security technology the dynamic threat 
environment and limited house security expertise according idc enterprises use 
cloud based security for their security spend today rising our 
calculation exhibit take slightly more conservative approach and assume the 
security service mix moves 
exhibit expect security service spending significantly outpace growth overall security spending over the next five years

cloud based vendors like proofpoint are well levered this trend while legacy security 
vendors are building security service functionality which should add greater 
recurring revenue the model and potentially boast gross margins the long term 
vendors shift away from appliance based models 
what are the drivers customer adoption security service 
lower capex and personnel costs cloud based security can significantly 
reduce the need purchase maintain and enhance technology infrastructure 
and hire support personnel 
staying current with latest technology buyer cloud delivered 
cybersecurity better positioned automatically take advantage product 
innovation premise where enterprises will need implement new 
versions the latest technology 
benefits scale and shared services security service can boost the 
efficiency advanced security operations centers socs cloud based soc 
that shares information among member organizations enables businesses 
leverage from the collective intelligence helping detect and remediate threats 
more quickly than standalone premise soc 
secure communication channels enterprises will able leverage the 
cloud provider infrastructure deploy secure communication and 
collaboration channels this creates safe repository for sensitive information 
which will require separate access clearance limiting the ability for attackers 
move laterally across the infrastructure following initial breach 
the combination these factors should allow companies that would not normally 
have the resources fund large house security departments gain access more 
dynamic cybersecurity footprint that adapts the changing threat environment 
what areas cybersecurity are seeing cloud delivery today cloud delivered security 
relatively nascent today with idc estimating only security spending today going 
towards cloud delivered security services the markets seeing greater cloud adoption 
include vulnerability management web security and email security which benefiting 
from enterprises adoption addition many solution sets have cloud 
components supplement the premise technology example fireeye onpremise web appliance incorporates its cloud based dynamic threat intelligence 
subscription 
what technologies make most sense deliver over the web believe will see 
increased adoption cloud security for technology that needs integrate both 
cloud and premise use cases example here identity management technology 
which enterprises use manage identities across all applications premise and 
cloud technology that already extends outside the network example the 
protection external facing websites web application firewall and email security and 
technology which bolstered greater scale example threat intelligence 
which can benefit from sharing information across wide customer base 
endpoint security and network security less likely fully move the cloud cloudbased endpoint security solution would require the device mobile server 
connected the web for protection however this raises issues when the device 
offline malicious software downloaded attack trigger can occur once 
internet connection detected which point the endpoint becomes vulnerable 
however see increased cloud based functionality embedded endpoint security 
such threat intelligence cloud based signature databases known malware 
the key barrier significant adoption cloud based network security the latency 
lag created when specific web traffic all traffic all network security cloud 
delivered routed through the infrastructure the cloud security provider adequate 
global infrastructure can mitigate this issue the near term most companies will 
operate hybrid cloud environments running workloads both premise and the 
public cloud this may actually prove benefit spending perimeter security while 
perimeter security today protects what called north south traffic into and out the 
data center the traffic between systems and applications within data center 
east west traffic remains largely unprotected with more systems and applications 
now residing outside the data center more that east west traffic becomes 
north south traffic pushing higher volume traffic through the perimeter security 
which generally prices based capacity 
how could this impact the current spending environment not necessarily additive but 
more shifting towards more favorable business models 
greater cost efficiency benefits from greater scale and greater ease management will 
likely drive increased adoption cloud delivered cybersecurity currently the vast 
majority cybersecurity software sales are for premise systems 
according idc assume security service will increase from the 
product mix today growing pace more than double the traditional 
security architectures assume our revolution scenario and assume that security 
service grows double the pace the overall market could see security 
service grow over the next five years 
the move security service will shift business models towards more recurring 
revenue which generally has positive impacts model visibility and customer lifetime 
value addition this also shifts business models away from the traditional appliancebased delivery and towards service delivery depending scale the cloud 
infrastructure this could have positive impacts gross margins however company 
building out its own cloud services leveraging aws azure example gross 
margins may lower particularly the solutions are subscale example 
proofpoint which cloud based has gross margins the average security

cybersecurity for the cloud 
expect see new security requirements arising from the increased adoption 
cloud based infrastructure and applications many cases security for the cloud will 
additive existing premise security deployments and offer area growth for 
legacy security players who are facing maturity premise architectures however 
also expect the cloud providers themselves capture some incremental security 
dollars either indirectly part the product offering directly separate sku 
when companies shift their infrastructure the cloud the responsibility provide 
cybersecurity for that infrastructure shifts into the hands the cloud service provider 
the enterprise however the enterprise remains responsible for the security the 
actual data and application the cloud other words the cloud provider 
responsible for the security the infrastructure the enterprise remains responsible for

security for cloud apps and cloud infrastructure broadly believe cloud application 
deployments software service require new but narrow list cybersecurity 
technologies procured directly the enterprise one the more common additional 
technology deployed today alongside cloud applications cloud access security 
brokerage technology casb which provides visibility into the use cloud based 
applications and enforces consistent policies across all cloud and premises apps 
recent activity this space highlights its increasingly strategic importance with 
microsoft buying casb vendor adallom imperva buying skyfence and palo alto 
networks buying cirrosecure addition employees accessing more web based 
applications should drive the need for greater web protection through secure web 
gateways often procured based the amount web traffic and encryption 
technology 
for infrastructure deployments such amazon web services have seen cloud 
providers offer enterprises the option equip its deployments with additional security 
features however this largely delivered party security software providers 
while amazon web services has largely relied party security partners has also 
recently come market with some several security offerings including its own web 
application firewall 
what does change the status quo 
cloud computing aligned with cybersecurity best practices one the core 
issues with advanced persistent threats apt when attacker able gain 
access some part corporation network infrastructure and then freely 
move laterally across the remaining network having specific apps data 
cloud environment solves this issue these cloud environments are isolated 
across the wide area network wan and therefore are secured with their own 
firewalls ips and monitoring our recent conversations with cios now suggest 
security driver cloud adoption with the vendor that platform vendors like 
amazon have significantly greater resources and scale secure its 
infrastructure versus smaller enterprise 
better data protection both rest and transit due the nature 
public cloud architecture virtualization shared servers etc difficult 
point single physical server where the data stored which can breached 
cloud providers typically encrypt the data that server breached the 
attacker will only have access subset the overall information 
economies scale for security expertise cybersecurity significant 
business model risk for cloud providers such these companies have large 
budgets hire top security talent from agencies such the nsa cia fbi 
there significant talent gap cybersecurity with the international 
information system security certification consortium predicting 
hiring shortfall years believe this will make very difficult for large 
corporations compete with cloud providers attract the experienced talent 
required protect against advanced threats 
how could this impact the current spending environment another growth 
opportunity 
when applications and infrastructure shift cloud environment limited amount 
the security responsibility shifts the cloud provider itself cost business 
however cloud vendors currently offer the bare bones security therefore enterprises 
will likely want add from vendors with specific security domain expertise however 
most enterprises today and for the foreseeable future will operate hybrid 
environment with application workloads premise and across multiple clouds this 
means that enterprises won rip out their existing infrastructure moves the 
cloud but rather will layer technologies secure the new cloud workloads 
exhibit most large security vendors offer software only solution iaas platforms such aws although rev contribution today fairly 
minimal 
amazon morgan stanley research

bad actors similar premise architectures encryption for data transit 
can achieved via virtual private networks vpn while there some

email security more enterprises move their email see 
enterprises adopting similar deployment method for email security such 
proofpoint cloud based solution 
identity management proper identity and access management tools iam 
are the foundation for securing cloud applications the move the cloud 
could catalyst for enterprises reevaluate its iam architectures and 
potentially adopt iam service offerings 
web gateways more traffic moves across the web via cloud applications 
this will drive the need for more web security gateway capacity some 
network security vendors such palo alto check point and fortinet offer 
web security capabilities addition stand alone vendors 
virtual firewalls the move the cloud will drive greater adoption 
virtual appliances that can protect apps built the cloud amazon and 
azure own the physical network but not the protection and allow for 
more workload based security these deployments will largely additive

hybrid architecture both premise and the cloud and will want

ddos protection similar the waf analysis protection against distributed 
denial service attacks ddos may reside the data center where the web

other data center security enterprises increasingly adopt database aservice offerings from aws azure believe the threat these cloud

implications for the cloud providers better security reduces friction adoption plus 
some incremental opportunity cloud providers like amazon google and microsoft 
continue enhance their internal security offerings attract more customers but 
likely not aspire large security companies with their core competencies other 
markets services enhancing their security cloud providers are attempting remove 
major point friction the enterprise sales process historically concerns around 
data security have been among the largest obstacles moving workloads the cloud 
such getting potential enterprise customers comfortable with the security offered 
cloud vendors top priority interestingly for many companies and most smbs the 
public cloud may provide higher level security than they could otherwise afford 
through third party vendor 
our revolution scenario could see the public cloud providers take larger role 
developing security applications capturing share the security market themselves 
this scenario cloud providers like aws could add portion the security 
spending our revolution scenario their tam looking further out time 
years possible that security moves more the edges the cloud and the endpoint 
the burden security increasingly shifts the cloud providers see security 
becoming cost doing business for these cloud platforms such will likely 
embedded into pricing with the potential upsell additional features and protections 
while not see amazon google aspiring security company believe 
both will continue expand incremental direct security offerings where makes sense
