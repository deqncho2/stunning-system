summary 
public cloud adoption drives more decentralized distributed computing architectures necessitating security architectures evolve beyond 
the traditional defense depth perimeter based security architectures however our primary survey work cios and chief security officers highlights that cloud migration driving incremental security spend today primarily accruing party security vendors environments remain hybrid mix multi cloud premise meaning the cloud additive vector protect cloud providers offer limited direct 
security functionality themselves and have limited visibility beyond their own cloud and the move the cloud also spurs the need for new 
security functionality like cloud access security brokerage however the public cloud still represents small portion total spending 
too does security for the public cloud total security spending suggesting long runway opportunity ahead

traditional perimeter based security becoming less effective

perimeter allow sanctioned activities users inside the network 
perimeter where the corporate crown jewels reside while blocking 
non sanctioned malicious network traffic branch traffic routed 
through the network corporate headquarters apply consistent 
policy enterprises generally rely network security solutions firewalls intrusion protection vpn enforce policy around what 
allowed and what not allowed enter the corporate network 
however enterprises are shifting incremental investments away 
from this approach the rise insider threats from negligence 
something more nefarious means enterprises can assume 
insiders are good the rising adoption cloud applications means 
some the corporate assets longer reside within the corporate 
perimeter and greater mobility means more enterprise computing

security vendors are the best position provide that func
