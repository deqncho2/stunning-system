the cybersecurity market should continue outpace growth spend rising 
malicious threats growth digital assets and the limited effectiveness current security 
solutions will likely drive evolution the security paradigm wider digital surface area 
should bolster the market from today 
cagr well ahead mid single digit growth overall spend 
but incremental dollars set shift enterprises are favoring security solutions that 
enable consolidation and automation security functionality well greater visibility 
across the enterprise these trends require scale such believe the big will get 
bigger counter current trends best breed seeing greater share efficiencies from 
consolidation help enterprises fund security for new vectors such mobile and cloud 
large security platforms the best way play this trend garnering market share 
line with other mature tech markets today the top security vendors could 
sustain revenue growth through vendors such cisco systems palo 
alto networks sophos and symantec appear well positioned benefit 
some new direct and indirect beneficiaries security gets productized through 
cloud services amazon microsoft hardware components secure chips and security 
funding sources shift security will increasingly embedded product cost while also 
shifting towards security service capex opex and cybersecurity insurance

more effective security versus more security 
driving change the core security paradigm 
key takeaways 
alternative scenarios 
more digitization requires new security paradigm themes such 
cloud app infrastructure adoption mobility software defined networking 
and internet things add growing surface area that enterprises and 
consumers must protect the same time limited security expertise 
ineffective security technology and productivity drags from highly restrictive 
security policies limit effective security posture 
revolution new set security providers internet connected 
world securing iot could drive overall security spend 
our base case assumes evolution the security paradigm 
see the cybersecurity market evolving encompass larger surface area 
including public and private cloud workloads and wider variety devices 
efficiency garnered from traditional security spending complements 
incremental security spend for new vectors and new assets driving 
security technology and services 
companies will likely shift spend towards solutions that provide 
consolidation visibility analytics and automation drive more optimal 
cost efficiency equation this helps fund securing new vectors such the 
cloud while embedded security helps alleviate security share the

point and symantec become commoditized 
best positioned vendors with scale are well positioned and the big can 
get bigger counter consensus view that best breed within security 
wins vendors such cisco systems palo alto networks sophos and 
symantec are well positioned 
potentially challenged vendors offering point solutions will likely become 
commoditized functionality rolls into broader platforms

the defense depth strategy relies the premise that 
enterprises can harden the perimeter device itself 
mitigate risk however these technologies alone and 
aggregate are not effective such enterprises are 
also layering detection and monitoring oriented 
technologies across the entire cyber kill chain 
overall 
security expertise and human capital are significant 
constraints against backdrop increasingly 
sophisticated threat environment security professionals 
either internal resources outsourced often complement 
and bolster the deficiencies security technologies with 
growing number security technologies throwing off alerts 
human capital necessary prioritize and act the alerts 
however with close unemployment for security 
professionals and projected increase the demand for 
information security analysts between and 
according the bureau labor statistics skilled security 
professionals are and will likely remain scarce resource 
productivity takes hit from restrictive security policies 
there are costs associated with implementing overly 
restrictive security policies chiefly around the lost productivity 
the workforce example enterprises may restrict the 
use legitimate cloud based applications because the 
more limited control the data that resides the cloud twofactor authentication and remote log ins technologies 
access corporate desktops are also good examples strong 
security measures that drag down productivity there also 
the lost productivity related false positives within security 
example email security solution potentially blocking 
legitimate email employee because has characteristics 
morgan stanley research

cybersecurity rethinking security 
that suggest malicious email while enterprises want 
solutions that automatically block potential threats the 
challenge with false positives and the subsequent productivity 
hit often limits enterprises from implementing strict automation 
security policies 
fear false positives limits effective security 
implementation false positive any normal within 
policy behavior that incorrectly identified malicious out 
policy this problem arises because imperfect 
information light complex threat environment this 
means that perfectly legitimate activity may restricted due 
false positive with implications around employee 
productivity because the risk false positives security 
organizations are often reluctant implement tight 
prevention oriented security policy line with network traffic 
instead enterprises have favored detection oriented 
technology out line network traffic which security 
analysts can then analyze and take action this approach 
reduces the likelihood false positives but does not catch 
threats real time our conversations suggest the ability 
catch and stop threats immediately critical effective

consolidation creating single pane glass 
consolidation security technologies means that enterprises 
will seek more with fewer vendors particularly within the 
traditional enterprise security architecture where pieces 
functionality become commoditized over time the trend 
towards consolidating security functionality not new has 
evolved the market for almost decade however 
believe this trend will continue not accelerate 
enterprises are increasingly looking have single pane 
glass into their security architecture consolidating security 
functionality drives number benefits around cost 
efficiencies and security effectiveness 
lower total cost ownership sourcing from fewer 
vendors reduces tco potentially getting greater scale 
investments greater volume generally equals higher 
discounts well lower management operations

example endpoint security detects malicious 
process the endpoint advantageous the endpoint 
security technology automatically modifies the firewall 
policies block that malicious process the network 
believe that best breed technology will continue have 
prominent role within the security market given the 
constantly evolving nature threats but vendors which are 
best positioned develop and acquire and integrate those 
best breed solutions into larger platform will likely the 
key beneficiaries 
automation reducing the level human intervention 
one the biggest gating items making security more 
intelligent and effective the labor constraints security 
departments enterprises face overwhelming amount 
security data from too many tools with increasingly limited 
capability process and prioritize the data there are several 
areas where automation alleviates some the human capital 
constraints including more effective prevention oriented 
techniques blocking malicious activity generating alert 
that needs responded more effective detection 
capabilities narrowing and prioritizing the list alerts and 
more automation the remediation forensic process post 
breach mitigate risk 
automating some the more mature security functionality 
better identify and remove the needles within the haystack 
makes existing security infrastructures more effective and 
allow more resources focus new probabilistic solutions 
greater context and visibility finding the needle the 
haystack increasingly noisy environment this 
third pillar security investment centers tools enable 
enterprises broaden their visibility into vulnerabilities and 
activity around users data and applications identify and 
contain malicious behavior more quickly the role big data 
will likely become increasingly strategic bringing together 
internal data analysis analyzing data points generated from 
internal technology and processes and external data 
analyzing data from relevant external data sources apply 
internally this allows security analysts focus the most 
relevant and time sensitive security events according 
gartner large global companies will have adopted big 
data analytics for least one security fraud use case 
from 
focus resiliency with enterprises increasingly 
acknowledging that breach inevitable are seeing 
increased focus resiliency the full recovery normal 
business operations after cyber attack occurs automation 
remediation well greater visibility into the entire cyber 
attack lifecycle enables better resiliency shortens the life 
and risk breach technology not the only enabler 
resiliency enterprises are focused better security controls 
processes and culture 
productization security cloud sdn iot 
cloud necessitates new approaches enterprises will 
likely consolidate premises security functionality through 
multi function appliances and shift some the incremental 
dollars towards security functionality the cloud this 
enables companies move security spending from capex 
investments recurring operating expenses see 
greater scale necessary for some security functionality that 
requires greater computational capacity such security 
analytics and better secure cloud based workloads 
this does not mean that companies will rip out traditional 
security technologies workloads move the cloud but 
does suggest fewer incremental investment dollars moving 
towards those technologies 
are seeing the rise new technology that better 
addresses the unique challenges requirements rising 
cloud adoption software platform and infrastructure 
service technologies focused protecting usage and data 
transport and storage the cloud such encryption 
technologies are becoming more strategic enterprises 
gartner estimates that cloud based security will grow about 
through reaching spending 
mobile sdn also driver other new vectors include 
mobile productivity workers compute more heavily through 
mobile device well through cloud apps today the 
market small with idc estimating only mobile 
security spending given more limited threat 
environment mobile devices today however see 
technologies such mobile anti virus mobile identity and 
access management and mobile vulnerability management 
garnering more traction the mobile vector becomes 
undoubtedly more malicious

software defined networking sdn uses software layer 
dynamically program applications running legacy 
networking infrastructure sdn helps companies enhance 
visibility have more granulated security policies and ensure 
compliance with network management policies however 
implementing and configuring sdns can operational 
challenge that being said the need for better visibility and 
control for more probabilisitic security gives enterprises the 
potential catalyst they need through the difficult 
implementation process our view 
sdn also enables protection east west traffic network 
traffic within the network just north south traffic network 
traffic and out the network advantage relative the 
traditional firewall approach sdn also enables microsegmentation allowing segmented policies and control 
application user and use case 
sdn should drive greater adoption virtualized security 
software including virtualized firewalls these virtualized 
firewalls will likely remain additive existing premise 
firewall implementations more traffic moves outside the 
network new firewall deployments are likely slow and 
perhaps slowly commoditize but see growing market 
internal firewalls protecting network flow between virtual 
machines within the datacenter such firewall vendors can 
see new growth opportunities through virtual firewall 
see trend towards security consolidation within the 
service devices and the components themselves this 
trend takes many forms from security semiconductor chip 
security offered within saas based application this shifts 
spend from direct spend where enterprises have buy 
firewalls web security etc more indirect spend where 
the security embedded feature the product 
service other words this shifts security spend from the 
opex capex spend enterprises the cost sales for 
service product providers 
while the value digital assets continues rise not 
believe this means that the security spend per asset should 
rise well some point enterprises will allocate 
incremental budget insurance protect against 
catastrophic events rather than keep building stronger 
cyber technology however this market still emerging with 
insurance companies tackling the challenge quantifying and 
pricing for potential cyber risk 
building security moving from securing assets 
secure assets see the semiconductor industry playing 
greater role reducing the tax security some the 
leading participants have developed secure chips for 
variety applications including smartcards and sims 
example arm has version its cortex class processors 
called securecore engineered prevent advanced attacks 
the hardware layer also has some secure chip 
which includes some called cyptocell that highly 
configurable component providing anchor trust such

moving security line item expense for cloud service 
providers moving security spend outside the traditional 
budget evolving through the adoption cloud services the 
cloud providers themselves are offering some level 
security which cost business for the cloud provider but 
not additional expense for its customers enterprise 
deploying salesforce the enterprise generally does not 
have attach additional security around that workload 
salesforce provides its own network database and 
application security secure workloads its cloud however 
greater cloud adoption does not cannibalize existing security 
spend enterprises still need secure their premise 
architecture 
this illustrates security functionality product feature may 
moderate the amount incremental dollars needed secure 
newer vectors iot cloud 
addition enterprises become more digital technology 
used secure mission critical digital assets starting 
become more business expense rather than 
expense example morgan stanley wealth 
management customer log site was hacked and sensitive 
data was stolen morgan stanley would suffer severe financial 
and reputational damage therefore one could think the 
security protect that web application cost sales 
rather than expense this important distinction 
because this allows security spending expand outside 
the security budget into the realm the product budget this 
managed security services shifting security opex 
from capex for enterprises enterprises will also 
increasingly leverage managed security services that 
moves some security spend from upfront capex purchases 
potentially recurring subscription fees and enhances 
security effectiveness outsourcing security management 
organization greater scale and management 
who will best positioned 
security not moving towards one but moving towards 
fewer scale will win despite the ongoing trend 
consolidating security functionality we seen the top 
security vendors take smaller share the security spend 
over the past years according idc data however 
think this trend may start stabilize our view existing 
vendors are the best position consolidate security 
spending given their broader portfolios entrenched 
positions already the enterprise and generally strong 
balance sheets that enables and continued 
investments the need for technologies integrate and 
share information will slowly surpass the need for point 
solutions that provide best breed functionality our view 
strong security domain expertise access large volumes 
relevant security data and the confidence security buyers 
likely keeps pure play security vendors the pole position 
consolidate traditional security spend our view vendors 
like palo alto networks fortinet and fireeye are likely best 
positioned benefit over time while vendors like cisco may

cloud providers taking greater share but cloudbased security providers also well positioned there are 
two distinct areas cloud security today security for the 
cloud and security delivered via the cloud areas which are 
increasingly converging our view 
see increased adoption security delivered via the cloud 
due the growing sprawl security technology the dynamic 
threat environment and limited house security expertise 
according idc enterprises use cloud based security for 
their security spend today rising 
some areas security such email security and 
vulnerability management are more mature terms cloud 
delivery while other areas such endpoint and network 
security less however see broad based shift 
spending towards cloud infrastructure which means 
enterprises will likely also choose adopt their security via 
the cloud vendors that are ahead the curve terms

garner greater amount share the security spend than 
traditional premise vendors

significantly outpace premise spending 
cloud total

however also see some the security spending shifting 
the cloud providers themselves such amazon web 
services and microsoft azure when companies shift their 
infrastructure the cloud the responsibility provide cyber 
security for that infrastructure largely lies the hands the 
cloud service provider the enterprise one could argue 
that security within the cloud providers more robust than 
typical enterprise architectures cloud providers typically 
encrypt the data residing rest and transit there way 
point single physical server where data stored due 
the nature public cloud architecture and cloud providers 
have much greater scale terms security expertise 
however this does not mean the traditional premise 
security architecture will away most cases the spending 
for cloud infrastructure will additive existing security 
spending with some exceptions 
however that not the case for all security for 
infrastructure deployments such aws have seen cloud 
providers offer enterprises the option equip compute 
power with additional security features which are largely 
delivered party security software providers while 
amazon web services has largely relied party security 
partners has also recently come market with several 
security offerings including its own web application firewall 
such see cloud infrastructure providers such aws 
and microsoft azure well cloud app providers such 
salesforce capturing larger portion security 
spending either directly indirectly 
services enterprises grapple with rapidly proliferating 
access points valuable digital assets demand for 
integrated partners with scalable security practices and 
access skilled human capital also increasing 
enterprise network complexity accelerates creating greater 
exposure emerging threats expect services vendors 
will focus the growth security related services and gain

security expands all devices not just enterprise devices 
this scenario represents extreme shift from the current

embedded within all devices connected the internet with 
security spend spread through enterprises device 
manufacturers cloud providers and consumers use 
gartner forecast internet connected devices 
and add all public and private virtual machines 
reflect all application workloads this translates

also assume that security spending shifts towards 
percentage the value the device calculate market

revolution security for the iot world 
this scenario the central component security architecture 
shifts from the network the cloud and the endpoints 
devices themselves insider threats computing taking place 
outside the enterprise perimeter and the rise internet 
connected devices inside and outside enterprise 
network has eroded the concept secure perimeter 
the vast majority computing moves the cloud the 
security technology focuses solely two areas the cloud 
workloads through the cloud provider and the device itself 
which connects the cloud this scenario addresses the 
challenges with the internet things within the enterprise 
more internet connected devices off the network means 
network firewall will irrelevant this scenario all 
enterprise resources are fully authenticated and encrypted 
enforce fine grained access data and applications 
this calculation yields security spending product

cagr while there number assumptions this 
calculation which are conservative our view illustrates 
that security spending may able sustain mid high

moving from worldwide gdp worldwide 
gdp this still well below overall defense budgets

the gdp for the united states for the and 
for china according the world bank 
while this represents lower likelihood upper range this does 
illustrate how large the market could become iot security 
becomes more mature 
how will spending evolve 
our view this pushes security spend two directions 
down the device itself and the cloud service 
provider this scenario perimeter based technologies 
become less relevant addition security moves more 
notably beyond the traditional budget into the cost business 
for service providers and device manufacturers outline 
several key trends within the evolution scenario which are 
more extreme form this revolution scenario 
morgan stanley research

cybersecurity rethinking security 
security offerings gets pushed the cloud 
provider this case the perimeter dead most 
the computing happens via the cloud therefore the cloud 
provider the best position offer the security 
functionality this will come the form either direct 
offerings security service security functionality 
embedded standard functionality included the 
offering both cloud infrastructure providers amazon 
microsoft etc well cloud application providers 
salesforce workday etc will capture significant 
portion the growing security spend 
device manufacturers and service providers embed 
security more broadly enterprises and consumers will 
come expect secure devices with embedded security 
enterprises and consumers may not pay directly for those 
security features but most likely indirectly through the cost 
the good service example secure chip 
described the evolution scenario 
key drivers this scenario 
reduced capex spend security technologies this 
approach would reduce enterprise spending network 
security technologies which comprised total 
spending security technologies according 
idc would narrow the list security vendors for 
enterprise and shift security the cloud provider either 
directly indirectly allowing enterprises lower its 
capex spend addition focus building and 
delivering secure devices and secure services shifts the 
security spend from the budget into cost business 
higher employee productivity this approach may also 
bolster employee productivity the focus access 
versus restriction and allows for work from any location 
regardless off the network 
which have useful life years therefore cios will 
likely want continue sweat the assets keep the 
technology until depreciation expense fully rolls off cios 
will likely continue pay the maintenance existing 
firewall appliances over their useful lives would also 
emphasize the powerful effect inertia given network 
security technologies are deeply ingrained enterprises 
security architectures 
willingness shift risk cloud providers this 
scenario shifts the security technology more heavily 
cloud service providers limited control and visibility into 
the cloud architecture could limit adoption given the 
mission critical nature security 
regulatory requirements some industries are subjected 
regulatory requirements for security some specifying 
the use perimeter based technology for example 
retailers that accept credit cards must adhere the 
payment card industry security standards and firewalls 
deployments can used adhere this standard 
regulatory requirements are generally inflexible and slow 
change which drives the use traditional technology 
for longer than the landscape would otherwise require 
difficult implement and maintain consistent security 
policy difficult deploy across cloud environments 
growing volume and variety securing perimeter less 
environment will likely require more man hours than the 
traditional perimeter model 
exhibit 
revolution security moves down the device and 
the platform providers 
greater security effectiveness focusing the 
hardening the device itself and protecting the data 
matter where resides may more secure than 
hardening increasingly blurry perimeter every device 
trusted one device that hacked will not put other 
devices risk the same time malicious actors will 
have attack multiple devices and multiple cloud

including long list technologies including firewalls

enterprises have little control over however growing cloud 
infrastructure has number benefits security well 
particularly related security deployed service the 
cloud versus the traditional premises security deployment 
method while there may some technologies and 
corresponding vendors that will face challenges this 
environment think the move the cloud largely neutral 
positive for most security software and services vendors 
what does change the status quo 
lower capex and personnel costs cloud based 
security can significantly reduce the need purchase 
maintain and enhance technology infrastructure and hire 
support personnel this should allow the company focus 
core security issues lower cost 
staying current with latest technology buyer

operations centers asocs cloud based asoc that 
shares information among member organizations enables 
businesses leverage from the collective intelligence 
helping detect and remediate threats more quickly than 
standalone premise asoc 
secure communication channels enterprises will 
able leverage the cloud provider infrastructure 
deploy secure communication and collaboration channels 
this creates safe repository for sensitive information 
which will require separate access clearance limiting the 
ability for attackers move laterally across the

see two main avenues disruption within the cyber 
security industry from the cloud 
cloud delivered cyber security 
conclusion more computing moves the cloud and 
enterprises look reduce their data center footprint 
expect see greater adoption security service this 
represents different deployment model than traditional 
security functionality often appliance premise software 
driven some cloud based vendors like proofpoint are well 
levered this trend while legacy security vendors are building 
security service functionality which should add greater 
recurring revenue the model and potentially boast gross 
margins 
what does mean security service secaas the 
consumption external security service where the 
service provider owns the technology and delivers the security 
capability over the web with software service 
saas the underlying hardware and software components 
are abstracted from the customer security service not 
only applicable cloud based infrastructure although broad 
cloud adoption often driver but also premises 
infrastructure 
see increased adoption security delivered via the cloud

web believe will see increased adoption cloud 
security for technology that needs integrate both cloud 
and premise use cases example here identity 
management technology which enterprises use manage 
identities across all applications premise and cloud 
technology that already extends outside the network 
example the protection external facing websites web 
application firewall and email security and technology 
which bolstered greater scale example threat 
intelligence which can benefit from sharing information 
across wide customer base 
cloud delivered cyber security spending expected 
significantly outpace premise spending 
the key barrier significant adoption cloud based network 
security the latency lag created when specific web traffic 
all traffic all network security cloud delivered routed 
through the infrastructure the cloud security provider 
adequate global infrastructure can mitigate this issue 
however the concern then turns whether the vpns virtual 
private networks connecting cloud cybersecurity provider 
the enterprise are secure 
how could this impact the current spending 
environment 
greater cost efficiency benefits from greater scale and 
greater ease management will likely drive increased 
adoption cloud delivered cyber security industry estimates 
broadly support this view currently the vast majority 
cybersecurity software sales are for premise systems 
gartner estimates that spending for cloud 
cyber security will grow cagr between 
with overall cyber security spending only expected 
increase annually over the same period this implies 
cloud total 
endpoint security and network security less likely fully 
move the cloud cloud based endpoint security solution 
would require the device mobile server connected 
the web for protection however this raises issues when 
the device offline malicious software downloaded 
attack trigger can occur once internet connection 
detected which point the endpoint becomes vulnerable

however also believe that the larger security platforms 
will well levered this trend with most security vendors 
like palo alto networks and fireeye now offering portfolio

cyber security for the cloud 
conclusion expect see new security requirements 
arising from the increased adoption cloud based 
infrastructure and applications many cases security for the

what does change the status quo 
cloud computing aligned with cyber security best 
practices one the core issues with advanced 
persistent threats apt when attacker able gain 
access some part corporation network 
infrastructure and then freely move laterally across the 
remaining network having specific apps data cloud 
environment naturally solves this issue these cloud 
environments are isolated across the wide area network 
wan and therefore are secured with their own firewalls 
ips and monitoring some the historical inhibitors 
cloud adoption included security and data privacy 
concerns however with the recent explosion cyberattacks the majority cases show that the cloud 
environments were the one part the infrastructure 
that was not breached our recent conversations with 
cios now suggest security driver cloud adoption 
with the vendor that platform vendors like amazon have 
significantly greater resources and scale secure its 
infrastructure versus smaller enterprise 
better data protection both rest and transit due 
the nature public cloud architecture virtualization 
shared servers etc difficult point single 
physical server where the data stored which can 
breached additionally cloud providers typically encrypt 
the data that server breached the attacker will 
only have access subset the overall information 
economies scale for security expertise cyber 
security clearly significant business model risk for 
cloud providers such these companies have large 
budgets hire top security talent from agencies such 
the nsa cia fbi there significant talent gab

there difference security needs between cloud 
apps and cloud infrastructure broadly believe cloud 
application deployments software service require

directly the enterprise one the more common additional 
technology deployed today alongside cloud applications 
cloud access security brokerage technology casb which 
provides visibility into the use cloud based applications and 
enforces consistent policies across all cloud and premises 
apps recent activity this space highlights its 
increasingly strategic importance with microsoft buying casb 
vendor adallom imperva buying skyfence bluecoat buying 
elastica and palo alto networks buying cirrosecure 
addition employees accessing more web based applications 
should drive the need for greater web protection through 
secure web gateways often procured based the amount 
web traffic and encryption technology 
for infrastructure deployments such amazon web 
services have seen cloud providers offer enterprises the 
option equip its deployments with additional security 
features however this largely delivered party 
security software providers while amazon web services has 
largely relied party security partners has also recently 
how could this impact the current spending 
environment 
when applications and infrastructure shift cloud 
environment some but not all the security responsibility 
shifts the cloud provider itself cost business this 
has positive neutral and some cases negative 
implications for the current security spending paradigm 
morgan stanley research

cybersecurity rethinking security 
positive implications the move cloud workloads will 
morgan stanley blue paper 
likely drive spending new security functionality specifically 
focused securing the cloud one example cloud security 
access brokerage functionality with vendors such 
microsoft palo alto networks and imperva investing this 
area addition security for iaas deployments are largely 
going additive for security vendors offering virtualized 
version their solutions the iaas platforms which many 
security vendors today including barracuda check point 
cisco etc iaas vendors currently offer the bare bones 
security therefore enterprises will likely want add from 
vendors with specific security domain expertise 
neutral implications some security solutions offered the 
cloud providers themselves may adequate for the 
workloads deployed that specific cloud however most 
enterprises today and for the foreseeable future will operate 
hybrid environment with application workloads 
premise and across multiple clouds this means that 
enterprises won rip out their existing infrastructure 
moves the cloud but rather will layer technologies 
secure the new cloud workloads addition larger areas 
security spending network and endpoint security will 
continue relevant with broad cloud adoption even with 
cloud computing enterprises likely will still have network 
which will need secured with firewalls and will still have 
devices that connect the web which will need 
secured with endpoint security 
who most risk our view the move the cloud 
represents outsourcing enterprises data centers third 
party providers our view the security technology most 
likely provided the cloud providers themselves 
centers around security specifically targeting the data center 
one example database security which looks for unusual 
activity within enterprises databases databases move more 
heavily the cloud this functionality can rolled the 
cloud provider another example web applications 
enterprises host all their web apps via cloud provider 
may make sense for the enterprise procure its web 
application firewall from the cloud provider itself other areas 
related analytics such security incident and event 
management could move cloud providers however this 
likely more long term risk 
while not believe that traditional premise security 
spending going away see incremental security 
dollars going towards security service offerings and 
some incremental security for cloud applications with 
premise security becoming less strategic over time could 
see some commodization pricing pressure some the 
more mature technologies web security stateful inspection 
firewalls which will likely help fund enterprises increased 
investment cloud security this should help drive relatively 
stable security budgets despite the growing vectors that need

with internal firewalls being one them 
although security vendors have not disclosed the percentage 
revenues from internal segmentation deployments palo 
alto networks was one the first vendors announce 
virtual firewall conjunction with vmware nsx solution and 
the company sees the virtualized firewall significant 
driver for growth fortinet has also invested virtual firewalls 
and has cited internal segmentation their largest

security software has remained top priority our cio

top vendors ahead growth overall spending however 
periods disruption typify the security software market with 
new technologies coming market that threaten incumbent 
positions this drives consensus view that security 
platforms are unsustainable due the dynamic nature 
the threat environment and corresponding technologies 
address however think the security software industry 
reaching tipping point maturity where will see faster 
pace consolidation than we seen the past look for 
the beneficiaries the evolving security software market 
include the following areas 
big will get bigger our view consolidation visibility 
and automation requires scale the ability process 
data analytics the underlying driver the 
components working together and product breadth 
this suggests the large vendors who can deliver both 
ability process data and deliver multiple security 
functionalities across multiple infrastructures should 
garner incremental spend over time best breed

security platforms will integrate security analytics but 
market for stand alone solutions will likely remain 
with visibility and automation increasingly important 
features security see security analytics playing 
more strategic role vendors will offer this functionality 
feature broader platform our view however 
still see market for stand alone analytics solution 
given the need collect and correlate disparate security 
and non security events splunk and are two 
beneficiaries this trend 
incremental spend will come through new cloud 
security offerings and cloud service providers 
themselves believe that enterprises will focus 
consolidating traditional security technologies and shifting 
incremental spend towards security software for new 
vectors particularly the cloud see two sets winners 
this area those well positioned provide cloud based

optimizing the cost efficacy equation 
with security software 
security tax that enterprises will seek 
optimize with current security spending driving sub optimal 
security postures believe unlikely that enterprises will 
continue allocate higher portion their budget 
current paradigm that ineffective and does not drive the 
business forward such believe enterprises will shift 
focus from spending more security spending more 
effective security discussed see several areas 
focus for security spend which has broad software 
implications 
consolidation consolidation security software 
functionality allows for greater info sharing across 
disparate technologies and lower total cost ownership 
for enterprises improvements hardware and networking 
speeds has allowed for the greater consolidation 
security software functionality without network 
performance degradation 
automation security software will increasingly build 
automation capabilities reduce the level human 
moving towards fewer the security solution sprawl 
likely abate enterprises are looking bolster the cost 
performance ratio security spend our view existing 
vendors are the best position consolidate security 
spending given their broader portfolios entrenched positions 
the enterprise and generally strong balance sheets that 
enable and continued investments 
while most our industry conversations highlight the trend 
security consolidation most also highlight the unlikeliness 
one two security vendors owning controlling most the 
security industry the industry will remain fragmented 
certain degree but will become less fragmented over time 
larger security vendors roll best breed solutions rich 
domain expertise critically important security and some 
security requirements are particularly unique and target 
different buyers this means several sub sectors within 
security will likely continue exist the near future 
addition enterprises generally try mitigate risk from 
significant vendor concentration which means enterprises 
may comfortable moving their security vendor list from 
but likely will uncomfortable moving from

however markets traditionally considered separate are 
increasingly converging functionality which expect 
continue key areas convergence our view include 
threat prevention including identity management 
high level threat prevention solutions are focused 
keeping malicious actors out the enterprise while 
identity management focuses allowing the good guys 
these two technologies are increasingly trying 
achieve the same goals one technology that illustrates 
the increased convergence user behavioral analytics 
which seeks identify unusual behavior corresponding 
malicious activities both identity management and 
network security vendors have invested this technology 
bolsters its respective core capabilities 
integration between the network and endpoint security 
intelligence gathered from the network has tremendous 
value the security solutions protecting the endpoint 
pcs mobile devices servers and vice versa while 
the convergence these markets not new 
expect see acceleration this trend vendors 
seek provide the full security lifecycle these 
markets historically targeted different buyers one 
person bought the network security solution one 
bought the endpoint solution and therefore vendors 
have had limited success selling bundled solution 
however security purchasing decisions are moving 
higher level management with broader purview while 
networking and endpoint professionals are 
increasingly working together provide cohesive 
strategy sophos has pioneered the integration 
between endpoint and network with their security 
heartbeat product palo alto networks offers broad 
security analytics believe there will likely narrow 
list vendors that can operate the switzerland 
technology collecting analyzing and storing data across 
disparate security technologies while security vendors 
focused threat prevention are building security analytics 
into their solutions believe there will need 
neutral third party that can enable integration and visibility 
across the entire infrastructure today there are separate 
markets for security analytics security information and 
event management threat intelligence and user behavioral 
analysis all which centers around data analysis 
see these technologies merging example 
released its user behavioral analysis solution 
userinsight complement its vulnerability 
management suite while splunk released its user 
behavioral analysis solution the fall while 
some fraud prevention technologies will likely remain 
stand alone like device fingerprinting transaction 
monitoring and sector focused banking commerce 
some vertical neutral technologies focused fraud 
protection such user activity monitoring will likely 
rolled our view 
capabilities security focus key growth 
investments correlates revenue growth and those that 
continue invest are generally able sustain growth that 
higher for longer this because the threat and security 
technology landscape continues evolve rapidly therefore 
the larger vendors will need continue dynamically evolve 
their portfolio either through internal development 
the example palo alto networks versus check point 
relevant palo alto grew its expenses from and grew its billings while check point grew its 
expense and grew its billings over the same 
period while the base spend for palo alto was 
materially smaller than check point base palo 
alto base will likely surpass check point base 
while palo alto growing faster 
strong security domain expertise access large volumes 
relevant security data and the confidence security buyers 
likely keeps pure play security vendors the pole position 
accumulate incremental spending our view vendors like 
palo alto networks and fortinet are likely best positioned 
benefit over time while vendors like cisco and symantec may 
able regain lost share they reinvest and focus

this trend applies cloud services that the cloud provider 
themselves are providing some level security cost 
business for the cloud provider example 
enterprise deploying salesforce application 
salesforce provides its own network database

view greater cloud adoption does not cannibalize existing

architecture however believe this trend will 
increasingly shift incremental dollars away from the traditional 
premises focused security providers 
infrastructure service and platform service offerings 
such aws and microsoft azure provide some basic 
security functionality individual firewalls for the instances 
security logging user access control but these providers are 
only responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure that 
supports the cloud while enterprises are responsible for 
securing anything the cloud itself other words these are 
shared security models enterprises will likely continue 
want source from security oriented vendors sync with 
premise security protocols and policies but portion the 
burden shifted the cloud provider example

the below section describes how networking vendors benefit 
from and enable the evolution case 
position network cumulative processing power and 
visibility the network remain incredibly valuable and 
should help networking vendors regain share 
mentioned our security piece last year while the share 
networking vendors has taken hit couple factors still 
work towards their favor first networking vendors have 
access the traffic flows versus having installed line 
with traffic having set receive cut the data 
second leveraging the cumulative processing power the 
switches and routers addition the firewall enables 
networking equipment naturally have more processing 
power than distinct security vendors apply analytics third 
the more present the vendor within the network the better 
the data collection and potential make security more holistic 
and predictive 
already have access the traffic flows networking 
equipment already line with traffic having route that 
traffic switches routers intelligently distribute 
adc this position makes easier add 
additional security functionality because often enterprises 
not need install additional appliances competitors 
that have newly added and have traffic ported 
them often creating more complexity great example

sdn gives the visibility for more intelligent security

reach within network creates intelligence edge 
another advantage networking vendors have the battle 
for security spend that they often times see more the

wlan access points network access control having full 
visibility all the different entry points and traffic across 
the network the more this data security provider has

semis companies have significant role play improving automating 
and standardizing security architecture our view the major semis 
architecture players intel arm have had embedded chip security 
place for over decade the largest most complex and most diffuse 
networks globally payment cards mobile sims make use chip cardbased security standard which has protected these networks 
efficiently low cost and with minimal intervention 
think growth internet things applications and the massive 
increase remote network access and sensitivity associated data will 
lead this technology applied many more verticals also 
believe that arm well positioned providing deeply embedded 
security architecture prerequisite for the development the internet 
things while there lots discussion and money spent 
software security wonder whether more spending hardware 
would have greater benefit has been the case credit card 
transactions 
internet things devices for the purposes this report 
identity access management and corporate and 
consumer endpoint are likely the most relevant areas 
today there secure standardized architecture for remote 
access endpoint security whether for enterprise 
consumer which tends mean more fragmented 
architecture greater degree manual intervention and 
ultimately more vulnerable network given the rise remote 
access byod proliferation iot devices this will only get 
worse early days suggest that any the companies 
involved this area has the perfect mousetrap that 
universal security architecture will easy implement 
the nature the market this would require multiple hardware 
oems adopt common approach technology that could 
impact usability historically not winning strategy 
hardware however think some the technologies being 
developed semis companies around access management 
and endpoint security have much wider applicability than has 
been the case date

what role semis companies play the new 
security architecture 
think semis companies have significant role play 
the security space technologies developed several 
companies under our coverage play into the themes 
explore this report particular believe that hardwarebased security can become more important the surface 
area for potential attacks network increases more 
connected devices greater number remote users more 
particular highlight arm nxp gemalto and infineon 
likely benefit from the trends highlight this report 
and outline the areas which these companies are 
involved more detail below 
what does chip based security look like 
there are two potential areas where semis players can 
benefit from rising importance chipset security one 
building richer security features into the core cpu the other 
providing additional hardware with dedicated 
cryptographic features enhance system security view 
the most significant revenue opportunity the latter 
category though also highlight the increasing importance 
security core cpu architecture 
exhibit outlines the main ways which separate secure 
chip for authentication and access management can 
incorporate into device the sim card gemalto 
embedded into nfc antenna nxp separate 
embedded chip the device chassis which option chosen 
depends the application the chip and believe many 
device manufacturers are still grappling with the issue 
selecting the most appropriate model 
the example below for mobile phone but equally 
applicable other devices particularly iot 
applications connected cars and the like also view 
the service opportunity associated with this additional 
hardware significant outline below

what the revenue potential for semis companies 
think the opportunity for the companies twofold firstly 
there volume opportunity more devices incorporate 
secure chips other security features that require additional 
hardware content secondly there opportunity for these 
companies extend their offering into related areas this can 
involve developing rich operating system incorporating 
security features intel arm nxp gemalto building 
buying their way into new areas gemalto nxp 
the following are the main areas where companies under our 
coverage have specific opportunities leverage their 
presence embedded security 
embedding security the cpu architecture 
providing extra secure chips for authentication 
services around and access management 
related and access management hardware and services 
practice this unlikely major revenue opportunity 
for either player these features tend embedded into 
chipsets standard best view increasing security 
features likely mitigate against normal price deflation 
the second component for semis players building 
separate silicon into systems that are completely separate 
from the core cpu and dedicated secure authentication 
and access management this core business today for 
nxp and gemalto and also the main application for 
infineon chip card business the technology already 
used several areas where access management core 
competence bank cards sim cards and pay 
subscriptions are the most obvious examples

what additional semis content needed for 
security

already been incorporating additional trust features into their 
designs for many years intel introduced its trusted execution

number areas than the case today and could become 
standard range iot applications the range services 
requiring mobile access increasing and with the amount 
sensitive data transmitted through mobile devices 
healthcare telematics home security and ecommerce are 
all areas where the inclusion secure elements distributed 
devices would improve security around information being

what are the alternatives secure elements 
not all applications will require separate chip provide 
secure authentication and access services arm 
trustzone can also operate with hardware security module 
located within the soc virtualized layer the cpu 
these bring advantages terms power consumption and 
processing speed external security module can impact 
processor performance according arm most 
the applications using chip based security rely 
external power source and software pos terminal set top 
box atm however integration into the soc sacrifices the 
hardware based security characteristics secure element 
host card emulation and trusted execution environment 
are alternatives chip based security for secure 
services delivered mobile trusted execution 
environment tee another term for the hardware security 
module within the soc some handset manufacturers have 
termed this secure enclave the main chipset the tee

security point view while view this potential threat 
secure elements and chip based security believe that 
both technologies will exist suspect that ultimately the 
main constraints for incorporating one rather than another will 
constraints around power availability and integration with 
other aspects the host operating system 
important cost effective part access management 
timing clearly heavily dependent execution individual 
companies the short term general find the response 
many corporate departments will inertia 
believe adopting this model could take time 
exhibit 
are there other revenue opportunities for hardware 
players 
any system authentication needs two components 
simplistically key and lock the case most 
technologies securing access the digital world this takes 
the form two keys one the client side one the 
server side that must match order prove that system 
operating secure mode has not been compromised 
the provider authentication services the server side can 
the same that providing the secure module the client 
side particularly instances where there are regulatory 
aspects how authentication takes place gemalto for 
instance provides access management services 
outsourced basis majority telcos worldwide where 
also supplier sim cards sim cards and payment 
smartcards are the best example this our view though 
there are also examples egovernment and enterprise rsa 
securid technology used many enterprises secure 
access using unique one time passwords 
there are additional opportunities the server side 
order keep cryptographic keys secure the server side 
infrastructure providers like aws rackspace would 
typically specify hardware security modules hsms store 
cryptographic keys and sensitive data safenet acquired 
gemalto major provider hsm along with 
french security company thales safenet supplies the hsms 
behind the cloudhsm product marketing aws among

transaction data references are therefore strong whether 
this technology succeeds penetrating the enterprise market 
significantly will depend usability economics and ease

arm 
arm provides deeply embedded security for wide range 
applications its chip architecture and believe 
will allow the development the internet things 
more secure way 
trustzone part all cortex class processors and most 
and thus used nearly every smartphone and 
tablet also increasingly used microcontrollers for 
free actually for customers paying the range per 
processor not free but not optional and not 
separately priced arm does not get any direct revenues 
from trustzone although this part the wider arm 
product offering 
what trustzone according arm trustzone 
system wide approach security that can used protect 
services and devices from scalable attacks from cyber 
attacks security embedded within the chip either high end 
chips for smartphones tablets etc cortex lower end 
microcontrollers chips for the internet things cortex 
arm has included trustzone its chips architectures for the 
last decade 
arm could position gain more share secure 
microprocessors historically smartcards have had lower 
processing requirements than higher end processors and 
there have tended more proprietary architectures bit smartcard processors result arm had 
share smartcard processors about units

securecore processor this basis view the

trusted computing group iso iec spec for tpm 
intel amd and others 
how have hacking approaches and security 
features evolved 
version arm cortex class processors called 
securecore which goes into lot smartcard credit 
cards passports etc the main difference between 
cortex and that the code the secure version 
has been obfuscated prevent some the most advanced 
types attack the old way attacking secure chip was 
decap the chip and then look the circuitry hack into 
this was particularly used criminals who wanted 
circumvent sky system and sell sky boxes without 
the sky subscription chip companies then put light 
detectors that would blow key circuitry they detected that the 
lid had been removed from the chip circumvent this 
hackers used very sensitive equipment trace the circuitry 
through the top the chip running the chip and detecting 
how the magnetic and power characteristics the chip 
changed they could figure out how the chip worked and 
therefore how hack the obfuscated version the 
processor hides all its details has fake circuitry that 
randomly powers and draws random amount power 
that one cannot guess what working and what not 
through the sansa acquisition arm can provide secure onchip sansa has block called cryptocell that 
highly configurable component providing anchor trust

gemalto 
gemalto provides critical software and services its 
customers for key management and network access 
leading supplier smart cards and associated services 
mobile network operators banks governments and the 
enterprise sector the company buys secure microcontrollers 
from chip companies nxp infineon stmicro samsung 
and installs its java based secure operating system onto 
these chips this turn allows gemalto offer end end 
key management services for its customers for which 
gemalto also frequently manages the servers that host 
access management functions 
gemalto leading provider for this critical function 
access management think the importance this 
function service providers often underestimated for 
mobile network managing access for millions subscribers 
allowing users connect the network secure fashion 
from any location any time and being able bill the 
correct subscribers for those services critical function 
requiring trusted partner think this the reason why 
networks with the largest numbers mobile users and with 
the tightest security requirements that have seen most use 
smartcards and the enhanced and standardized security 
they provide 
this clearly plays into several the themes explore this 
report secure elements are highly secure and cost effective 
means managing network access such believe they 
are among the best ways control access network 
where the surface area expanding exponentially where the 
number services also increasing which needs minimal 
intervention from support staff and can integrated into 
any device with cpu think this comes down one 
issue question when was the last time you had call 
support ensure your mobile network access credit card 
passport worked should 
think embedded security creates increased role for 
service focused players like gemalto the replaceability 
disposability services like sim cards bank cards means 
that while security paramount access service 
management relatively simple for future applications 
embedded sims cars mobile phones healthcare 
equipment provisioning profiles and service access will 
need frequently updated and will become more 
complex secure elements will also need host several 
service profiles and sets keys simultaneously think this 
market has potential for players like gemalto 
gemalto has sought integrate vertically into other 
areas particularly enterprise the acquisition safenet 
moved gemalto into the enterprise space 
adding business the provision hardware security 
modules the move seeks address one the key issues

public cloud vendors are likely benefit internal security 
improves while the market for security vendors should remain 
largely unaffected neither amazon nor google alphabet aspire 
security companies although these cloud providers continue enhance 
their internal security offerings attract more customers enhancing 
their security cloud providers are attempting remove major point 
friction the enterprise sales process historically concerns around data 
security have been among the largest obstacles moving workloads 
the cloud such getting potential enterprise customers comfortable 
with the security offered cloud vendors top priority interestingly 
for many companies and most smbs the public cloud may provide 
higher level security than they could otherwise afford through third 
party vendor 
our revolution scenario could see the public cloud providers 
take larger role developing security applications capturing 
share the security market themselves this scenario cloud 
providers like aws could add portion the security 
spending our revolution scenario their tam looking further out 
time years possible that security moves more the edges 
the cloud and the endpoint the burden security increasingly shifts 
the cloud providers see security becoming cost doing 
business for these cloud platforms such will likely embedded 
into pricing with the potential upsell additional features and 
protections 
best positioned 
our view amazon via aws best positioned benefit from the 
evolving enterprise security landscape going forward see aws 
contributing total amzn cosi over the next two years nongaap operating income over the next years while the google cloud 
platform still very small our estimate see 
google increasingly focused growing this business historically 
google market strategy has been somewhat fragmented going 
forward expect that change which could drive upside given that 
google already has much the infrastructure required run larger 
cloud business 
evolution security bolster cloud demand our 
view despite the very robust internal security architecture 
aws security services offered directly customers still 
limited today amazon offers services around identity 
management encryption key management and web 
application firewalls for web apps hosted aws which 
relatively small subsector the broader security market 
going forward likely that aws will continue

amazon web services approaches security uniformly 
across the globe this necessitates that amazon builds 
the highest requirements their most demanding customers 
physical security 
aws has numerous policies place protect the physical 
security their data centers first access the data center 
limited authorized staff that must pass two factor 
authentication process least two times before gaining 
access the data center floor each data center equipped 
with uninterruptible power supply the event 
electrical failure and generators provide back power for 
the entire facility the event data center failure there 
sufficient capacity enable traffic load balanced the 
remaining sites furthermore when storage drive has 
reached the end its useful life aws erases and physically 
destroys the device order prevent customer data from 
being exposed unauthorized individuals 
network security 
aws has built world class network infrastructure that 
carefully monitored and managed amazon has strategically 
limited the number access points the cloud order 
closely monitor inbound and outbound communications 
well network traffic protect data while 
transmission customers can connect aws via secure 
sockets layer ssl many customers also choose add 
additional layer security using the amazon virtual 
private cloud vpc which provides private subnet within 
the aws cloud customers can then use virtual private 
network vpn order create encrypted tunnel 
between the vpc and the customer data center 
source amazon web services 
identity and data security 
aws provides variety tools and features order 
ensure that only authorized users can gain access 
account these features include passwords multi factor 
authentication access keys key pairs and security 
certificates furthermore aws provides access 
centralized mechanism called aws identity access 
management iam which allows customers define which 
aws services that users that account have access and 
what they can with using aws cloud trails 
customers create log files all requests for aws resources 
within the account this enables security teams detect 
intrusions near real time fashion well investigate 
incident after has occurred 
people process 
aws has minimum standards for employees that have access 
the platform and infrastructure all employees must 
undergo criminal background check and pre screening 
commensurate with the employee position and level 
access furthermore all employees authorized have 
access the data center floor must undergo two factor 
authentication process before being allowed enter all 
passwords must complex and must changed every

payments ecosystem security concerns are among the top reason for 
slow adoption new payments technology 
payment networks use predictive analytics for real time 
time fraud detection minimize transaction level risk 
fraud payment networks predictive analytics driven methods 
have been effective protecting against fraud while still 
keeping transactions costs relatively stable over time both 
visa and mastercard utilize transaction based risk scoring 
and rule based technology platforms that offer real time

security interchange fees are transaction based revenues 
that accrue card issuers when cardholders use their credit 
and debit cards make transaction while there are several 
factors based which the payments networks decide the 
level interchange compensation for potential fraud losses 
one looked credit card interchange fee data the 
global data not readily available and indicates that 
while interchange fees have gone over time mostly due 
introduction premium cards that carry higher rewards for 
consumers they have remained relatively stable since the

network connectivity and third party data centers 
security presents growth opportunity for enterprise providers 
network connectivity providers have the most exposure such 
companies like level verizon and zayo these companies are 
able upsell enterprises with security offerings that architects and 
monitors network traffic rackspace service focused offerings include 
increased security monitoring for incremental recurring charge 
third party data center providers can hold security edge against inhouse data centers for colocation data center providers like 
cyrusone equinix and qts security one the main criteria when 
enterprise cios choose provider for both main and disaster recovery 
workloads 
increased data usage increases bandwidth requirements 
and network complexity the fiber based telecom providers 
have been benefiting from the secular tailwind bandwidth 
usage stemming from the rise mobile video and cloud 
result these enterprise networks are holding more 
mission critical operations increasingly complex network 
architectures increasing security concerns 
fiber providers benefit from private connectivity 
requirements enterprises need secured connectivity 
move data back and forth between their headquarters 
regional offices and outsourced data centers instead 
utilizing the public internet they can purchase private access 
via companies like level verizon and zayo this 
can the form lit services pre architected routes the 
fiber providers for enterprises with larger scale and specific 
needs dark fiber where the customers themselves customize 
the network 
telecom providers can also charge for incremental 
security monitoring services both the incumbent 
telecom service providers and verizon offer security 
products offerings are grouped under its network

data centers allow enterprises outsource security 
there has been clear trend enterprises choosing 
outsource their workloads from house third party data 
centers like cyrusone equinix and qts currently around 
all workloads are still house though estimates see 
this moving closer over the next few years the 
argument for outsourcing ties the comparative advantage 
while enterprise can keep everything house they are 
likely run these data centers less effectively than the thirdparty experts this includes security third party data 
centers are built protect the facilities from physical and 
environmental attacks including services such 
monitoring restricted access reinforced walls and floors 
cages and backup generators 
increases security concerns may prompt more 
outsourcing given the quicker speed technology cycles 
today house data center may not keep with the 
security advancements the same pace third party 
facility the increasing coverage security breaches the 
news prompts enterprises reevaluate and upgrade their 
current data center setup this may not only benefit the thirdparty data center providers but also the network providers 
that have the fiber connecting these third party locations 
broader office locations 
security often the top criteria for cios when choosing 
data center provider this the case particularly when 
the workloads outsourced are more mission critical than 
archival relative security costs secondary 
consideration for cios while the data centers may not 
directly charge more for extra security services this 
reflected via higher prices for data center facilities more 
strategic locations with newer technology disaster

this ongoing trend

expanding problem corporate breaches across all 
sectors outline how boards play fundamental role 
setting the strategy company and need keep pace with 
market development such the board directors has the 
potential support the market evolution they challenge the 
current structures potentially opening security spending 
outside traditional 
cyber security risk sits within the oversight role the 
board the model for most companies around the world 
that corporation managed the board directors who 
provide guidance and oversight the oversight role has 
traditionally extended risk factors such credit risk 
liquidity risk and general operational risk and has more 
recently expanded greater inclusion processes and 
cyber security sec 
however board members have not traditionally had 
knowledge processes and cyber security the 
majority directors not have background 
according analysis diamond management 
technology consultants less than fortune 
directors have been are chief information officers pwc 
furthermore the landscape changing very 
quickly and many directors have spent the majority their 
careers pre digital world 
this has led many directors lack experience when 
overseeing the system boards that lack adequate 
understanding cyber risks are unlikely able oversee 
cyber risk management which could encourage inclination 
stay with the status quo 
indeed there are still some boards which are not 
spending enough time devoting sufficient corporate 
resources addressing cyber security issues analysis 
nyse governance services which surveyed 
directors public companies suggested that said cyber 
security was discussed every meeting most 
meetings but one five indicated that cyber security was only 
discussed after internal incident one the same

however the cybersecurity landscape develops 
companies and their directors are likely face stricter

training cyber security risks for their company this 
may include basic coding and understanding the dark

indeed see the most advanced boards are those that are 
challenging companies move away from the traditional 
cyber security strategy defense depth layering 
preventative orientated technologies centered around onpremise more efficient strategy that secures greater
