security analytics 
enterprises become more distributed and 
traditional security solutions less effective 
security analytics emerges key technology 
solve for the signal noise challenges and improve 
security effectiveness stand alone markets and 
broader suites see splk key beneficiary 
revisit our cybersecurity blue paper rethinking security 
focusing the increasingly paramount area security analytics term 
encompassing analytics embedded into broad security platforms well 
stand alone analytics solution aimed reducing the detection time malicious 
activity several forces are driving the need for increased visibility via analytics 
into the security platform including inefficiency and noisiness security 
prevention solutions greater volume and variety security data and the 
emergence big data technologies better collect store and process this data 
see splunk key beneficiary this trend with its flexible platform that 
offers rich security and operational insights other key conclusions 
what enabling the market for security analytics see three converging 
factors which drive the growing market for security analytics data relevant 
security growing volume velocity and variety computing environments 
grow more complex and distributed data store and analytics technology has 
developed alongside data growth bringing together internal data analysis 
analyzing data points generated from internal technology and processes and 
external data analyzing data from relevant external data sources apply 
internally and traditional preventative oriented technology remain well 
below effective necessitated tools shorten the time detection when 
prevention fails 
how large will the market for security analytics grow see large security 
vendors increasingly offering security analytics feature broader suites 
aiming towards the single pane information for the enterprise assess their 
overall security profile example includes palo alto autofocus solution 
which automates the process detecting unique incidents within the network 
there will also narrow list vendors that can operate the switzerland 
technology collecting analyzing and storing data across disparate security and 
non security events data our view today there are separate markets for

what the best way play this trend 
splunk security key driver growth for splunk revenue 
its technology enabling security analytics and enterprise visibility 
positions splunk the switzerland disparate security data 
expanding delivery models splunk cloud large partner ecosystem

differentiation large and growing security analytics market 
ibm ibm security one the largest security businesses the 
industry and positioned capture share customers look 
consolidate vendors and capitalize ibm leadership out 
core security areas 
analytics driven security suite well positions 
capture share investment dollars shift towards solutions enabling 
better visibility and intelligence however still the early days 
selling the broader security analytics platform with most the

key conclusions 
rise security noise rise big data technologies increasing strategic importance 
security analytics 
exhibit security analytics moving from detection predictive analytics enabled big data technology

what does this mean more efficiently finding the needle the haystack 
security analytics contributes two themes within the security landscape analytical 
capabilities will increasingly offered enhanced features functionality into broader 
security suites lower false positives and bolster productivity security analysts and 
security analytics will largely already evolve into separate stand alone market 
with the role central aggregator the switzerland across disparate security 
technologies some key trends 
why now greater variety volume and velocity data relevant for security 
decision making the increased complexity computing environments coupled 
with the greater sophistication bad actors has driven greater volume and 
diversity data relevant for security purposes addition network traffic 
moving and out the network effective security solutions incorporate 
additional data gleaned from machine logs forensics data employee identity 
information physical security information external threat intelligence etc 
but what with leveraging big data tools garner value from the data 
security solutions are now leveraging new data store technologies store and 
process large volume structured unstructured data and new data analytics 
technologies incorporating machine learning and cognitive computing machine 
learning the ability for technology change and improve response new 
data cognitive computing the ability technology automate human thought 
processes these types technologies drive more relevant security insight and 
bolsters the productivity security analysts who are tasked with taking action 
the most pertinent alerts see security analytics tools enabling more effective 
automation incident response example security system automatically 
quarantining device when abnormal behavior detected the integration 
between detection oriented devices and automated prevention incident response 
largely not place today due the risk false positives blocking legitimate 
activities processes however the security systems get smarter and can 
process greater amount data the likelihood false positives moves lower 
which provides granularity behavior down the user level the analysis 
identity information with security data allows for actionable insight down the 
user level important capability detect and block insider threats this allows 
for user and peer group profiling which turn boosts detection rates for the 
stealthiest malicious activities this has given rise the emerging user behavioral 
analysis uba market which believe will integrated with larger security 
incident and event management platforms siem such splunk 
probabilistic security already leveraged payment networks payment networks 
assess risk levels through predictive analytics analyzing wide range factors like 
purchasing behavior location purchases anomaly detection reputation scoring and 
address detection they are able quickly determine the chance that fraudulent 
purchase being attempted part this payment networks have tuned their 
algorithms strike balance between restrictive which would cause lost revenue and 
lax which would drive increased fraud controls while the payment industry still faces 
losses general milliseconds they make risk assessment customer that has 
led losses only total transactions enterprise networks face similar 
balance between stringent security controls and high productivity enterprise 
architectures are arguably more complex than payments with broad range normal 
behaviors across very disparate environment users apps machines etc however 
think the security vendors are tackling these challenges leveraging big data 
technologies base line normal behavior 
where will work security looking for the central aggregator 
security analytics bolster the value the big security suites see large 
security vendors increasingly offering security analytics feature functionality 
additional product offering broader protection oriented suites this supports view 
that protection oriented technologies are not effective therefore enterprises look 
for capabilities that provide additional visibility shorten the time detection the 
benefit security platform best breed solutions integrated together that 
provides single pane information for the enterprise and analytics bolsters the 
actionable insight incorporated this single pane 
some examples include 
palo alto networks palo alto released its autofocus subscription service 
which automates the process detect unique incidents within the network 
reduces the signal noise ratio automating the process finding the truly 
critical threats increasingly important reduce the time detection crowded 
and noisy security landscape this subscription attaches palo alto networks 
next generation firewall solution 
fireeye fireeye has released variety analytics related subscriptions the 
areas threat analytics threat intelligence and forensics its threat analytics 
platform collects network traffic and constructs events for threat detection and 
response expansion into these new product areas are important piece 
fireeye future growth prospects with its core appliances down yoy 
and its product subscription solutions growing and 
exhibit cisco activity cisco cisco covered james faucette 
pushing forward with its efforts 
increasingly focused around

but stand alone security analytics solutions will remain priority even 
consolidating world 
believe there will likely narrow list vendors that can operate the 
switzerland technology collecting analyzing and storing data across disparate 
security technologies while security vendors focused threat prevention are building 
security analytics into their solutions believe there will need neutral third 
party that can enable integration and visibility across the entire infrastructure today 
there are separate markets for security analytics security information and event 
management threat intelligence and user behavioral analysis all which centers 
around data analysis see these technologies merging some ways play
