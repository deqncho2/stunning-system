chief security officer survey shows improving security spend over the next 
three years our survey chief security officers csos highlights 
accelerating security spending growth over the next few years driven growing 
compliance requirements the need for new functionality and security 
requirements around the public cloud our survey shows expected 
growth security spending line with our survey and cagr 
over the next three years ahead overall spending growth according 
our cio survey stable improving commercial demand for security bucks 
concerns related secular headwinds from ineffective security 
technologies architectures and cloud adoption results across security were 
generally solid which think will sustain not improve through 
particularly with the general data protection regulation gdpr just coming 
line see data privacy gdpr security solution stocks 
gdpr coming into play the implementation gdpr may appears 
impacting security intentions with survey respondents noting compliance 
the driver for incremental security spend our survey this also 
comes through the technology priorities well with data governance the 
priority for security spending along with identity and access management and 
security analytics within the top this syncs with the requirements gdpr 
which forces enterprises prioritize the identity and control access 
personal data and better detection and remediation vulnerabilities and 
breaches 
adoption public cloud additive total security spending although 
physical network appliances expected face headwind the majority 
csos identify the move the public cloud additive security spending 
reductive across most the subsectors security including security analytics 
identity management and virtual network security appliances however saw 
downtick the csos who expect negative impact network security 
appliance spend with csos spending less due cloud more 
this compares our prior survey where csos spending more 
network security appliances due the cloud spending less 
which also syncs with more moderate view appliance refreshes 
twenty one percent csos note their organization plans has already 
refreshed the majority their firewalls down from who have 
already refreshed expectations improve into next year with csos

industry takeaways 
highlight six key industry takeaways 
security spend grows line with software spend improves over next years 
chief security officers report average expected growth security 
spending this compares software spending growth and 
overall spending growth according our april cio survey see 
cio survey cio survey growth expectation strengthens record highs 
apr note csos average expect security spending growth improve 
over the next few years with average annual growth over the next 
months 
mixed refresh expectations the near term twenty one percent csos note 
their organization plans has already refreshed the majority their firewalls 
down from who have already refreshed expectations improve 
into next year with csos indicating plans refresh however this 
contrasts with csos who identify refreshing technology for new functionality 
one the top drivers incremental security spend 
compliance becomes more important driver survey data suggests that rising 
compliance requirements are the main driver for incremental security spend 
think this likely reflection gdpr requirements and would more directly 
benefit data governance identity and access management security analytics 
technologies this significant shift from our prior survey where compliance was 
ranked the security priority today 
data governance and identity access management are top security priorities 
data governance and identity and access management were chosen top 
security priorities which likely fits with requirements under gdpr 
csos note data governance top priority for significant increase from 
the who identified top priority identity and access management 
was chosen the third top priority with csos who noted top 
priority compared the survey intrusion detection prevention 
technologies ranked the second priority with security analytics and cloud 
workload security solutions rounding out the top five 
cso data suggest cloud additive security spend but more bearish view 
appliance impacts with the exception network security appliances csos who 
identify the move the public cloud additive security spending outweigh the 
percentage who believe will decrease security spending similar our prior 
survey the subsectors best positioned benefit include security analytics 
csos note that they plan spend more due the cloud spending less 
and identity management csos will spend more due the cloud 
less virtual network security appliances remain beneficiary csos will 
spend more due cloud less the other hand network security 
appliance spend expected decline from cloud adoption with csos 
spending less due cloud more this compares our prior survey where 
csos planned spend more network security appliances due the 
cloud spending less 
mixed view beneficiaries from cloud workload security survey data suggests 
csos will likely use firewall vendor cloud vendor themselves for virtual 
firewalls csos however csos use web application firewalls and 
identity and access management technologies from the iaas paas vendor 
themselves stand alone vendor contrast our prior work suggesting the 
opposite 
valuation views 
symantec price target from our survey shows symantec share loser 
endpoint security and web security gateways over the next three years this raises 
some additional concern the ability symantec see improving enterprise security 
revenue growth from flat yoy high single digits low double digits 
remain below management outlook and look for enterprise revenue 
growth but lower our multiple more cautious view our price target 
now based eps prior this multiple line with slow 
growth legacy vendors orcl symc and line with the average symc multiple 
from period mixed execution and slower eps growth for symantec 
cyberark price target from think cyberark should beneficiary 
from gdpr enterprises look lock down privileged accounts that have access 
systems applications exposed personal data leader the privileged access 
management space pam cyberark has room sustain top line growth the 
next few years its recently announced saas based version its core privileged access 
security platform should also drive opportunity into the lower end enterprise mid 
market over time raise our outer year estimates modestly and now look for 
revenue cagr through prior although traction beyond the high end 
enterprise and more dev ops use cases could drive this higher higher fcf 
estimates prior and higher multiple prior drives 
our price target prior our multiple assumes the average 
growth large cap software large caps chkp ctxs orcl and symc prior 
which was the average all large cap software 
sailpoint price target from sailpoint should benefit from the increased 
importance identity governance well broader identity management and data 
governance arising from gdpr while only csos rank identity governance 
top priority for this ahead for while identity and access management 
top priority which likely encompasses views governance technologies sailpoint 
should also benefit from the increased priority data governance technologies with its 
newer solution securityiq with greater confidence the sustainability growth 
raised our fcf from the average growth large cap software large 
caps chkp ctxs orcl and symc 
varonis price target from vrns one the key beneficiaries gdpr 
regulation given its well positioned data governance and insider threat solutions with 
data governance ranked top priority for modestly raise our top line 
estimates for varonis through and now look for revenue cagr through 
which may prove too low keep our margins stable continue 
cautious around varonis ability scale the business but higher top line drives our 
fcf from with greater confidence the sustainability growth 
raised our fcf from the average growth large cap software 
large caps chkp ctxs orcl and symc 
forescout bull case moves from our survey showed inflection the 
prioritization network access control with csos listing network access 
control top security priority from forescout should the 
key beneficiary from this rising priority likely catalyzed the growing prioritization 
securing iot devices with outsized exposure the government financial services 
verticals and large deals forescout business model inherently lumpy which keeps 
conservative our base case model which looks for revenue growth through 
however raise our bull case estimates modestly with fcf 
our bull case prior also raise our bull case multiple from 
reflect longer runway growth our bull case these changes bring our bull 
case current levels also now see more favorable risk reward for 
forescout with upside our bull case downside our bear case
