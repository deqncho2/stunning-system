key software themes for 
where will cios direct increased spend within security the past two years have seen steady ramp 
the priority security amongst cios our surveys the driver this increasing priority relatively obvious 
steady stream highly public hacks with increasing monetary damage associated with each hack the answer 
the problem increasingly dangerous security environment less obvious seems counter intuitive 
think the answer criminals and nation states evading the firewalls intrusion prevention systems and end 
point security suites implemented over the past years for cios out and buy more firewalls 
intrusion prevention systems and end point security suites 
reality the first reaction from many cios indeed out and make sure all the existing security 
infrastructure date likely driver the robust firewall refresh cycle saw ramping the more 
durable increase security spend likely goes two broad directions our view one consolidating the layers 
technology which made the traditional defense depth security architecture onto single platforms this 
consolidation lowers capex and opex spending associated with the security technology which increases security 
effectiveness more efficiently sharing security information amongst the components our most recent 
chief security officer survey respondents expected the percentage network gateways they bought 
consolidated platform next generation firewall unified threat management increase from 
over the next three years panw remains our top play this consolidation theme within security with 
ftnt also well levered the trend 
the second area increasing incremental security spend will focus minimizing the risk profile within their 
networks organizations now have operate with the working assumption they will breached already 
have security organization likely tighten their focus finding existing threats within their environment faster 
mean time detection remediating attacks more quickly and locking down assets within their network 
perimeters more tightly splk stands benefit from this incremental spend expands distribution and 
product investment the security use case and feye expanding product strategy well addresses this shift 
the security paradigm while vendors with next generation technologies capture market share expect symc

open source what does take have durable scalable open source business model and 
secondarily what the impact the rising breadth and depth open source adoption for existing 
infrastructure software vendors open source software defined any software product where the 
underlying source code visible and freely shared with the end user with limited ownership the code any 
software engineer free use optimize and extend the functionality open source programs open source 
software first came investors attention just over years ago with the ipo red hat rht however the 
failure any other open source software names subsequently reach the scale remain independent long 
enough ipo has made the notion open source business models seem relatively niche with several open 
source software vendors likely test the ipo market investors are likely face the question 
whether open source for real once again consensus likely still considers the impacts open source 
relatively limited today with few niche functionalities particularly infrastructure software seeing some 
competition from open source vendors the edges believe the impacts open source may broader 
pressuring pricing and forcing more rapid and open development traditional proprietary software this trend 
has the potential impact vendors across software whether infrastructure focused orcl msft vmw rht 
analytics focused splk qlik data applications focused crm wday adsk 
will anyone make money infrastructure service iaas investors remain bullish about the topline growth potential infrastructure service and think there good reason optimistic our most 
recent cio survey data suggests growth public cloud workloads applications set increase from 
today end while there has been significant focus the top line implications and potential 
for disruption existing vendors see our aws impacts report amazon web services making waves the 
pond may attention just beginning shift towards what these public cloud services particularly 
iaas will contribute the bottom line and more importantly how appropriately value these businesses 
consensus seems currently treat commodity iaas revenues very similarly the way they look the full stack 
higher value software service revenues saas simply assigning sales multiple the 
subscription base these businesses become more important the overall valuations vendors like 
amazon microsoft oracle and vmware investors likely need sharpen their pencils ascribing value 
our thesis given the much higher capital intensity these iaas businesses lower differentiation and 
intense price competition the ultimate valuation model likely turns out looking more like simon flannery
