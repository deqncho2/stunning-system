many high growth names trade only sales focusing more tightly the hyper growth names

over from their early march peak while these hyper growth names continue trade premium the 
year average today year average average the current 
cohort hyper growth names have twice the forward growth profile the historical average argued 
our april report software feeling for floor high growth software this higher growth profile should 
warrant premium multiple versus the year average believe growth expected relatively durable 
further supporting the case for premium multiples these secular growth names are unlikely ever cheap 
unless the stories break however current levels look provide more reasonable entry point names

reason disruptive software tends outperform over extended 
periods time 
rule thumb growth trumps value software investing found empirical backing for that 
sentiment looking software performance over the past years examined group software 
companies with market cap classified each stock into value growth baskets based price 
forward earnings multiples the month prior the performance evaluation period the value basket consisted 
stocks with multiples between and and the growth basket consisted stocks with multiples 
outside that range looking risk adjusted excess returns rolling month basis growth has outperformed 
the last periods the time with average risk adjusted outperformance each 
period calculated similar advantage for growth stocks looking and month periods well

created high growth disruptive basket consisting the stocks from the software group with the highest estimated revenue cagr the large cap incumbent basket consisted the largest stocks market cap 
rebalanced the baskets annually using metrics from the last day prior the performance period given our
