heavy tech ownership 
according our morgan stanley prime brokerage content group remains one 
the most widely owned sectors hedge funds based gross and net exposure 
while there was slight pullback the end we seen reversal during the 
first few weeks january we still near peak levels when looking software 
specifically hedge fund ownership currently near all time highs relative data since 
after trending upwards from its troughs 
think heavy ownership alone isn cause for concern however heightened 
ownership coupled with changing tides market sentiment and risk appetite could 
cause outsized pain for software given its outsized exposure relative other sectors 
increased focus gaap accounting 
continues question mark investors and companies new 
revenue recognition guidelines have been the mind software investors the new 
rule specifically deals with how contracts are booked revenue looking various 
opinions appears that adopting the new standard could drive change the timing 
revenue recognition but significance still unknown the new rules companies must 
follow steps before recognizing revenue identify the contract with customer 
identify the performance obligations the contract determine the transaction price 
allocate the transaction price recognize revenue when the entity satisfies 
performance obligation the biggest difference may come step the 
company determine there are multiple performance obligations such consulting 
training upgrades support product enhancements etc determined that these are 
distinct services then they will require separate revenue accounting line 
with many moving pieces believe companies are still working through what this 
could mean for their revenue recognition policies and are expecting receive more 
details with earnings however splunk provided some detail around the impact 
adoption its recent analyst day cfo dave conte noted number 
changes term licensing will now recognized upfront revenue versus ratable 
under the previous accounting guidelines deferred license the balance sheet the 
time the adoption will converted into equity and will not recognized revenue 
and the company will required disclosed unbilled backlog providing investor 
visibility into bookings quarter 
software companies are also contending with number regulations impacting nongaap accounting metrics general these new standards are designed limit certain 
non gaap metrics and ensure reported metrics are closer gaap standards 
determining these metrics impact individual stock performance difficult but our 
equity strategy team determined that large gap between gaap and non gaap eps 
not predictive performance market level equity strategy america insight 
the gaap gap does matter apr digging into specifics gddy and eigi 
are now being required remove change deferred revenue from their ebitda 
calculations while elli going start reporting fully taxed non gaap eps starting 
previously the company applied gaap taxes its non gaap pre tax income 
inflating non gaap eps 
stock based compensation matters again 
increased regulatory and investor scrutiny non gaap accounting metrics likely 
bring greater focus companies with higher levels stock based compensation sbc 
these include high growth names our coverage from splk with rev small 
caps recent ipos such zen feye newr which remain unprofitable while the 
greater attention warranted our view believe companies with durable fcf

software plays this theme 
our view 
market view 
yes estimate that cios currently use expect use machine 
learning and technologies this par with public cloud adoption two 
most investors believe the inflection point for and still few years 
away return investment spend less transparent compared 
years ago however cios don yet list top priority suggesting low 
public cloud which was largely cost decision its early days the training 
level total spend see number factors that could drive more 
required for computers understand company and industry specific data 
positive spending trends first significant acquisition spend over the 
sets time consuming additionally the size and transparency the 
last year including microsoft acquisition linkedin ibm acquisitions 
financial impact the large providers limited for these reasons 
the weather company truven health and merge healthcare and 
inventors view longer term trend with minimal impact over the next 
salesforce com spend several smaller machine learning analytics 
year 
tuck acquisitions likely improve the value proposition platforms 
second increased consumer awareness through amazon echo apple 
investment plays are limited there are few any publicly traded pure 
siri and google home likely leak into business adoption much like the 
play machine learning and companies and the market tends gravitate 
consumer smartphone market drove enterprises adopt more mobile 
towards nvida covered joseph moore while believing the impact 
friendly approach lastly while was year investigation into use 
larger technology companies limited 
cases see number large customer engagements moving forward 
for example just announced ibm watson will integrated into vehicles 
ibm early relationship with pfizer broadening additional use 
cases and amazon just introduced amazon grocery store without lines 
checkout counters that relies upon computer vision sensors and machine 
learning technology 
see platforms not applications winning with microsoft amazon 
ibm underappreciated leaders see value accruing cloud delivered 
platforms that allow for both off the shelf and customized solutions today 
microsoft amazon and ibm are the leading enterprise platforms each with 
market share the other hand see functionality standard 
across applications rather than area potential differentiation result 
see less value accruing companies like workday and adobe who are 
focused features within existing solutions 
the use cases for machine learning and artificial intelligence will only 
continue grow from here 
machine learning represent massive trillion tam artificial intelligence and 
machine learning platforms allow companies gain access the data that isn 
accessible today this data such pictures videos sensors and heartbeats the 
ability pull this today onto one cloud platform and connect other data sets 
allows for new insights that remove inefficiency and open new revenue opportunities 
for businesses 
data the holy grail over time expect algorithms become commoditized 
leaving data the value enhancer any cloud platform all three leaders today microsoft amazon ibm either already own large data sets amazon retail media usage 
data stepped data acquisitions the last year microsoft spend linkedin 
ibm spent the weather company plus healthcare data sets 
potential catalysts 
leaders begin break out revenue contribution and growth the 
market 
customer proof concept engagements convert revenue

saas tech growth stack making smbs great again 
heading into think smb focused software provider stocks could continue 
outperform the united states small business growth has been big driver 
economic activity with healthy macro backdrop entering and the incoming 
administration focus building businesses the think smbs can continue 
grow healthy pace the same time public cloud saas became widely 
accepted the most efficient platform for new software development and delivery 
there are many software vendors jumping into the fray 
smb focused software big market and one that has historically been underserved 
example estimate that hubspot marketing product pursuing large 
total addressable market tam just the smb more than coupa tam 
for procurement software levered small and mid sized companies the same 
time software was historically developed with the enterprise buyer mind which 
makes these smb tam dollars almost entirely greenfield the past many small 
organizations could not afford advanced software packages because they were too 
difficult use and simply cost much implement and maintain today saas has 
democratized software the smb drastically reducing typical costs and simplifying 
usage this has allowed even the smallest businesses have powerful call center 
software rolled out through zendesk manage all their appointment bookings through 
mindbody and manage all their finances through quickbooks online because there 
are many businesses the and even more globally and many dollars for 
grabs numerous established software vendors are refocusing the smb space while 
many new vendors popped the last decade just working solving smb problems 
through saas 
below put together small sample business functions smb and which 
public private software vendors are that space see exhibit functionality 
usually split into either horizontal vertical focus where vertically focused 
software vendor can satisfy almost all the needs small business with out thebox functionality the offset that the vendor tam could limited the scope 
the vertical which why many other smb software vendors chose the horizontal route 
although vertical software model usually much more efficient the enterprise 
segment considering that smbs are usually not complex enterprises and not 
require the same functionality depth horizontal solution sold via high velocity low 
touch sales model could very efficient from customer acquisition cost perspective

which stocks could benefit 
our analysis the performance the smb and enterprise focused software 
baskets shows that smb outperformance see exhibit was helped few big 
single stock moves see exhibit heading into think the smb 
outperformance trend can continue and see the following names best positioned 
hubs hubspot started out providing inbound marketing software the smbs and has 
since expanded its offering also include software for sales organizations addition 
paid products free versions are also available which creates great pipeline costeffective upsell opportunities the company has been exclusively focused the smb 
segment which think has been important key their success the same time 
hubspot management has methodically built out broad network global 
partners which see great way control customer acquisition costs well 
churn see hubspot inc channel differentiator nov heading into 
see number product cycles see hubspot inc products lead the way the 
journey inbound nov and hubspot inc the opportunities and risks 
selling sales dec potentially benefitting numbers combined with overall 
conservatism that see our consensus estimates for the year are with 
zen zendesk provider customer service software with very strong core the 
smb world the software was built from the ground sold through high 
velocity low touch model although management drive take the company into 
larger engagements has hit some challenges see zendesk inc solving the zen 
equation after results nov think their core smb business that 
could help the stock work move beyond earnings see zendesk inc buying 
enterprise call option nov and into the rest see zendesk inc 
getting enterprise call option for free puzzle pieces fall into place dec 
despite the possible volatility around results think zendesk well 
positioned capitalize continuing smb growth trend are with 
gddy market with low barriers entry and high barriers scale godaddy has 
the largest scaled platform the world for offering web presence smbs 
approximately half the smbs the lack web presence and this number jumps 
over worldwide with its scale godaddy has the ability offer better breadth 
and quality service competitive prices while driving consistent revenue margin 
expansion and cash flow growth the scale the company platform also enables 
grab share with web presence faster than its peers recently the company announced 
that acquiring host europe group heg for approximately see gddy 
extending its lead dec and leveraged its balance sheet strength beat the 
competition the process not only see this deal accretive margins and 
multiples but the acquisition accelerates gddy market penetration into robust 
european markets while many its smaller peers are struggling scale godaddy 
still the process converting heg financial statements from ifrs into gaap 
numbers and plans close the deal however have upside our price 
target without the deal and estimate that our price target implies approximately 
pro forma fcf after accounting for the acquisition and the planned sale its

part evaluating growth for mixed model companies ltv 
approach 
the shift subscription based revenue models for enterprise software firms has been 
key trend software for well over decade the shift has been most pronounced among 
applications software firms given the early success salesforce and netsuite and the 
software service saas model generally however infrastructure software and 
business intelligence firms have been laggards terms moving subscription based 
models recent years the shift has started take hold with servicenow and new 
relic opting for pure saas based subscription revenue models while traditional 
perpetual license firms such vmware splunk and tableau are now aggressively 
pursuing subscription ratable revenue streams 
the challenge for investors assessing growth prospects between firms whose revenue 
mix primarily consists subscription such workday servicenow and firms who 
operate hybrid model such tableau and splunk which may include perpetual 
license term license maintenance support and subscription revenue 
lifetime value metric for assessing growth 
our approach evaluating growth between firms that have operate different business 
models and who have varying mixes revenue incorporate lifetime value ltv 
approach lifetime value attempts estimate the future revenue contribution from the 
customer base over the expected life that customer base this primarily function 
the company ability consistently achieve high renewal rates company that 
currently generates per year subscription revenue and has annual 
renewal rate the lifetime value equation suggests that the company can expect 
lifetime revenue from their customer base current subscription 
revenue annual renewal rate 
implement the ltv methodology for companies that have hybrid models requires 
certain assumptions how treat the distinct revenue categories from ltv 
perspective our approach make the following assumptions for each revenue 
category 
subscription cloud based revenue ltv revenue calculated taking the 
existing base subscription revenue and dividing annual dollar based 
renewal rate 
term license revenue premise time based license ltv revenue calculated 
taking the annualized base value term revenue and dividing annual 
dollar based renewal rate 
product perpetual license revenue ltv revenue equal perpetual license 
revenue 
maintenance support perpetual license ltv revenue calculated taking the 
existing maintenance base and dividing annual dollar based maintenance 
renewal rate 
professional services other ltv revenue equal the services revenue the 
time 
hypothetical example company with million annual revenue including 
million perpetual license million maintenance million term license 
million subscription and services and that has renewal rates across all its 
recurring revenue streams would have ltv million using the assumptions 
above 
ltv methodology practice 
using the methodology detailed above applied the ltv concept sample our 
coverage universe included two distinct categories this analysis pure saas 
models including servicenow and workday and hybrid model firms including 
atlassian palo alto networks splunk and tableau the mixed model firms vary 
significantly terms the mix perpetual perpetual for tableau for 
atlassian and the mix term license subscription atlassian 
tableau before conducting the analysis made the following assumptions 
relating renewal rates for our sample follows 
firms with subscription term maintenance renewal rates firms not 
consistently disclose dollar based renewal rates but often point approximate 
range firms that have disclosed renewal rates maintenance term subscription 
near the low were defaulted across time for this analysis 
these firms include atlassian palo alto networks splunk and tableau 
firms with subscription term maintenance renewal rates near the case 
workday and servicenow whose renewal rates are consistently reported near 
the ltv equation can problematic implies very large near infinite 
ltv adjust for this replace the renewal rate estimate with estimate 
the replacement cycle years their solutions for both workday and 
servicenow estimate this years 
analysis our ltv estimates for highlights the importance ltv 
assessing growth prospects across business model types for example while workday 
and splunk rank the highest projected revenue cagr from looking cagr ltv places palo alto networks ahead the pack 
followed workday tableau and splunk following fourth 
note that across our sample growth projected ltv substantially outpaces our 
revenue growth forecast for each company 
assess the impact long term profitability and the efficiency which firms are 
acquiring their ltv revenue streams estimate ltv customer acquisition cost cac 
ratios over time calculate this multiply each firm incremental ltv revenue 
during year average gross margin over the period and then divide sales and 
marketing expense that year for example estimate that workday added 
million incremental ltv average gross margin dividing lifetime 
gross profit dollars sales and marketing expense results ltv cac 
while atlassian ranked near the bottom our sample terms ltv growth 
the company placed first terms ltv cac this 
reflects atlassian unique business model which foregoes direct sales force and could 
outlier terms the underlying unit economics for mixed model companies for 
example for both workday and servicenow have estimated 
ltv cac ratios that are well ahead the hybrid models our sample palo alto 
splunk and tableau 
exhibit servicenow ranks highest ltv dollars palo alto ranks highest term ltv cagr 
and workday ranks higher terms revenue cagr

exhibit despite ranking near the bottom our sample for ltv growth atlassian has the 
most attractive ltv cac ratio followed workday and servicenow
