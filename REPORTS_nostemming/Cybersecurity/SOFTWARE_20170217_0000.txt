filtering through the 
marketing noise rsa 
conference 
security top priority reverberated through the rsa 
conference with still complex vendor ecosystem contrasting 
with enterprises looking garner more value out existing 
vendors think this ultimately favors the large vendors 
panw with consolidation the inevitable path 
good enough now good enough attended the rsa security 
conference where noted healthy security demand environment with some 
enthusiasm amongst security vendors that should shape better 
year for growth versus the digestion year while previous rsa 
conferences have generally focused one two new technologies positioned 
the silver bullet for cyber challenges such next gen malware protection 
security analytics next gen firewalls this year sensed higher level best 
breed fatigue the reality that prevention technologies will never wholy 
effective and budgets need split more fully cover prevention detection 
and remediation efforts the mantra moves from more security towards more 
efficient and effective security specifically seems enterprises are looking 
get more functionality out existing vendors security vendors themselves are 
following suit and marketing broader capabilities they build out their 
portfolio solutions address multiple buckets security spending notable 
takeaways from this trend more dollars will accrue the largest security 
vendors driving our positive view panw and symc and consolidation 
within security inevitable with valuations security below historical levels 
iot security approaching inflection point but still early days enterprises 
are increasingly acknowledging the need secure expanding digital surface 
area including cloud mobile and increasingly containers and iot light the 
dyn breach there are number challenges with securing iot devices such 
the heterogeneity hardware software and limited compute capacity handle 
agent based prevention software traditional endpoint security however 
see two broad themes emerging secure growing surface area including 
visibility you can secure what you don know security analytics remains 
key theme but has crossed the chasm from marketing lingo enterprise 
budgeting number vendors are addressing the key requirements 
enabling better visibility into all assets workloads and vulnerabilities 
across variety different technologies which expect will start 
merge these technologies include endpoint management tanium

management tech splunk 
control putting more control through granular security policy with 
enterprises now acknowledging that not all network connected assets can 
protected hear enterprises applying segmentation 
approaches define and control the most sensitive 
assets workloads data applying segmentation techniques allows for more 
granularity but also flexibility around security policies enabling some 
processes prohibiting others high level enterprises are leveraging 
microsegmentation technologies illumio and virtual firewalls 
granularly secure network flows palo alto networks fortinet network 
access control technologies also emerging means control the 
connection assets the network 
are security ops and ops ready come together with human capital being 
key constraint security effectiveness there growing push further 
automate and orchestrate the actions needed identify assess and remediate 
malicious behavior however often times remediation entails actions typically 
under the control ops patching thus there growing recognition 
that operations and security will increasingly blur however still early days 
with security and ops still siloed representing impediment implementing 
full orchestration automation security policies security vendors look push 
out their capabilities into the ops realm while vendors like splunk and more 
recently servicenow are pushing into security from the ops side the fence 
the year the endpoint seeing renaissance endpoint 
security with recognition that traditional anti virus solutions are 
ineffective and the move the cloud based apps shifting control points 
security identities and endpoints this corroborated our january 
cio survey with cios identifying endpoint security top beneficiary 
security spending next gen capabilities address the deficiencies traditional 
through machine learning and heuristic technologies catch the most stealthy 
malware with fairly long list private vendors leading the charge and 
momentum while this leads investors assume the death traditional 
endpoint vendors such symc are less bearish still don hear 
enterprises ripping out traditional most next gen vendors can replace 
and continue hear about consolidation around endpoint protection 
platforms favoring incumbent vendors who can offer multiple functionality 
within one software agent 
stock takeaways 
feye still lots moving pieces attended fireeye investor meeting with 
ceo kevin mandia and new cfo frank verdecanna several takeaways 
simplifying the portfolio fireeye digesting its product sprawl over the past few 
years moving the appliance skus from helix new solution expected 
represents step the right direction integrating its network 
endpoint and threat intelligence solutions one subscription lower 
than stand alone pricing banking new products for acceleration 
management acknowledges good enough competition its core appliance 
market however they expect return growth new solutions ramp and 
the new head sales bill robbins improves sales productivity however 
these new solutions are not yet the market are very nascent driving our 
limited visibility confidence this back half acceleration and still focused 
leverage despite the moving pieces management reiterated its goal for positive 
operating cash flow evolving product portfolio amid new head 
sales which could drive disruption and investment the sales force reduces 
our confidence significant margin leverage 
ftnt wasn just budget flush hosted meetings with cfo drew del 
matto and new head kelly blough management addressed some the 
key debates post including strength billings billings grew yoy 
improvement from last the biggest debate the extent which this 
strength was due one time budget flush more sustainable drivers del 
matto noted the key drivers strength include stable demand environment 
positive customer feedback its security fabric architecture and improved sales 
productivity particularly with changes made august streamline the sales 
org and continued leverage management continued note focus 
improving margins through better sales productivity and more subscription 
content reiterating its goal margins 
however capex will remain elevated due real estate investments 
which may continue into muting near term fcf growth 
pfpt competitive environment still favorable hosted meetings with ceo 
gary steele and cfo paul auvil management addressed some the key 
debates post including magnitude beat while pfpt posted yoy 
billings growth investor feedback noted more moderate level billings 
beat and exposure large deals the mgmt reiterated very healthy with 
normal linearity and magnitude beats line with historical levels absent the 
anomalies microsoft competition microsoft has been more 
noisy the security space the past year recently announcing new security 
score for and updates its advanced malware protection solutions 
for management continued note limited competition from microsoft 
with proofpoint price performance equation compelling for large enterprises 
despite microsoft ability more price aggressive with proofpoint core 
protection suite user year the spend for greater functionality remains 
minimal relative pricing and other areas security spend management 
commentary aligns with commentary from the channel customers but 
paying close attention see there are any changes 
rpd working bring ops together with security held several meetings 
with management including ceo corey thomas and new cfo jeff 
kalowski would note number takeaways leveraging its data beyond 
vulnerability management has extended its reach beyond onpremise include cloud based detection and response platform 
addressing other areas security such siem and operations while still 
early days the insights platform has already ramped billings within 
year highlighting good amount momentum and still work the 
enterprise space while billings growth was improvement from 
mgmt notes that traction within the enterprise space remains soft with more 
work done new americas sales eric erston could help but likely
