upside potential for investors looking for the next big thing this report 
try identify three trends capable producing new billion market cap 
software company the key components our view are very big market 
opportunity bottleneck broken order access the value the 
market and funneling mechanism defining few one clear winner that 
market with that mind focus three market opportunities 
the likeliest candidate saas based applications data has gravity and the 
business workflows being automated applications will migrate towards that 
data ultimately business users want all their workflows well integrated 
and working off single version data the push and pull between best 
breed functionality and broader application suites kept peak market shares the 
low mid twenties the premise application world with saas based 
applications faster innovation cycles and easier integration new functionality 
becomes harder for best breed vendors sustain differentiation and 
enables suite vendors garner broader ecosystems and higher market share 
seen salesforce share the sales force automation market 
with the most customer data the cloud and multiple solutions targeting over 
million users see crm the clear leader saas based applications and 
well their way billion market cap 
stretch goal security consolidation the billion being spent annually 
security today has not solved the problem cybersecurity going forward 
chief information security officers cisos will looking systems enabling 
more effective security not just more layers security the keys this 
increased security effectiveness are better visibility within organization and

the components billion software company 
keith your space getting boring seems like all the key secular themes lead the 
same big companies where the next really big company going come from where 
that next billion company going come from 
the genesis this note came from recent meeting where client noted all 
the technology trends are talking about public cloud internet things and 
artificial intelligence seem lead the same five vendors amazon google 
microsoft facebook and alibaba and they are already very big companies what 
wanted know was where will that next huge company come from 
exhibit seems every tech question has the same answer 
source company data morgan stanley research 
that meeting started with thinking about how can find the next billion 
market cap company the first thing needed was figure out what level the 
fundamentals need reach support billion valuation came with 
simple equation with round figures for this exercise average you pay 
multiple for large well positioned vendor the software group which means the 
company needs yield about billion net income adding back taxes average 
tax rate yields operating income software names have pretty good 
operating margins around average scale the magic number get 
billion annual revenue 
exhibit fundamentals billion market cap 
source morgan stanley research 
then identified three key components needed support revenues that scale 
very big market opportunity this will usually come from either platform 
that can support multiple use cases very large user base that you can sell set 
applications into 
bottleneck broken unlock value there needs large pool value 
unlocked and some bottleneck reaching that value has broken large 
companies seem more likely built revolutionary evolutionary 
innovations 
demand funnels few one vendor demand must funnel few one 
vendor that large market opportunity 
when trying find these big markets there are basically two ways you could 
broad deep 
broad according forrester there are about million worldwide 
information workers which the core pool potential large base users for 
enterprise software company for example let say get share the 
million worldwide information workers and charge them per user 
that gives you billion revenues this the microsoft model such 
microsoft office its windows operating system very broad tool set that can 
used across high percentage the users within that big base informations 
workers 
deep according idc there are about worldwide firms with over 
employees which would the companies that are going buying 
significant amounts technology get billion revenue company 
would need garner approximately million per customer assuming 
share the mentioned firms that company must have platform that 
drives significant value able sell that deeper value proposition this 
line with the oracle model and its relational database platform 
before step into where the aforementioned pools values may come from let 
set the landscape with what call the fundamental forces software 
dollars moving towards software seen exhibit historical bea data 
shows that software has been getting larger piece overall capex for the past 
years hardware peaked and has been declining ever since 
software dollars moving from infrastructure applications within 
software budget dollars are moving from infrastructure software towards 
applications 
consumerization the end customer used the department the cio 
and those collecting requirements they would try understand the 
organization needs and then they would out and decide what technology they 
wanted buy fit those requirements that not the case anymore now it the 
business user that drives purchasing decisions the business users knows from 
their day day workflow exactly what they looking for additionally the 
business users bring work set expectations from the consumer world 
applications that are easy use and work out the box today the business 
users more discreetly drive the demand and departments enable those services 
increasing pace innovation simply the pace which things are getting 
better getting faster see the increasing pace innovation across all 
technology from semiconductors software service saas based

where are the potential markets for the next mega cap 
talk about software generally two key buckets applications and 
infrastructure 
applications are the software users interact with applications automate and optimize 
business and consumer processes making them either more efficient more effective 
infrastructure basically all the pipes enabling those applications run it the 
database underlying the applications that organizes and stores all the data it the 
messaging software that enables one application talk another it the plumbing 
why important understand the two different buckets software see two 
different value propositions the two sides the equation see exhibit 
applications entail open ended value proposition driven innovation 
long vendor can create more effective and efficient business processes 
applications are adding more and more value 
infrastructure represents cost optimization exercise how get the lowest 
possible cost for certain level service for example need database 
capable holding terabyte data and sustain thousand transactions per 
second going pay the least possible price get that functionality 
required level service this the reason why see budget dollars moving 
from the infrastructure layer the application layer infrastructure software has 
become cost optimization exercise track becoming commoditized while 
application software holds value better 
exhibit two buckets software with two different value propositions 
source shutterstock morgan stanley research 
see two major forces commoditizing infrastructure software however herein lies 
potentially very large value proposition there huge amount money already 
being spent proprietary infrastructure software vendors today perhaps one these 
two realms commoditization where are going see that bottleneck broken 
open source open source software defined any software product where the 
underlying source code visible and freely shared with the end user with 
limited ownership the code any software engineer free use optimize and 
extend the functionality open source programs gartner estimates least 
all mainstream organizations will leverage some element open source 
software within their mission critical solutions 
public cloud particularly infrastructure service amazon web services 
companies that bring market compute storage networking and other core 
services huge scale iaas vendors enable customers rent rather than buy these 
services one can think iaas extensive outsourcing exercise 
exhibit infrastructure getting commoditized

potential market open source 
what enables big open source company have one example big open source 
company today red hat within their product portfolio the red hat enterprise linux 
operating system represents over their revenues let look what made red 
hat the one company that been able monetize open source really well 
large market server operating systems are billion market and was even bigger 
when red hat entered the space 
consolidating funneling function operating system interface between 
underlying hardware server coming from dell ibm hewlett packard and the 
software running top that server database from oracle application 
from sap given these vendors running below and top the operating system are 
likely unwilling support every open source linux operating system available therein 
lies funneling function vendors chose support core set linux operating system 
flavors and red hat came out that dominant flavor every server vendor was going 
support red hat running top their servers and every application vendor was going 
support red hat viable run their applications their infrastructure top 
ultimately this funnels money red hat 
ability get people pay red hat was able get people pay from three core 
value propositions 
packaging red hat takes the wild wild west open source software 
development different versions the software with developers from around the 
world working then improve little portions code add specific 
functionalities then packages the best those improvements and functionalities 
into one easy install and implement piece software further they test the 
resulting packaged software code set against all the various servers storage 
systems and software likely run top 
updates similar commercial vendors red hat customers receive stream 
upgrades and updates their operating system continually patching holes and 
improving functionality red hat users garner confidence that their piece 
software works 
technical support finally red hat provides their customer base with technical 
support you have problem with your operating system there somebody 
call this type support crucial for large enterprises 
the end customer for server operating systems server admin who are used 
getting these services from third party provider much easier get server admin 
pay red hat than your end customer was software developer who packages 
software all the time may more comfortable with community support models and 
may not appreciate the value proposition red hat the same degree 
open source has given one big company possible that there can another 
large open source company going forward basis there are three markets that 
believe could potentially very large the open source world 
openstack started rackspace and nasa openstack open 
source project focused providing the infrastructure build and manage public 
and private cloud environments standard hardware other words openstack 
set tools and technologies used automate and orchestrate what 
customer doing their data center annual basis enterprises spend 
billion data center technology there lot that automated however the 
primary difficulty creating new mega vendor openstack the lack 
funnelling functionality while there big potential market opportunity it 
difficult imagine one two vendors taking that entire market place traditional 
vendors like cisco hewlett packard ibm vmware and red hat each have their 
own versions the core openstack distribution leaving open the question 
whether the market will consolidate behind smaller set offerings while 
see openstack good expansion opportunity for red hat don see driving 
the company the billion market cap mark 
data stores the database market represents about billion annual 
spending according industry sources the market size significant however 
the dominant trend data stores particularly open source data stores has been 
giving the end user more choice finding the right data store fit the particular 
type data problem needed solved this dynamic likely further fragments 
the demand the market across more vendors 
containers containers are emerging technology within application 
development and deployment what containers try optimize how 
application developers write and deploy their code see software container 
enthusiasm revolutionizing software delivery september essentially 
containers standardize the platform which the developer writes software code 
and containerizing their applications developers have means ensure that 
the code they written and tested will work across any system where 
deployed with enterprises spending almost billion application 
development and deployment today containers could very large market 
opportunity from our most recent cio survey companies incorporated 
linux containers their environments with additional expected 
again the big question remains who will that value accrue could 
the operating system vendors other open source companies developing 
management frameworks for containers given developers are the end 
customer the technology may ultimately prove difficult monetize 
containers the analogy simply understand containers think shipping container rather than shipping couches 
lamps refrigerators and tvs all out the box and having count for all the different shapes and sizes you pack them all 
together into standard sized shipping container anyone within your transport network can use whether it the truck the 
ship train the warehouse they all use standardized container the same thing applies for software containers you 
package the software standard size container when you develop anyone who wants run knows exactly how run 
you running the same way any environment top any software 
potential market infrastructure service 
let shift gears the other commoditizing functionality discussed earlier 
outsourcing underlying infrastructures third party vendor what call 
infrastructure service iaas see two types infrastructure service iaas 
demand 
the new software development kits this the application development 
platform for extending the functionality application suites customer already 
uses let say customer uses salesforce sales cloud which gives you 
horizontal generic version sales force automation business processes 
continuing the example you work morgan stanley selling institutional 
clients with very specific needs and utilize specific selling processes you want 
develop functionality that pertains specifically your business processes 
tickers trade sizes etc that isn the core salesforce application the 
customer can use this type iaas platform develop this functionality adjacent 
their existing applications that nature going smaller market 
opportunity given adjunct what the company already selling their 
customers think the larger opportunity comes from 
supporting newer existing workloads essentially outsourcing infrastructure 
hardware and software technologies from amazon web services microsoft 
google why that much bigger opportunity because you commoditizing 
the billion infrastructure software and hardware that being utilized 
data centers today see exhibit you targeting very big market 
opportunity see global technology america insight aws disruption spreads 
software soon services nov this potentially where the next 
billion company comes from 
exhibit iaas addressable market 
source idc gartner infonetics morgan stanley research 
probably not because infrastructure service leverages economies scale and 
the scale vendors already exist amazon web services microsoft azure google 
compute and alibaba have all spent considerable capital already making play for this 
market opportunity the annual capex spent needed catch with these four are 
considerable see exhibit

what about big data there are two categories technology that address the large 
potential market opportunities see big data 
data stores the underlying technologies which store organize and retrieve data

application analysis being done effectively moving the industry away from what had 
been one size fits all approach let take look the most recent gartner magic 
quadrant relational databases see exhibit there are currently vendors within 
the leader quadrant while this remains very big billion market opportunity 
the market has opened lot different vendors over the past several years the 
magic quadrant three years ago looked much cleaner with four core vendors providing 
basically one type data store relational database and within that oracle 
dominating the category with distributed systems market share close see exhibit 
the central reason the relational database was the only reliable scale data store 
for doing high performance transactional applications the answer any data store 
question customer had was always going relational database and more times 
than not was going oracle now the equation has flipped the customer has 
many viable options for data store and can optimize the data store the type 
application being built 
for oracle this what consider death thousand cuts while oracle sustains 
their current base customers well there just lot more competition for new 
workloads their core database business including open source public cloud and 
other legacy vendors like microsoft see oracle corporation see you the spring 
time moving await clarity catalysts nov

potential market user interfaces 
user interfaces single pane glass into the data within user interfaces vendors 
look bring market single screen view analyze and eventually present 
information contained within all the data stores company has why could this the 
next billion company because this pertains the million worldwide 
information workers spoke about earlier from them drive 
billion annual revenue company qliktech and tableau are trying come out with 
these value propositions 
however are little reticent making high conviction case for these two the 
blue skies scenario for qliktech tableau solution which can reach all these 
information workers given product that compelling and easy enough use that 
everyone could have their desk ideally instead giving presentation 
powerpoint one could using tableau instead using static excel driven charts 
there would real time data coming from back end data sources increasing accuracy 
and efficiency the information workers communications our view the problem 
with qliktech tableau becoming the next billion company the competitive 
environment 
particularly from the incumbent microsoft microsoft power features 
enhanced self service data preparation data discovery and dashboards with access 
premises and cloud data compelling price point 
analytics embedded within the app salesforce sap workday 
salesforce new analytics tool wave allows users enhanced visibility with 
their own analytics tools set within the environment where the data resides 
workday also doing this creating underlying data store enabling 
customers transactional and analytical types workloads against the same 
underlying data store the analytics come right alongside the automation 
business processes sap also trying base all their applications top 
their own database which analytically oriented data store the same 
thing push the analytics right line with automation those business 
processes 
cloud providers aws google microsoft the cloud providers themselves are 
all trying create more and more analytical functionality within their big clouds 
this market that has real opportunity but too much competition really throw 
out another billion software company 
potential market internet things 
let shift the internet things which pulls together lot the big data ideas 
we been talking about one the core drivers within that the evolution 
machine learning technologies eventually distill the value out the big data and big 
compute companies have access see exhibit 
big data the opportunity side the equation unprecedented amount data has 
been created from the proliferation sensors our cars refrigerators and cellphones 
all have sensors that produce bunch data furthermore the digitalization 
business processes and mobile computing creates even more data however all this 
data itself doesn really drive any value it what you can with that the 
opportunity analyzing the large stores data drive insight which makes our 
business processes and consumer processes more efficient and effective 
the other side the equation the enabler big compute moore law increasing 
the capacity within piece silicon public cloud creating the global capacity scale 
workload elastic basis and grow needed horizontally scaling applications 
enabling customers engage huge amounts processing power single problem 
very short notice and only when needed pulling together the opportunity big 
data and the enabler big compute the mechanism machine learning algorithms 
running within these compute plants utilizing different techniques find connections 
and insights out the data coming the optimal solutions that humans couldn find 
their own there ton insight and value that could potentially come from these 
machine learning applications 
the problem terms this actually becoming the next billion company 
rooted where all this data resides the big public cloud vendors amazon google 
microsoft have machine learning tool sets where the analysis already being done 
you look the acquisition history amazon google and microsoft over the past 
years they bought raft and machine learning technologies they are creating 
machine learning studios that exist within their cloud environments this the core 
the problem that discussed earlier the existing big players are going get the 
lion share the benefits from these innovations similar what were talking 
about earlier regards their scale 
exhibit internet things opportunity framework 
source morgan stanley research 
where think find the next mega cap 
until this point we discussed what not going create the next mega cap 
company where could potentially find that next billion market cap 
company see three potential opportunities 
the likeliest candidate saas based apps best positioned vendor crm 
stretch goal security consolidation best positioned vendor panw 
get this right we geniuses app development for the masses best 
positioned vendor team 
why saas based apps data has gravity 
application automates the workflows business and business users want all the 
workflow associated that business process integrated one system and working off 
single version the data for example salesforce the idea salesforce 
have all the data and workflows pertaining company end customers and 
prospects consolidated one platform from the beginning the relationship 
when sending out marketing emails when sales leads are coming the door when 
the lead becomes customer and the company needs provide effective customer 
support all the information why you marketing potential lead how you 
got the lead become customer the experience that customer has had goes into 
central data base that will help you create happier customer more leads and more 
new sales 
the premise world there existed push and pull between best breed 
functionality from smaller more innovative firms and the benefits workflow 
integration and single set data found the broader application suites this friction 
kept peak market shares for leading application vendors the low mid twenties 
with saas based applications faster innovation cycles releases per year and 
easier integration new functionality given single version the code more 
difficult for best breed vendors sustain differentiation this dynamic has enabled 
suite vendors like salesforce garner broader partner ecosystems deeper set 
functionality and higher market share their core market seen their share 
the sales force automation market see salesforce into the clouds sales 
cloud apr 
exhibit power data creates self fulfilling cycle ultimately happier customer 
source morgan stanley research 
success centers having the data looking the saas landscape we looking for 
who has the biggest sets data think the most obvious answer terms who 
could the next billion market cap company salesforce one hand 
they already halfway there but even more because they furthest along 
penetrating very large customer base between sales cloud service cloud and 
marketing cloud estimate salesforce addresses million business users 
see salesforce into the clouds service cloud may their platform 
business represents another large potential opportunity functionality built top 
the platform could potentially utilized all those million information 
workers and they doing good job monetizing the sales cloud their initial 
product that has been the market longest has over market share they can 
get market share across out the platforms they going that

why security consolidation 
drivers why need the change there more malicious threat environment 
companies are facing the problem getting harder and not easier solve with 
expanding surface area vulnerable attack the problem longer just protecting 
the core data center it not about just building high thick walls keep all the bad 
guys out and keep the good stuff cloud based applications and mobile phones 
extend outside the data center with internet things companies now have 
protect all sorts infrastructure and devices from potentially being hacked the 
bottom line the billion spending security today still not making safe 
see cybersecurity rethinking security april companies are still getting 
hacked daily basis 
constraints what are the challenges 
productivity drags security represents tax both terms dollars and the 
productivity the underlying systems being protected 
lack human capital there are not enough trained personnel properly 
monitor and react the security systems currently place 
false positive problem security systems must err the side missing bad 
stuff order avoid destroying the integrity underlying systems with false 
positives 
how going change more effective security not more security the industry will 
moving systems that enable more effective security not necessarily more security 
think this comes the form increased visibility gathering all the 
information the current state operations from within organization and the 
threat environment outside the organization pulling together into one data 
pool and analyzing get enhanced context what going both good and 
bad 
more automation when the increased visibility from this data find alerts 
bad actors the responses should triggered automatically since requiring 
manual human intervention will prolong the time the system are vulnerable 
attack and don have the human capital effectively respond 
one the primary ways achieve both increased visibility and more automation 
through consolidation customers getting more pieces the puzzle from one vendor 
who can pull information create automated responses and tie together these actions 
across all the various devices organization 
exhibit why security consolidation 
source morgan stanley research 
who can potentially win security consolidation full disclaimer we still very far 
from the point that any single vendor garnering the lion share the overall security 
budget however our top pick would palo alto networks given what they been 
able the network security part the equation the network security market 
about billion out the larger billion total security tam while palo alto 
networks hasn yet gotten solution for that entire billion they been very 
effective consolidation functionality within their core network security market when 
looking for the best consolidator feel it important looking for the most 
effective fast follower not necessarily the first mover looking for the vendor 
that can consistently incorporate new functionality their platform seamlessly 
customers don have look elsewhere for the best breed solution that way when 
new threat comes new vector needs protected customers keep coming 
them for more and more the overall solution 
for palo alto network get very large they need emerge the security platform 
for their end customers enabling multiple security functionalities apps this how 
they can derive million per customer from the customers spoke about 
earlier that point palo alto networks talks about their top customers having 
spent million with them which evidence that they are able get the right sized 
customer now the company has broaden their offering point the entire 
billion security market instead just network security 
another potential consolidation player would symantec the largest the 
standalone software companies the security vendor space right now with significant 
presence within large enterprises symantec natural choice consolidate 
functionality they protect million corporate end points all the pcs and 
servers amongst broad set customers they could better organize their product 
portfolio make integration easier ultimately getting more customers buy more 
from them they could potentially long term consolidation winner well 
exhibit panw success network security gives confidence its ability address the broader software security tam 
source idc company data morgan stanley research 
why application development for the masses 
see long tail business processes with more limited user bases which have yet 
automated packaged applications see exhibit representing large pool 
potential value creation the smaller user bases for these business process means 
packaged application vendors are unlikely target this opportunity however 
vendor could truly make app development easy enough for information workers 
which there are million automate their own business processes and the 
components these applications were shareable amongst users drawing users 
towards fewer vendors very large vendor could supported 
exhibit long tail business processes yet automated 
source morgan stanley research 
where the value unlock it that massive long tail businesses processes that 
nobody would spend the time create packaged application the processes 
conduct daily basis that maybe could automated for example there are lot 
processes and lot work that goes into organizing equity research conference 
many emails spreadsheets phone calls organize the participants content and 
marketing the event however highly unlikely that any packaged application 
vendor going create application just automate how get organized for 
equity research conferences 
however they did would find lot value that somebody made that daily 
process more efficient ideally should able create these efficiencies ourselves 
using application development tool that easy enough for information workers 
use that would come from taking software development from the million software 
developers today the million information workers massively expanding that 
market opportunity and unlocking that big value pool 
potential vendor that could that atlassian company that went public 
january started tool for automating workflows for software developers the 
company mantra make their workflow engine easy enough use that usage 
moves out the department into the department the legal team etc atlassian 
strives become app development tool for the masses salesforce and 
servicenow are also going after these opportunities 
again this has lot the components spoken about very big market 
opportunity all information workers the potential for revolutionary change given 
very few information workers are doing application development today and 
potential funnel that demand given the need share those automated workflows 
across different users much the same way office winnowed down one vendor 
order effectively share excel word files automated work flows should able 
effectively shared well whoever can get this right could make really really big
