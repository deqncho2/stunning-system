summary the state cyber security 
why are cyber attacks the increase 
cyber attacks and data breaches present risks for all companies businesses are becoming increasingly 
reliant the digital economy with the amount data collected and processed growing rapidly with this 
comes greater risk cyber attacks the spread viruses corporate espionage identity theft 
operations can disrupted and sensitive data accessed and leaked unauthorised parties 
the growth the digital economy increase use smartphones and use the internet things 
all raise the risk cyber attacks more confidential information and transactions are moving the digital 
space the growth the internet things for example provides opportunities for companies increase 
connectivity cost savings and flexibility but the same time gives rise cyber security risks that need 
managed effectively research firm idc expects the internet things grow billion connected 
devices from today 
the number security incidents against companies has been rising over year since 
cagr according pwc and this trend set continue was particularly high profile year for 
cyber attacks early the year details were confirmed regarding the attack target the end had 
million customer debit and credit card details and million records stolen including names addresses and 
telephone numbers target shoppers this was followed high profile attacks ebay may morgan 
july and sony pictures november according data symantec security software company recorded 
million identities exposed the incidence cyber attacks has continued rise with cases 
such anthem january ashley madison july and more recently experian and talktalk october 
and cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated many cyber advances have been developed 
overcome more advanced layers defence according the latest threat report mcafee they are

cybercrime costs the global economy more than billion the equivalent the gdp united arab 
emirates according the centre for strategic and international studies key concern for companies 
the loss sensitive information critical assets some attacks have stolen intellectual property information 
deals and customer data with resulting damage the company competitive advantage and brand 
reputation according research the ponemon institute business disruption the highest external cost 
total external costs followed the costs associated with information loss see the impact 
valuation for analysis how cyber attack can affect revenues costs capital investment and cost capital 
how can companies combat the threat 
forward leaning businesses are starting approach cyber security matter when rather than 
they are hacked such companies are developing holistic approach putting place framework 
protect and identify critical assets and sensitive information the most effective companies have fully 
committed boards with chief information security officer ciso reporting directly the board matters 
information security new technologies are being employed such cloud based security services and data 
analytics which are being used monitor data within company helping identify anomalous activity 
furthermore additional safeguard the event attack companies are encrypting data ensure 
redundant any hacker 
how can investors assess the risk companies 
for the outsider often hard assess the extent which company risk cyber attack 
data cyber attacks tends incomplete companies often not disclose when they have been attacked 
and some cases may not even aware the section assessing the risk cyber attack look 
how investors can analyse the level cyber security for company 
identifying the risk industry operation

the impact valuation 
cyber attack can disrupt business operations creating confusion and disabling services yet the 
immediate signs cyber attack are often not the full extent damage some attacks have resulted theft 
intellectual property information deals and customer data damaging both company competitive 
advantage and brand reputation according research the ponemon institute business disruption 
the highest external cost total external costs followed the costs associated with information loss 
exhibit the cost cyber attacks

the cost cyber attack increases the longer 
takes resolve this may because the number 
data records that are breached because the 
hackers have infiltrated higher number company 
systems creating more infrastructure damage the 
ponemon institute which looked companies 
estimates the mean number days takes resolve 
attack with average cost per day 
some types attacks can take longer resolve and 
result higher cost the company attacks 
malicious insiders take the longest time resolve 
days average and therefore pose the highest 
risk ponemon institute 
exhibit shows some the direct costs reported 
companies following cyber attacks with range million million however maintenance 
costs protect against the increasing risk cyber attacks are also substantial cost morgan says that 
spent million protect against the risk cyber security and will increase cyber spend nearly 
over the next two years ceo letter culture excellence 
however note that these figures not necessarily capture the other costs incurred through reputation 
damage lost business that can impact the long term value company explore below 
following announcement attack see the immediate risks first through the reputational 
damage and loss customers and second through regulatory fines customer lawsuits and compliance exhibit 
shows illustrative discounted cash flow model identifying how cyber security can impact the traditional 
analysis namely through 
revenues 
reported findings data breach result cyber attack can result reputational damage affecting 
customer perceptions company according report the ponemon institute respondents who 
had experienced data breach said reputation loss brand value and marketplace image were the biggest 
impacts addition where the breach results loss sensitive information this can result loss 
competitiveness december the attack sony resulted the leak full copies movies that had yet 
released 
fines 
fines relating regulatory enforcement data breaches are one off cost the company these fines have 
been enforced the past particularly the under the data protection act which can issue monetary 
penalty notice requiring organisations pay europe new legislation expected under the 
general data protection information directive for which fines can amount annual worldwide

remedial actions improve processes fix damage that occurred result cyber attack all add 
company costs the method attacks continually changing and developing requires continued investment 
security measures morgan spent more than million its financial year protection against 
the risk cyber attack with around people focusing cyber security expects this increase 
over the next two years morgan how business ceo letter culture excellence 
ongoing monitoring required staff current service providers consultants contractors and suppliers 
ensure they are following cyber security policies and procedures any employee third party could pose 
cyber risk the company indeed employees remain the most cited source compromise according pwc 
global state information security survey such companies are investing data analytics log and 
track data throughout the company allow them better understand anomalous network activity 
capital investment 
due diligence procedures are required new acquisitions projects from the perspective cyber security 
risk for example small company that does not have the relevant cyber security processes place may 
infiltrated advance pending acquisition merger acquisition and integration the systems the 
threat actor may try infiltrate the larger company and carry out attack 
cost capital 
companies that fail set strong tone from the top and not appear haves good understanding the 
importance cyber security can regarded higher risk investors this can result higher cost 
capital for example morgan stanley european telecoms analyst terence tsui has lowered the terminal

assessing the risk cyber attack 
individual company vulnerability cyber attack can depend the sector which operates its size and 
what doing internally bolster its cyber security geography may have some role play too the united 
states has had the largest number high profile attacks recent years including target sony 
and anthem this may simply reflect the fact that the united states has some the world largest 
companies and these tend target for hackers cyber criminals have more gain from hacking rich 
target rather than poor target furthermore attacks have also been linked foreign nation states and 
such can driven ideological and country specific aims 
for outsiders including investors often difficult assess what extent company exposed the risk 
cyber attack accurate information cyber security often opaque part because most cybercrime 
incidents unreported companies and countries can view reporting cyber attack sign weakness 
internally and some cases the attack not identified until some time after the event 
this section highlight how investors can approach assessing cyber security risk for company 
assess risk sector operation 
all industries are impacted cyber crime but the level risk varies industry owing the nature 
and sensitivity the data held sectors that hold consumer data are target for cyber attackers intellectual 
property and state secrets are also desired hackers 
exhibit data breaches identities exposed

source symantec internet security threat report 
financial services and retail companies are most targeted for theft financial information real 
names government ids and home addresses were the top three types information exposed 
according symantec however financial information increased from breaches most 
cases relating credit and debit card information derived from online retailers and point sale systems 
such financial services companies and retail companies are more risk attackers looking sell this 
information retail companies have experienced surge attacks particularly also the industry 
liable for the highest number identities exposed with all identities reported exposed 
from according symantec 
the healthcare sector also target for cyber criminals because the value stolen medical 
records medical records were only information exposed symantec but hold greater 
value than credit card data the black market symantec estimated that the value medical 
information was times the value credit card data per record this because includes 
personal data such names telephone numbers birth dates social security numbers among other 
information which can used buy drugs for resale create false insurance claims addition the level 
sustainable and responsible october 
morgan stanley research 
spending cyber security defence lower than other industries providing opportunity for hackers abi 
research reported that estimates healthcare spending cyber security worldwide were billion 
whereas according report written homeland security market research the financial services 
industry the alone expected spend billion 
the cost cyber crime also appears vary sector the ponemon institute found study 
companies that some the most heavily regulated industries such financial services utilities and energy had 
the highest average total annualised cost result cyber crime million and million 
respectively contrast the cost incurred retailers and the public sector was less than half this total 
average annualised cost million and million respectively 
but the growth the internet things opening other sectors the risk cyber attack 
experiment conducted for wired magazine article earlier this year human driven production car had its 
firmware altered and various functions controlled remotely computer pair white knight hackers 
penetrated jeep cherokee can bus system wirelessly rewriting the firmware the 
infotainment system chip using the car native phone connection this allowed them take control both 
infotainment functions well critical operations the car including braking and power vehicles become 
more connected more autonomous and less reliant human operated mechanical functions the question 
security will become more important and more frequent for further details see car hacking implications for 
autonomous vehicles 
case study medical devices 
medical devices mobile health apps and new mobile care delivery models that move patient care 
the home create opportunities for hackers information moved via public networks and through 
consumer devices such the mobile phone creating greater risk data breaches for example medical 
devices that send information hospital network can provide entry point larger attack for hospital 
data such without relevant safeguards medical data can exposed cyber attackers 
exhibit illustrates how implanted device such pacemaker constantly transmitting data the hospital 
network patients well being the data transmitted through home transmitter and could open 
cyber attack

remotely accessed hackers allowing the unauthorised user control the device and change the dosage the 
pump delivers fiercemedical aug this pump not alone the risk hacking has been demonstrated 
through research for pacemakers surgical and anesthesia devices ventilators and patient monitors 
what makes medical devices vulnerable the nature medical devices with long useful lives used 
hours day and continually and off the hospital network means that removal malware from 
compromised device may operationally difficult addition any security updates the medical device 
would hard carry out when constantly use 
what can done reduce the risk the first step risk management for the specific medical device

companies are starting adapt environment where there high chance data breach the most 
advanced companies this area appreciate that controls and compliance can only afford degree protection 
against the risk cyber attack such they are moving away from the fortress approach securing 
company more broadly against cyber risk for example focusing critical assets and identifying anomalous 
activity through data analytics this because well organised hackers who want data insight from company 
only have look for gaps company approach attempt data breach some companies are also 
adopting cyber insurance mitigate the financial cost should they the victim cybercrime 
there are quick fixes for cyber security risk rather companies must prepared with framework

environment increasing cyber security risk acknowledge this list not exhaustive 
management board level commitment 
responsibility for promoting culture cyber security ultimately rests with the board directors consistent 
commitment from the board and ceo adhering cyber security policies will set the tone for the company 
the ceo and board should have regular updates any cyber breaches and the security framework 
addition companies may have designated chief information security officer ciso 
furthermore board members who are well versed the risk cyber security are better able challenge risk 
management plans cyber attacks some boards have had training cyber security risks for their company 
this may include basic coding and elementary understanding the dark web highlight what hackers 
maybe looking for within company 
cybersecurity absolutely critical the operations any enterprise and executives need pay 
much attention they the bottom line company data has become valuable the products

regulation tightening 
cyber security legislation the horizon and this will impact how companies think about the risk 
cyber security currently only around one seven companies have organisations structured that 
security leaders report directly the chief executive officer ceo ponemon institute with regulations 
set tighten both the and the level internal focus cyber security set increase 
nearly two thirds companies are expected have security leaders reporting direct the ceo according 
survey performed the ponemon institute 
the most stringent regulation for companies the financial sector government agencies and 
sectors national importance the and other developed economies there has been some natural flow 
down regulation through companies dealing with governments sensitive data any company with 
government contract must have robust security procedures place face sanctions this has led 
regulations being imposed through the subcontractor chain 
the whole existing cybersecurity legislation has not yet caught with the pace change 
cybercrime even the most developed economies including the and the european union have been slow 
implement regulations minimum cyber security defences and more important imposing penalties 
encourage companies upgrade their cyber security infrastructure however the challenge with new 
regulation cyber security making flexible enough keep with how the cyber threat evolves and thus 
ensure that law becomes outdated quickly 
united states 
cyber information sharing has been common theme bills introduced the congress 
for example the cyber intelligence sharing and protection act was introduced the house 
representatives and the cybersecurity information sharing act was introduced the senate both bills allow 
companies and the federal government share threat information for the purpose cybersecurity such 
the aim the legislation encourage companies and governments share information help prevent 
cyber attacks such those sony pictures and target 
however sharing cyber security data creates many privacy concerns and thus there are many who 
oppose the bills under the cyber intelligence sharing and protection house bill the government would 
allowed obtain information that now requires warrant addition private companies would able 
share information with the government without the individual knowing addition even legislation 
introduced expected have broad scope and also voluntary 
european union 
the european union now taking proactive stance the issue the set introduce two new 
directives with direct implications for cybersecurity these are the general data protection regulation gdpr 
and the national information and security directive nis these signal two waves more stringent and 
widespread legislation being introduced 
general data protection information due come into force fines can amount 
annual worldwide revenues million this covers broad 
range data security aspects conducting business example longer 
sufficient simply destroy device once has been decommissioned from business the

segment below 
endpoint security 
endpoint security software focuses ensuring devices like pcs tablets mobile phones and even 
point sales systems meet certain standards and therefore offer some degree protection from 
attack traditional examples endpoint security include personal firewalls anti virus software that 
monitored and updated from the server given the constantly evolving threat landscape endpoint security 
technology also starting include things like intrusion detection with behaviour blocking components 
broadly would highlight four key drivers for growth endpoint security spending 
the expanding attack surface more personal devices mean more endpoints companies 
allow employees bring their own devices which access corporate networks spending 
endpoint security secure these devices must increase 
vanishing perimeter for corporate networks more applications are delivered over the 
cloud and more employees work remotely companies need improve the security the 
endpoints being used access these networks this puts the emphasis back endpoint 
security 
increasing attacker sophistication requiring refresh legacy systems

policies 
endpoint security vendors symantec trend micro avg cyvera palo alto networks mandiant fireeye

network security 
network security focuses the corporate computer network and includes elements like firewalls 
which aim create perimeter around the corporate network keeping bad things out and keeping 
good things typically network security system relies layers protection that consist multiple 
components including

firewalls which act first line defence assessing traffic over network and determining 
whether network packet allowed through the network based previously determined rules

insurers are still taking their time before writing 
large amounts cyber policies the risk still not 
well modeled air currently developing cyber risk 
model the problem for the industry lies defining 
products way that can provide meaningful value for 
client without exposing the industry high amounts 
accumulation risks internet things world 
multiple linked systems could mean that single 
disruption would take down entire networked 
system across global locations affecting multiple lines 
business all without the source the disruption 
being identified 
not only difficult insure against but think the 
contract wording will have very accurately defined 
include what covered the risk currently some 
contracts are already specifically making cyber 
exclusions avoid potential cyber event being 
claimed under the policy 
the use new technologies drives the need for knowledge sharing between reinsurer and 
technology provider through partnerships for example swiss and ibm partnered april 
provide cyber risk protection products globally munich also partnered with hewlett packard april 
with providing the technical and organisational knowledge measures for risk minimisation and investigation 
the event claim and munich providing underwriting experience and support after the claim munich 
would also offer insurance cover over lost sales from reputational loss business interruption contractual 
penalties 
alternative capital solution for cyber risk new products such cyber insurance are still some way 
from becoming commoditised product with the potential for alternative capital step and serve the 
demand but think that could possible few years time the problem the lack historical data 
which difficult gather companies may reluctant disclose the extent their losses after event 
also the service element would required for cyber loss helping the cedent retrieve data and establish 
operations which not present the ils market
