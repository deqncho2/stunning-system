capgemini top services pick for 
william crone 
services capgemini remains our top pick while turn more 
cautious atos upgrade tieto earnings inflection 
and valuation software turn more cautious both software 
and temenos fear momentum has slowed both and 
valuation longer strong support 
technology software services 
cap the top pick services tieto moves atos 
acknowledge that cap has enjoyed strong run but feel this has only removed 
valuation anomaly see the company the best positioned europe 
deliver top line and margin expansion and integrates igate narrow 
the valuation gap further accenture our price target increases 
sales turn more cautious atos while the shares are not expensive 
not expect organic top line growth accelerate 
materially and synergies will broadly achieved this would 
make growth potential more limited from then without further 
elsewhere double upgrade tieto driven strong cash flow 
valuation fcf yield and capital return story dividend yield with 
top line inflection point the main catalyst 
turning more cautious software downgrade both software and 
temenos from upgraded both initially trough valuation 
call recurring troughs temenos became more than that licence growth 
accelerated however this now decelerating temenos weaker licence 
growth despite the year renewal cycle suggests banks may doing 
smaller proof concepts big bang changes which push out licence 
acceleration there little valuation support here and risk reward looks more 
balanced now hence software think growth will remain very 
muted the legacy mainframe business returns its natural declines and 
not believe material acceleration dbp digital business platform 
also see less room for cost cutting now and the shifting growth from high 
margin adabas lower margin dbp may even weigh margins the shares 
are not expensive but the reaction results suggests investors need 
see top line growth now not just cost cutting think this unlikely and 
move 
introducing our new esg analysis include analysis the esg risks 
and opportunities for atos capgemini sap software tieto and temenos 
see human capital the shift cloud and corporate governance the main 
esg topics relevant our sector we seen moderate wage inflation 
software services companies driven services vendors efforts

capgemini has guided cost synergies which expected from and facilities 
rationalisation and from improved utilisation rates and pyramid based this and the baseline margin 
accretion from the igate deal the company has issued new mid term margin guidance while the 
company has not quantified mid term believe likely refers the period ending 
this guidance looks achievable given the midpoint the cost savings represents 
overlapping revenues midpoint capgemini standalone north america revenues and igate north america 
revenues and combined group revenues historically services deals have achieved average cost 
savings overlapping revenues and combined revenues result see capgemini 
guidance the conservative end and therefore more achievable 
higher offshoring industrialisation and pyramid should improve through the cycle margins 
over recent quarters capgemini management have argued that recession should have materially lower 
negative impact margins today than over the last years this largely driven the company efforts 
related offshoring automation and industrialisation moving from previously offering custom one off 
projects with infinite choice capgemini now offer menu modules options they can mix and match 
additionally with offshore ratio capgemini leads the european peer group offshore service 
delivery 
believe the above points are enhanced the acquisition igate which bolsters capgemini process

the average accenture sales premium has been above the ebit margin differential average sales 
premium ebit margins being higher accenture over the same period

when upgraded temenos the shares were trading around trough historical maintenance 
revenue valuations and saw greater upside than downside potential from the structural trends 
around party software adoption banking 
while remain believers the company strong brand and the spending trends long term have 
become increasingly concerned about the speed this transition and the resulting new business 
licence volatility that this might cause believe our concerns are broadly echoed the market 
following quarters disappointing licences the shares have gradually rated from forward

less confident licence acceleration 
low visibility uncertain transition tier banks from house systems party software and 
consecutive quarters licence deceleration make less confident licence acceleration implied the 
current guidance 
licences have decelerated over the past quarters 
while management has maintained the view that the spending environment for banks improving and big 
deals should returning this has yet translate into significant licence growth over the last quarters 
licences have decelerated every quarter turning negative and result establish two 
factors which believe have resulted the mismatch between the company performance and the 
underlying spending environment 
execution issues based conversations with management our morgan stanley tmt 
conference barcelona november and subsequent communications from the company 
went into expecting acceleration licence growth the org reported 
result the sales execution issues asia pacific came surprise highlighting the 
limited visibility management have the signing new deals our view although short term 
sales delivery was flagged priority when david arnott was appointed ceo believe there 
still lot work ahead have levers place prevent significant deal slippage from 
occurring going forward with historical licence volatility still front mind for many investors 
technology software services july 
morgan stanley research 
especially given the recent licence disappointments believe the focus will remain shortterm performance 
pace adoption believe the type slippage highlighted above has also been driven the 
slower than expected transition from house developed systems party software tier 
banks see exhibit changing core banking system highly risky and complex 
process resulting decision cycles that can materially longer other verticals while the 
benefits transitioning party software are generally understood the long roi time frame 
years many cases can often lead banks especially tier indicating interest but 
then delaying definitive agreement based various short term factors additionally tier 
deals could coming much smaller proof concepts which means deals are being done 
but not significant size therefore while believe temenos may have extensive pipeline 
deals these may subject continuous delays signing the expectations the 
internal sales representatives temenos have been addressing this issue creating software 
modules the core banking system which take less time implement and therefore have 
faster roi progressive renovation have yet see the effectiveness this however with

those customers who will longer use the software and therefore not require renewal and inflation 
per annum calculate licence contribution from renewals and 
respectively therefore despite incremental licences from renewals temenos was unable
