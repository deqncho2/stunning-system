dear shareholders 
operate highly cyclical industry that entering 
its fourth year down cycle for the last several 
years our board directors and management team 
have focused positioning our company navigate 
the downturn while executing our existing expansion 
program with view emerging from this cycle 
preeminent supplier well intervention services the 
offshore deepwater oil and gas industry 
maintaining strong balance sheet has been one 
our key priorities managing through this cycle 
addition the transactions completed 
successfully executed several transactions shore 
our balance sheet for what could relatively 
long time before market recovery january 
sold million our common stock and june 
refinanced million our term loan extending 
the loan reduced our overall debt 
million this restructuring our balance 
sheet was aimed helping position our company 
manage through the protracted downturn our 
industry and allow our company benefit once the 
market eventually recovers 
operationally was pivotal year for helix 
april the siem helix monohull well intervention 
vessel was accepted and commenced its four year 
contract with petrobras the acceptance process was 
difficult one for our first vessel arrive brazil the 
vessel started its contract agreed upon reduced rates 
several items identified the petrobras acceptance 
process were resolved most those items having been 
addressed the end the third quarter applied 
the lessons learned during this process our completion 
and preparation the sister ship the siem helix 
presented the vessel for acceptance early october and 
the vessel was accepted and went contract early 
december the siem helix marks the third vessel 
have completed and commenced long term contract 
operations since may the two siem helix 
vessels represent milestone non rig intervention 
they are the first successful monohull designs capable 
deploying high pressure riser based intervention 
believe that these assets have set the foundation for 
helix not only manage through this down cycle but 
also benefit during eventual market upturn 
from business perspective now have six purposebuilt well intervention vessels and operations the three 
largest basins for offshore deepwater wells three our 
six vessels are long term contracts two our vessels 
have strong utilization the north sea market market 
that has improved since reaching its trough 
the two vessels the gulf mexico the long 
term contract while the covers the spot market 
the has historically achieved high utilization 
this market and has been the benchmark for intervention 
vessels

government regulation 
overview 
many aspects the offshore marine construction industry are subject extensive governmental 
regulations are subject the jurisdiction the coast guard the coast guard the environmental 
protection agency the epa well state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions which 
operate three divisions the department the interior the bureau ocean energy management the 
boem the bureau safety and environmental enforcement the bsee the office natural resource 
revenue the onrr and the customs and border protection the cbp well classification societies 
such the american bureau shipping the abs are also subject the requirements the federal 
occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws that regulate the protection employee 
health and safety for our land based operations 
the north sea international regulations govern working hours and specified working environment 
well standards for diving procedures equipment and diver health these north sea standards are some the 
most stringent worldwide the absence any specific regulation our north sea operations adhere standards 
set the international marine contractors association and the international maritime organization addition 
operate other foreign jurisdictions each with their own laws and regulations which are subject 
with respect north sea operations also note that the decision exit from the may 
result the imposition new laws rules regulations affecting operations inside territorial waters 
coast guard 
the coast guard sets safety standards and authorized investigate vessel and diving accidents well 
other marine casualty incidents and recommend improved safety standards the coast guard also 
authorized inspect vessels will also adhere manning requirements which are implemented the 
coast guard the outer continental shelf ocs are required various governmental and quasigovernmental agencies obtain various permits licenses and certificates with respect our operations 
boem and bsee 
the development and operation oil and gas properties located the ocs the united states 
regulated primarily the boem and bsee among other requirements the boem requires lessees ocs 
properties post bonds provide other adequate financial assurance connection with the plugging and 
abandonment wells located offshore and the removal all production facilities service company are 
not subject these regulations but depend the demand for our services from the oil and gas industry and 
therefore our business affected laws and regulations well changing tax laws and policies relating the 
oil and gas industry general 
the deepwater horizon incident april resulted enhanced standards being implemented for 
companies engaged the development offshore oil and gas wells these standards are determined and 
implemented bsee the applicable standards now include notice lessees ntl ntl 
environmental ntl ntl compliance and evaluation ntl ntl significant change oil 
spill response plan worst case scenario the final drilling safety rule and rule regarding production 
measurement documents 
april bsee issued the final oil and gas and sulfur operations the outer continental shelfblowout preventer systems and well control rule wcr which updated requirements for equipment and 
operations for well control activities associated with drilling completion workover and decommissioning operations 
specifically the well control rule resulted reforms that establish the following items incorporation the 
latest industry standards that establish minimum baseline requirements for the design manufacture repair and 
maintenance blowout preventers bops additional controls over the maintenance and repair bops 
use dual shear rams deepwater bops requirement that bop systems include technology that allows the 
drill pipe centered during shearing operations more rigorous third party certification the shearing 
capability bops expanded accumulator capacity and operational capabilities for increased functionality 
real time monitoring capability for deep water and high temperature high pressure drilling activities 
establishment criteria for the testing and inspection subsea well containment equipment increased 
reporting bop failure data the bsee and the original equipment manufacturers expectations what 
constitutes safe drilling margin and allowance for alternative safe drilling margins when justified requirements 
for the use accepted engineering principles and establishment general performance criteria for drilling and 
completion equipment establishment additional requirements for using rovs function certain 
components the bop stack requirements for adequate centralization casing during cementing and 
making the testing frequency bops used workover and decommissioning operations the same drilling 
operations 
the well control rule further provides guidance for the design and operation remotely operated tools 
including the requirement that rov tooling used offshore subsea systems held the industry standards 
incorporated api first edition december bsee proposed amend the wcr reduce 
certain unnecessary regulatory burdens imposed under the existing regulations while correcting errors and 
clarifying current requirements comments were due january rule requirements can significantly 
affect our operations 
the jones act coastwise trade rules 
are also subject the coastwise merchandise statute commonly known the jones act which 
provides that only vessels built the owned citizens and crewed citizen seafarers may 
transport merchandise between points the this statute has been applied offshore oil and gas work the 
the jones act interpreted large part letter rulings the cbp the cumulative effect these letter 
rulings has been establish framework for offshore operators understand when operation can carried 
out foreign flag vessel and when must carried out coastwise qualified flag vessel 
january cbp proposed modification revocation numerous prior letter rulings regarding the 
interpretation the jones act which would have significantly changed how foreign flag vessels could operate 
the ocs under the jones act while cbp withdrew this proposal may cbp its parent agency the 
department homeland security the congress could revisit the issue through rulemaking the customs 
bulletin legislation policy change occurred along the lines proposed cbp january such new 
interpretation the jones act could adversely impact the operations non coastwise qualified vessels working 
the gulf mexico and could potentially make more difficult and costly perform our offshore services 
the area industry would undoubtedly challenge any such action the extent that seeks limit the ability noncoastwise qualified vessels from performing the operations they are currently permitted perform but such 
regulatory legislative action could create the same uncertainty the industry the january cbp proposal 
did 
other federal and state regulatory agencies 
additional proposals and proceedings before various federal and state regulatory agencies and the courts 
could affect the oil and gas industry cannot predict when whether any such proposals may become 
effective 
these regulatory developments and legislative initiatives may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels 
such oil and natural gas areas the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future 
demand for our services which may turn adversely affect our future results operations 
environmental regulation 
overview 
our operations are subject variety national including federal state and local and international laws 
and regulations governing the discharge materials into the environment otherwise relating environmental 
protection numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations implement and enforce these laws 
that are often complex costly comply with and carry substantial administrative civil and possibly criminal 
penalties for compliance failure there currently little uniformity among the regulations issued the government 
agencies both state and federal with authority over environmental regulation 
under these laws and regulations may liable for remediation removal costs damages civil 
criminal administrative penalties and other costs associated with releases hazardous materials including oil into 
the environment and that liability may imposed even the acts that resulted the releases were 
compliance with all applicable laws the time such acts were performed some the environmental laws and 
regulations that are applicable our business operations are discussed the following paragraphs but the 
discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations 
opa 
the oil pollution act amended opa imposes variety requirements offshore facility 
owners operators and the lessee permittee the area which offshore facility located well 
owners and operators bareboat charterers vessels any these entities persons can responsible 
parties and are jointly severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil 
spills threatened spills their limits liability except the limits are broken discussed below there are 
few exceptions and defenses opa including the spill results solely from the act omission certain third 
parties under specified circumstances act god act war failure comply with opa may result the 
assessment civil administrative and criminal penalties final rule published november the 
coast guard increased liability limits under opa equal the greater per gross ton for 
vessels other than tankers liability limits are higher for certain types facilities and could apply our operations 
resulted responsible party status for spill from such facility the liability limits are not applicable however 
the spill caused gross negligence willful misconduct the spill results from violation federal safety 
construction operating regulation iii party fails report spill fails cooperate fully the cleanup 
few defenses exist the liability imposed under opa 
addition opa requires owners and operators vessels over gross tons provide the coast guard 
with evidence financial responsibility cover the cost cleaning oil spills from such vessels currently 
own and operate five vessels over gross tons have provided satisfactory evidence financial 
responsibility the coast guard for all our vessels 
clean water act 
the clean water act imposes controls the discharge pollutants into the navigable waters the 
united states and imposes potential liability for the costs remediating releases petroleum and other 
substances the controls and restrictions imposed under the clean water act have become more stringent over 
time and possible that additional restrictions will imposed the future permits must obtained 
discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the clean water act also establishes the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes 
permitting program which governs discharges pollutants into navigable waters the united states pursuant 
the npdes program epa has issued vessel general permits covering discharges incidental normal vessel 
operations the current vessel general permit the vgp which became effective december 
applies commercial vessels that are least feet length the vgp requires vessel owners and 
operators adhere best management practices manage the covered discharges that occur normally the 
operation vessel including ballast water and implements various training inspection monitoring 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements well corrective actions upon identification each deficiency the 
vgp has also implemented more stringent requirements than the prior vessel general permit including 
numeric technology based effluent limitations for ballast water discharges the vgp expires 
december expect new vgp proposed this year additionally certain state regulations and the 
vgp prohibit the discharge produced waters and sand drilling fluids drill cuttings and certain other substances 
related the exploration for and production oil and natural gas into certain coastal and offshore waters 
the clean water act provides for civil criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge 
oil and other hazardous substances and imposes liability responsible parties for the costs cleaning any 
environmental contamination caused the release hazardous substance and for natural resource damages 
resulting from the release many states have laws that are analogous the clean water act and also require 
remediation releases petroleum and other hazardous substances state waters our vessels carry diesel fuel 
for their own use offshore facilities and vessels operated have facility and vessel response plans deal 
with potential spills believe that our operations comply all material respects with the requirements the 
clean water act and state statutes enacted control water pollution 
clean air act 
the supreme court has held that greenhouse gasses are air pollutant under the federal clean air 
act and thus subject regulation the epa october the epa published final rule requiring the 
reporting greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas sources the united states 
annual basis beginning for emissions occurring november the epa expanded its 
greenhouse reporting rule include onshore petroleum and natural gas production offshore petroleum and natural 
gas production onshore natural gas processing natural gas transmission underground natural gas storage 
liquefied natural gas storage liquefied natural gas import and export and natural gas distribution facilities 
reporting greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities required annual basis under this 
expanded rule 
variety regulatory developments proposals requirements and legislative initiatives that are focused 
restricting the emissions carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases have been introduced the 
domestic and international regions which operate for example congress has from time time considered 
legislation reduce greenhouse gas emissions and almost one half the states already have taken legal 
measures reduce greenhouse gas emissions primarily through the planned development greenhouse gas 
emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs more stringent regulations under the 
clean air act other similar federal state law could materially impact our business 
cercla 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla contains 
provisions requiring the remediation releases hazardous substances into the environment and imposes liability 
without regard fault the legality the original conduct certain classes persons including owners and 
operators contaminated sites where the release occurred and those companies that transport dispose 
arrange for the disposal hazardous substances released the sites under cercla those persons may 
subject joint and several liability for the costs cleaning the hazardous substances that have been released 
into the environment for damages natural resources and for the costs certain health studies third parties 
may also file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused the release hazardous 
substances 
operate foreign jurisdictions that have various types governmental laws and regulations relating 
the discharge oil hazardous substances and the protection the environment pursuant these laws and 
regulations could held liable for remediation some types pollution including the release oil 
hazardous substances and debris from production refining industrial facilities and other assets own 
operate that are owned operated our customers our subcontractors 
ocsla 
the outer continental shelf lands act amended ocsla provides the federal government with 
broad discretion regulating the production offshore resources oil and natural gas including authority 
impose safety and environmental protection requirements applicable lessees and permittees operating the 
ocs specific design and operational standards may apply ocs vessels rigs platforms vehicles and 
structures violations lease conditions regulations issued pursuant ocsla can result substantial civil and 
criminal penalties well potential court injunctions that could curtail operations and cancellation leases 
because our operations rely offshore oil and gas exploration and production the government were exercise 
its authority under ocsla restrict the availability offshore oil and gas leases such action could have material 
adverse effect our financial condition and results operations addition since august the agency has 
implemented policy guidelines ipd under which bsee will issue incidents non compliance directly 
contractors for serious violations bsee regulations however december the court appeals 
for the fifth circuit dismissed the government appeal regarding bsee notification inc civil penalty 
issued against oilfield contractor this development brings closure the long standing question whether 
bsee has authority enforce civil and criminal penalties against offshore contractors 
marpol 
the united states one approximately member countries party the international maritime 
organization imo agency the united nations which responsible for developing measures improve the 
safety and security international shipping and prevent marine pollution from ships the imo has negotiated 
the international convention for the prevention pollution from ships marpol marpol imposes 
environmental standards the shipping industry which are subject these standards relate oil spills 
management garbage the handling and disposal noxious liquids harmful substances packaged forms 
sewage and air emissions 
greenhouse gases and vessel engine emissions 
greenhouse gases and marine engine emissions are area increasing regulatory action may 
subject variety regulations from multiple regulatory bodies that are designed reduce greenhouse gases 
other particulate emissions including restrictions the types fuels used our vessels restrictions the types 
engines carbon neutralization offset measures and requirements collect and report data emissions 
and the costs attendant each these efforts 
annex marpol which addresses air emissions including emissions sulfur and nitrous oxide 
requires the use low sulfur fuels worldwide both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines vessels 
vessels worldwide are currently required use fuel with sulfur content greater than which the imo 
decided october reduce beginning january 
the the epa regulates the standards for emissions from vessel engines both its own and 
participant the imo beginning the imo designated the waters off north american emission 
control area meaning that vessels operating the united states must use fuel with sulfur content greater 
than directives have been issued designed reduce the emission nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides 
these can impact both the fuel and the engines that may used onboard vessels addition states can 
and the case california have issue rules regulating emissions from vessels operating off their coasts 
the california air resources board notified the industry that their vessel fuel regulations would not sunset due 
the implementation the imo the emissions regulations the north american emission control area but 
would continue effect marine notice 
addition foreign nations and state actors may also impose emissions restrictions the has issued 
regulations regulation that requires monitoring and reporting the emissions vessels exceeding 
gross tons that call ports with the first reports due present the regulation for monitoring 
and reporting only but anticipated that the future the may move from requiring reporting emissions 
regulations aimed reducing them 
current compliance and potential material impact 
believe that are compliance all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and 
regulations which are subject maintain robust compliance program ensure that maintain and 
update our programs meet exceed regulatory requirements the areas which operate not 
anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have material effect upon our 
capital expenditures earnings competitive position however changes environmental laws and regulations 
claims for damages persons property natural resources the environment could result substantial costs and 
liabilities and thus there can assurance that will not incur significant environmental compliance costs 
the future such environmental liability could substantially reduce our net income and could have significant 
impact our financial ability carry out our operations 
insurance matters 
our businesses involve high degree operational risk hazards such vessels sinking grounding 
colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions are inherent marine operations these hazards 
can cause personal injury loss life severe damage and destruction property and equipment pollution 
environmental damage and the suspension operations damages arising from such occurrences may result 
lawsuits asserting large claims insurance may not sufficient effective under all circumstances against all 
hazards which may subject successful claim for which are not fully insured could have material 
adverse effect our financial condition results operations and cash flows 
discussed below maintain insurance policies cover some our risk loss associated with our 
operations maintain the amount insurance believe prudent based our estimated loss potential 
however not all our business activities can insured the levels desire because either limited market 
availability unfavorable economics limited coverage considering the underlying cost 
our current insurance program valid until june 
maintain hull and increased value insurance which provides coverage for physical damage 
agreed amount for each vessel the deductibles are million the the the and the well 
enhancer and the seawell addition the primary deductibles the vessels are subject 
annual aggregate deductible million also carry protection and indemnity insurance which covers 
liabilities arising from the operation the vessels and general liability insurance which covers liabilities arising 
from construction operations the deductible both the and general liability per occurrence 
onshore employees are covered workers compensation offshore employees and marine crews are covered 
maritime employers liability mel insurance policy which covers jones act exposures and includes 
deductible per occurrence plus annual aggregate deductible addition the liability 
policies described above currently carry various layers umbrella liability for total limits million 
excess primary limits our self insured retention our medical and health benefits program for employees 
per participant 
also maintain operator extra expense coverage that provides million coverage per each 
loss occurrence for well control issue separately also maintain million liability insurance and 
million oil pollution insurance for any given oil spill event have million insurance coverage 
customarily have agreements with our customers and vendors which each contracting party 
responsible for its respective personnel under these agreements are indemnified against third party claims 
related the injury death our customers vendors personnel and vice versa with respect well work 
contracted the customer generally contractually responsible for pollution emanating from the well

circumstances against any such third party claims associated with well control events 
incur workers compensation mel and other insurance claims the normal course business which 
believe are covered insurance analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate 
liability each claim have not incurred any significant losses result claims denied our insurance 
carriers our services are provided hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage 
loss life could occur and litigation arising from such event may result our being named defendant 
lawsuits asserting large claims although there can assurance the amount insurance carry sufficient 
protect fully all events that such insurance will continue available current levels cost

item risk factors 
shareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors addition the other information 
contained herein operate globally challenging and highly competitive markets and thus our business 
subject variety risks the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing helix are 
also subject variety risks that affect many other companies generally well additional risks and 
uncertainties not known that the date this annual report believe are not significant the 
risks described below you should aware that the occurrence the events described these risk factors and 
elsewhere this annual report could have material adverse effect our business results operations and 
financial position 
our business adversely affected low oil and gas prices which occur from time time 
cyclical oil and gas industry 
our services are substantially dependent upon the condition the oil and gas industry and particular 
the willingness oil and gas companies make capital expenditures for offshore exploration development drilling 
and production operations although our services are used for other operations during the entire life cycle well 
when industry conditions are unfavorable such the current environment oil and gas companies will likely 
continue reduce their budgets for expenditures all types operations the level both capital and operating 
expenditures generally depend the prevailing view future oil and gas prices which are influenced 
numerous factors including 
worldwide economic activity 
supply and demand for oil and natural gas especially the united states europe china and india 
regional conflicts and economic and political conditions the middle east and other oil producing regions 
actions taken the organization petroleum exporting countries opec 
the availability and discovery rate new oil and natural gas reserves offshore areas 
the exploration and production onshore shale oil and natural gas 
the cost offshore exploration for and production and transportation oil and natural gas 
the level excess production capacity 
the ability oil and gas companies generate funds otherwise obtain external capital for capital 
projects and production operations 
the sale and expiration dates offshore leases the united states and overseas 
technological advances affecting energy exploration production transportation and consumption 
potential acceleration the development alternative fuels 
shifts end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use natural gas 
weather conditions and natural disasters 
environmental and other governmental regulations and 
tax laws regulations and policies 
prolonged period low level activity offshore oil and gas operators may continue adversely affect 
demand for our services and could lead even greater surplus available vessels and therefore increasingly 
downward pressure the rates can charge the market for our services the short term our customers 
reaction negative market conditions may continue seek renegotiate their contracts with lower rates 
both for existing contracts and when existing contracts expire cancel earlier work and shift later periods 
cancel their contracts with even cancellation involves their paying cancellation fee the extent the 
impact these conditions our results operations and cash flows depends the length and severity the 
current unfavorable industry environment and the potential decreased demand for our services 
the majority our current backlog concentrated small number long term contracts 
although historically our service contracts were relatively short duration over the last several years 
have been entering into longer term contracts such the five year contract with for work the gulf 
mexico the four year petrobras contracts for well intervention services offshore brazil and the seven year contract 
for the december the contract the petrobras contracts and the contract for the 
represented approximately our total backlog any cancellation termination breach these contracts 
would have larger impact our operating results and our financial condition than shorter term contracts due 
the value risk the cancellation termination unwillingness perform these contracts could have 
material adverse effect our financial position results operations and cash flows 
our current backlog for our services may not ultimately realized for various reasons and our 
contracts may terminated early 
december backlog for our services supported written agreements contracts totaled 
billion which million expected performed may incur capital costs substantial 
portion which expect recover from these contracts may charter vessels for the purpose performing 
these contracts and may forgo not seek other contracting opportunities light these contracts 
may not able perform under our contracts for various reasons addition our customers may 
seek cancel terminate suspend renegotiate our contracts the event our customers diminished demand 
for our services due industry conditions affecting our customers and their own revenues some these 
contracts provide for cancellation fee that substantially less than the expected rates from the contracts 
addition some our customers could experience liquidity issues could otherwise unable unwilling 
perform under contract which could lead customer seek repudiate cancel renegotiate the contract our 
inability the inability our customers perform under our their contractual obligations and the early 
cancellation termination our contracts our customers could have material adverse effect our financial 
position results operations and cash flows 
our inability failure perform operationally under our contracts could result reduced 
revenues contractual penalties and ultimately contract termination 
our equipment and services are very technical and the offshore environment poses its own challenges 
performing the work pursuant the terms our contracts can difficult for various reasons including 
equipment failure reduced performance human error design flaws weather currents soil conditions failure 
perform accordance with contract specifications can result reduced rates zero rates contractual 
penalties and ultimately termination the event sustained non performance for example our services and 
charter agreements with petrobras provide that petrobras can assess fines based percentage our daily 
operating rate for certain failures equipment vessels personnel which fines may deducted petrobras 
from our monthly payments and that ultimately petrobras has the right terminate should assessed penalties 
reach certain amount reduced revenues and contract termination because our failure perform 
operationally could have material adverse effect our financial position results operations and cash flows 
time chartering vessels requires make ongoing payments regardless utilization and 
revenue generation from those vessels and may own vessels with ongoing costs that cannot 
recouped the vessels are not under contract 
typically charter our rov support vessels under long term time charter agreements also have 
entered into long term charter agreements for the siem helix and siem helix vessels perform work under the 
petrobras contracts should our contracts with customers canceled terminated breached and not 
secure work for the chartered vessels are still required make charter payments making those payments 
absent revenue generation could have material adverse effect our financial position results operations and 
cash flows 
addition depending available opportunities and market conditions vessels and other assets may 
constructed for our fleet without first obtaining service contracts covering the cost those assets for example our 
vessel currently does not have any contracted backlog once constructed and service there are ongoing 
costs owning these capital assets including ongoing maintenance limited manning insurance and depreciation 
our failure secure service contracts for vessels other assets could adversely affect our financial position 
results operations and cash flows 
fleet upgrade modification repair dry dock and construction projects and customer contractual 
acceptance new vessels and equipment are subject risks including delays cost overruns and failure 
commence maintain contracts 
the shipyard scope for the our newbuild semi submersible well intervention vessel complete and 
currently equipment being manufactured and installed for the completion the vessel from time time 
construct make capital improvements other pieces equipment such the irs that jointly 
constructed with onesubsea addition incur significant upgrade modification refurbishment repair and dry 
dock expenditures our existing fleet from time time while some these projects are planned some are 
unplanned additionally vessels and equipment age they are more likely subject higher maintenance 
and repair activities these projects are subject risks delay cost overruns inherent any large capital 
project resulting from numerous factors including 
shortages equipment materials skilled labor 
unscheduled delays the delivery ordered materials and equipment 
unanticipated increases the cost equipment labor and raw materials particularly steel 
weather interferences 
difficulties obtaining necessary permits meeting permit conditions 
design and engineering problems 
political social and economic instability war and civil disturbances 
delays customs clearance critical parts equipment 
financial other difficulties failures shipyards and suppliers 
disputes with shipyards and suppliers and 
work stoppages and other labor disputes 
the estimated capital expenditures for vessel and equipment construction upgrade modification 
refurbishment and dry dock projects could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures moreover our 
assets undergoing upgrades modifications refurbishment repair may not earn day rate during the period they 
are out service any significant period unplanned maintenance and repairs related our vessels and other 
income producing assets could have material adverse effect our financial position results operations and 
cash flows 
addition delays the delivery vessels and other operating assets being constructed undergoing 
upgrades modifications refurbishment repair dry docks may result delay customer acceptance and 
contract commencement resulting loss revenue and cash flow and may cause our customers seek 
terminate shorten the terms their contracts with and seek delay damages under applicable late 
delivery clauses the event termination contract due late delivery may not able secure 
replacement contract favorable terms all 
sustained period unfavorable industry conditions could jeopardize our customers and other 
counterparties ability perform their obligations 
continued uncertain industry conditions could jeopardize the ability certain our counterparties 
including our customers insurers and financial institutions perform their obligations although assess the 
creditworthiness our counterparties prolonged period difficult industry conditions could lead changes 
counterparty liquidity and increase our exposure credit risk and bad debts particular our robotics business 
unit tends business with smaller customers that may not capitalized the same extent larger operators 
addition may offer extended payment terms our customers order secure contracts these 
circumstances may lead more frequent collection issues our financial results and liquidity could adversely 
affected and could incur losses 
because have certain capital debt and other obligations prolonged period low demand and 
rates for our services could eventually lead material adverse effect our liquidity 
although continue seek reduce the level our capital and other expenses and have raised capital 
means several equity offerings the event more prolonged period the current industry environment 
the failure our customers expend funds our services longer period lower rates for our services 
coupled with certain fixed obligations that have related debt repayment capital commitments long term time 
charter contracts for our vessels and certain other commitments related ongoing operational activities could 
eventually lead material adverse effect our liquidity and financial position 
may not able compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the oilfield services business which operate highly competitive oversupply offshore drilling 
rigs coupled with significant slowdown industry activities results increased competition from drilling rigs 
well substantially lower rates work that being performed several our competitors are substantially larger 
and have greater financial and other resources better withstand prolonged period difficult industry conditions 
order compete for customers these larger competitors may undercut substantially reducing rates 
levels are unable withstand other companies relocate acquire assets for operations the regions 
which operate levels competition may increase further and our business could adversely affected 
our indebtedness and the terms our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our 
ability fulfill our debt obligations 
december had million consolidated indebtedness outstanding the level 
indebtedness may have adverse effect our future operations including 
limiting our ability refinance maturing debt obtain additional financing satisfactory terms fund 
our working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service 
requirements and other general corporate requirements 
increasing our vulnerability continued general economic downturn competition and industry conditions 
which could place disadvantage compared our competitors that are less leveraged 
increasing our exposure potential rising interest rates because portion our current and potential 
future borrowings are variable interest rates 
reducing the availability our cash flows fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures 
acquisitions investments and other general corporate requirements because will required use 
substantial portion our cash flows service debt obligations 
limiting our flexibility planning for reacting changes our business and the industry which 
operate and 
limiting our ability expand our business through capital expenditures pursuit acquisition 
opportunities due negative covenants senior secured credit facilities that place annual and aggregate 
limitations the types and amounts investments that may make and limit our ability use proceeds 
from asset sales for purposes other than debt repayment except certain circumstances where proceeds 
may reinvested under criteria set forth our credit agreements 
prolonged period weak economic conditions and other events beyond our control may make 
increasingly difficult comply with our covenants and other restrictions agreements governing our debt fail 
comply with these covenants and other restrictions could lead reduced liquidity event default the 
possible acceleration our repayment outstanding debt and the exercise certain remedies the lenders 
including foreclosure against our collateral these conditions and events may limit our access the credit markets 
need replace our existing debt which could lead increased costs and less favorable terms including 
shorter repayment schedules and higher fees and interest rates 
lack access the financial markets could negatively impact our ability operate our business 
and execute our strategy 
access financing may limited and uncertain especially times economic weakness capital and 
credit markets are limited may unable refinance may incur increased costs and less favorable terms 
associated with any refinancing our maturing debt also may incur increased costs and less favorable terms 
associated with any additional financing may require for future operations limited access the financial 
markets could adversely impact our ability take advantage business opportunities react changing 
economic and business conditions additionally capital and credit markets are limited this could potentially result 
our customers curtailing their capital and operating expenditure programs which could result decrease 
demand for our vessels and reduction fees and utilization addition certain our customers could 
experience inability pay suppliers including the event they are unable access financial markets 
needed fund their operations likewise our suppliers may unable sustain their current level operations 
fulfill their commitments and fund future operations and obligations each which could adversely affect our 
operations continued lower levels economic activity and weakness the financial markets could also adversely 
affect our ability implement our strategic objectives and dispose non core business assets 
our forward looking statements assume that our lenders insurers and other financial institutions will 
able fulfill their obligations under our various credit agreements insurance policies and contracts any our 
significant financial institutions were unable perform under these agreements and were unable find 
suitable replacements reasonable cost our financial position results operations liquidity and cash flows 
could adversely impacted 
further decline the offshore energy services market could result additional impairment 
charges 
december recorded goodwill impairment charge million related our robotics 
reporting unit december recorded asset impairment charges million related our previously 
owned helix vessel million related our vessel and million related certain capitalized 
vessel project costs also recognized goodwill impairment charge million related our well 
intervention reporting unit well losses totaling million primarily reflecting our share impairment 
charges that deepwater gateway and independence hub recorded december prolonged periods low 
utilization and day rates could result the recognition additional impairment charges for our vessels and robotics 
assets future cash flow estimates based information available the time indicate that their carrying 
value may not recoverable may also record additional impairment losses the future 
our north sea business typically declines winter and bad weather the gulf mexico north 
sea can adversely affect our operations 
marine operations conducted the north sea are seasonal and depend part weather conditions 
historically have enjoyed our highest north sea vessel utilization rates during the summer and fall when 
weather conditions are favorable for offshore operations typically have experienced our lowest utilization rates 
the north sea the first quarter common the industry may bear the risk delays caused some 
adverse weather conditions accordingly our results any one quarter are not necessarily indicative annual 
results continuing trends 
certain areas and near the gulf mexico and north sea experience unfavorable weather conditions 
including hurricanes and extreme storms relatively frequent basis substantially all our facilities and assets 
offshore and along the gulf mexico and the north sea are susceptible damage and total loss these 
storms damage caused high winds and turbulent seas could potentially cause curtail service operations 
for significant periods time until damage can assessed and repaired moreover even not experience 
direct damage from any these weather events may experience disruptions our operations because 
customers may curtail their offshore activities due damage their platforms pipelines and other related facilities 
the operation marine vessels risky and not have insurance coverage for all risks 
vessel based offshore services involve high degree operational risk hazards such vessels 
sinking grounding colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions are inherent marine 
operations these hazards can cause personal injury loss life severe damage and destruction property 
and equipment pollution environmental damage and suspension operations damage arising from such 
occurrences may result lawsuits asserting large claims insurance may not sufficient effective under all 
circumstances against all hazards which may subject successful liability claim for which are not 
fully insured could have material adverse effect our financial condition moreover cannot make 
assurances that will able maintain adequate insurance the future rates that consider reasonable 
some instances certain insurance could become unavailable available only for reduced amounts coverage 
for example insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due war risk and terrorist acts and 
limitations for wind storm damages the current insurance our vessels amounts approximating replacement 
value the event property loss due catastrophic marine disaster mechanical failure collision other 
event insurance may not cover substantial loss revenue increased costs and other liabilities and therefore the 
loss any our assets could have material adverse effect 
our customers may unable unwilling indemnify 
consistent with standard industry practice typically obtain contractual indemnification from our 
customers whereby they agree protect and indemnify for liabilities resulting from various hazards associated 
with offshore operations can provide assurance however that our customers will willing financially 
able meet these indemnification obligations 
enhanced regulations for deepwater offshore drilling may reduce the need for our services 
exploration and development activities and the production and sale oil and natural gas are subject 
extensive federal state local and international regulations conduct deepwater drilling the gulf 
mexico operator required comply with existing and newly developed regulations and enhanced safety 
standards before drilling may commence the bsee conducts many inspections deepwater drilling operations 
for compliance with its regulations including the testing blowout preventers operators also are required 
comply with the safety and environmental management system regulations sems within the deadlines specified 
the regulations and ensure that their contractors have sems compliant safety and environmental policies and 
procedures additionally each operator must demonstrate that has containment resources that are available 
promptly the event deepwater blowout regardless the company operator involved expected that 
the boem and the bsee will continue issue further regulations regarding deepwater offshore drilling our 
business significant portion which the gulf mexico provides development services newly drilled 
wells and therefore relies heavily the industry drilling new oil and gas wells the issuance permits 
significantly delayed other oil and gas operations are delayed reduced due increased costs complying 
with regulations demand for our services the gulf mexico may also decline moreover our assets are not 
redeployed other locations where can provide our services profitable rate our business financial 
condition results operations and cash flows would materially adversely affected 
cannot predict with any certainty the substance effect any new additional regulations the 
united states other areas around the world the united states other countries where our customers 
operate enact stricter restrictions offshore drilling further regulate offshore drilling and thereby increase costs 
and cause delays for our customers and this results decreased demand for profitability our services our 
business financial condition results operations and cash flows could materially adversely affected 
government regulations may affect our business operations 
our business affected changes public policy and federal state local and foreign laws and 
regulations relating the offshore oil and gas industry offshore oil and gas operations are affected tax 
environmental safety labor cabotage and other laws changes those laws application interpretation 
existing laws and changes related administrative regulations enforcement priorities also possible that 
these laws and regulations may the future add significantly our operating costs those our customers 
otherwise directly indirectly affect our operations for instance january cbp proposed modification 
revocation numerous prior letter rulings regarding the interpretation the jones act which would have 
significantly changed how foreign flag vessels could operate the ocs under the jones act while cbp withdrew 
this proposal may cbp its parent agency the department homeland security the congress 
could revisit the issue policy change occurred along the lines proposed cbp january such new 
interpretation the jones act could adversely impact the operations non coastwise qualified vessels working 
the gulf mexico and could potentially make more difficult and costly perform our offshore services 
the area industry would undoubtedly challenge any such action the extent that seeks limit the ability noncoastwise qualified vessels from performing the operations they are currently permitted perform but such 
regulatory legislative action could create the same uncertainty the industry the january cbp proposal 
did 
tax laws are dynamic and subject change new laws are passed and new interpretations the law are 
issued applied the united states recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions the new law 
may adversely affect addition risks substantial costs and liabilities related environmental compliance 
issues are inherent our operations our operations are subject extensive federal state local and foreign laws 
and regulations relating the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge materials 
into the environment permits are required for the operations various facilities and those permits are subject 
revocation modification and renewal government authorities have the power enforce compliance with their 
regulations and violations are subject fines injunctions both some cases those governmental 
requirements can impose liability for the entire cost cleanup any responsible party without regard 
negligence fault and impose liability for the conduct others conditions others have caused for our 
acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed them possible that other 
developments such stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages property persons 
resulting from our operations would result substantial costs and liabilities our insurance policies and the 
contractual indemnity protection seek obtain from our customers may not sufficient effective protect 
under all circumstances against all risk involving compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
failure comply with anti bribery laws could have material adverse impact our business 
the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar anti bribery laws other jurisdictions

business operate many parts the world that have experienced governmental corruption some degree 
have robust ethics and compliance program that designed deter detect violations applicable laws 
and regulations through the application our anti corruption policies and procedures code business conduct 
and ethics training internal controls investigation and remediation activities and other measures however our 
ethics and compliance program may not fully effective preventing all employees contractors intermediaries 
from violating circumventing our compliance requirements applicable laws and regulations failure comply 
with anti bribery laws could subject civil and criminal penalties and such failure and some instances even 
the mere allegation such failure could create termination other rights connection with our existing contracts 
negatively impact our ability obtain future work lead other sanctions all which could have material 
adverse effect our business financial position results operations and cash flows and cause reputational

executive summary 
our strategy 
are international offshore energy services company that provides specialty services the offshore 
energy industry with focus well intervention and robotics operations believe that focusing these 
services will deliver favorable long term financial returns from time time make strategic investments that 
expand our service capabilities add capacity existing services our key operating regions our well 
intervention fleet expanded following the delivery the siem helix chartered vessel february and 
expected further expand following the completion and delivery the newbuild semi submersible 
vessel chartering newer vessels with additional capabilities including the grand canyon iii 
chartered vessel that went into service for may should enable our robotics business better serve the 
needs our customers from longer term perspective also expect benefit from our fixed fee agreement for 
the dynamically positioned floating production vessel that processes production from the phoenix field for 
the field operator until least june 
january helix onesubsea llc onesubsea schlumberger technology corporation 
schlumberger and schlumberger oilfield holdings ltd entered into strategic alliance agreement and related 
agreements for the parties strategic alliance design develop manufacture promote market and sell global 
basis integrated equipment and services for subsea well intervention the alliance expected leverage the 
parties capabilities provide unique fully integrated offering clients combining marine support with well 
access and control technologies april and onesubsea agreed jointly develop and ordered 
irs for total cost approximately million approximately million for our interest december 
our total investment the irs was million inclusive capitalized interest the irs was 
completed and placed service january october and onesubsea launched the development 
our first riserless open water abandonment module roam for estimated cost approximately million

economic outlook and industry influences 
demand for our services primarily influenced the condition the oil and gas industry and particular 
the willingness oil and gas companies spend operational activities well capital projects the 
performance our business also largely dependent the prevailing market prices for oil and natural gas which 
are impacted domestic and global economic conditions hydrocarbon production and capacity geopolitical 
issues weather and several other factors including 
worldwide economic activity including available access global capital and capital markets 
supply and demand for oil and natural gas especially the united states europe china and india 
regional conflicts and economic and political conditions the middle east and other oil producing regions 
actions taken opec 
the availability and discovery rate new oil and natural gas reserves offshore areas 
the exploration and production onshore shale oil and natural gas 
the cost offshore exploration for and production and transportation oil and natural gas 
the level excess production capacity 
the ability oil and gas companies generate funds otherwise obtain external capital for capital 
projects and production operations 
the sale and expiration dates offshore leases the united states and overseas 
technological advances affecting energy exploration production transportation and consumption 
potential acceleration the development alternative fuels 
shifts end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use natural gas 
weather conditions and natural disasters 
environmental and other governmental regulations and 
domestic and international tax laws regulations and policies 
oil prices have gradually risen above per barrel fueled opec led production cuts and increased 
demand for commodities global economic conditions continue improve have started see uptick 
oil and gas exploration and production activities evidenced increase the global rig count however 
prolonged oversupply partially attributable increased shale oil production expected constrain oil prices 
least the near term the resulting weak industry environment may continue curtail investments offshore 
exploration and production well other offshore operational activities increased competition for limited 
offshore oil and gas projects has driven down rates that drilling rig contractors are charging for their services which 
affects drilling rigs historically have been the asset class used for intervention work this rig overhang 
combined with lower volumes work may affect the utilization and rates can achieve for our assets 
addition the current volatile and uncertain macroeconomic conditions some countries around the world such 
brazil and the following brexit may have direct and indirect impact our existing contracts and 
contracting opportunities and may introduce further currency volatility into our operations and financial results 
the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act the tax act may also introduce uncertainty terms 
capital spending oil and gas companies 
many oil and gas companies are increasingly focusing optimizing production their existing subsea 
wells believe that have competitive advantage terms performing well intervention services efficiently 
furthermore believe that when oil and gas companies begin increase overall spending levels will likely 
for production enhancement activities rather than for exploration projects our well intervention and robotics 
operations are intended service the life span oil and gas field well provide abandonment services 
the end the life field required governmental regulations thus over the longer term believe that 
fundamentals for our business remain favorable the need for prolongation well life oil and gas production 
the primary driver demand for our services 
our current strategy positioned for future recovery while coping with sustained period weak 
activity this strategy based the following factors the need extend the life subsea wells significant 
the commercial viability the wells plug and abandonment costs are considered our services offer 
commercially viable alternatives for reducing the finding and development costs reserves compared new 
drilling well extending and enhancing the commercial life subsea wells and past cycles well 
intervention and workover have been some the first activities recover and prolonged market downturn are 
important the commercial viability deepwater wells 
business activity summary 
have enhanced our financial position and strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from the sale 
certain non core business assets which together with net proceeds from our equity offerings and early 
well liquidity under our revolving credit facility has allowed strategically focus our core well 
intervention and robotics businesses our non core business asset dispositions since primarily included the

addition servicing the oil and gas market our robotics operations are contracted for the development 
renewable energy projects wind farms december our consolidated backlog that supported 
written agreements contracts totaled billion which million expected performed the 
substantial majority our backlog associated with our well intervention business segment december 
our well intervention backlog was billion including million expected performed our

critical accounting estimates and policies 
our results operations and financial condition reflected the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements and related footnotes are prepared conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the 
united states such are required make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the

revenues and expenses during the periods presented base our estimates historical experience available 
information and various other assumptions believe reasonable under the circumstances these estimates 
may change new events occur more experience acquired additional information obtained and our 
operating environment changes believe that the most critical accounting policies this regard are those 
described below while these issues require make judgments that are somewhat subjective they are 
generally based significant amount historical data and current market data see note for detailed 
discussion the application our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our services are derived from contracts which are both short term and long term 
duration our services contracts generally contain either lump sum provisions provisions for specific time 
material and equipment charges that are billed accordance with the terms such contracts recognize 
revenue earned estimated collectible amounts further record revenues net taxes collected from 
customers and remitted governmental authorities 
the majority our contracts contain provisions for specific time material and equipment charges 
revenues generated from these contracts are generally earned dayrate basis and recognized amounts are 
earned accordance with contract terms similarly revenues from contracts that stipulate monthly rate are 
recognized ratably during the month certain dayrate contracts with built rate changes require record 
revenues straight line basis may receive revenues for mobilization equipment and personnel under 
dayrate contracts revenues related mobilization are deferred and recognized over the period which 
contracted services are performed using the straight line method incremental costs incurred directly for 
mobilization equipment and personnel the contracted site which typically consist materials supplies and 
transit costs also are deferred and recognized using the same straight line method our policy amortize the 
revenues and costs related mobilization straight line basis over the estimated contract service period 
consistent with the general pace activity level services being provided and dayrates being earned over the 
contract period mobilization costs move vessels when contract does not exist are expensed incurred 
revenues significant lump sum contracts are generally recognized under the percentage completion 
method under the percentage completion method recognize estimated contract revenue based costs 
incurred date percentage total estimated costs changes the expected cost materials and labor 
productivity scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs additionally weather and other external 
factors outside our control may affect the progress and estimated cost project completion and therefore 
the timing revenue recognition routinely review estimates related our contracts and reflect revisions 
profitability earnings current basis current estimate total contract cost indicates ultimate loss 
contract recognize the projected loss full when first determined recognize additional contract 
revenue related claims when the claim probable and legally enforceable 
property and equipment 
property and equipment recorded cost depreciation expense derived primarily using the straightline method over the estimated useful life asset 
assets used operations are evaluated for impairment indicators whenever changes facts and 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount the asset asset group may not recoverable and may 
exceed its fair value our marine vessels are assessed vessel vessel basis while our robotics assets are 
grouped and assessed asset class the expected future cash flows used for the assessment recoverability 
are based judgmental assessments operating costs project margins and capital project decisions considering 
all available information the date review because there usually lack quoted market prices for long lived 
assets the fair value impaired assets typically determined based the present values expected future cash 
flows using discount rates believed consistent with those used principal market participants based 
multiple operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions similar assets where possible 
impairment has occurred recognize loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value 
the asset 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are based the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases 
assets and liabilities utilize the liability method computing deferred income taxes the liability method 
based the amount current and future taxes payable using tax rates and laws effect the balance sheet 
date income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates the countries which operations are 
conducted and income earned valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded when more likely 
than not that some all the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not realized 
december had accumulated undistributed earnings generated our non 
subsidiaries without operations the approximately million all which was subject the one time 
transition tax foreign earnings required the tax act enacted december has otherwise been 
previously taxed intend indefinitely reinvest these earnings well future earnings from our non 
subsidiaries without operations the fund our international operations and foreign credit facility 
addition expect future cash generation will sufficient meet future cash needs 
our policy provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon 
management assessment whether tax benefit more likely than not sustained upon examination tax 
authorities the extent prevail matters for which liability for unrecognized tax benefit established 
are required pay amounts excess the liability our effective tax rate given financial statement period may

derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our risk management activities involve the use derivative financial instruments hedge the impact 
market risk exposure related variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates reduce the impact 
these risks earnings and increase the predictability our cash flows from time time have entered into

economics our life field services are segregated into three reportable business segments well intervention 
robotics and production facilities note 
our well intervention segment includes our vessels and equipment used perform well intervention 
services primarily the gulf mexico north sea and brazil our well intervention segment also includes 
intervention riser systems irss some which rent out stand alone basis and subsea intervention

note summary significant accounting policies 
principles consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts majority owned subsidiaries the equity 
method used account for investments affiliates which not have majority ownership but have the 
ability exert significant influence account for our former ownership interest deepwater gateway 
deepwater gateway and our ownership interest independence hub under the equity method accounting 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
basis presentation 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles gaap and reported dollars certain reclassifications were made previously 
reported amounts the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto make them consistent with the 
current presentation format have made all adjustments which were normal recurring adjustments that 
believe are necessary for fair presentation our consolidated financial statements applicable 
use estimates 
the preparation financial statements conformity with gaap requires management make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities and disclosures contingent 
assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities three months 
less they are carried cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts 
accounts and notes receivable are stated the historical carrying amount net write offs and allowance 
for uncollectible accounts establish allowance for uncollectible accounts based historical experience 
well any specific collection issues that have identified uncollectible receivables are written off when 
settlement reached for amount that less than the outstanding historical balance when have 
determined that the balance will definitively not collected note 
property and equipment 
property and equipment recorded historical cost property and equipment depreciated straight 
line basis over the estimated useful life each asset the cost improvements capitalized while the cost 
repairs and maintenance charged expense incurred for the years ended december and 
repair and maintenance expense totaled million million and million respectively 
assets used operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes facts and circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount asset asset group may not recoverable because such carrying amount 
may exceed the asset asset group fair value upon review the sum undiscounted future cash flows 
expected generated the asset asset group less than its carrying amount impairment recorded 
the amount the impairment recorded calculated the difference between the carrying amount the asset 
asset group and its estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes the lowest level 
where there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent the cash flows other groups assets 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based 
assessments operating costs project margins and capital project decisions considering all available information 
the date review the fair value impaired assets typically determined based the present values 
expected future cash flows using discount rates believed consistent with those used principal market 
participants based multiple operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions similar 
assets where possible these fair value measurements fall within level the fair value hierarchy 
assets are classified held for sale when formal plan dispose the assets exists and those assets 
meet the held for sale criteria assets held for sale are reviewed for potential loss sale when commit 
plan sell and thereafter while those assets are held for sale losses are measured the difference between 
asset fair value less costs sell and the asset carrying amount estimates anticipated sales prices are 
judgmental and subject revision future periods although initial estimates are typically based sales prices for 
similar assets and other valuation data 
capitalized interest 
interest from external borrowings capitalized major projects until the assets are ready for their 
intended use capitalized interest added the cost the underlying asset and amortized over the useful life 
the asset the same manner the underlying asset capitalized interest excluded from our interest expense 
note 
equity investments 
periodically review our equity investments for impairment under the equity method accounting 
impairment loss would recorded whenever the fair value equity investment determined below its 
carrying amount and the reduction considered other than temporary judging other than temporary 
consider the length time and extent which the fair value the investment has been less than the carrying 
amount the equity investment the near term and long term operating and financial prospects the entity and 
our longer term intent retaining our investment the entity 
the event incur losses excess the carrying amount equity investment and reduce our 
investment balance zero would not record additional losses unless guaranteed obligations the 
investee are otherwise committed provide further financial support for the investee iii anticipated 
that the investee return profitability imminent provided commitment fund losses would 
continue record losses resulting negative equity method investment which presented liability 
goodwill 
goodwill impairment evaluated using two step process the first step involves comparing reporting 
unit fair value with its carrying amount the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second 
step performed comparing the implied fair value goodwill with the reporting unit carrying amount 
goodwill the carrying amount goodwill exceeds the implied fair value impairment loss recognized 
amount equal that excess 
previously performed impairment analysis goodwill least annually november more 
frequently whenever events circumstances occur indicating that might impaired result our 
goodwill impairment analysis recorded impairment charge million write off the goodwill 
associated with our well intervention reporting unit result our goodwill impairment analysis 
recorded impairment charge million write off the entire goodwill balance our robotics reporting unit 
had goodwill remaining our consolidated balance sheets december and 
recertification costs and deferred dry dock costs 
our vessels are required regulation periodically recertified recertification costs are incurred while 
vessel dry dock addition routine repairs and maintenance are performed and times major 
replacements and improvements are performed expense routine repairs and maintenance costs they are 
incurred defer and amortize dry dock and related recertification costs over the length time for which 
expect receive benefits from the dry dock and related recertification which generally months but can 
long months the appropriate permitting obtained dry dock and related recertification process typically 
lasts one two months period during which the vessel idle and generally not available earn revenue major 
replacements and improvements that extend the vessel economic useful life functional operating capability are 
capitalized and depreciated over the vessel remaining economic useful life 
december and capitalized deferred dry dock costs included within other assets net 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets note totaled million and million net 
accumulated amortization million and million respectively during the years ended december 
and dry dock amortization expense was million million and million respectively 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our services are derived from contracts which are both short term and long term 
duration our services contracts generally contain either lump sum provisions provisions for specific time 
material and equipment charges that are billed accordance with the terms such contracts recognize 
revenue earned estimated collectible amounts further record revenues net taxes collected from 
customers and remitted governmental authorities 
unbilled revenue represents revenue attributable work completed prior period end that has not yet 
been invoiced all amounts included unbilled revenue are expected billed and collected within one year 
monitor the collectability our outstanding trade receivables continual basis connection with our 
evaluation allowance for doubtful accounts 
dayrate contracts revenues generated from specific time material and equipment contracts are 
generally earned dayrate basis and recognized amounts are earned accordance with contract terms

revenues for mobilization equipment and personnel under dayrate contracts revenues related mobilization 
are deferred and recognized over the period which contracted services are performed using the straight line 
method incremental costs incurred directly for mobilization equipment and personnel the contracted site 
which typically consist materials supplies and transit costs also are deferred and recognized using the same 
straight line method mobilization costs move vessels when contract does not exist are expensed incurred 
lump sum contracts revenues significant lump sum contracts are generally recognized under the 
percentage completion method under the percentage completion method recognize estimated contract

fair value measurements 
fair value defined the price that would received sell asset paid transfer liability 
orderly transaction between market participants the measurement date the fair value accounting rules establish 
three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used measuring fair value follows 
level observable inputs such quoted prices active markets 
level inputs other than the quoted prices active markets that are observable either directly 
indirectly and 
level unobservable inputs for which there little market data which require the reporting entity 
develop its own assumptions 
assets and liabilities measured fair value are based one more three valuation approaches 
described note
