sweden and taiwan addition each these locations other than sweden employ staff field applications engineers provide direct 
engineering support locally our customers 
our sales cycles typically require significant investment time and substantial expenditure resources before can realize revenue from the 
sale our solutions any our typical sales cycle consists multi month sales and development process involving our customers system designers and 
management and our sales personnel and software engineers successful this process culminates customer decision use our solutions its system 
which refer design win our sales efforts are typically directed the oem the product that will incorporate our video and image processing 
solution but the eventual design and incorporation our soc into the product may handled odm behalf the oem volume production may 
begin within six months after design win depending the complexity our customer product and other factors upon which may have little 
influence once our solutions have been incorporated into customer design they are likely used for the life cycle the customer product 
conversely design loss competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for future revenue from such customer product 
the end markets into which sell our products have seen significant changes consumer preferences have evolved response new 
technologies result the composition our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods technology consumer preference changes for 
example fiscal year pocket video revenue represented approximately total revenue the proliferation smartphones and their ability 
capture high quality video and still images significantly impacted this market decreasing pocket video cameras contribution approximately zero percent 
total revenue fiscal year conversely our total revenue the fiscal years was primarily derived from markets for specialized video and 
image capture devices such the wearable camera market the security camera market the automotive aftermarket and the uav camera market expect 
shifts consumer use video capture continue change over time more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues proliferate 
our sales are generally made pursuant purchase orders received approximately four weeks prior the scheduled product delivery date 
depending upon agreed terms with our customers and the current manufacturing lead time the time the purchase order received these purchase orders 
may cancelled without charge upon notification within agreed period time advance the delivery date which may short days due 
the scheduling requirements our foundry assembly and test contractors generally provide our contractors with our production forecasts and place firm 
orders for products with our suppliers weeks prior the anticipated delivery date usually without purchase order from our own customers our 
standard warranty provides that our socs containing defects materials workmanship performance may returned for refund the purchase price 
for replacement our discretion 
manufacturing 
employ fabless business model and use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors manufacture assemble and test our solutions 
this outsourced manufacturing approach allows focus our resources the design sales and marketing our solutions and avoid the cost associated 
with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility our engineers work closely with foundries and other contractors increase yields lower 
manufacturing costs and improve quality addition believe outsourcing many our manufacturing and assembly activities provides the flexibility 
needed respond new market opportunities simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements not have guaranteed 
level production capacity from any our suppliers facilities produce our solutions carefully qualify each our suppliers and their subcontractors 
and processes order meet the extremely high quality and reliability standards required our solutions 
backlog 
our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery products our manufacturing production based estimates and 
advance non binding commitments from customers future purchases follow industry practice that allows customers cancel change defer orders 
with limited advance notice prior shipment given this practice not believe that backlog reliable indicator future revenue levels

competition 
the global semiconductor market general and the video and image processing markets particular are highly competitive expect 
competition increase and intensify more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets and enter new markets increased competition 
could result price pressure reduced profitability and loss market share any which could materially and adversely affect our business revenue and 
operating results 
our competitors range from large international companies offering wide range semiconductor products smaller companies specializing 
narrow markets the wearable sports camera market our primary competitors are vertically integrated divisions camera device oems including sony

competitors the uav camera market include hisilicon intel nvidia corporation and qualcomm our primary competitors the infrastructure market 
include intel magnum semiconductor inc and texas instruments certain our customers and suppliers also have divisions that produce products 
competitive with ours expect competition our current markets increase the future existing competitors improve expand their product 
offerings and potential new competitors enter these markets 
our ability compete successfully depends elements both within and outside our control including industry and general economic trends 
many our competitors are substantially larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more 
established than are and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them develop and enable new 
technology into product solutions better faster than and better withstand adverse economic market conditions the future 
our ability compete successfully the rapidly evolving video market depends several factors including 
the design and manufacturing new solutions including software that anticipate the video processing and integration needs our 
customers next generation products and applications 
performance measured video and still picture image quality resolution and frame processing rates 
power consumption 
the ease implementation customers 
the strength customer relationships 
the selection the foundry process technology and architecture tradeoffs meet customers product requirements timely manner 
reputation and reliability

the trading price our ordinary shares could decline and you could lose part all your investment 
risks related our business and our industry 
our customers not design our solutions into their product offerings our customers product offerings are not commercially successful our 
business would suffer 
sell our video and image processing system chip soc solutions original equipment manufacturers oems who include our socs 
their products and original design manufacturers odms who include our socs the products that they supply oems refer odms our 
customers and oems our end customers except otherwise indicated the context otherwise requires our video and image processing socs are 
generally incorporated into our customers products the design stage which referred design win result rely oems design our 
solutions into the products that they design and sell without these design wins our business would significantly harmed often incur significant 
expenditures developing new soc solution without any assurance that oem will select our solution for design into its own product once oem 
designs competitor device into its product becomes significantly more difficult for sell our soc solutions that oem because changing suppliers 
involves significant cost time effort and risk for the oem 
even oem designs one our soc solutions into its product cannot assured that the oem product will commercially successful over 
time all for example higher than normal customer inventory levels gopro inc gopro significantly impacted our revenue the fiscal quarter 
ended january and the first half fiscal year and expect that similar high inventory levels gopro will negatively impact our revenue 
the first half our fiscal year not control our customers purchasing decisions inventory levels relating our socs this could occur 
again other products other product categories incorporating our soc solutions are not commercially successful experience rapid decline our revenue 
and business will suffer 
similarly even oem designs one our soc solutions into its product are not assured that will receive continue receive new design 
wins from that oem for example believe that gopro our largest oem customer will use competing solution one its mainstream cameras its 
next product release cycle which would have significant negative impact our revenue fiscal year and beyond fiscal year the revenues 
for direct shipments gopro accounted for approximately our total revenue estimated that the revenues for shipments gopro various odms 
represented additional approximately our total revenue fiscal year anticipate that revenue from gopro will represent significantly 
smaller percentage our total revenue fiscal year and beyond 
depend limited number customers and end customers for significant portion our revenue fail retain expand our customer 
relationships our revenue could decline 
derive significant portion our revenue from limited number odms who build products behalf limited number oems and from 
limited number oems whom ship directly anticipate that this customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future fiscal years 
and sales directly and through our logistics providers our five largest odm and oem customers collectively accounted for 
approximately and our total revenue respectively fiscal years and sales our ten largest odm and oem customers 
collectively accounted for approximately and our total revenue respectively believe that our operating results for the foreseeable 
future will continue depend sales relatively small number customers and end customers the future these customers may decide not 
purchase our soc solutions all may purchase fewer solutions than they did the past may alter their purchasing patterns substantially all our 
sales date have been made purchase order basis these customers may cancel change delay product purchase commitments with little notice 
and without penalty and may make our revenue volatile from period period for example believe that gopro will use competing solution one 
its mainstream cameras its next product release cycle which would have significant negative impact our revenue fiscal year and beyond 
the loss significant customer substantial reduction purchases significant customer could happen again any time and without notice and 
such loss would likely harm our financial condition and results operations 
addition our relationships with some customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our solutions 
attract new customers retain existing customers may have offer these customers favorable prices our solutions that event our average 
selling prices and gross margins would decline the loss key customer reduction sales any key customer our inability attract new customers 
could seriously impact our revenue and harm our results operations 
our customers may cancel their orders change production quantities delay production fail accurately forecast demand for our solutions 
revenue shortfalls excess obsolete insufficient inventory could result 
our customers typically not provide with firm long term purchase commitments substantially all our sales are made purchase order 
basis which permits our customers cancel change delay their product purchase commitments with little notice and without penalty them 
because production lead times often exceed the amount time required our customers fill their orders often must build socs advance orders 
relying imperfect demand forecast project volumes and product mix 
our socs are incorporated into products manufactured for our end customers and result demand for our solutions influenced the 
demand for our customers products our ability accurately forecast demand can adversely affected number factors including inaccurate 
forecasting our customers miscalculations our customers their inventory requirements changes market conditions adverse changes our 
product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers products for example higher than normal customer inventory levels gopro significantly 
impacted our revenue the fiscal quarter ended january and the first half fiscal year and expect that similar high inventory levels 
gopro will negatively impact our revenue the first half our fiscal year not control our customers purchasing decisions inventory 
levels relating our socs this could occur again even after order received our customers may cancel these orders request decrease production 
quantities request delay the delivery our solutions any such cancellation decrease delay subjects number risks most notably that our 
projected sales will not materialize schedule all leading unanticipated revenue shortfalls and excess obsolete inventory that may unable 
sell other customers 
alternatively are unable project customer requirements accurately may not build enough socs which could lead delays product 
shipments and lost sales opportunities the near term well force our customers identify alternative sources which could affect our ongoing 
relationships with these customers have the past had customers significantly increase their requested production quantities with little advance 
notice not fulfill customer demands timely manner our customers may cancel their orders and may subject customer claims for cost 
replacement addition the rapid pace innovation our industry could render portions our inventory obsolete excess obsolete inventory levels 
could result unexpected expenses increases our reserves that could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 
addition any significant future cancellations deferrals product orders could harm our margins increase our write offs due product obsolescence and 
restrict our ability fund our operations 
our target markets may not grow develop currently expect and are subject market risks any which could harm our business revenue 
and operating results 
date our revenue has been attributable demand for our video and image processing socs the camera and infrastructure markets and the 
growth these overall markets initially focused the infrastructure market and then leveraged our knowledge and experience design solutions for 
the camera market now derive substantially all our revenue from the camera market and our operating results are increasingly affected trends the 
camera market these trends include demand for higher resolution increasing functionality longer battery life greater storage connectivity requirements 
and computer vision technology while accommodating more sophisticated standards for video compression may unable predict the timing 
development these markets with accuracy for example the proliferation smartphones having the ability capture high quality video and still images 
has significantly impacted the camera market relatively short period time and continues impact this market the internet protocol security 
camera market slower than expected adoption rate for digital technology place analog solutions could slow the demand for our solutions our target 
markets such wearable cameras automotive cameras security cameras and unmanned aerial vehicle cameras also referred uavs drones flying 
cameras not grow develop ways that currently expect demand for our video and image processing socs may not materialize expected and our 
business and operating results could suffer 
fluctuations our operating results quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price our ordinary shares decline 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period period the past and are likely the future particular our 
business tends seasonal with higher revenue our third quarter our customers typically increase their production meet holiday shopping season 
year end demand for their products also may experience seasonally lower demand our first quarter the asia based portion the security camera 
market result industry seasonality and the impact odm and oem factory closures associated with the chinese new year holiday result you 
should not rely period period comparisons our operating results indication our future performance future periods our revenue and results 
operations may below the expectations analysts and investors which could cause the market price our ordinary shares decline 
factors that may affect our operating results include 
fluctuations demand sales cycles product mix and prices for our products 
the forecasting scheduling rescheduling cancellation orders our customers 
shifts consumer preferences and any resultant change demand for video and image capture devices into which our solutions are 
incorporated 
changes the competitive dynamics our markets including new entrants pricing pressures 
delays our customers ability manufacture and ship products that incorporate our solutions caused internal and external factors 
beyond our control 
our ability successfully define design and release new solutions timely manner that meet our customers needs 
changes manufacturing costs including wafer test and assembly costs mask costs manufacturing yields and product quality and 
reliability 
timely availability adequate manufacturing capacity from our manufacturing subcontractors 
the timing product announcements our competitors 
incurrence research and development and related new products expenditures 
write downs inventory for excess quantities and technological obsolescence 
future accounting pronouncements and changes accounting policies 
volatility our share price which may lead higher stock based compensation expense 
volatility our effective tax rate 
general socioeconomic and political conditions the countries where operate where our products are sold used and 
costs associated with litigation especially related intellectual property 
moreover the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical nature reflecting overall economic conditions well budgeting and 
buying patterns consumers expect these cyclical conditions continue result our quarterly operating results are difficult predict even the 
near term our expense levels are relatively fixed the short term and are based part our expectations future revenue revenue levels are below our 
expectations may experience material impacts our business including declines margins and profitability incur losses for example the first 
half fiscal year our revenue declined compared the same period the prior fiscal year resulting substantial decline profit and cash 
flows from operating activities 
achieving design wins subject lengthy competitive selection processes that require incur significant costs even begin product 
design customer may decide cancel change its product plans resulting revenue from such expenditures 
are focused selling our video and image processing solutions odms and oems for incorporation into their products the design stage 
these efforts achieve design wins typically are lengthy especially new markets intend address and any case can require both incur design 
and development costs and dedicate scarce engineering resources pursuit single customer opportunity may not prevail the competitive 
selection process and even when achieve design win may never generate any revenue despite incurring development expenditures for example 
the past had achieved significant design win and projected substantial future revenue from that end customer result that design win 
subsequently based changes that end customer assessment the consumer market among other factors the end customer abruptly shut down its 
business unit with which achieved the design win with notice addition even oem designs one our soc solutions into one its 
products cannot assured that will secure new design wins from that oem for future products for example believe that gopro our largest oem 
customer fiscal year will use competing solution one its mainstream cameras its next product release cycle which would have significant 
negative impact our revenue fiscal year and beyond 
these risks are exacerbated the fact that some our end customers products particularly the camera market likely will have short life cycles 
further even after securing design win have experienced and may again experience delays generating revenue from our solutions result the 
lengthy product development cycle typically required generate any revenue all result any such design win 
our customers generally take considerable amount time evaluate our solutions the typical time from early engagement our sales force 
actual product introduction runs from nine months for the camera market and months for the infrastructure market though may take longer 
new markets intend address the delays inherent these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that customer will decide cancel curtail reduce 
delay its product plans causing lose anticipated sales addition any delay cancellation customer plans could harm our financial results 
may have incurred significant expense and generated revenue finally our customers failure successfully market and sell their products could 
reduce demand for our soc solutions and harm our business financial condition and results operations were unable generate revenue after 
incurring substantial expenses develop any our solutions our business would suffer 
the average selling prices video and image processing solutions our target markets have historically decreased over time and will likely 
the future which could harm our revenue and gross margins 
average selling prices semiconductor products the markets serve have historically decreased over time and expect such declines 
continue occur for our solutions over time our gross margins and financial results will suffer are unable offset reductions our average selling 
prices reducing our costs developing new enhanced soc solutions timely basis with higher selling prices gross margins increasing our sales 
volumes additionally because not operate our own manufacturing assembly testing facilities may not able reduce our costs rapidly 
companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our gross margins the past have reduced the 
prices our soc solutions anticipation future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions our competitors and other factors 
recently have experienced competitive pricing pressures the low ends the automotive aftermarket camera market and china based security 
camera market expect that will have address pricing pressures again the future which could require reduce the prices our soc solutions 
and harm our operating results 
expect competition increase the future which could have adverse effect our revenue and market share 
the global semiconductor market general and the video and image processing markets particular are highly competitive compete 
different target markets various degrees the basis number competitive factors including our solutions performance features functionality 
energy efficiency size ease with which our solution may integrated into our customers products customer support reliability and price well the 
basis our reputation expect competition increase and intensify more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets and large oems 
grow their internal resources and potentially develop their own semiconductor solutions addition move into new markets such the oem 
automotive market will face competition from larger competitors with longer histories these markets increased competition could result price 
pressure reduced profitability and loss market share any which could harm our business revenue and operating results

companies that will achieve meaningful revenue from the sales our solutions into these markets 
fail penetrate these other new markets are targeting our revenue likely will decrease over time and our financial condition would likely 
suffer 
not have long term supply contracts with our third party manufacturing vendors and they may not allocate sufficient capacity 
reasonable prices meet future demands for our solutions 
the semiconductor industry subject intense competitive pricing pressure from customers and competitors accordingly any increase the cost 
our solutions whether adverse purchase price variances adverse manufacturing cost variances will reduce our gross margins and operating profit 
currently not have long term supply contracts with most our primary third party vendors and negotiate pricing with our main vendors purchase 
order purchase order basis therefore they are not obligated perform services supply product for any specific period any specific quantities 
any specific price except may provided particular purchase order availability foundry capacity has the recent past been limited due 
strong demand the ability our foundry vendors provide with product which sole sourced each foundry limited their available capacity 
existing obligations and technological capabilities foundry capacity may not available when need reasonable prices none our third party 
foundry assembly and test vendors has provided contractual assurances that adequate capacity will available meet our anticipated future 
demand for our solutions our foundry and assembly and test vendors may allocate capacity the production other companies products while reducing 
deliveries short notice particular other companies that are larger and better financed than are that have long term agreements with our 
foundry assembly and test vendors may cause our foundry assembly and test vendors reallocate capacity them decreasing the capacity available 
converting transferring manufacturing from primary location supplier backup foundry vendor could expensive and would likely take

advanced process nodes will increasingly dependent upon such foundries 
the future enter into arrangements with suppliers that include additional fees expedite delivery nonrefundable deposits loans 
exchange for capacity commitments commitments purchase specified quantities over extended periods such arrangements may costly reduce our 
financial flexibility and terms unfavorable are able secure such arrangements all moreover are able secure foundry capacity 
may obligated use all that capacity incur penalties these penalties could harm our financial results date have not entered into any such 
arrangements with our suppliers need additional foundry assembly and test subcontractors because increased demand the inability obtain 
timely and adequate deliveries from our current vendors may not able cost effectively all 
substantial portion our revenue processed through single logistics provider and the loss this logistics provider may cause disruptions 
our shipments which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
sell significant percentage our solutions through single logistics provider wintech microelectronics ltd wintech which serves 
our non exclusive sales representative asia other than japan approximately and our revenue was derived from sales through wintech 
for the fiscal years ended january and respectively anticipate that significant portion our revenue will continue derived

fiscal year but decreased million fiscal year may not achieve similar growth rates future periods for example currently 
anticipate that our revenue growth rate will relatively flat fiscal year compared the fiscal year you should not rely our revenue growth 
gross margins operating results for any prior quarterly annual periods indication our future operating performance are unable maintain 
adequate revenue growth our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline 
are unable manage any future growth may not able execute our business plan and our operating results could suffer 
our business has grown rapidly our future operating results depend large extent our ability successfully manage any expansion and growth 
including the challenges managing company with headquarters the united states and the majority its employees asia are increasing our 
investment research and development and other functions grow our business and address new markets manage our growth successfully and handle 
the responsibilities being public company believe must effectively among other things 
recruit hire train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities particularly our offices 
asia and especially for the positions semiconductor design and systems and applications engineering 
add additional sales and business development personnel 
add additional finance and accounting personnel 
implement and improve our administrative financial and operational systems procedures and controls and 
enhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering adapting and expanding our 
systems and tool capabilities and properly training new hires their use 
are likely incur the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some the anticipated benefits and the return these 
investments any may lower may develop more slowly than expect may not materialize 
are unable manage our growth effectively may not able take advantage market opportunities develop new solutions and 
may fail satisfy customer product support requirements maintain product quality execute our business plan respond competitive pressures 
while intend continue invest research and development may unable make the substantial investments that are required 
remain competitive our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment research and development order bring market new and enhanced solutions our 
research and development expense was million million and million fiscal years and respectively expect 
increase our research and development expenditures compared prior periods part our strategy focusing the development innovative and 
sustainable video and image processing solutions with increased functionality such analytics computer vision capabilities are unable predict 
whether will have sufficient resources maintain the level investment research and development required remain competitive for example 
development the latest process nodes such can cost significantly more than required develop this added cost could prevent 
from being able maintain technology advantage over larger competitors that have significantly more resources invest research and development 
addition cannot assure you that the technologies which are the focus our research and development expenditures will become commercially 
successful generate any revenue 
may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses 
the rapidly evolving nature the markets which sell our solutions combined with substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may 
develop and other factors beyond our control limits our ability accurately forecast quarterly annual revenue addition because record 
significant portion our revenue from sales when have received notification from our logistics providers that they have sold our products some the 
revenue record quarter may derived from sales products shipped our logistics providers during previous quarters this revenue recognition 
methodology limits our ability forecast quarterly annual revenue accurately are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expenditures 
anticipation future revenue growth our revenue does not increase anticipated could incur significant losses due our higher expense levels 
are not able decrease our expenses timely manner offset any shortfall future revenue 
may experience difficulties demonstrating the value customers newer higher priced and higher margin solutions they believe existing 
solutions are adequate meet end customer expectations 
develop and introduce new solutions face the risk that customers may not value willing bear the cost incorporating these newer 
solutions into their products particularly they believe their customers are satisfied with current solutions regardless the improved features superior 
performance the newer solutions customers may unwilling adopt our new solutions due design pricing constraints owing the extensive time 
and resources that invest developing new solutions are unable sell customers new generations our solutions our revenue could decline and 
our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could negatively affected 
the complexity our solutions could result unforeseen delays expenses from undetected defects errors bugs hardware software which 
could reduce the market adoption our new solutions damage our reputation with current prospective customers and adversely affect our operating 
costs 
highly complex soc solutions such ours frequently contain defects errors and bugs when they are first introduced new versions are released 
have the past and may the future experience these defects errors and bugs any our solutions have reliability quality compatibility problems 
may not able successfully correct these problems timely manner all addition any our proprietary features contain defects errors 
bugs when first introduced new versions our solutions are released may unable timely correct these problems consequently our reputation 
may damaged and customers may reluctant buy our solutions which could harm our ability retain existing customers and attract new customers 
and could adversely affect our financial results addition these defects errors bugs could interrupt delay sales our customers any these 
problems are not found until after have commenced commercial production new product may incur significant additional development costs and 
product recall repair replacement costs these problems may also result claims against our customers others 
the loss any our key personnel could seriously harm our business and our failure attract retain qualified management engineering sales 
and marketing talent could impair our ability grow our business 
believe our future success depends large part upon the continuing services the members our senior management team and various 
engineering and other technical personnel one more our senior executives other key personnel are unable unwilling continue their present 
positions may not able replace them easily all our business may disrupted and our financial condition and results operations may 
materially and adversely affected addition any member our senior management team any our other key personnel joins competitor forms 
competing company may experience material disruption our operations and development plans and lose customers know how and key professionals 
and staff members and may incur increased operating expenses the attention other senior executives diverted recruit replacements for key 
personnel our industry characterized high demand and intense competition for talent and the pool qualified candidates very limited while 
plan continue recruit software and system engineers with expertise video processing technologies primarily taiwan and china may not 
successful attracting retaining and motivating sufficient numbers technical and engineering personnel support our anticipated growth the 
competition for qualified engineering personnel our industry and particularly asia very intense are unable hire train and retain qualified 
engineering personnel timely manner our ability grow our business will impaired addition are unable retain our existing engineering 
personnel our ability maintain grow our revenue will adversely affected 
camera manufacturers incorporate components supplied multiple third parties and supply shortage delay delivery these components 
could delay orders for our solutions our customers 
our customers purchase components used the manufacture their cameras from various sources supply often involving several specialized 
components including lenses and sensors any supply shortage delay delivery third party component suppliers third party supplier cessation

our failure adequately protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability compete effectively defend ourselves from litigation 
which could harm our business financial condition and results operations 
our success depends part our ability protect our intellectual property rely primarily patent copyright trademark and trade secret

which offer only limited protection the steps have taken protect our intellectual property rights may not adequate prevent misappropriation 
our proprietary information infringement our intellectual property rights and our ability prevent such misappropriation infringement uncertain 
particularly countries outside the united states the failure our patents adequately protect our technology might make easier for our competitors 
offer similar products technologies which would harm our business for example our patents and patent applications could opposed contested 
circumvented designed around our competitors declared invalid unenforceable judicial administrative proceedings our foreign patent 
protection generally not comprehensive our patent protection and may not protect our intellectual property some countries where our products 
are sold may sold the future many based companies have encountered substantial intellectual property infringement foreign countries 
including countries where sell products even foreign patents are granted effective enforcement foreign countries may not available for example 
the legal environment relating intellectual property protection china relatively weak often making difficult create and enforce such rights 
may not able effectively protect our intellectual property rights china elsewhere such impermissible use our intellectual property trade 
secrets were occur our ability sell our solutions competitive prices may adversely affected and our business financial condition operating results 
and cash flows could materially and adversely affected 
the legal standards relating the validity enforceability and scope protection intellectual property rights are uncertain and evolving 
cannot assure you that others will not develop patent similar superior technologies products services that our patents trademarks and other 
intellectual property will not challenged invalidated circumvented others 
unauthorized copying other misappropriation our proprietary technologies could enable third parties benefit from our technologies without 
paying for doing which could harm our business monitoring unauthorized use our intellectual property difficult and costly although are not 
aware any unauthorized use our intellectual property the past possible that unauthorized use our intellectual property may have occurred 
may occur without our knowledge cannot assure you that the steps have taken will prevent unauthorized use our intellectual property our failure 
effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value our technology licensing arrangements cross licensing negotiations 
may the future need initiate infringement claims litigation order try protect our intellectual property rights litigation whether 
are plaintiff defendant can expensive time consuming and may divert the efforts our technical staff and management which could harm our 
business whether not such litigation results determination favorable litigation also puts our patents risk being invalidated interpreted 
narrowly and our patent applications risk not being issued additionally any enforcement our patents other intellectual property may provoke 
third parties assert counterclaims against are unable protect our proprietary rights third parties independently develop gain access our 
similar technologies our business revenue reputation and competitive position could harmed 
third parties assertions infringement their intellectual property rights could result our having incur significant costs and cause our 
operating results suffer 
the semiconductor industry characterized vigorous protection and pursuit intellectual property rights and positions which has resulted 
protracted and expensive litigation for many companies certain our customers have received and expect particularly the extent gain greater 
market visibility that the future may receive communications from others alleging our infringement their patents trade secrets other intellectual 
property rights addition certain our end customers have been the subject lawsuits alleging infringement intellectual property rights products 
incorporating our solutions including the assertion that the alleged infringement may attributable least part our technology lawsuits resulting 
from such allegations could subject significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights though this has not occurred date any 
potential intellectual property litigation also could force one more the following 
stop selling products using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
lose the opportunity license our technology others collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion our 
intellectual property against others 
incur significant legal expenses 
pay substantial damages the party whose intellectual property rights may found infringing 
redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
attempt obtain license the relevant intellectual property from third parties which may not available reasonable terms all 
any significant impairment our intellectual property rights from any litigation face could harm our business and our ability compete 
any potential dispute involving our patents other intellectual property could affect our customers which could trigger our indemnification 
obligations them and result substantial expense 
any potential dispute involving our patents other intellectual property our customers could also become the target litigation certain our 
customers have received notices from third parties claiming have patent rights certain technology and inviting our customers license this technology 
and certain our end customers have been the subject lawsuits alleging infringement patents products incorporating our solutions including the 
assertion that the alleged infringement may attributable least part our technology because indemnify our customers for intellectual property 
claims made against them for products incorporating our technology any litigation could trigger technical support and indemnification obligations under 
some our license agreements which could result substantial expense although have not incurred significant indemnity expenses related 
intellectual property claims date anticipate that will receive requests for indemnity the future pursuant our license agreements with our 
customers addition other customers end customers with whom not have formal agreements requiring indemnify them may ask 
indemnify them claim made condition awarding future design wins because some our odms and oems are larger than are and have 
greater resources than they may more likely the target infringement claim third parties than would which could increase our 
chances becoming involved future lawsuit although have not yet been subject such claims any such claims were succeed might 
forced pay damages behalf our odms oems that could increase our expenses disrupt our ability sell our solutions and reduce our revenue 
addition the time and expense required for supply support indemnification our customers any such litigation could severely disrupt shut

experience foreign exchange gains losses due the volatility other currencies compared the dollar significant portion our solutions are 
sold camera manufacturers located outside the united states primarily asia sales customers asia accounted for approximately and 
our total revenue fiscal years and respectively because most our end customers their odm manufacturers are located asia

overview 
are leading developer semiconductor processing solutions for video that enable high definition video capture analysis sharing and 
display device that captures video includes four primary components lens image sensor video processor and storage memory the video processor 
converts raw video input into format that can stored analyzed and distributed efficiently and some cases analyzes the video data automate 
processes combine our processor design capabilities with our expertise video image processing and computer vision algorithms and software 
provide technology platform that designed easily scalable across multiple applications and enable rapid and efficient product development our 
system chip soc designs fully integrate video processing image processing and analysis audio processing and system functions onto single 
chip delivering exceptional video and image quality differentiated functionality and low power consumption 
sell our solutions leading original design manufacturers odms and original equipment manufacturers oems globally refer odms 
our customers and oems our end customers except otherwise indicated the context otherwise requires the camera market our solutions 
enable the creation high quality video content wearable cameras automotive cameras internet protocol security cameras for both professional 
use and home security and monitoring unmanned aerial vehicle cameras also referred uavs drones flying cameras and virtual reality cameras also 
referred cameras the infrastructure market our solutions efficiently manage video traffic broadcast encoding transcoding and video 
delivery applications 
our sales cycles typically require significant investment time and substantial expenditure resources before can realize revenue from the 
sale our solutions any our typical sales cycle consists multi month sales and development process involving our customers system designers and 
management along with our sales personnel and software engineers successful this process culminates customer decision use our solutions its 
system which refer design win our sales efforts are typically directed the oem the product that will incorporate our video and image 
processing solution but the eventual design and incorporation our soc into the product may handled odm behalf the oem volume 
production may begin within six months after design win depending the complexity our customer product and other factors upon which 
may have little influence once one our solutions has been incorporated into customer design believe that our solution likely remain 
component the customer product for its life cycle because the time and expense associated with redesigning product substituting alternative 
solution conversely design loss competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for generate future revenue from such customer product even 
obtain design win and our soc remains component through the life cycle customer product the volume and timing actual sales our socs 
the customer depend upon the production release and market acceptance that product none which are within our control 
fiscal year financial highlights and trends 
recorded revenue million decrease compared fiscal year the decrease revenue was primarily due 
significant revenue decline the wearable sports camera market the first half fiscal year the decreased revenue from the wearable 
sports camera market was partially offset strong growth the home security and monitoring uav and the non sports wearable markets 
fiscal year the professional security market experienced decline revenue fiscal year predominantly from customers 
located the china region although revenue from the automotive aftermarket which dominated demand from asia was down from 
fiscal year due declining business from china revenue from recording systems installed original equipment automobiles helped 
offset the decline despite the revenue growth the wearable sports camera market the second half fiscal year anticipate 
continued decline this market the first half fiscal year result high inventory levels gopro inc gopro addition 
anticipate that the incorporation competitive chip for least one main stream camera product gopro next product release cycle will 
significantly and adversely impact our revenues the second half fiscal year and beyond fiscal year infrastructure revenue 
declined percentage total revenue from for the twelve months ended january for the twelve months ended 
january anticipate that infrastructure revenue will continue decline percentage total revenue for the foreseeable future 
experienced moderate adverse impact our business the second and third quarters fiscal year due the disruption supply 
image sensors from sony corporation sony our customers resulting from damage sony production facility caused the april 
earthquake kumamoto japan this disruption image sensor supply impacted our customers ability build launch camera 
devices and result impacted the timing and scope demand for our socs fiscal year believe that during the fourth quarter 
fiscal year this adverse impact became immaterial and will not continue into fiscal year 
recorded operating income million decrease compared fiscal year primarily due decreased total revenue 
increased stock based compensation expense well increased research and development costs result increased headcount and costs 
associated with new soc development especially automotive and computer vision markets 
generated cash flows from operating activities million fiscal year compared million fiscal year the 
decreased cash flows from operating activities were primarily due decreased net income result decreased revenue adjusted for 
increased non cash stock based compensation expense the decrease cash flows from operating activities also was attributable increased 
inventory purchases and decreased deferred revenue associated with the timing inventory shipments our logistics providers the decrease 
was partially offset increased liabilities associated with the timing payments suppliers

factors affecting our performance 
design wins closely monitor design wins customer and end market consider design wins critical our future success although 
design win may not successfully materialize into revenue and even they result revenue the amount generated each design win can vary significantly 
our long term sales expectations are based forecasts from customers and internal estimations customer demand factoring the expected time market 
for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential our ability accurately forecast demand however can adversely 
affected number factors including inaccurate forecasting our customers miscalculations our customers their inventory requirements changes 
market conditions adverse changes our product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers products 
pricing product cost and margin our pricing and margins depend the volumes and the features the solutions provide our customers 
additionally make significant investments new solutions for both cost improvements and new features that expect drive revenue and maintain 
margins general solutions incorporated into more complex configurations such those used high performance camera infrastructure applications 
have higher prices and higher gross margins compared solutions sold into lower performing more competitive camera applications our average selling 
price can vary market and application due market specific supply and demand the maturation products launched previous years and the launch 
new products 
continually monitor the cost our solutions rely third party manufacturers for the production our products maintain close 
relationship with these suppliers continually monitor production yields component costs and design efficiencies 
shifting consumer preferences our revenue subject consumer preferences regarding form factor and functionality and how those preferences 
impact the video and image capture electronics that support for example improved smartphone video capture capabilities and the rapid adoption 
smartphones consumers led the decline pocket video cameras aimed the video and image capture market the current video and image capture 
market now characterized greater volume more specialized video and image capture devices that are less likely replaced with smartphones 
such wearable security uav and automotive cameras this increasing specialization video capture devices has changed our customer base and end 
markets and has impacted our revenue the future expect further changes the market continue impact our business performance 
continued concentration revenue end market historically our revenue has been significantly concentrated small number end markets 
fiscal year the majority our revenue came from the pocket video camcorder and infrastructure markets since that time have developed 
technologies provide solutions for new markets such the wearable security uav and automotive camera markets believe these new markets can 
continue facilitate revenue growth and customer diversification since fiscal year the wearable sports and professional security markets have been 
our largest end markets and sales into these markets collectively generated the majority our revenue while will continue expand our end market 
exposure such home security and monitoring cameras non sports wearable cameras uavs automotive and computer vision markets and virtual reality 
cameras anticipate that sales limited number end markets will continue account for significant percentage our total revenue for the 
foreseeable future our end market concentration may cause our financial performance fluctuate significantly from period period based the success 
failure products that our socs are designed into well the overall growth decline the video capture markets which compete addition 
derive significant portion our revenue from limited number odms who build products behalf limited number oems and from limited 
number oems whom ship directly believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue depend sales relatively 
small number customers 
ability capitalize connectivity and computer vision trends mobile connected devices are ubiquitous today and play increasingly 
prominent role consumers lives the constant connectivity provided these devices has created demand for connected electronic peripherals such 
video and image capture devices our ability capitalize these trends supporting our end customers the development connected peripherals that 
seamlessly cooperate with other connected devices and allow consumers distribute and share video and images with online media platforms critical for 
our success have added wireless communication functionality into our solutions for wearable security uav and automotive cameras the 
combination our compression technology with wireless connectivity enables wireless video streaming and uploading videos and images the internet 
our solutions enable security camera systems stream video content either cloud infrastructure connected mobile devices and our solutions for 
wearable and uav cameras allow consumers quickly stream upload video and images social media platforms addition expect that computer 
vision functionality will become increasingly important requirement many our current and future markets including security wearable uav and 
automotive camera markets result believe that our ability develop advanced computer vision technology and gain customer acceptance our 
technology will critical our future success 
sales volume typical camera design win that successfully launches into the marketplace can generate wide range sales volumes for our 
solutions depending the end market demand for our customers products this can depend several factors including the reputation the end 
customer market penetration product capabilities size the end market that the product addresses and our end customers ability sell their products 
certain cases may provide volume discounts sales our solutions which may offset lower manufacturing costs related higher volumes 
general our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle 
customer product life cycle estimate our customers product life cycles based the customer type product and end market general 
products launched the camera market have shorter life cycles than those sold into the infrastructure market typically commence commercial shipments 
from six months following design win however some markets more lengthy product and development cycles are possible depending the scope 
and nature the project portable consumer device typically has product life cycle six months the infrastructure market the product life cycle 
can range from months

derive substantially all our revenue from the sale video and image processing soc solutions oems and odms either directly 
through our logistics providers our soc solutions have been used the camera and infrastructure markets although expect the camera market will the 
primary market for our solutions for the foreseeable future the infrastructure market continues decline due delays investments network upgrades 
derive substantial portion our revenue from sales made indirectly through our logistics provider wintech microelectronics ltd wintech and 
directly one oem customer gopro 
typically experience seasonal fluctuations our quarterly revenue with our third fiscal quarter normally being the highest revenue quarter this 
fluctuation has been driven primarily increased sales consumer camera markets our customers build inventories preparation for the holiday 
shopping season more generally our average selling prices fluctuate based the mix our solutions sold period which reflects the impact both 
changes unit sales existing solutions well the introduction and sales new solutions our solutions are typically characterized life cycle that 
begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes followed broader market adoption higher volumes and average selling prices that are lower 
than initial levels 
the end markets into which sell our products have seen significant changes consumer preferences have evolved response new 
technologies result the composition our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods technology consumer preference changes expect 
shifts consumer use video capture continue change over time more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues proliferate 
cost revenue and gross margin 
cost revenue includes the cost materials such wafers processed third party foundries costs associated with packaging assembly and 
testing and our manufacturing support operations such logistics planning and quality assurance cost revenue also includes indirect costs such 
warranty inventory valuation reserves and other general overhead costs 
expect that our gross margin may fluctuate from period period result changes average selling price product mix and the introduction 
new products our competitors general solutions incorporated into more complex configurations such those used high performance 
cameras infrastructure applications have higher prices and higher gross margins compared solutions sold into the lower performance more 
competitive camera applications semiconductor products mature and unit volumes sold customers increase their average selling prices typically 
decline these declines may paired with improvements manufacturing yields and lower wafer packaging and test costs which offset some the margin 
reduction that could result from lower selling prices believe that our gross margin will decline the future continue penetrate the highly 
competitive camera market 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily personnel costs including salaries stock based compensation and employee benefits the 
expense also includes costs development incurred connection with our collaborations with our foundry vendors costs licensing intellectual property 
from third parties for product development costs development for software and hardware tools cost fabrication mask sets for prototype products and 
allocated depreciation and facility expenses all research and development costs are expensed incurred expect our research and development expense

additional amounts earned resulting from margin sharing arrangements and determination the end products into which the products are ultimately 
incorporated are recognized when end customer sales volume reported revenue from margin sharing arrangements was not material for the fiscal 
years ended january and respectively 
also enter into engineering service agreements with certain customers these agreements may include multiple deliverables such software 
development services licensing intellectual property and post contract customer support pcs not sell separately any these components and 
not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for the deliverables accordingly revenues from these agreements are deferred for any amounts 
billed until delivery all the elements the agreements include pcs the revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated supporting periods revenue

cash equivalents and marketable securities 
consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities less than three months the time purchase cash equivalents
