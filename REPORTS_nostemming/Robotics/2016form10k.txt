mix and number copies each product licensed 
generally provide our customers the right mix portion the software they initially licensed for other 
specified synopsys products for example customer may use our front end design products for portion the 
license term and then exchange such products for back end place and route software for the remainder the term 
order complete the customer design this practice helps ensure the customer access the complete 
design flow needed design their product offering remix rights customers gives advantage over 
competitors who offer narrower range products because customers can obtain more their design flow from 
single vendor the same time because such cases the customer need not obtain new license and pay 
additional license fee for the use the additional products the use these arrangements could result reduced

risk factors 
description the risk factors associated with our business set forth below investors should carefully consider 
these risks and uncertainties before investing our common stock 
the growth our business depends the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the growth the electronic design automation eda industry whole and our eda and intellectual property 
product sales particular dependent the semiconductor and electronics industries substantial portion 
our business and revenue depends upon the commencement new design projects semiconductor 
manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity designs systems chips and integrated 
circuits and customers concerns about managing costs have previously led and the future could lead 
decrease design starts and design activity general with some customers focusing more one discrete phase 
the design process opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the 
most advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition 
and results operations could adversely affected growth the semiconductor and electronics industries 
slows stalls additionally the eda industry matures consolidation may result stronger competition from 
companies better able compete sole source vendors this increased competition may cause our revenue 
growth rate decline and exert downward pressure our operating margins which may have adverse effect 
our business and financial condition 
furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems many 
our customers outsource the manufacture their semiconductor designs foundries our customers also 
frequently incorporate third party whether provided other vendors into their designs improve the 
efficiency their design process work closely with major foundries ensure that our eda and 
manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes similarly work closely with other 
major providers semiconductor particularly microprocessor optimize our eda tools for use with their 
designs and assure that their and our own products which may each provide for the design separate 
components the same chip work effectively together fail optimize our eda and solutions for use with 
major foundries manufacturing processes major providers products our access such foundry 
processes third party products hampered then our solutions may become less desirable our customers 
resulting adverse effect our business and financial condition 
consolidation among our customers and within the industries which operate well our 
dependence relatively small number large customers may negatively impact our operating results 
number business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships among our 
customers the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years and more 
could occur the future consolidation among our customers could lead fewer customers the loss 
customers increased customer bargaining power reduced customer spending software and services 
furthermore depend relatively small number large customers and such customers continuing

table contents 
helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our products are important part our 
customers development process their research and development budget and spending decisions may affected 
their business outlook and willingness invest new and increasingly complex chip designs addition 
several consolidations have taken place the semiconductor industry recently while not believe customer 
consolidations have had material impact our results the future impact uncertain for discussion 
potential risks please see the risk factor titled consolidation among our customers and within the industries 
which operate well our dependence relatively small number large customers may negatively 
impact our operating results part item risk factors 
despite global economic uncertainty have maintained profitability and positive cash flow annual basis 
recent years achieved these results not only because our solid execution leading technologies and strong 
customer relationships but also because our time based revenue business model under this model 
substantial majority our customers pay over time and typically recognize this revenue over the life the 
contract which averages approximately three years time based revenue which consists time based products 
maintenance and service revenue represents approximately our total revenue the revenue recognize 
particular period generally results from selling efforts prior periods rather than the current period due our 
business model decreases well increases customer spending not immediately affect our revenues

our growth strategy based building our leadership our eda products expanding and proliferating our 
offerings and driving growth the software quality and security market continue expand our product 
portfolio and our total addressable market for instance the software quality and security space and hardware 
grows may experience increased variability our revenue though generally expect time based revenue 
continue represent approximately our total revenue overall our business outlook remains solid based

critical accounting policies and estimates 
our discussion and analysis our financial results under results operations below are based our audited 
results operations which have prepared accordance with gaap preparing these financial 
statements make assumptions judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts assets

historical experience and various other assumptions believe are reasonable under the circumstances our 
actual results may differ from these estimates for further information our significant accounting policies see

revenue recognition 
generate our revenue from the sale products that include software licenses maintenance and professional 
services and lesser extent hardware products software license revenue consists fees associated with the 
licensing our software maintenance and professional service revenue consists maintenance fees associated 
with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees hardware revenue consists sales field 
programmable gate array fpga based emulation and prototyping products 
most our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds products and various license rights 
bundled with post contract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide complete end end 
solution the customer throughout the contract our customers are typically using myriad products 
complete each phase chip design and are concurrently working multiple chip designs projects 
different phases the design during this time the customer looks release state the art technology 
keep with the pace change address requested enhancements our tools meet customer 
specifications provide support each stage the customer design including the final manufacturing the 
chip the tape out stage and other important services 
with respect software licenses utilize three license types 
technology subscription licenses tsls tsls are time based licenses for finite term and 
generally provide the customer limited rights receive exchange certain quantities 
licensed software for unspecified future technology the majority our arrangements are tsls 
due the nature the business and customer requirements addition the licenses the 
arrangements also include post contract customer support which includes providing frequent 
updates and upgrades maintain the utility the software due rapid changes technology 
other intertwined services such multiple copies the tools assisting our customers applying 
our technology their development environment and rights remix licenses for other licenses 
term licenses also infrequently enter into certain license arrangements wherein licenses are 
provided for finite term without any other services rights including rights receive 
exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology customers purchase maintenance 
separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance the term the annual 
maintenance fee typically calculated percentage the net license fee 
perpetual licenses perpetual licenses continue long the customer renews maintenance plus 
additional years perpetual licenses not provide the customer any rights receive 
exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology customers purchase maintenance 
separately for the first year and may renew annually 
for the three software license types recognize revenue follows 
tsls typically recognize revenue from tsl fees ratably over the term the license period 
customer installments become due and payable whichever later revenue attributable 
tsls reported time based products revenue the consolidated statements operations 
term licenses recognize revenue from term licenses full upon shipment the software 
payment terms require the customer pay least the license fee and the 
maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable these term licenses reported upfront products revenue the 
consolidated statements operations for term licenses which less than the license fee 
and the maintenance fee payable within one year from shipment recognize revenue 
customer payments become due and payable such revenue reported time based

our maintenance and service revenue consists maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software 
licenses and professional services fees recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the 
maintenance period the extent cash has been received fees become due and payable and recognize revenue 
from professional services and training fees such services are performed and accepted the customer

also enter into arrangements which portions revenue are contingent upon the occurrence uncertain 
future events for example royalty arrangements refer this revenue contingent revenue contingent 
revenue recognized and when the event that removes the contingency occurs such revenue reported 
time based products revenue the consolidated statements operations these arrangements are not material 
our total revenue 
infrequently enter into multiple element arrangements that contain both software and non software deliverables 
such hardware have determined that the software and non software deliverables our contracts are 
separate units accounting recognize revenue for the separate units accounting when all revenue 
recognition criteria are met revenue allocated hardware units accounting recognized upon shipment when 
all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated software units accounting recognized 
depending the software license type tsl term license perpetual license such arrangements have not had 
material effect our consolidated financial statements and are not expected have material effect future 
periods 
also enter into arrangements deliver software products either alone together with other products 
services that require significant modification customization the software account for such arrangements 
using the percentage completion method have the ability make reasonably dependable estimates that 
relate the extent progress toward completion contract revenues and costs measure the progress towards 
completion using the labor hours incurred complete the project revenue attributable these arrangements 
reported maintenance and service revenue the consolidated statements operations 
determine the fair value each element multiple element software arrangements that only contain software 
and software related deliverables based vendor specific objective evidence vsoe limit our assessment 
vsoe fair value for each element the price charged when such element sold separately have analyzed 
all the elements included our multiple element software arrangements and have determined that have 
sufficient vsoe allocate revenue the maintenance components our perpetual and term license products and 
professional services accordingly assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met recognize license 
revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from 
maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services services are 
performed and accepted the customer with respect tsl arrangements due the complexity the tools the 
complexity the arrangement terms and intertwined services the license maintenance and other services are not 
separable and are considered combined unit additionally not have sufficient vsoe fair value 
allocate the fee between these services therefore recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term the 
license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
make judgments related revenue recognition specifically connection with each transaction involving our 
products must evaluate whether persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery software 
services has occurred the fee for such software services fixed determinable and collectability the 
table contents 
full license service fee probable all four these criteria must met order for recognize revenue with 
respect particular arrangement apply these revenue recognition criteria follows 
persuasive evidence arrangement exists prior recognizing revenue arrangement 
our customary policy have written contract signed both the customer and 
purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated standard end user license 
arrangement purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred deliver our products our customers electronically physically for 
electronic deliveries delivery occurs when provide access our customers take immediate 
possession the software through downloading the customer hardware for physical 
deliveries the standard transfer terms are typically freight board fob shipping point 
generally ship our products license keys promptly after acceptance customer orders 
however number factors can affect the timing product shipments and result timing 
revenue recognition including the delivery dates requested customers and our operational 
capacity fulfill product orders the end fiscal quarter 
the fee fixed determinable our determination that arrangement fee fixed 
determinable depends principally the arrangement payment terms our standard payment 
terms for perpetual and term licenses require more the license fee and the 
maintenance fee paid within one year the arrangement includes these terms regard the 
fee fixed determinable and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement full upon 
delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the arrangement does not 
include these terms not consider the fee fixed determinable and generally recognize 
revenue when customer installments are due and payable the case tsl because the 
right exchange products receive unspecified future technology and because vsoe for 
maintenance services does not exist for tsl recognize revenue ratably over the term the 
license but not advance when customers installments become due and payable 
collectability probable judge collectability the arrangement fees customer bycustomer basis pursuant our credit review policy typically sell customers with whom 
have history successful collection for new customer when existing customer 
substantially expands its commitments evaluate the customer financial position and ability 
pay and typically assign credit limit based that review increase the credit limit only after 
have established successful collection history with the customer determine any time 
that collectability not probable under particular arrangement based upon our credit review 
process the customer payment history recognize revenue under that arrangement 
customer payments are actually received 
valuation business combinations 
are required allocate the purchase price tangible assets liabilities and contingencies assumed and 
intangible assets acquired business combination any residual purchase price recorded goodwill the 
allocation the purchase price requires management make estimates determining the fair values assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect intangible assets which are amortized over various 
estimated useful lives our estimates may include but are not limited future cash flows acquired business 
the appropriate discounted rate and the cost savings expected derived from acquisition these estimates 
are inherently difficult subjective and unpredictable and different estimates were used the purchase price 
allocation the acquired assets and liabilities could different addition make judgments and estimates 
when assign useful lives intangible assets identified part our acquisitions these estimates are also 
inherently uncertain and used different estimates the useful life over which amortize intangible assets 
would different therefore our assessment the estimated fair value each these assets and liabilities can 
have material effect our consolidated financial statements 
valuation intangible assets 
evaluate our intangible assets for indications impairment whenever events changes circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not recoverable intangible assets consist purchased technology contract 
rights intangibles customer relationships trademarks and trade names covenants not compete capitalized 
software development and process research and development factors that could trigger impairment review 
include significant under performance relative expected historical projected future operating results significant 
changes the manner our use the acquired assets the strategy for our overall business significant

useful life this assessment indicates that the intangible asset not recoverable based the estimated 
undiscounted future cash flows the technology over the remaining useful life reduce the net carrying value

adverse effect our reported financial results did not record any impairment charges our intangible assets 
during fiscal 
income taxes 
our estimates and assumptions made our tax provisions may differ from the actual results reflected our 
income tax returns and record the required adjustments when they are identified resolved

for tax loss and credit carryovers record valuation allowance reduce the deferred tax assets the amount 
that more likely than not realized evaluating our ability utilize our deferred tax assets consider all 
available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results our forecast future taxable income 
jurisdiction jurisdiction basis well feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions 
require judgment about the forecasts future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates 
are using manage the underlying businesses believe that the net deferred tax assets approximately

benefit the largest amount that more than likely being realized upon ultimate settlement uncertain 
tax position considered effectively settled completion examination taxing authority certain other 
conditions are satisfied 
the calculation tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application complex tax laws 
significant assumptions judgments and estimates including forward looking financial projections and geographical 
mix earnings are also subject examination various taxing authorities believe have adequately

results operations 
revenue background 
generate our revenue from the sale products that include software licenses maintenance and professional 
services and lesser extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies recognize 
revenue from orders receive for software licenses services and hardware products varying times 
most instances recognize revenue tsl software license order over the license term and 
term perpetual software license order the quarter which the license delivered the 
weighted average license term the tsls and term licenses typically approximately three 
years but varies from quarter quarter due the nature and timing the arrangements entered 
into during the quarter the weighted average license term the tsls and term licenses 
entered into fiscal and was years years and years respectively 
revenue contracts requiring significant modification development accounted for using the 
percentage completion method over the period the development 
revenue hardware product orders generally recognized full the time the product 
shipped and when title transferred 
contingent revenue recognized and when the event that removes the contingency occurs 
table contents 
revenue maintenance orders recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one 
year 
revenue professional services orders generally recognized the services are performed 
our revenue any period equal the sum our time based products upfront products and maintenance and 
services for the period derive time based products revenue largely from tsl orders received and delivered 
prior quarters and smaller extent from contracts which revenue recognized customer installments 
become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements derive upfront products revenue directly 
from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period 
derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received prior periods since our maintenance 
orders generally yield revenue ratably over term one year also derive professional services revenue 
primarily from orders received prior quarters since recognize revenue from professional services those 
services are delivered and accepted percentage completion for arrangements requiring significant 
modification our software and not when they are booked 
our revenue sensitive the mix tsls and perpetual term licenses delivered during reporting period 
tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes revenue future periods for example 
order for three year tsl delivered the last day quarter typically generates revenue that 
quarter but each the succeeding quarters conversely order for perpetual and term 
licenses with greater than the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates 
revenue the quarter the product delivered but future revenue additionally revenue particular quarter 
may also impacted perpetual and term licenses which less than the license fees and the 
maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment the related revenue will recognized revenue 
the period when customer payments become due and payable 
our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds products and various license rights and our 
customers bargain with over many aspects these arrangements for example they often demand broader 
portfolio solutions support and services and seek more favorable terms such expanded license usage future 
purchase rights and other unique rights overall lower total cost single factor typically drives our customers 
buying decisions and compete all fronts serve customers highly competitive eda market customers 
generally negotiate the total value the arrangement rather than just unit pricing volumes

company operational capacity fulfill product orders the end fiscal quarter 
the fee fixed determinable the company determination that arrangement fee fixed 
determinable depends principally the arrangement payment terms the company standard 
payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require more the license fee and 
the maintenance fee paid within one year the arrangement includes these terms the 
company regards the fee fixed determinable and recognizes all license revenue under the 
arrangement full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the 
arrangement does not include these terms the company does not consider the fee fixed 
determinable and generally recognizes revenue when customer installments are due and payable
