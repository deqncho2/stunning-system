international markets offer rights return and standard warranties for product defects related our products the rights return are 
generally for period days after the delivery date our standard warranties cover periods ranging from days three years our 
standard sales arrangements not require product acceptance from the customer 
recent years have made concentrated effort increase our revenue through the pursuit orders with value greater than million 
these orders often include contract terms that vary substantially from our standard terms sale including product acceptance requirements 
and product performance evaluations which create uncertainty with respect the timing our ability recognize revenue from such orders 
these orders may also include most favored customer pricing significant discounts extended payment terms and volume rebates all which 
also may create uncertainty with respect the amount and timing revenue recognized from such orders

unlimited quantity certain software licenses for fixed term bundled with software maintenance technical support and specified amount training and 
service credits currently defer revenue for software licensed under our enterprise agreements and certain perpetual arrangements due lack vendor 
specific objective evidence vsoe for certain elements the contract under the new standard are longer required establish vsoe recognize 
software license revenue separately from the other elements and will able recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control 
the license which will generally occur the start each license term due the complexity our enterprise agreement contracts the actual revenue 
recognition treatment required under the new standard will dependent contract specific terms and may vary some instances from recognition the
