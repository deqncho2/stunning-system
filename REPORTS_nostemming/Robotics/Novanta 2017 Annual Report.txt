industries that are subject market cycles which turn could adversely affect the market demand for our products 
experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations the past cannot predict when slowdowns will recur that the 
impact such slowdowns will more less significant compared historical fluctuations 
our business success depends upon our ability respond fluctuations product demand but doing may require 
incur costs despite limited visibility toward future business declines 
during period increasing demand and rapid growth must able increase manufacturing capacity quickly our inability 
quickly increase production response surge demand could prompt customers look for alternative sources supply 
leave our customers without supply both which events could harm our reputation and make difficult for retain our existing 
customers obtain new customers 
periods weak demand may required reduce costs while maintaining the ability motivate and retain key employees 
the same time additionally remain competitive must continually invest research and development which may inhibit our 
ability reduce costs down cycle long product lead times create risk that may purchase manufacture inventories 
products that are unable sell 
the success our business depends our ability continuously innovate and manage transitions new product 
innovations 
technology requirements our markets are constantly advancing must continually introduce new products that meet evolving 
customer needs our ability grow depends the successful development introduction and market acceptance new enhanced 
products that address our customers requirements developing new technology complex and uncertain process requiring 
accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products additionally this requires that 
manage the transition from older products minimize disruption customer ordering patterns avoid excess inventory and ensure 
adequate supplies new products failure develop new products failed market acceptance new products problems associated 
with new product transitions could harm our business 
fail introduce new products timely manner may lose market share and unable achieve revenue growth 
targets 
our research and development efforts may not lead the successful introduction products within the time frame that our 
customers demand our competitors may introduce new improved products processes technologies that make our current 
proposed products obsolete less competitive may encounter delays problems connection with our research and 
development efforts product development delays may result from numerous factors including 
changing product specifications and customer requirements 
inability manufacture new products cost effectively 
difficulties reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations 
changing market competitive product requirements and 
unanticipated engineering complexities 
new products often take longer develop may have fewer features than originally considered desirable and have higher costs 
than initially estimated there may difficulty sourcing components for new products and delays starting volume production 
new products may also not commercially successful any these adverse developments could harm our business and our results 
operations 
customer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results fluctuate from period period

decisions customers reduce their purchases our products 
changes the prices our products our competitors products and 
fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates 
may receive several large orders one quarter from customer and then receive orders from that customer the next 
quarter result the timing revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations our operating results 
from quarter quarter addition our sales are reactive changes our customers businesses for instance customer that 
placed large order one period could subsequently experience downturn business and result could cancel order 
reduce the amount products purchases from future periods 
delay shipment near the end reporting period due rescheduling cancellation customers unexpected production 
delays experienced may cause revenue the period decline significantly and may have material adverse effect our 
operating results for that period 
cannot predict how the market will react new products introduced enhancements made our existing products 
any our new enhanced products contain defects perceived defects have reliability quality compatibility problems 
perceived problems our competitors release similar products enhancements the same time that are more widely accepted 
our customers our revenue and results operations for one more reporting periods could adversely affected 
addition our competitors may raise lower prices products response market demands competitive pressures 
lower the prices our products our competitors lower the prices their products such that demand for our products 
weakens our revenue for one more quarters may decline and our operating results would adversely affected changes foreign 
currency exchange rates can also cause significant fluctuations our results operations from quarter quarter

other penalties moreover our anti bribery policy and procedures may violated third party sales representatives other agents 
that help sell our products provide other services such representatives agents are not our employees and may more difficult 
oversee their conduct 
increased outsourcing components manufacturing manufacturers outside the united states leads additional risks that 
could negatively impact our business 
are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture subassemblies suppliers based china and elsewhere overseas order 
reduce our manufacturing cost however economic political trade problems with foreign countries could substantially impact our 
ability obtain critical parts needed the timely manufacture our products could substantially increase the costs these parts 
additionally this practice increases our vulnerability the theft and reduced protection for our intellectual property 
our global operations are subject extensive and complex import and export rules that vary among the legal jurisdictions

union member states pursue withdrawal barrier free access between the united kingdom and other european union member states 
among the european economic area overall could diminished eliminated these developments turn may inhibit our sales 
products mobility our personnel and our access capital 
the policies the current government regarding trade tax and health care policies among other things have led 
substantial uncertainty global financial markets the current government has withdrawn the united states from the transpacific partnership trade agreement attempting negotiate north american free trade agreement nafta and has made 
various comments suggesting the possible negotiation withdrawal from other trade agreements and the potential imposition 
new import barriers the current government has also enacted comprehensive tax law reform which may result additional 
tax payments foreign subsidiaries limitations tax deductions for interest expenses changes foreign income taxation for 
multinational companies the current government has also attempted repeal the patient protection and affordable care 
act the ppaca and may continue seek repeal the ppaca these developments and the lack clarity regarding future 
tax trade and health care policies have created significant uncertainty that could have material adverse effect global economic 
conditions and the stability global financial markets any major changes these policies could have material adverse effect

any patents will issued from any application filed that patents are issued the claims allowed will sufficient deter 
prohibit others from marketing similar products addition our patents may challenged invalidated circumvented legal 
administrative proceeding policing unauthorized use our intellectual property rights difficult and time consuming and may 
involve initiating claims litigation against third parties for infringement our proprietary rights which could costly 
our efforts protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not effective some foreign countries where 
operate sell our products fail adequately protect our intellectual property these countries may lose significant 
business our competitors 
our operating results would suffer are unable successfully defend against infringement claims third parties 
have received the past and could receive the future notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent 
other proprietary rights these allegations could result significant costs and diversion the attention management the event 
that any third party makes valid claim against our customers and license not available commercially reasonable

operate highly competitive industries and lose competitive advantages our business would suffer adverse 
consequences 
some our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial engineering manufacturing and 
marketing resources than our competitors will continue improve the design and performance their existing products and 
introduce new products possible that may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products 
our competitors that the marketplace will not consider our products superior competing products remain 
competitive will required invest heavily research and development marketing and customer service and support 
however may not able make the necessary technological advances maintain our competitive position and our products 
may not receive market acceptance these factors would cause not able

manufacture our products lead times for components and raw materials that order vary significantly and depend factors 
including the specific supplier requirements the size the order contract terms and current market demand for substantial increases 
our sales levels certain products some our suppliers may need significant lead time overestimate our component and 
raw material requirements may have excess inventory which would increase our costs underestimate our component and 
raw material requirements may have inadequate inventory which could interrupt and delay delivery our products customers 
any these occurrences could adversely affect our results operations and damage our relationships with customers 
production difficulties and product delivery delays disruptions could have material adverse effect our business 
assemble our products our facilities the united states the united kingdom germany and china each our products
