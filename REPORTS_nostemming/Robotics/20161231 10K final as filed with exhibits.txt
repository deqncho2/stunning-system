products and from improvements existing print materials and equipment technologies 
some our patents have recently expired and others will expire coming years upon expiration those patents our competitors 
may introduce products using the technology previously protected the expired patents and those products may have lower prices than 
those our products compete may need reduce our prices for those products which could adversely affect our revenues 
margins and profitability additionally the expiration our patents could reduce barriers entry into additive manufacturing which 
could result the reduction our sales and earnings potential competitors using technology previously protected our expired 
patents were introduce products inferior quality our potential customers may view the technology negatively which would have 
adverse effect our image and reputation and our ability compete with systems using other additive fabrication technologies 
intend follow strategy continuing product development enhance our position the extent practicable cannot assure

acquired company technology 
the risk that incur significant costs associated with such acquisition activity that may negatively impact our operating 
results before the benefits such acquisitions are realized all 
the risk incurring significant goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 
the risk incurring significant exit costs products services are unsuccessful 
the entry into marketplaces where have limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger 
marketplace positions 
the exposure litigation other claims connection with our assuming claims litigation risks from terminated 
employees customers former shareholders other third parties and 
the risk that historical financial information may not representative indicative our results combined company 
historically have grown organically and from acquisitions and intend continue grow our infrastructure will require among 
other things continued development our financial and management controls and management information systems management 
our sales channel continued capital expenditures the ability attract and retain qualified management personnel and the training 
new personnel cannot sure that our infrastructure systems procedures business processes and managerial controls will 
adequate support the growth our operations any delays problems associated with implementing transitioning new

circumstances such write offs write downs could adversely impact our earnings and our ability obtain financing the 
future 
december had million goodwill capitalized our balance sheet and million other intangible assets 
net capitalized our balance sheet which represented our total assets 
majority our acquisitions have resulted our recording additional goodwill our consolidated balance sheet this goodwill 
typically arose because the purchase price for these businesses reflected number factors including the future earnings and cash flow 
potential these businesses the multiples earnings cash flow and other factors such prices which similar businesses have been 
purchased other acquirers the competitive nature the process which acquired the business and the complementary strategic 
fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring existing operations 
result our annual impairment testing recorded goodwill impairment charges million and other intangible 
assets impairment charges million the fourth quarter the impairment charges were non cash nature and did not 
impact our cash position cash flows but such charges and possible additional charges the future could adversely affect our results 
operations and stockholders equity and could adversely affect the trading price our common stock will monitor our reporting 
units effort determine whether events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing could required 
write off write down additional amounts the future the event deterioration our future performance sustained slower growth

goodwill 
goodwill reflects the excess the consideration transferred plus the fair value any non controlling interest the acquiree the 
acquisition date over the fair values the identifiable net assets acquired goodwill not amortized but rather tested for impairment 
annually whenever events circumstances present indication impairment goodwill asset representing the future 
economic benefits arising from other assets acquired business combination that are not individually identified and separately 
recognized the primary items that generate goodwill include the value the synergies between the acquired companies and and the 
acquired assembled workforce neither which qualifies for recognition identifiable intangible asset 
the annual impairment testing required asc intangibles goodwill and other requires use judgment and could require 
write down the carrying value our goodwill future periods allocate goodwill our identifiable geographic reporting 
units the americas emea and apac regions which are tested for impairment using two step process the first step requires 
comparing the fair value each reporting unit with the carrying amount including goodwill that fair value exceeds the carrying 
amount the second step the process not required performed and impairment charge required recorded that fair 
value does not exceed that carrying amount must perform the second step which requires allocation the fair value the 
reporting unit all assets and liabilities that unit the reporting unit had been acquired purchase business combination and 
the fair value the reporting unit was the purchase price the goodwill resulting from that purchase price allocation then compared 
the carrying amount with any excess recorded impairment charge 
the evaluation goodwill impairment requires make assumptions about future cash flows the reporting unit being evaluated 
that include among others growth revenues margins realized level operating expenses and cost capital these assumptions 
require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
goodwill set forth the consolidated balance sheet december arose from acquisitions carried out from 
and years prior december goodwill arising from acquisitions prior was allocated geographic reporting units 
based the percentage sls printers then installed geographic area goodwill arising from acquisitions was 
allocated geographic reporting units based geographic dispersion the acquired companies sales capitalization the time 
their acquisition 
conducted our annual impairment testing for the year ended december the fourth quarter there was goodwill 
impairment for the year ended december 
conducted our annual impairment testing for the year ended december the fourth quarter the results the first 
step our annual impairment testing indicated the carrying amount goodwill assigned the americas and emea reporting units 
exceeded fair value and that the carrying amount goodwill assigned apac did not exceed fair value based these results 
management completed the second step annual impairment testing for the americas and emea reporting units management 
determined that the fair value associated with goodwill assigned the americas was zero resulting non cash non tax deductible 
impairment charge million for the year ended december management determined that the carrying amount the 
goodwill assigned the emea reporting unit exceeded fair value approximately resulting non cash non tax deductible 
impairment charge million for the year ended december see notes and our consolidated financial statements 
there was goodwill impairment for the year ended december 
will monitor our reporting units effort determine whether events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment 
testing could required write off write down additional amounts the future the event deterioration our future 
performance sustained slower growth other circumstances 
other intangible assets 
intangible assets other than goodwill primarily represent acquired intangible assets including licenses patent costs acquired technology 
internally developed technology customer relationships non compete agreements trade names and trademarks intangible assets with 
finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life which determined identifying the period 
over which most the cash flows are expected generated 
for intangibles with finite lives review the carrying amounts for potential impairment when events changes circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount asset may not recoverable examples such change circumstances include significant 
decrease selling price significant adverse change the extent manner which asset being used significant adverse 
change the legal business climate evaluating recoverability group assets and liabilities the lowest level such that the 
identifiable cash flows relating the group are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities then compare 
the carrying amounts the assets asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows the event impairment 
exists impairment charge recorded the amount which the carrying amount the asset asset group exceeds the fair value 
fair value determined reference estimated selling values assets similar condition using discounted cash flow model 
addition the remaining amortization period for the impaired asset would reassessed and necessary revised 
impairment charges for intangible assets with finite lives were recorded for the year ended december recorded noncash impairment charges million result our other intangible assets impairment testing for the year ended december 
impairment charges for intangible assets with finite lives were recorded for the year ended december

goodwill 
goodwill reflects the excess the consideration transferred plus the fair value any non controlling interest the acquiree the 
acquisition date over the fair values the identifiable net assets acquired goodwill not amortized but rather tested for impairment 
annually whenever events circumstances present indication impairment goodwill asset representing the future 
economic benefits arising from other assets acquired business combination that are not individually identified and separately 
recognized the primary items that generate goodwill include the value the synergies between the acquired companies and the 
company and the acquired assembled workforce neither which qualifies for recognition identifiable intangible asset 
the annual impairment testing required asc intangibles goodwill and other requires the company use judgment and 
could require the company write down the carrying value its goodwill future periods the company allocates goodwill its 
identifiable geographic reporting units the americas emea and apac regions which are tested for impairment using two step 
process the first step requires comparing the fair value each reporting unit with the carrying amount including goodwill that fair 
value exceeds the carrying amount the second step the process not required performed and impairment charge required 
recorded that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount the company must perform the second step which requires 
allocation the fair value the reporting unit all assets and liabilities that unit the reporting unit had been acquired 
purchase business combination and the fair value the reporting unit was the purchase price the goodwill resulting from that purchase 
price allocation then compared the carrying amount with any excess recorded impairment charge 
the evaluation goodwill impairment requires the company make assumptions about future cash flows the reporting unit being 
evaluated that include among others growth revenues margins realized level operating expenses and cost capital these 
assumptions require significant judgement and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts

the company conducted its annual impairment testing for the year ended december the fourth quarter the results 
the company first step annual impairment testing indicated the carrying amount goodwill assigned the americas and emea 
reporting units exceeded fair value and that the carrying amount goodwill assigned apac did not exceed fair value based these 
results management completed the second step annual impairment testing for the americas and emea reporting units management 
determined that the fair value goodwill assigned the americas was zero resulting non cash non tax deductible impairment 
charge management determined that the carrying amount the goodwill assigned emea exceeded fair value

amortization license and patent costs included cost sales research and development expenses and selling general and 
administrative expenses depending upon the nature and use the technology amortization trade names customer relationships and 
non compete agreements are recorded selling general and administrative expenses 
for intangibles with finite lives the company reviews the carrying amounts for potential impairment when events changes 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount asset may not recoverable examples such change circumstances include 
significant decrease selling price significant adverse change the extent manner which asset being used significant 
adverse change the legal business climate evaluating recoverability the company groups assets and liabilities the lowest 
level such that the identifiable cash flows relating the group are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities 
the company then compares the carrying amounts the assets asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash 
flows the event impairment exists impairment charge recorded the amount which the carrying amount the asset 
asset group exceeds the fair value fair value determined reference estimated selling values assets similar condition 
using discounted cash flow model addition the remaining amortization period for the impaired asset would reassessed and 
necessary revised
