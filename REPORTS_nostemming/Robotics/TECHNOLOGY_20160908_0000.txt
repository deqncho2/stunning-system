katy huberty keith weiss brian nowak francois meunier 
since the mid ibm has been the forefront artificial intelligence with computers playing checkers chess jeopardy 
and now with watson which focusses many different segments including autonomous driving healthcare pharma believe 
that ibm the best positioned company terms artificial intelligence for corporate applications today ibm has customers 
industries working specific applications the technology 
believe that google the other market leader but for consumer applications such calendars google now messaging apps 
playing with alphago and research with deepmind google highly focused its artificial intelligence capabilities with 
management noting that investments machine learning and artificial intelligence are priority for machine learning 
technology has been integrated directly into powering some google core search business enhancing google voice search and 
image search abilities facebook amazon microsoft alibaba baidu are also involved artificial intelligence 
however there debate around how achieve sufficient computing power scale for broad use solve this 
bottleneck into the fourth industrial revolution think new sources computing power and new sources energy are 
required 
what artificial intelligence field research computer

science that aims understand how intelligence works con

structing computational mathematical models that mimic intelligent behaviour 
significant computing power required for these experiments consuming much more power and than human being human 
today computers can solve some specific tasks better than humans 
brain requires only watts power function for comparison 
artificial narrow intelligence the future provided there 
the main chip smartphone consumes watts order usa 
enough computing power hope this can more generally 
ble for several hours and enabled device would use several 
applied artificial general intelligence the debate around the avail 
orders magnitude more power than smartphone today hence 
ability enough computing power open today system 
conclude that having full learning artificial intelligence brain 
would use large array computers the cloud learn but once 
our pocket might not possible for decades but artificial intelli 
has learned its task the function can run smaller number 
gence will work different way the meantime large clusters 
computers hence scalable for artificial narrow intelligence 
servers the cloud will charge the learning process and 
one function but there might not enough computing power for 
when the process matures will downloaded smaller scale

the steam engine was the driver the first industrial revolution the internal combustion engine the driver the second industrial 
revolution they both shared new form power coal then oil and new materials wrought iron then steel 
moore law semiconductors was the engine the third digital revolution the new material was semiconducting silicon and 
the required source energy electricity that said the digital revolution losing steam and even with euv believe that moore 
law could stop know with transistors only wide 
there lots discussion around artificial intelligence machine learning but are still only scraping the surface with the risk 
moore law stopping artificial intelligence chip affordable cost could only reach the intelligence level guinea

binary way the answer issue might not false true but 
and more recently for data storage driven one the scien 
combination false and true this rather disconcerting explain 
tists who invented the rsa cryptographic method rivest shamir 
our education teaches that false and true are exclusive state 
adleman the dna uses four state coding for input

transferred bits but qubits quantum bits there 
solving problems that today are solved computers the idea 
clock the computer because the problem solved quasi instantly 
let bacteria solve problems using the same biological skills they use

survive hostile environments and because bacteria have shown 
supra conducting metal the computer needs remain isolated 
strong survival capacities over millions years earth scientists

cannot measure the output some quantum computers have also

some commercial success the field wave private and its cus

with light photonic computing has advantages versus transistor based computing does not generate any heat fast the 
speed light and therefore much faster fourier transforms

since then the development euv has made much progress terms throughput machines are running across different

find interesting that several companies joined forces solve complicated technical issues could that framework for 
next generation computing and energy generation

providers are reimbursed for health outcomes versus the current fee for service 
methodology where each healthcare act reimbursed individually order manage the 
outcomes population the most cost effective manner and reduce costs the 
overall system therefore insurers and other organizations taking risk are expected 
use more comprehensive big data and analytics measure and manage their population 
thus breaking down healthcare data silos gain comprehensive view the individual 
will become increasingly more important

players are becoming more involved the current market for data analytics fragmented
