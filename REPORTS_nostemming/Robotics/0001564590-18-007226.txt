sales customers asia accounted for approximately and our total revenue the fiscal years ended january and 
respectively certain prior year revenue amounts have been reclassified geographic region conform the fiscal year presentation these 
reclassifications did not impact total revenues each fiscal year many our oem end customers their odm manufacturers are located asia 
anticipate that majority our revenue will continue come from sales customers that region although large percentage our sales are made 
customers asia believe that significant number the products designed these customers and incorporating our socs are then sold consumers 
globally fiscal years and and our revenue was attributable sales our solutions into the camera markets 
respectively and and our revenue was attributable sales our solutions into the infrastructure market respectively date all our sales 
have been denominated dollars 
work closely with our end customer oems and odms throughout their product design cycles that often last six nine months for the camera 
market though new products within the camera market may have longer design cycles and months for the infrastructure market result are 
able develop long term relationships with our customers our technology becomes embedded their products consequently believe are well 
positioned not only designed into our customers current products but also continually develop next generation video and image processing 
solutions for their future products 
the product life cycles the camera market typically range from six months the product life cycles the infrastructure market typically range 
from two five years where new product introductions occur less frequently for many our solutions early engagement with our customers technical 
staff necessary for success ensure adequate level early engagement our application and development engineers work closely with our customers 
adjust product specifications and add functionality into their products 
fiscal year the customers representing more revenue were wintech the company distributor and gopro inc gopro direct 
oem customer which accounted for approximately and total revenue respectively the revenues for gopro fiscal year included direct 
shipments gopro but did not include shipments gopro odms through wintech which represented additional approximately our total 
revenue fiscal currently rely and expect continue rely limited number customers for significant portion our revenue fiscal 
years and sales directly and through our distributors our five largest odm and oem customers collectively accounted for approximately 
and our total revenues respectively and sales our largest odm and oem customers collectively accounted for approximately 
and our total revenues respectively 
sales and marketing 
sell our solutions worldwide using our direct sales force and our distributors have direct sales personnel covering the united states asia and 
europe and operate sales offices santa clara california and hong kong and business development offices china japan south korea and taiwan 
addition each these locations employ staff field applications engineers provide direct engineering support locally our customers 
our sales cycles typically require significant investment time and substantial expenditure resources before can realize revenue from the 
sale our solutions any our typical sales cycle consists multi month sales and development process involving our customers system designers and 
management and our sales personnel and software engineers successful this process culminates customer decision use our solutions its system 
which refer design win our sales efforts are typically directed the oem the product that will incorporate our video and image processing 
solution but the eventual design and incorporation our soc into the product may handled odm behalf the oem volume production may 
begin within six months after design win depending the complexity our customer product and other factors upon which may have little 
influence once our solutions have been incorporated into customer design they are likely used for the life cycle the customer product 
conversely design loss competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for future revenue from such customer product 
the end markets into which sell our products have seen significant changes consumer preferences have evolved response new 
technologies result the composition our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods technology consumer preference changes for 
example fiscal year pocket video revenue represented approximately our total revenue the proliferation smartphones and their ability 
capture high quality video and still images significantly impacted this market decreasing pocket video cameras contribution approximately zero percent 
total revenue fiscal year conversely our total revenue the fiscal years was primarily derived from markets for specialized video and 
image capture devices such the wearable camera market the security camera market the automotive aftermarket and the uav camera market expect 
shifts consumer use video capture continue change over time more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues proliferate 
which could significantly impact any these markets 
our sales are generally made pursuant purchase orders received approximately four weeks prior the scheduled product delivery date 
depending upon agreed terms with our customers and the current manufacturing lead time the time the purchase order received these purchase orders 
may cancelled without charge upon notification within agreed period time advance the delivery date which may short days due 
the scheduling requirements our foundry assembly and test contractors generally provide our contractors with our production forecasts and place firm 
orders for products with our suppliers weeks prior the anticipated delivery date usually without purchase order from our own customers our 
standard warranty provides that our socs containing defects materials workmanship performance may returned for refund the purchase price 
for replacement our discretion

this outsourced manufacturing approach allows focus our resources the design sales and marketing our solutions and avoid the cost associated 
with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility our engineers work closely with foundries and other contractors increase yields lower 
manufacturing costs and improve quality addition believe outsourcing many our manufacturing and assembly activities provides the flexibility 
needed respond new market opportunities simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements not have guaranteed 
level production capacity from any our suppliers facilities produce our solutions carefully qualify each our suppliers and their subcontractors 
and processes order meet the extremely high quality and reliability standards required our solutions 
backlog 
our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery products our manufacturing production based estimates and 
advance non binding commitments from customers future purchases follow industry practice that allows customers cancel change defer orders 
with limited advance notice prior shipment given this practice not believe that backlog reliable indicator future revenue levels

competition 
the global semiconductor market general and the video and image processing markets particular are highly competitive expect 
competition increase and intensify more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets and enter new markets increased competition 
could result price pressure reduced profitability and loss market share any which could materially and adversely affect our business revenue and 
operating results 
our competitors range from large international companies offering wide range semiconductor products smaller companies specializing

instruments certain our customers and suppliers also have divisions that produce products competitive with ours 
our ability compete successfully depends elements both within and outside our control including industry and general economic trends 
many our competitors are substantially larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more 
established than are and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them develop and enable new 
technology into product solutions better faster than and better withstand adverse economic market conditions the future 
our ability compete successfully the rapidly evolving video market depends several factors including 
the design and manufacturing new solutions including software that anticipate the video processing and integration needs our

the trading price our ordinary shares could decline and you could lose part all your investment 
risks related our business and our industry 
our customers not design our solutions into their product offerings our customers product offerings are not commercially successful our 
business would suffer 
sell our video and image processing system chip soc solutions original equipment manufacturers oems who include our socs 
their products and original design manufacturers odms who include our socs the products that they supply oems refer odms our 
customers and oems our end customers except otherwise indicated the context otherwise requires our video and image processing socs are 
generally incorporated into our customers products the design stage which referred design win result rely oems design our 
solutions into the products that they design and sell without these design wins our business would significantly harmed often incur significant 
expenditures developing new soc solution without any assurance that oem will select our solution for design into its own product once oem 
designs competitor device into its product becomes significantly more difficult for sell our soc solutions that oem because changing suppliers 
involves significant cost time effort and risk for the oem 
even oem designs one our soc solutions into its product cannot assured that the oem product will commercially successful over 
time all for example the past have secured design wins for camera products that were never commercially released our customer result 
factors beyond our control similarly higher than normal customer inventory levels gopro inc gopro significantly reduced gopro demand for our 
solutions and negatively reduced our revenue the fiscal quarter ended january and the first half fiscal years and other products 
other product categories incorporating our soc solutions are not commercially successful experience rapid decline our revenue and business will suffer 
similarly even oem designs one our soc solutions into its product are not assured that will receive continue receive new design 
wins from that oem for example gopro our largest oem customer fiscal year has used competing solution one its recently introduced 
mainstream cameras which has had and will continue have significant negative impact our revenue fiscal year revenues for direct shipments 
gopro accounted for approximately our total revenue estimated that the revenues for shipments gopro odms represented additional 
approximately our total revenue fiscal year anticipate that revenue from gopro will represent significantly smaller percentage our 
total revenue fiscal year and beyond 
depend limited number customers and end customers for significant portion our revenue fail retain expand our customer 
relationships our revenue could decline 
derive significant portion our revenue from limited number odms who build products behalf limited number oems and from 
limited number oems whom ship directly anticipate that this customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future fiscal years 
and sales directly and through our distributors our five largest odm and oem customers collectively accounted for approximately 
and our total revenue respectively and sales our ten largest odm and oem customers collectively accounted for approximately 
and our total revenue respectively believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue depend sales relatively 
small number customers and end customers the future these customers may decide not purchase our soc solutions all may purchase fewer 
solutions than they did the past may alter their purchasing patterns substantially all our sales date have been made purchase order basis 
these customers may cancel change delay product purchase commitments with little notice and without penalty and may make our revenue 
volatile from period period for example gopro our largest oem customer fiscal year has used competing solution one its recently 
introduced mainstream cameras which had and will continue have significant negative impact our revenue similarly our customer dji recently 
introduced uav incorporating competing solution that expect will negatively impact dji demand for our solutions future periods the loss 
significant customer substantial reduction purchases significant customer could happen again any time and without notice and such loss would 
likely harm our financial condition and results operations moreover because several our largest oem customers have dominant position their 
markets loss significant customer may not easily replaced through sales other customers that market 
addition our relationships with some customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our solutions 
attract new customers retain existing customers may have offer these customers favorable prices our solutions that event our average 
selling prices and gross margins would decline the loss key customer reduction sales any key customer our inability attract new customers 
could seriously impact our revenue and harm our results operations 
our customers may cancel their orders change production quantities delay production fail accurately forecast demand for our solutions 
revenue shortfalls excess obsolete insufficient inventory could result 
our customers typically not provide with firm long term purchase commitments substantially all our sales are made purchase order 
basis which permits our customers cancel change delay their product purchase commitments with little notice and without penalty them 
because production lead times often exceed the amount time required our customers fill their orders often must build socs advance 
receiving orders from customers relying imperfect demand forecast project volumes and product mix 
our socs are incorporated into products manufactured for our end customers and result demand for our solutions influenced the 
demand for our customers products our ability accurately forecast demand can adversely affected number factors including inaccurate 
forecasting our customers miscalculations our customers their inventory requirements changes market conditions adverse changes our 
product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers products for example higher than normal customer inventory levels gopro significantly 
impacted our revenue the fiscal quarter ended january and the first half fiscal years and higher than normal customer inventory 
levels can occur the future even after order received our customers may cancel these orders request decrease production quantities request 
delay the delivery our solutions any such cancellation decrease delay subjects number risks most notably that our projected sales will not 
materialize schedule all leading unanticipated revenue shortfalls and excess obsolete inventory that may unable sell other 
customers 
alternatively are unable project customer requirements accurately may not build enough socs which could lead delays product 
shipments and lost sales opportunities the near term well force our customers identify alternative sources which could affect our ongoing 
relationships with these customers have the past had customers significantly increase their requested production quantities with little advance 
notice not fulfill customer demands timely manner our customers may cancel their orders and may subject customer claims for cost 
replacement addition the rapid pace innovation our industry could render portions our inventory obsolete excess obsolete inventory levels 
could result unexpected expenses increases our reserves that could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 
addition any significant future cancellations deferrals product orders could harm our margins increase our write offs due product obsolescence and 
restrict our ability fund our operations 
our target markets may not grow develop currently expect and are subject market risks any which could harm our business revenue 
and operating results 
date our revenue has been attributable demand for our video and image processing socs the camera and infrastructure markets and the 
growth these overall markets initially focused the infrastructure market and then leveraged our knowledge and experience design solutions for 
the camera market now derive substantially all our revenue from the camera market and our operating results are increasingly affected trends the 
camera market these trends include demand for higher resolution increasing functionality longer battery life greater storage connectivity requirements 
and computer vision technology while accommodating more sophisticated standards for video compression may unable predict the timing 
development these markets with accuracy for example the proliferation smartphones having the ability capture high quality video and still images 
has significantly impacted the camera market relatively short period time and continues impact this market the internet protocol security 
camera market slower than expected adoption rate for digital technology place analog solutions could slow the demand for our solutions the 
automotive market slower than anticipated adoption advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous driving functionality could reduce demand 
for our new computer vision solutions our target markets such wearable cameras automotive cameras security cameras and unmanned aerial vehicle 
cameras also referred uavs drones not grow develop ways that currently expect demand for our video and image processing socs may 
not materialize expected and our business and operating results could suffer 
fail penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could harmed 
the past several years substantially all our revenue was generated from sales our products oems and odms video cameras our future 
revenue growth any will depend part our ability expand within the camera markets with our video and image processing soc solutions 
particularly the professional security and home security and monitoring camera markets the automotive camera market and the uav market well 
emerging markets such the virtual reality camera and robotics markets each these markets presents distinct and substantial risks and many cases 
requires develop new functionality software address the particular requirements that market for example expect that computer vision 
functionality will become increasingly important requirement many our current and future markets including automotive security uav wearable 
camera and robotics markets result believe that our ability develop advanced computer vision technology and gain customer acceptance our 
technology will critical our future success development products address new markets such the oem automotive and robotics markets could 
negatively impact our ability develop new products for our current markets which may harm our financial condition particularly the near term 
addition anticipate that move into new markets such the oem automotive and robotics markets will likely face competition from larger 
competitors with greater resources and more history these markets any these markets not develop currently anticipate are unable 
penetrate them successfully with our solutions our revenue could decline 
some these markets are primarily served only few large multinational oems with substantial negotiating power relative and some 
instances with internal solutions that are competitive our products meeting the technical requirements and securing design wins with any these 
companies will require substantial investment our time and resources cannot assure you that will secure design wins from these other 
companies that will achieve meaningful revenue from the sales our solutions into these markets addition these new markets such the oem 
automotive and robotics markets will likely face competition from larger competitors with greater resources and more history these markets 
fail penetrate these other new markets are targeting our revenue likely will decrease over time and our financial condition would likely 
suffer 
fail develop and introduce new enhanced solutions timely basis our ability attract and retain customers could impaired and 
our competitive position could harmed 
operate dynamic environment characterized rapidly changing technologies and technological obsolescence compete successfully 
must design develop market and sell enhanced solutions that provide increasingly higher levels performance and functionality and that meet the cost 
expectations our customers our existing future solutions could rendered obsolete the introduction new products our competitors 
convergence other markets such smartphones with into the camera market the market adoption products based new alternative 
technologies the emergence new industry standards for video compression the requirement additional functionality included our products such 
analytics computer vision functionality addition the markets for our solutions are characterized frequent introduction next generation and new 
products short product life cycles increasing demand for added functionality and significant price competition our customers are unable manage 
product transitions timely and cost effective manner our business and results operations would suffer 
our failure anticipate timely develop new enhanced solutions response technological shifts could result decreased revenue and our 
competitors achieving design wins that sought particular may experience difficulties with product design development new software 
manufacturing marketing qualification that could delay prevent our development introduction marketing new enhanced solutions addition 
delays development could impair our relationships with our customers and negatively impact sales our solutions under development moreover 
possible that our customers may develop their own product adopt competitor solution for products that they currently buy from fail 
introduce new enhanced solutions that meet the needs our customers penetrate new markets timely fashion will lose market share and our 
operating results will adversely affected 
fluctuations our operating results quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price our ordinary shares decline 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period period the past and are likely the future particular our 
business tends seasonal with higher revenue our third quarter our customers typically increase their production meet holiday shopping season 
year end demand for their products also may experience seasonally lower demand our first quarter the asia based portion the security camera 
market result industry seasonality and the impact odm and oem factory closures associated with the chinese new year holiday result you 
should not rely period period comparisons our operating results indication our future performance future periods our revenue and results 
operations may below the expectations analysts and investors which could cause the market price our ordinary shares decline 
factors that may affect our operating results include 
fluctuations demand sales cycles product mix and prices for our products 
the forecasting scheduling rescheduling cancellation orders our customers 
shifts consumer preferences and any resultant change demand for video and image capture devices into which our solutions are 
incorporated 
changes the competitive dynamics our markets including new entrants pricing pressures 
delays our customers ability manufacture and ship products that incorporate our solutions caused internal and external factors 
beyond our control 
our ability successfully define design and release new solutions timely manner that meet our customers needs 
changes manufacturing costs including wafer test and assembly costs mask costs manufacturing yields and product quality and 
reliability 
timely availability adequate manufacturing capacity from our manufacturing subcontractors 
the timing product announcements our competitors 
incurrence research and development and related new products expenditures 
write downs inventory for excess quantities and technological obsolescence 
future accounting pronouncements and changes accounting policies 
volatility our share price which may lead higher stock based compensation expense 
volatility our effective tax rate 
general socioeconomic and political conditions the countries where operate where our products are sold used and 
costs associated with litigation especially related intellectual property 
moreover the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical nature reflecting overall economic conditions well budgeting and 
buying patterns consumers expect these cyclical conditions continue result our quarterly operating results are difficult predict even the 
near term our expense levels are relatively fixed the short term and are based part our expectations future revenue revenue levels are below our 
expectations may experience material impacts our business including declines margins and profitability incur losses for example the first 
half fiscal year and the fourth quarter fiscal year our revenue declined and respectively compared the same periods the 
prior fiscal years resulting substantial decline profit and cash flows from operating activities may experience similar declines the future which 
would harm our operating results 
achieving design wins subject lengthy competitive selection processes that require incur significant costs even begin product 
design customer may decide cancel change its product plans resulting revenue from such expenditures 
are focused selling our video and image processing solutions odms and oems for incorporation into their products the design stage 
these efforts achieve design wins typically are lengthy especially emerging markets intend address such the oem automotive market and 
any case can require both incur design and development costs and dedicate scarce engineering resources pursuit single customer opportunity 
may not prevail the competitive selection process and even when achieve design win may never generate any revenue despite incurring 
development expenditures for example the past had achieved certain design wins and projected substantial future revenue result such design 
wins subsequently based factors outside our control the applicable end customers abruptly cancelled the projects with notice resulting 
loss projected revenue addition even oem designs one our soc solutions into one its products cannot assured that will secure new 
design wins from that oem for future products for example gopro our largest oem customer fiscal year has used competing solution one 
its recently introduced mainstream cameras which will have significant negative impact our revenue the current fiscal year and beyond 
these risks are exacerbated the fact that some our end customers products particularly the camera market likely will have short life cycles 
further even after securing design win have experienced and may again experience delays generating revenue from our solutions result the 
lengthy product development cycle typically required generate any revenue all result any such design win 
our customers generally take considerable amount time evaluate our solutions the typical time from early engagement our sales force 
actual product introduction runs from nine months for the camera market and months for the infrastructure market though may take longer 
new markets intend address such the oem automotive and robotics markets the delays inherent these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk 
that customer will decide cancel curtail reduce delay its product plans causing lose anticipated sales addition any delay cancellation 
customer plans could harm our financial results may have incurred significant expense and generated revenue finally our customers failure 
successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our soc solutions and harm our business financial condition and results operations 
were unable generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses develop any our solutions our business would suffer 
the average selling prices video and image processing solutions our target markets have historically decreased over time and will likely 
the future which could harm our revenue and gross margins 
average selling prices semiconductor products the markets serve have historically decreased over time and expect such declines 
continue occur for our solutions over time our gross margins and financial results will suffer are unable offset reductions our average selling 
prices reducing our costs developing new enhanced soc solutions timely basis with higher selling prices gross margins increasing our sales 
volumes additionally because not operate our own manufacturing assembly testing facilities may not able reduce our costs rapidly 
companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our gross margins the past have reduced the 
prices our soc solutions anticipation future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions our competitors and other factors 
recently have experienced competitive pricing pressures the low ends the automotive aftermarket camera market and china based security 
camera market expect that will have address pricing pressures again the future which could require reduce the prices our soc solutions 
and harm our operating results 
expect competition increase the future which could have adverse effect our revenue and market share 
the global semiconductor market general and the video and image processing markets particular are highly competitive compete 
different target markets various degrees the basis number competitive factors including our solutions performance features functionality 
energy efficiency size ease with which our solution may integrated into our customers products customer support reliability and price well the 
basis our reputation expect competition increase and intensify more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets and large oems 
grow their internal resources and potentially develop their own semiconductor solutions addition move into new markets such the oem 
automotive and robotics markets will face competition from larger competitors with longer histories these markets increased competition could result 
price pressure reduced profitability and loss market share any which could harm our business revenue and operating results

established than are and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them develop and enable new 
technology into product solutions better faster than and better withstand adverse economic market conditions the future our ability compete 
will depend number factors including 
our ability anticipate market and technology trends and successfully develop solutions that meet market needs 
our success identifying and penetrating new markets applications and customers 
our ability understand the price points and performance metrics competing products the marketplace 
our solutions performance and cost effectiveness relative that competing products 
our ability gain access leading design tools and product specifications the same time our competitors 
our ability develop and maintain relationships with key oems and odms 
our products effective implementation video processing standards 
our ability protect our intellectual property 
our ability expand international operations timely and cost efficient manner 
our ability deliver products volume timely basis competitive prices 
our ability support our customers incorporation our solutions into their products and 
our ability recruit design and application engineers with expertise image video and image processing technologies and sales and 
marketing personnel 
our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves with third parties acquire companies that provide similar 
products ours result new competitors alliances may emerge that could acquire significant market share any these factors alone 
combination with others could harm our business and result loss market share and increase pricing pressure 
are dependent sales limited number video and image processing solutions and decline market adoption these solutions could 
harm our business 
from inception through january our revenue has been generated primarily from the sale limited number high definition video 
and image processing soc solutions the camera and infrastructure markets moreover currently derive substantially all our revenue from the sale 
our socs for use the camera market and expect for the next several years result continued market adoption our soc solutions the 
camera market critical our future success demand for our soc solutions were decline demand for products incorporating our solutions declines 
does not continue grow does not grow expected our revenue would decline and our business would harmed 
not have long term supply contracts with our third party manufacturing vendors and they may not allocate sufficient capacity 
reasonable prices meet future demands for our solutions 
the semiconductor industry subject intense competitive pricing pressure from customers and competitors accordingly any increase the cost 
our solutions whether adverse purchase price variances adverse manufacturing cost variances will reduce our gross margins and operating profit 
currently not have long term supply contracts with most our primary third party vendors and negotiate pricing with our main vendors purchase 
order purchase order basis therefore they are not obligated perform services supply product for any specific period any specific quantities 
any specific price except may provided particular purchase order availability foundry capacity has the recent past been limited due 
strong demand the ability our foundry vendors provide with product which sole sourced each foundry limited their available capacity 
existing obligations and technological capabilities foundry capacity may not available when need reasonable prices none our third party 
foundry assembly and test vendors has provided contractual assurances that adequate capacity will available meet our anticipated future 
demand for our solutions our foundry and assembly and test vendors may allocate capacity the production other companies products while reducing 
deliveries short notice particular other companies that are larger and better financed than are that have long term agreements with our 
foundry assembly and test vendors may cause our foundry assembly and test vendors reallocate capacity them decreasing the capacity available 
converting transferring manufacturing from primary location supplier backup foundry vendor could expensive and would likely take 
least two more quarters there are only few foundries including samsung and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing ltd tsmc that are 
currently available for certain advanced process technologies that utilize may utilize nanometer continue develop solutions 
advanced process nodes will increasingly dependent upon such foundries 
the future enter into arrangements with suppliers that include additional fees expedite delivery nonrefundable deposits loans 
exchange for capacity commitments commitments purchase specified quantities over extended periods such arrangements may costly reduce our 
financial flexibility and terms unfavorable are able secure such arrangements all moreover are able secure foundry capacity 
may obligated use all that capacity incur penalties these penalties could harm our financial results date have not entered into any such 
arrangements with our suppliers need additional foundry assembly and test subcontractors because increased demand the inability obtain 
timely and adequate deliveries from our current vendors may not able cost effectively all 
substantial portion our revenue processed through single distributor and the loss this distributor may cause disruptions our shipments 
which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
sell significant percentage our solutions through single distributor wintech microelectronics ltd wintech which serves our nonexclusive sales representative asia other than japan approximately and our revenue was derived from sales through wintech for the 
fiscal years ended january and respectively anticipate that significant portion our revenue will continue derived from 
sales through wintech the foreseeable future our current agreement with wintech effective until september unless terminated earlier either 
party for any reason with days written notice failure the breaching party cure material breach within days following written notice 
such material breach the non breaching party our agreement with wintech will automatically renew for additional successive month terms unless 
least days before the end the then current term either party provides written notice the other party that elects not renew the agreement 
termination the relationship with wintech either wintech could result temporary permanent loss revenue may not successful 
finding suitable alternative distributors satisfactory terms all and this could adversely affect our ability effectively sell our solutions certain 
geographical locations certain end customers furthermore wintech any successor other distributors business with may face issues 
obtaining credit which could impair their ability make timely payments 
are subject risks associated with our distributors product inventories 
sell many our products customers through distributors who maintain their own inventory our products for sale dealers and end 
customers allow limited price adjustments sales distributors price adjustments may effected way credits for future product cash 
payments the distributor either arrears advance using estimates based historical transactions currently recognize revenues for sales 
distributors upon sell through the distributors upon the adoption accounting standards update revenue from contracts with customers 
topic asu effective february will recognize revenue sales distributors upon shipment and transfer control known sellin revenue recognition based the amount consideration expected received the extent that the actual consideration received materially 
different from estimated variable consideration used revenue recognition may required adjust revenue subsequent periods 
our distributors are unable sell adequate amount their inventory our products given quarter dealers and end customers they 
decide decrease their inventories for any reason such adverse global economic conditions downturn technology spending our sales these 
distributors and our revenues may decline also face the risk that our distributors may purchase for other reasons accumulate inventory levels our 
products any particular quarter excess future anticipated sales end customers such sales not occur the time frame anticipated these 
distributors for any reason these distributors may substantially decrease the amount product they order from subsequent periods until their inventory 
levels realign with end customer demand which would harm our business and could adversely affect our revenues such subsequent periods our reserve 
estimates associated with products stocked our distributors are based largely reports that our distributors provide weekly monthly basis 
date believe this resale and channel inventory data have been generally accurate the extent that these data are inaccurate not received 
timely manner may not able make reserve estimates for future periods accurately all 
deterioration the financial conditions our customers could adversely affect our operating results 
deterioration the financial condition our distributors customers could adversely impact our collection accounts receivable regularly 
review the collectability and creditworthiness our distributors and customers determine appropriate allowance for doubtful receivables based our 
review our distributors and customers currently have only immaterial reserves for uncollectible accounts our uncollectible accounts however were 
exceed our current future allowance for doubtful receivables our operating results would negatively impacted 
the loss any our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
believe our future success depends large part upon the continuing services the members our senior management team and various 
engineering and other technical personnel one more our senior executives other key personnel are unable unwilling continue their present 
positions may not able replace them easily all our business may disrupted and our financial condition and results operations may 
materially and adversely affected addition any member our senior management team any our other key personnel joins competitor forms 
competing company may experience material disruption our operations and development plans and lose customers know how and key professionals 
and staff members and may incur increased operating expenses the attention other senior executives diverted recruit replacements for key

rely highly skilled personnel and are unable hire retain motivate key personnel may not able grow effectively 
our performance largely depends the talents and efforts highly skilled individuals our future success depends our continuing ability 
identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas our organization our industry characterized high demand and 
intense competition for talent the pool qualified candidates limited particularly silicon valley and parts asia for vlsi and computer vision 
engineers and certain our competitors and potential competitors with greater resources have directly targeted our employees addition our 
compensation arrangements such our equity award programs may not always successful attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our 
existing employees our continued ability compete effectively depends our ability attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing 
employees 
not generate revenue growth may not able execute our business plan and our operating results could suffer 
you should not rely our revenue growth gross margins operating results for any prior quarterly annual periods indication our future 
operating performance the past have experienced significant growth short period time our revenue increased from million fiscal year 
million fiscal year recently however have not sustained this growth rate our revenue decreased million fiscal year 
and million fiscal year continue invest the development new technology and solutions and expect our research and

financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline 
are unable manage any future growth may not able execute our business plan and our operating results could suffer 
our business has grown rapidly our future operating results depend large extent our ability successfully manage any expansion and growth 
including the challenges managing company with headquarters the united states and the majority its employees asia are increasing our 
investment research and development and other functions grow our business and address new markets such the oem automotive market manage 
our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities being public company believe must effectively among other things 
recruit hire train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities particularly our offices

add additional sales and business development personnel 
add additional finance and accounting personnel 
maintain and improve our administrative financial and operational systems procedures and controls and 
enhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering adapting and expanding our 
systems and tool capabilities and properly training new hires their use 
are likely incur the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some the anticipated benefits and the return these 
investments any may lower may develop more slowly than expect may not materialize addition development products address 
emerging markets such the oem automotive market could negatively impact our ability develop new products for our current markets which may 
harm our financial condition particularly the near term 
are unable manage our growth effectively may not able take advantage market opportunities develop new solutions and 
may fail satisfy customer product support requirements maintain product quality execute our business plan respond competitive pressures 
while intend continue invest research and development may unable make the substantial investments that are required 
remain competitive our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment research and development order bring market new and enhanced solutions our 
research and development expense was million million and million fiscal years and respectively expect 
increase our research and development expenditures compared prior periods part our strategy focusing the development innovative video 
and image processing solutions with increased functionality such analytics computer vision capabilities and target new markets such the 
automotive oem and robotics markets are unable predict whether will have sufficient resources maintain the level investment research and 
development required remain competitive for example development the latest process nodes such and can cost significantly more than 
required develop larger process nodes such this added cost could prevent from being able maintain technology advantage over larger 
competitors that have significantly more resources invest research and development addition cannot assure you that the technologies which are 
the focus our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful generate any revenue 
may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses 
the rapidly evolving nature the markets which sell our solutions combined with substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may 
develop and other factors beyond our control limits our ability accurately forecast quarterly annual revenue addition because record 
significant portion our revenue from sales when have received notification from our distributors that they have sold our products some the revenue 
record quarter may derived from sales products shipped our distributors during previous quarters this revenue recognition methodology 
limits our ability forecast quarterly annual revenue accurately are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expenditures anticipation 
future revenue growth our revenue does not increase anticipated could incur significant losses due our higher expense levels are not able 
decrease our expenses timely manner offset any shortfall future revenue 
may experience difficulties demonstrating the value customers newer higher priced and higher margin solutions they believe existing 
solutions are adequate meet end customer expectations 
develop and introduce new solutions face the risk that customers may not value willing bear the cost incorporating these newer 
solutions into their products particularly they believe their customers are satisfied with current solutions regardless the improved features superior 
performance the newer solutions customers may unwilling adopt our new solutions due design pricing constraints owing the extensive time 
and resources that invest developing new solutions are unable sell customers new generations our solutions our revenue could decline and 
our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could negatively affected 
the complexity our solutions could result unforeseen delays expenses from undetected defects errors bugs hardware software which 
could reduce the market adoption our new solutions damage our reputation with current prospective customers and adversely affect our operating 
costs 
highly complex soc solutions such ours frequently contain defects errors and bugs when they are first introduced new versions are released 
have the past and may the future experience these defects errors and bugs any our solutions have reliability quality compatibility problems 
may not able successfully correct these problems timely manner all addition any our proprietary features contain defects errors 
bugs when first introduced new versions our solutions are released may unable timely correct these problems consequently our reputation 
may damaged and customers may reluctant buy our solutions which could harm our ability retain existing customers and attract new customers 
and could adversely affect our financial results addition these defects errors bugs could interrupt delay sales our customers any these 
problems are not found until after have commenced commercial production new product may incur significant additional development costs and 
product recall repair replacement costs these problems may also result claims against our customers others 
camera manufacturers incorporate components supplied multiple third parties and supply shortage delay delivery these components 
could delay orders for our solutions our customers 
our customers purchase components used the manufacture their cameras from various sources supply often involving several specialized 
components including lenses sensors and memory chips any supply shortage delay delivery third party component suppliers third party 
supplier cessation shut down its business may prevent delay production our customers products addition replacement substitute 
components may not available commercially reasonable terms all result delays delivery supply shortages third party components 
orders for our solutions may delayed canceled and our business may harmed for example disruption the availability image sensors from 
sony corporation result the april kumamoto japan earthquake impacted our customers ability build launch cameras and result 
negatively impacted the timing and scope demand for our socs the second and third quarters fiscal year similarly errors defects within 
camera system the manner which the various components interact could prevent delay production our customers products which could harm 
our business

transfer manufacturing new location supplier converting transferring manufacturing from primary location supplier backup fabrication 
facility could expensive and could take two more quarters during such transition would required meet customer demand from our thenexisting inventory well any partially finished goods that could modified the required product specifications not seek maintain 
sufficient inventory address lengthy transition period because believe uneconomical keep more than minimal inventory hand result 
may not able meet customer needs during such transition which could delay shipments cause production delays result decline our sales 
and damage our customer relationships 
may experience difficulties transitioning new wafer fabrication process technologies achieving higher levels design integration 
which may result reduced manufacturing yields delays product deliveries and increased costs 
aim use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that available from our third party foundries 
result periodically evaluate the benefits migrating our solutions smaller geometry process technologies order improve performance and reduce 
costs believe this strategy will help remain competitive these ongoing efforts require from time time modify the manufacturing processes for 
our products and redesign some products which turn may result delays product deliveries may face difficulties delays and increased expense 
transition our products new processes such the process nodes and potentially new foundries depend samsung and tsmc the 
principal foundries for our products transition new processes successfully cannot assure you that samsung tsmc will able effectively 
manage such transitions that will able maintain our relationship with samsung tsmc develop relationships with new foundries moreover 
utilize more advanced process nodes beyond are increasingly dependent upon samsung and tsmc who are two the few foundries 
currently available for certain advanced process technologies our foundry vendors experience significant delays transitioning smaller 
geometries fail efficiently implement transitions could experience reduced manufacturing yields delays product deliveries and increased costs 
all which could harm our relationships with our customers and our operating results new processes become more prevalent expect continue

our failure adequately protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability compete effectively defend ourselves from litigation 
which could harm our business financial condition and results operations 
our success depends part our ability protect our intellectual property rely primarily patent copyright trademark and trade secret 
laws well confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and other contractual protections protect our proprietary technologies and know how all 
which offer only limited protection the steps have taken protect our intellectual property rights may not adequate prevent misappropriation 
our proprietary information infringement our intellectual property rights and our ability prevent such misappropriation infringement uncertain 
particularly countries outside the united states the failure our patents adequately protect our technology might make easier for our competitors 
offer similar products technologies which would harm our business for example our patents and patent applications could opposed contested 
circumvented designed around our competitors declared invalid unenforceable judicial administrative proceedings our foreign patent 
protection generally not comprehensive our patent protection and may not protect our intellectual property some countries where our products 
are sold may sold the future many based companies have encountered substantial intellectual property infringement foreign countries 
including countries where sell products even foreign patents are granted effective enforcement foreign countries may not available for example 
the legal environment relating intellectual property protection china relatively weak often making difficult create and enforce such rights 
may not able effectively protect our intellectual property rights china elsewhere such impermissible use our intellectual property trade 
secrets were occur our ability sell our solutions competitive prices may adversely affected and our business financial condition operating results 
and cash flows could materially and adversely affected 
the legal standards relating the validity enforceability and scope protection intellectual property rights are uncertain and evolving 
cannot assure you that others will not develop patent similar superior technologies products services that our patents trademarks and other 
intellectual property will not challenged invalidated circumvented others 
unauthorized copying other misappropriation our proprietary technologies could enable third parties benefit from our technologies without 
paying for doing which could harm our business monitoring unauthorized use our intellectual property difficult and costly although are not 
aware any unauthorized use our intellectual property the past possible that unauthorized use our intellectual property may have occurred 
may occur without our knowledge cannot assure you that the steps have taken will prevent unauthorized use our intellectual property our failure 
effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value our technology licensing arrangements cross licensing negotiations 
may the future need initiate infringement claims litigation order try protect our intellectual property rights litigation whether 
are plaintiff defendant can expensive time consuming and may divert the efforts our technical staff and management which could harm our 
business whether not such litigation results determination favorable litigation also puts our patents risk being invalidated interpreted 
narrowly and our patent applications risk not being issued additionally any enforcement our patents other intellectual property may provoke 
third parties assert counterclaims against are unable protect our proprietary rights third parties independently develop gain access our 
similar technologies our business revenue reputation and competitive position could harmed 
third parties assertions infringement their intellectual property rights could result our having incur significant costs and cause our 
operating results suffer 
the semiconductor industry characterized vigorous protection and pursuit intellectual property rights and positions which has resulted 
protracted and expensive litigation for many companies certain our customers have received and expect particularly the extent gain greater 
market visibility that the future may receive communications from others alleging our infringement their patents trade secrets other intellectual 
property rights addition certain our end customers have been the subject lawsuits alleging infringement intellectual property rights products 
incorporating our solutions including the assertion that the alleged infringement may attributable least part our technology lawsuits resulting 
from such allegations could subject significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights though this has not occurred date any 
potential intellectual property litigation also could force one more the following 
stop selling products using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
lose the opportunity license our technology others collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion 
our intellectual property against others 
incur significant legal expenses 
pay substantial damages the party whose intellectual property rights may found infringing 
redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
attempt obtain license the relevant intellectual property from third parties which may not available reasonable terms 
all 
any significant impairment our intellectual property rights from any litigation face could harm our business and our ability compete 
any potential dispute involving our patents other intellectual property could affect our customers which could trigger our indemnification 
obligations them and result substantial expense 
any potential dispute involving our patents other intellectual property our customers could also become the target litigation certain our 
customers have received notices from third parties claiming have patent rights certain technology and inviting our customers license this technology 
and certain our end customers have been the subject lawsuits alleging infringement patents products incorporating our solutions including the 
assertion that the alleged infringement may attributable least part our technology because indemnify our customers for intellectual property 
claims made against them for products incorporating our technology any litigation could trigger technical support and indemnification obligations under 
some our license agreements which could result substantial expense although have not incurred significant indemnity expenses related 
intellectual property claims date anticipate that will receive requests for indemnity the future pursuant our license agreements with our 
customers addition other customers end customers with whom not have formal agreements requiring indemnify them may ask 
indemnify them claim made condition awarding future design wins because some our odms and oems are larger than are and have 
greater resources than they may more likely the target infringement claim third parties than would which could increase our 
chances becoming involved future lawsuit although have not yet been subject such claims any such claims were succeed might 
forced pay damages behalf our odms oems that could increase our expenses disrupt our ability sell our solutions and reduce our revenue 
addition the time and expense required for supply support indemnification our customers any such litigation could severely disrupt shut

system which refer design win our sales efforts are typically directed the oem the product that will incorporate our video and image 
processing solution but the eventual design and incorporation our soc into the product may handled odm behalf the oem volume 
production may begin within six months after design win depending the complexity our customer product and other factors upon which 
may have little influence once one our solutions has been incorporated into customer design believe that our solution likely remain 
component the customer product for its life cycle because the time and expense associated with redesigning product substituting alternative 
solution conversely design loss competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for generate future revenue from such customer product even 
obtain design win and our soc remains component through the life cycle customer product the volume and timing actual sales our socs 
the customer depend upon the production release and market acceptance that product none which are within our control portable consumer 
device typically has product life cycle six months 
fiscal year financial highlights and trends 
recorded revenue million fiscal year decrease compared fiscal year the decrease revenue was 
primarily due our major customer the sports camera market gopro inc gopro incorporating competing solution into one its 
recently released mainstream camera models that significantly reduced our sales gopro fiscal year compared fiscal year 
revenue from gopro declined from million fiscal year million fiscal year believe our revenue 
from gopro will continue decline over the foreseeable future the decrease was also attributable decline revenues from dajiang 
innovation technology inc dji the drone market the customer product mix shifted non ambarella based drones well 
continued weakness from smaller consumer drone customers the declined revenues sports camera and drone markets were partially offset 
strong revenue growth the security automotive and non sports wearable camera markets revenue growth the security camera market 
was primarily due solid performance the home security and monitoring camera market the automotive camera market increase 
shipments oem automotive video recorders plus growth shipments for the automotive aftermarket resulted strong revenue growth 
that market fiscal year 
recorded operating income million decrease compared fiscal year primarily due decrease gross 
margin increased stock based compensation expense and increased research and development costs the increase research and development 
costs was primarily the result increased headcount and costs associated with new soc development and research and development efforts 
the area computer vision technology principally for applications the automotive market 
generated cash flows from operating activities million fiscal year compared million fiscal year the 
decreased cash flows from operating activities were primarily due decreased net income result decreased revenue and increased 
operating expenses adjusted for increased non cash stock based compensation expense the decrease cash flows from operating activities 
also was attributable decreased liabilities associated with the timing payments suppliers and decreased deferred revenue the decrease 
was partially offset increased cash receipts associated with the timing payments from our customers

factors affecting our performance 
design wins closely monitor design wins customer and end market consider design wins critical our future success although 
design win may not successfully materialize into revenue and even they result revenue the amount generated each design win can vary significantly 
our long term sales expectations are based forecasts from customers and internal estimations customer demand factoring the expected time market 
for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential our ability accurately forecast demand however can adversely 
affected number factors including inaccurate forecasting our customers miscalculations our customers their inventory requirements changes 
market conditions adverse changes our product order mix and fluctuating demand for our customers products 
pricing product cost and margin our pricing and margins depend the volumes and the features the solutions provide our customers 
additionally make significant investments new solutions for both cost improvements and new features that expect drive revenue and maintain 
margins general solutions incorporated into more complex configurations such those used high performance camera infrastructure applications 
have higher prices and higher gross margins compared solutions sold into lower performing more competitive camera applications our average selling 
price can vary market and application due market specific supply and demand the maturation products launched previous years and the launch 
new products 
continually monitor the cost our solutions rely third party manufacturers for the production our products maintain close 
relationship with these suppliers continually monitor production yields component costs and design efficiencies 
shifting consumer preferences our revenue subject consumer preferences regarding form factor and functionality and how those preferences 
impact the video and image capture electronics that support for example improved smartphone video capture capabilities and the rapid adoption 
smartphones consumers led the decline pocket video cameras aimed the video and image capture market the current video and image capture 
market now characterized greater volume more specialized video and image capture devices that are less likely replaced with smartphones 
such wearable security uav and automotive cameras this increasing specialization video capture devices has changed our customer base and end 
markets and has impacted our revenue the future expect further changes the market continue impact our business performance 
continued concentration revenue end market historically our revenue has been significantly concentrated small number end markets 
fiscal year the majority our revenue came from the pocket video camcorder and infrastructure markets since that time have developed 
technologies provide solutions for new markets they emerged such the wearable security uav and automotive camera markets since fiscal year 
the wearable sports and professional security markets have been our largest end markets and sales into these markets collectively generated the 
majority our revenue believe however that expansion into new markets required facilitate revenue growth and customer diversification while 
will continue expand our end market exposure such home security and monitoring cameras non sports wearable cameras uavs automotive and 
virtual reality cameras anticipate that sales limited number end markets will continue account for significant percentage our total revenue 
for the foreseeable future our end market concentration may cause our financial performance fluctuate significantly from period period based the 
success failure products that our socs are designed into well the overall growth decline the video capture markets which compete 
addition derive significant portion our revenue from limited number odms who build products behalf limited number oems and from 
limited number oems whom ship directly believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue depend sales 
relatively small number customers 
ability capitalize connectivity trends mobile connected devices are ubiquitous today and play increasingly prominent role consumers 
lives the constant connectivity provided these devices has created demand for connected electronic peripherals such video and image capture 
devices our ability capitalize these trends supporting our end customers the development connected peripherals that seamlessly cooperate 
with other connected devices and allow consumers distribute and share video and images with online media platforms critical for our success have 
added wireless communication functionality into our solutions for wearable security uav and automotive cameras the combination our compression 
technology with wireless connectivity enables wireless video streaming and uploading videos and images the internet our solutions enable security 
camera systems stream video content either cloud infrastructure connected mobile devices and our solutions for wearable and uav cameras allow 
consumers quickly stream upload video and images social media platforms 
ability capitalize computer vision trends expect that computer vision functionality will become increasingly important requirement 
many our current and future markets including security wearable uav automotive and robotics markets result believe that our ability 
develop advanced computer vision technology enable and support customer product development emerging applications such advanced driverassistance systems object detection people recognition and machine learning and gain customer acceptance our technology platform and solutions will 
critical our future success 
sales volume typical camera design win that successfully launches into the marketplace can generate wide range sales volumes for our 
solutions depending the end market demand for our customers products this can depend several factors including the reputation the end 
customer market penetration product capabilities size the end market that the product addresses and our end customers ability sell their products 
certain cases may provide volume discounts sales our solutions which may offset lower manufacturing costs related higher volumes 
general our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle 
customer product life cycle estimate our customers product life cycles based the customer type product and end market general 
products launched the camera market have shorter life cycles than those sold into the infrastructure market typically commence commercial shipments 
from six months following design win however some markets more lengthy product and development cycles are possible depending the scope 
and nature the project portable consumer device typically has product life cycle six months the infrastructure market the product life cycle 
can range from months

cost revenue and gross margin 
cost revenue includes the cost materials such wafers processed third party foundries costs associated with packaging assembly and 
testing and our manufacturing support operations such logistics planning and quality assurance cost revenue also includes indirect costs such 
warranty inventory valuation reserves and other general overhead costs 
expect that our gross margin may fluctuate from period period result changes average selling price product mix and the introduction 
new products our competitors general solutions incorporated into more complex configurations such those used high performance 
cameras infrastructure applications have higher prices and higher gross margins compared solutions sold into the lower performance more 
competitive camera applications semiconductor products mature and unit volumes sold customers increase their average selling prices typically 
decline these declines may paired with improvements manufacturing yields and lower wafer packaging and test costs which offset some the margin 
reduction that could result from lower selling prices believe that our gross margin will decline the future continue penetrate the highly 
competitive camera market
