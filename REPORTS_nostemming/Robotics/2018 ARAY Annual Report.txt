market overview 
despite significant improvements cancer diagnosis and treatment cancer rates continue increase globally 
and are leading cause death according the world health organization cancer the second leading cause 
death worldwide and was responsible for million deaths globally nearly deaths due cancer 
and the number new cases expected rise about over the next decades 
cancers can broadly divided into two groups solid tumor cancers which are characterized the growth 
malignant tumors within the body areas such the brain lung liver breast prostate and hematological 
blood borne cancers such leukemia the most common causes cancer deaths are cancers lung liver 
colorectal stomach and breast the american cancer society the acs estimates that solid tumor cancers will 
account for approximately million approximately new cancer cases diagnosed annually 
traditional methods for the treatment solid tumor cancers include chemotherapy surgery and radiation 
therapy the most common type radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy which patients are treated 
with high energy radiation generated medical equipment external the patient the global radiotherapy 
equipment and software market has three main segments linear accelerators linacs treatment planning 
systems and radiation therapy simulators according the january radiation therapy equipment report 
global industry analysts inc linear accelerators represent the largest segment radiotherapy equipment and 
are forecast expand from estimated billion for reach billion the year treatment 
planning systems are poised grow billion from estimated billion increasing 
preference for non surgical options major factor promoting radiotherapy approximately cancer patients 
worldwide will undergo some form radiation therapy during the course their treatment while radiation therapy 
widely available the united states and western europe many developing countries currently not have 
sufficient number linacs adequately treat their domestic cancer patient populations believe increasing 
demand for advanced medical treatments many international markets and growth cancer incidences worldwide 
will continue drive demand for advanced linacs the coming years 
emerging markets are especially underequipped with external beam radiation therapy systems according 
publication called the lancet oncology commission radiation therapy required more than half the 
newly diagnosed cancer patients there was estimated shortage over linacs globally expected 
grow over this gap most pronounced low and middle income countries where only 
patients have access radiotherapy china alone estimated have shortfall over systems because 
increasing cancer incidence and aging population that estimated more than double 
radiation therapy 
radiation therapy used treat wide range cancer and tumor types using high energy radiation 
destroy cancer cells and shrink control the growth tumors radiation therapy works exposing clusters 
cancer cells tumors dose high energy radiation sufficient cause cell death and prevent cells from 
multiplying during external beam radiation therapy the clinician goal target radiation delivery the tumor 
precisely possible order maximize the radiation dose delivered cancerous tissue and minimize the 
exposure healthy tissue recent advances radiation therapy technologies have allowed clinicians further 
improve the ability target the radiation dose more precisely cancer cells while minimizing the exposure 
healthy tissue these advances include the following 
intensity modulated radiation therapy intensity modulated radiation therapy involves varying modulating 
the radiation beam intensity across the treatment area this technique aims conform the high dose region the 
radiation beam more closely with the shape the tumor enabling the delivery higher doses radiation 
tumors with reduced impact surrounding healthy tissue 
image guided radiation therapy igrt involves delivering radiation guided images the treatment area 
taken shortly before and during treatment using scan ray ultrasound other imaging technologies 
combining imaging with radiation treatment clinicians can adjust the patient position relative the radiation 
source prior each treatment target the tumor more precisely 
radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy radiosurgery form radiation therapy that uses 
precisely targeted radiation destroy tumors radiosurgery non invasive there cutting involved 
commonly used neurosurgeons treat conditions within the brain and spine sbrt treatment that uses 
precisely targeted radiation like radiosurgery destroy tumors located outside the brain and spine 
radiosurgery and sbrt typically involve the delivery single high dose radiation treatment few 
fractionated radiation treatments usually five ablate destroy all tissue within the tumor achieve the 
accuracy and precision required for both radiosurgery and sbrt image guidance during treatment the ability 
adjust the aim the beam real time compensate for tumor motion and wide range beam angles are 
critical for treatment 
adaptive radiation therapy adaptive radiation therapy involves adjusting patient radiation therapy plan 
during between fractions account for changes the patient anatomy the amount and location the 
radiation received the patient and the size shape and location the tumor while there widely accepted 
definition adaptive radiation therapy has been characterized include little adjustment the 
physical position the patient relative the radiation source prior treatment occurs during igrt rather 
than adjustment the treatment plan our approach based the belief that adaptive radiation therapy 
requires monitoring and adjustments the treatment plan facilitated both the regular acquisition updated 
quantitative images showing the location size shape and density the tumor and verification the radiation 
dose received the patient throughout the entire course treatment 
hypofractionation hypofractionation involves the delivery higher doses radiation fewer fractions than 
are used conventional radiation therapy higher doses radiation have been shown provide greater local 
control the tumor the advent innovative technological features radiation therapy treatment planning and 
delivery has enabled clinicians maximize the radiation dose administered tumors the patient improving 
local tumor control and some cases improving patient survival rates additional benefits hypofractionation 
include minimal side effects fewer treatments and greater scheduling convenience for the patient 
hypofractionation often used treat small targets throughout the body especially when located near critical 
structures including the brain head and neck spine lung and prostate also being used more frequently 
clinical applications where the radiobiology appropriate for fewer fractions higher doses including the 
prostate and breast 
despite advances radiation therapy techniques most commercially available radiation therapy systems 
from other manufacturers still present significant limitations that restrict clinicians ability provide the most 
precise treatment possible these limitations include 
limited versatility and precision the arm configuration traditional radiation therapy systems has 
limited range and speed motion because its size and mechanical structure arm linac architecture 
limited delivering radiation single plane coplanar thus limiting its radiation delivery capability for 
complex and advanced cases additionally most previously existing mlcs which modulate shape the 
radiation beams have mechanical limitations that reduce their beam shaping ability and the speed which they 
operate these design elements limit the motion and dynamic range imrt intensities capable being 
delivered traditional radiation therapy systems and often make challenging achieve the precision needed 
maximize dose the tumor while avoiding damage healthy tissue and minimizing side effects these 
limited treatment angles reduce the ability deliver precisely targeted radiation that minimizes exposure 
healthy tissue such imprecision may prevent clinicians from treating tumors near sensitive anatomic structures 
such the eye the spinal cord from treating patients area the body that was previously exposed 
radiation and may unable tolerate additional exposure 
limited ability provide frequent quantitative images precise radiation therapy requires frequent images 
that accurately depict the size shape and location the tumor many traditional radiation therapy systems use 
imaging technologies that are not generally used daily basis generate quantitative assessment the 
patient and target volume position due concerns about the additional radiation exposure addition 
traditional radiation therapy systems measure the amount radiation emitted the device based the 
system performance specifications this calculation does not provide the clinician with data regarding the 
amount radiation that was received the patient what tissue within the patient body received any 
particular amount radiation since common for internal organs shift and for the size the tumor 
change during the course treatment failure obtain updated images and adapt the patient and plan 
throughout the course treatment may result portion potentially all the radiation dose missing the 
tumor and instead being absorbed healthy tissue 
failure integrate multiple functions the basic architecture for traditional radiation therapy systems 
pre dates many recent advances that enable integrated imaging treatment planning dose verification quality 
assurance capabilities necessary for more advanced treatment protocols some conventional systems have been 
subsequently adapted include certain elements this functionality incorporating modular add devices 
legacy linac designs these separate modular components can provide imaging treatment planning quality 
assurance procedures post treatment analysis functionality however this add architectural approach can 
have safety accuracy and workflow implications because the manual methods used for checking proper 
system operation 
development radiosurgery 
advanced radiation therapy systems designed deliver radiosurgery stereotactic body radiation therapy differ 
from traditional radiation therapy systems that they are designed deliver very high cumulative dose 
radiation single small number treatments precisely targeted the tumor rather than region that 
consists the tumor plus healthy tissue that surrounds the tumor area the more accurate delivery radiation 
allows higher doses delivered increasing the probability tumor cell death and better local control 
addition radiosurgery can administered patients who have inoperable surgically complex tumors who 
may prefer clinically effective non surgical treatment option

daily quantitative imaging for better identification tumors dose verification and treatment planning the 
radixact systems offer integrated quantitative imaging capabilities which depict the density tumors and 
healthy tissue more accurately than traditional radiation therapy systems have recently launched our ctrue 
iterative reconstruction imaging technology which uses low intensity fan beam collect quantitative 
images prior each treatment these images allow lung tissue fat muscle and bone clearly distinguished 
addition because the low radiation dose involved the clinician can collect daily quantitative images which can 
used monitor changes the patient internal anatomy and quickly adapt the plan those changes deemed 
clinically necessary believe daily quantitative low dose images are essential enabling optimal patient 
treatment helping ensure that original clinical objectives are achieved from the first fraction the last 
integrated treatment system for precise radiation delivery believe the integration our imaging 
technology treatment planning and helical delivery mode radiation beams enables highly accurate and precise 
radiation therapy our planning software allows clinicians establish the contours tumor and any normal radiosensitive structures close proximity the treatment beam the tomotherapy systems use intelligent dose 
optimization algorithm ensure the radiation beam conforms the patient tumor and minimizes exposure 
surrounding healthy tissue structures providing highly targeted and effective dose distribution these features 
significantly benefit patients increasing the radiation delivered cancerous tissues while avoiding damage 
nearby healthy tissues thus also minimizing side effects 
efficient clinical workflow for image guided radiation therapy igrt and adaptive radiation therapy 
the tomotherapy systems integrate into single system all the key elements for radiation therapy including 
treatment planning image guided patient positioning treatment delivery quality assurance and adaptive 
planning the imaging and treatment planning capabilities many traditional systems are more modular require 
cumbersome add ons separate treatment planning systems that result clinicians taking more steps between 
scanning planning and treatment patients conversely the integrated ctrue imaging and treatment features 
the radixact systems allow clinicians scan plan and treat cancer patients efficiently treatment plans well 
daily images can easily accessed remotely enabling clinical teams collaboratively work together regardless 
location ensuring high quality plan development and delivery 
low barriers installation and implementation all external beam radiation systems must housed 
rooms which have special radiation shielding capture any radiation not absorbed the patient the 
tomotherapy systems size and self contained design allow customers retrofit them into existing treatment 
rooms previously used for legacy radiation therapy systems and avoid reduce the significant construction costs 
that can associated with building new larger treatment rooms which are often required other radiation therapy 
systems with both imaging and radiation delivery capabilities integrated ring gantry the tomotherapy 
systems require less space than other linac systems which use large moving arms position the linac 
incorporate adjacent imaging equipment used for treatment planning addition because the tomotherapy 
systems have integrated radiation beam stop which shields radiation that passes through the patient they require 
less radiation shielding treatment room walls compared traditional systems also preassemble test and 
commission each tomotherapy system our manufacturing facility and ship the system almost fully assembled 
this process typically allows radiation beam on within four days after delivery and first patient treatments 
begin within days after delivery 
platform for further technological advancements adaptive radiation therapy believe the 
tomotherapy systems are uniquely positioned enable truly adaptive radiation therapy because their unique 
ability provide daily quantitative images high speed delivery radiation from fixed beam angles helically 
from degrees around the body and real time verification the dose received the patient believe the 
combination these design features and our integrated treatment planning and optimization software will allow 
continue enhance the tomotherapy systems adaptive capabilities enable clinicians routinely and easily 
adjust patient treatment needed thereby remaining true the intent the original treatment plan 
addition the functionality listed above the tomotherapy systems may enhanced with the following 
product options tomodirect mode and tomoedge delivery key capabilities these options are follow 
tomodirect mode tomodirect standard the tomotherapy hda model and radixact and 
models the tomodirect mode discrete angle non rotational delivery mode for the tomotherapy systems

have entered into collaboration agreements with variety industrial partners within the fields radiation 
oncology and medical imaging provide with opportunities accelerate our innovation capability and bring 
complimentary products and technologies market continue seek out new partnerships complement our 
internal developments and implement our product strategies 
competition 
the medical device industry general and the non invasive cancer treatment field particular are subject 
intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies because our products often have long 
development and regulatory clearance and approval cycles must anticipate changes the marketplace and the 
direction technological innovation and customer demands compete successfully will need continue 
demonstrate the advantages our products and technologies over well established alternative procedures products 
and technologies and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers the advantages our products 
and technologies traditional surgery and other forms minimally invasive procedures brachytherapy 
chemotherapy and other drugs remain alternatives the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
new product sales this competitive market are primarily dominated two companies elekta elekta and 
varian medical systems inc varian some manufacturers standard linac systems including varian and elekta 
have products that can used combination with body and head frame systems and image guidance systems 
perform both radiosurgical and radiotherapy procedures our other competitors include brainlab brainlab 
viewray inc viewray and other companies the radiosurgical and radiation therapy markets 
furthermore many government academic and business entities are investing substantial resources research 
and development cancer treatments including surgical approaches radiation treatment mri guided radiotherapy 
systems proton therapy systems drug treatment immunotherapy gene therapy and other approaches successful 
developments that result new approaches for the treatment cancer could reduce the attractiveness our 
products render them obsolete 
our future success will depend large part our ability establish and maintain competitive position 
current and future technologies rapid technological development may render the cyberknife and tomotherapy 
systems and their technologies obsolete many our competitors have may have greater corporate financial 
operational sales and marketing resources and more experience research and development than have 
cannot assume that our competitors will not succeed developing marketing technologies products that are 
more effective commercially attractive than our products that would render our technologies and products 
obsolete less useful may not have the financial resources technical expertise marketing distribution 
support capabilities compete successfully the future our competitive position also depends among other 
things 
widespread awareness acceptance and adoption our products the radiation oncology and cancer 
therapy markets 
innovations that improve the effectiveness and productivity our systems treatment processes and enable 
them address emerging customer needs 
availability reimbursement coverage from third party payors including insurance companies 
governments and others for procedures performed using our systems 
published peer reviewed data supporting the efficacy and safety our systems 
limiting the time required from proof feasibility routine production 
limiting the time period and cost regulatory approvals clearances 
the manufacture and delivery our products sufficient volumes time and accurately predicting and 
controlling costs associated with manufacturing installation warranty and maintenance the products 
our ability attract and retain qualified personnel 
the extent our intellectual property protection our ability otherwise develop proprietary products and 
processes 
securing sufficient capital resources expand both our continued research and development and sales and 
marketing efforts and 
obtaining and maintaining any necessary united states foreign regulatory approvals clearances 
our customers equipment purchase considerations typically include reliability treatment quality service 
capabilities patient throughput price payment terms and equipment supplier viability believe compete 
favorably with our competitors price and value based upon the technology offered our treatment systems 
strive provide technologically superior product that covers substantially all aspects radiation therapy 
deliver precise treatments with high quality clinical outcomes that meet exceed customer expectations 
addition competition from technologies performing similar functions our treatment systems competition 
also exists for the limited capital expenditure budgets our customers for example our treatment systems may 
compete with other equipment required radiation therapy department for financing under the same capital 
expenditure budget which typically limited purchaser such hospital cancer treatment center may 
required select between the two items capital equipment our ability compete may also adversely affected 
when purchase decisions are based solely upon price since our products are premium priced systems due their 
higher level functionality and performance 
reimbursement 
the united states healthcare providers that purchase capital equipment such the cyberknife and 
tomotherapy systems generally rely government and private third party payors for reimbursement for the 
healthcare treatment and services they provide examples these types payors include medicare medicaid 
private health insurance plans and health maintenance organizations which reimburse all portion the cost 
treatment well related healthcare services reimbursement involves three components coverage coding and 
payment 
coverage 
there are currently national coverage determinations place under medicare for cyberknife 
tomotherapy treatment coverage criteria for treatment with cyberknife and tomotherapy outlined local 
determinations the absence formal policy treatment covered long considered reasonable and 
necessary the most common indications covered medicare local coverage determinations for radiotherapy are 
primary and metastatic tumors the brain spine lung liver kidney pancreas adrenal gland head and neck breast 
prostate abdominal and retroperitoneal regions well other cancers that have failed previous treatment 
commercial payor policies vary with respect coverage for radiotherapy including many the indications covered 
medicare though coverage criteria may differ 
coding 
the codes that are used report radiosurgery treatment delivery for the hospital outpatient department 
are current procedural terminology cpt codes and for single fraction intracranial radiosurgery and 
single fraction extracranial multi session radiosurgery stereotactic body radiation therapy for freestanding centers 
robotic radiosurgery billed with robotic radiosurgery healthcare common procedural codes hcpcs and 
the non robotic srs sbrt codes and are also payable codes the freestanding site 
service for non robotic srs sbrt 
the hospital outpatient department imrt delivery billed under cpt code for prostate breast 
and physical compensator imrt and for all other treatments for crt three codes are used report 
simple intermediate and complex treatments treatments using our tomotherapy systems which are considered 
complex treatments are reported under the complex crt code december the patient access 
and medicare protection act stopped the imrt and crt delivery codes from being implemented the 
freestanding center setting until the bipartisan budget act extended this freeze for additional year 
through calendar year until series temporary codes will used instead for non robotic srs and 
sbrt billed under cpt codes and the freeze did not apply and temporary codes were not assigned 
these services expect all valid delivery codes will recognized commercial payers other codes are used 
report treatment planning dosimetry treatment management and other procedures routinely performed for 
treating radiosurgery radiotherapy patients 
payment 
the united states the majority procedures using the cyberknife tomotherapy and radixact systems are 
performed the hospital outpatient department payment rates are established based cost data submitted 
hospitals the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms pays separately for ancillary procedures 
addition the delivery imrt crt and srs sbrt well comprehensive apc that bundles delivery 
and some ancillary services for single session cranial radiosurgery major changes payment cms have 
occurred the past three years and none are proposed for payment rates proposed would result slight 
increases for all modalities 
payment for treatment with cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are also available the freestanding center 
setting the primary treatment delivery codes for robotic radiosurgery are carrier priced under medicare and 
payment ranges from low payment parity with hospitals above the hospital rates expected the 
robotic srs sbrt delivery codes will remain contractor priced payment rates for imrt and procedures are 
set cms with adjustments account for geographic market variations major cuts cms have occurred 
imrt and the past three years and payment expected remain stable through mandated 
the patient access and medicare protection act and the bipartisan budget act for delivery nonrobotic sbrt cms has proposed significant cut which would the first four similar cuts 
through this proposal finalized while our freestanding center installed base that performs significant 
volume sbrt extremely small this proposal could have slight negative impact our business not 
overturned 
the federal government reviews and adjust rates annually and from time time consider various medicare and 
other healthcare reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for 
healthcare services including radiotherapy and radiosurgery hospitals and free standing clinics the past 
have seen our customers decision making process complicated the uncertainties surrounding reimbursement 
rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery the united states state government reimbursement for services 
determined pursuant each state medicaid plan which established state law and regulations subject 
requirements federal law and regulations 
foreign reimbursement 
internationally reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary from country country and include 
single payor government managed systems well systems which private payors and government managed 
systems exist side side general the process obtaining coverage approvals has been slower outside the 
united states our ability achieve adoption our treatment systems and significant sales volume international 
markets will depend part the availability reimbursement for procedures performed using our products 
regulatory matters 
domestic regulation 
our products and software are medical devices subject regulation the fda well other regulatory 
bodies fda regulations govern the following activities that perform and will continue perform ensure 
medical products distributed domestically exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses 
product design and development 
document and purchasing controls 
production and process controls 
labeling and packaging controls 
product storage 
recordkeeping 
servicing 
corrective and preventive action and complaint handling 
pre market clearance approval 
advertising and promotion and 
product sales and distribution 
fda pre market clearance and approval requirements unless exemption applies each medical device 
wish commercially distribute the united states will require either clearance pre market approval 
from the fda the fda classifies medical devices into one three classes devices deemed pose lower risks are 
placed either class which requires the manufacturer submit the fda pre market notification 
requesting permission commercially distribute the device known clearance some low risk devices are 
exempted from this requirement devices deemed the fda pose the greatest risks such life sustaining 
life supporting implantable devices devices deemed not substantially equivalent previously cleared 
devices are placed class iii requiring pre market approval all our current products are class devices 
requiring clearances 
clearance pathway when clearance required must submit pre market notification 
demonstrating that our proposed device substantially equivalent previously cleared and legally marketed 
device device that was commercial distribution before may for which the fda has not yet 
called for the submission pre market approval applications pma statute the fda has targets clear 
deny pre market notification after days review from submission the application clearance 
generally takes longer the fda may require further information including clinical data make determination 
regarding substantial equivalence 
january received clearance for the tomotherapy art system intended used 
integrated system for the planning and delivery imrt for the treatment cancer august received 
clearance for our tomodirect system june received clearance for the radixact 
treatment delivery platform also received clearance for our new treatment planning and data 
management systems accuray precision treatment planning system and idms data management system

image guided stereotactic radiosurgery and precision radiotherapy for lesions tumors and conditions anywhere 
the body where radiation treatment indicated april received clearance for the synchrony 
motion tracking system option the cyberknife system intended enable dynamic image guided 
stereotactic radiosurgery and precision radiotherapy lesions tumors and conditions that move under influence 
respiration october received clearance for the incise mlc with clearance from the fda 
july 
pre market approval pma pathway pma must submitted the fda the device not eligible for 
the clearance process pma must supported extensive data including but not limited technical 
preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling demonstrate reasonable evidence the device safety and 
efficacy the fda satisfaction currently device have developed and commercialized has required 
pre market approval 
product modifications after device receives clearance pma approval may changed 
modified any modification that could significantly affect its safety effectiveness that would constitute 
significant change its intended use will require new clearance approval regulations provide that the 
manufacturer initially determines when specific modification requires notification fda the fda has issued 
draft guidance that finalized and implemented will result manufacturers needing seek significant number 
new clearances for changes made legally marketed devices the fda reviews the manufacturer decision 
file pma for modifications during facility audits 
have modified aspects our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems since receiving regulatory clearance 
and have applied for and obtained additional clearances for these modifications when determined such 
clearances were required the fda may review our filing decision and can disagree with our initial 
determination fda may take regulatory action from requiring new filings injunction disagrees with our 
determinations not seek new clearance pma approval for modifications the fda reviewed and 
cleared the most recent versions the cyberknife system and tomotherapy systems including the radixact 
system this fiscal year 
pervasive and continuing regulation after device placed the market numerous regulatory 
requirements apply these include 
quality system regulation qsr which require manufacturers including third party manufacturers 
follow stringent design testing documentation and other quality assurance procedures during product design 
and throughout the manufacturing process 
labeling regulations and fda prohibitions against the promotion products for uncleared unapproved 
off label uses and 
medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report the fda their device may 
have caused contributed death serious injury malfunctioned way that would likely cause 
contribute death serious injury the malfunction were recur 
the fda has broad post market and regulatory enforcement powers are subject unannounced inspections 
the fda and the food and drug branch the california department health services determine our 
compliance with the qsr and other regulations and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities 
some our subcontractors our sunnyvale facility where manufacture the cyberknife systems was most 
recently inspected the fda august the august inspection resulted observations addition 
our madison facility where manufacture the finished tomotherapy and cyberknife systems was most recently 
inspected the fda july the july inspection resulted observations believe are 
substantial compliance with the qsr failure comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result 
enforcement action the fda which may include any the following sanctions 
fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties 
recall seizure our products 
operating restrictions partial suspension total shutdown production 
refusing our requests for clearance pre market approval new products new intended uses 
withdrawing clearance pre market approvals that are already granted and 
criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority require repair replace refund the cost any medical device that 
have manufactured distributed any these events were occur they could have material adverse effect 
our business 
radiological health because our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems contain both laser and ray 
components and because assemble these components during manufacturing and service activities are also 
regulated under the electronic product radiation control provisions the united states federal food drug and 
cosmetic act this law requires laser and ray products comply with regulations and applicable performance 
standards and manufacturers these products certify product labeling and reports the fda that their 
products comply with all such standards the law also requires manufacturers file new product reports and file 
annual reports and maintain manufacturing testing and sales records and report product defects various warning 
labels must affixed assemblers diagnostic ray systems are also required certify reports the fda 
equipment purchasers and where applicable state agencies responsible for radiation protection that diagnostic 
and therapeutic ray systems they assemble meet applicable requirements failure comply with these 
requirements could result enforcement action the fda which can include injunctions civil penalties and the 
issuance warning letters 
fraud and abuse laws are subject various federal and state laws pertaining healthcare fraud and 
abuse including anti kickback laws and physician self referral laws violations these laws are punishable 
significant criminal and civil sanctions including some instances exclusion from participation federal and 
state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid because the far reaching nature these laws there 
can assurance that would not required alter one more our practices compliance with 
these laws evolving interpretations current laws the adoption new federal state laws regulations could 
adversely affect many the arrangements have with customers and physicians addition there can 
assurance that the occurrence one more violations these laws regulations would not result material 
adverse effect our financial condition and results operations 
anti kickback laws our operations are subject broad and changing federal and state anti kickback laws the 
office the inspector general the department health and human services oig primarily responsible for 
enforcing the federal anti kickback statute and generally for identifying fraud and abuse activities affecting 
government programs the federal anti kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting 
receiving offering providing remuneration directly indirectly induce either the referral individual 
the furnishing recommending arranging good service for which payment may made under federal 
healthcare program such medicare and medicaid remuneration has been broadly interpreted include 
anything value including such items gifts discounts the furnishing supplies equipment credit 
arrangements waiver payments and providing anything value less than fair market value 
penalties for violating the federal anti kickback statute include criminal fines and 
imprisonment for five years for each violation civil monetary penalties which could result treble damages 
plus fines for each violation and possible exclusion from participation federal healthcare 
programs such medicare and medicaid many states have adopted prohibitions similar the federal 
anti kickback statute some which apply the referral patients for healthcare services reimbursed any 
source not only the medicare and medicaid programs and not include comparable exceptions 
the oig has issued safe harbor regulations which set forth certain activities and business relationships that are 
deemed safe from prosecution under the federal anti kickback statute there are safe harbors for various types 
arrangements including without limitation certain investment interests leases and personal services and 
management contracts the failure particular activity comply all regards with the safe harbor regulations 
does not mean that the activity violates the federal anti kickback statute that prosecution will pursued 
however conduct and business arrangements that not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result 
increased scrutiny government enforcement authorities such the oig 
the oig has identified the following arrangements with purchasers and their agents ones raising potential risk 
violation the federal anti kickback statute 
discount and free good arrangements that are not properly disclosed accurately reported federal 
healthcare programs 
product support services including billing assistance reimbursement consultation and other services 
specifically tied support the purchased product offered tandem with another service program 
such reimbursement guarantee that confers benefit the purchaser 
educational grants conditioned whole part the purchase equipment otherwise 
inappropriately influenced sales and marketing considerations 
research funding arrangements particularly post marketing research activities that are linked directly 
indirectly the purchase products otherwise inappropriately influenced sales and marketing 
considerations and 
other offers remuneration purchasers that are expressly impliedly related sale sales volume 
such rebates and upfront payments other free reduced price goods services and payments 
cover costs converting from competitor products particularly where the selection criteria for such 
offers vary with the volume value business generated 
have variety financial relationships with physicians who are position generate business for for 
example physicians who own our stock also provide medical advisory and other consulting collaboration 
services similarly have variety different types arrangements with our customers the case our 
former placement program certain services and upgrades were provided without additional charge based 
procedure volume the past have also provided loans our customers also provide research 
educational grants customers support customer studies related among other things our cyberknife and 
tomotherapy systems 
our past present operations are found violation the federal anti kickback statute similar 
government regulations which our customers are subject our officers may subject the 
applicable penalty associated with the violation including significant civil and criminal penalties damages fines 
imprisonment and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs the impact any such violation may lead 
curtailment restructuring our operations any penalties damages fines curtailment restructuring 
our operations could adversely affect our ability operate our business and our financial results the risk our 
being found violation these laws increased the fact that some these laws are open variety 
interpretations any action against for violation these laws even successfully defend against could 
cause incur significant legal expenses divert our management attention from the operation our business 
and damage our reputation enforcement action were occur our reputation and our business and financial 
condition could harmed even were prevail settle the action similarly the physicians other 
providers entities with which business are found non compliant with applicable laws they may 
subject sanctions which could also have negative impact our business 
transparency laws the physician payment sunshine act the sunshine act which was enacted congress 
part the patient protection and affordable care act december requires each applicable 
manufacturer which includes medical device companies such accuray track and report the federal 
government annual basis all payments and other transfers value from such applicable manufacturer 
licensed physicians and teaching hospitals well physician ownership such applicable manufacturer equity 
each case subject certain statutory exceptions such data will made available the government 
publicly searchable website failure comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed the 
sunshine act can result civil monetary penalties ranging from for each payment other 
transfer value that not reported maximum per reporting period and from 
for each knowing failure report maximum million per reporting period addition 
are subject similar state and foreign laws related the tracking and reporting payments and other transfers 
value healthcare professionals these laws require will require that implement the necessary and costly 
infrastructure track and report such payments and transfers value failure comply with these new tracking 
and reporting laws could subject significant civil monetary penalties 
physician self referral laws are also subject federal and state physician self referral laws the federal 
ethics patient referrals act commonly known the stark law prohibits subject certain exceptions 
physician referrals medicare and medicaid patients entity providing certain designated health services 
the physician immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity the stark law also 
prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good service furnished pursuant unlawful referral 
addition july cms issued final rule implementing significant amendments the regulations under 
the stark law the final rule which was effective october imposes additional limitations the ability 
physicians refer patients medical facilities which the physician immediate family member has 
ownership interest for treatment among other things the rule provides that leases equipment between physician 
owners that may refer patients and hospitals must fixed rate rather than per use basis prior enactment 
the final rule physician owned entities had increasingly become involved the acquisition medical 
technologies including the cyberknife system many cases these entities entered into arrangements with 
hospitals that billed medicare for the furnishing medical services and the physician owners were among the 
physicians who referred patients the entity for services the rule limits these arrangements and could require the 
restructuring existing arrangements between physicians owned entities and hospitals and could discourage 
physicians from participating the acquisition and ownership medical technologies the final rule also prohibits 
percentage based compensation equipment leases result the finalization these regulations some 
existing cyberknife system operators have modified restructured their corporate organizational structures 
addition certain customers that planned open cyberknife centers the united states involving physician 
ownership have restructured their legal ownership structure certain entities were not able establish viable models 
for cyberknife system operation and therefore canceled their cyberknife system purchase agreements 
accordingly these regulations have resulted cancellations cyberknife system purchase agreements and could 
also reduce the attractiveness medical technology acquisitions including cyberknife system purchases 
physician owned joint ventures similar entities result these regulations have had and could continue 
have adverse impact our product sales and therefore our business and results operations 
person who engages scheme circumvent the stark law referral prohibition may fined 
for each such arrangement scheme addition any person who presents causes presented 
claim the medicare medicaid programs violations the stark law subject civil monetary penalties 
per bill submission assessment three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion 
from federal healthcare programs such medicare and medicaid various states have corollary laws the stark 
law including laws that require physicians disclose any financial interest they may have with healthcare 
provider their patients when referring patients that provider both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary 
from state state 
federal false claims act the federal false claims act prohibits the knowing filing causing the filing 
false claim the knowing use false statements obtain payment from the federal government when entity 
determined have violated the false claims act may required pay three times the actual damages sustained 
the government plus mandatory civil penalties between and for each separate false claim 
suits filed under the false claims act known qui tam actions can brought any individual behalf 
the government and such individuals sometimes known relators more commonly whistleblowers may 
share any amounts paid the entity the government fines settlement addition certain states have 
enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act qui tam actions have increased significantly recent 
years causing greater numbers healthcare companies have defend false claim action pay fines 
excluded from medicare medicaid other federal state healthcare programs result investigation 
arising out such action have retained the services reimbursement consultant for which pay certain 
consulting fees provide and facilities that have purchased cyberknife tomotherapy system with general 
reimbursement advice while believe this will assist our customers filing proper claims for reimbursement 
and even though such consultants not submit claims behalf our customers the fact that provide these 
consultant services could expose additional scrutiny and possible liability the event one our customers 
investigated and determined violation any these laws 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa created two new federal

not begin use increase the use the cyberknife tomotherapy systems unless they determine based 
experience clinical data and other factors that the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are safe and effective 
alternatives traditional treatment methods further physicians may slow adopt new updated versions 
our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems because the perceived liability risks arising from the use new 
products and the uncertainty reimbursement from third party payors particularly light ongoing health care 
reform initiatives and the evolving health care environment 
often need educate physicians about the use stereotactic radiosurgery igrt and adaptive radiation 
therapy convince healthcare payors that the benefits the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and their related 
treatment processes outweigh their costs and help train qualified physicians the skilled use these systems 
addition also must educate prospective customers regarding the entire functionality our radiation therapy 
systems and their relative benefits compared alternative products and treatment methods must also increase 
awareness among potential patients who are increasingly educated about treatment options and therefore impact 
adoption new technologies clinicians have expended and will continue expend significant resources 
marketing and educational efforts create awareness stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic imrt well 
adaptive radiation therapy and igrt generally and encourage the acceptance and adoption our products for 
these technologies cannot sure that our products will gain significant market acceptance among physicians

our operating results including our quarterly orders revenues and margins fluctuate from quarter quarter 
and may unpredictable which may result decline our stock price 
have experienced and expect the future experience fluctuations our operating results including gross 
orders revenues and margins from period period drivers orders include the introduction and timing new 
product product enhancement announcements and our competitors the timing regulatory approvals 
well changes anticipated changes third party reimbursement amounts policies applicable treatments 
using our products the availability economic stimulus packages other government funding reductions 
thereof may also affect timing customer purchases our products have high unit price and require significant 
capital expenditures our customers accordingly experience long sales and implementation cycles which 
greater concern during volatile economic environment where have had customers delay cancel orders 
when orders are placed installation delivery shipping applicable accomplished and the revenues 
recognized affect our quarterly results further because the high unit price the cyberknife and tomotherapy 
systems and the relatively small number units sold installed each quarter each sale installation 
cyberknife tomotherapy system can represent significant percentage our net orders backlog revenue for 
particular quarter and shifts sales installation from one quarter another may have significant effects for 
example multi system sales involve additional complexities the transaction and require longer timeline 
finalize the sale which make more difficult predict the quarter which the sale will occur 
once orders are received and booked into backlog factors that may affect whether these orders become revenue 
are cancelled deemed aged out and reflected reduction net orders and the timing revenue include 
economic political instability foreign countries 
delays the customer obtaining funding financing 
delays construction the customer site and delays installation 
delays the customer obtaining receipt local foreign regulatory approvals such certificates need

management discussion and analysis financial condition and results operations 
because many our operating expenses are based anticipated sales and high percentage these expenses 
are fixed for the short term small variation the timing revenue recognition can cause significant variations 
operating results from quarter quarter our overall gross margins are impacted number factors described 
our risk factor entitled our ability achieve profitability depends part maintaining increasing our gross 
margins product sales and services which may not able achieve our financial results fall below the 
expectation securities analysts and investors the trading price our common stock would almost certainly 
decline 
report quarterly and annual basis our orders and backlog unlike revenues orders and backlog are not 
defined gaap and are not within the scope the audit conducted our independent registered public 
accounting firm also for the reasons discussed management discussion and analysis financial condition 
and results operations our orders and backlog cannot necessarily relied upon accurate predictors future 
revenues order cancellation significant delays installation date will reduce our backlog and future revenues 
and cannot predict when orders will mature into revenues particularly high levels cancellations 
age outs one more periods may cause our revenue and gross margins decline current future periods and 
will make difficult compare our operating results from quarter quarter cannot assure you that our 
backlog will result revenue timely basis all that any cancelled contracts will replaced 
our industry subject intense competition and rapid technological change which may result products 
new tumor treatments that are superior the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are unable 
anticipate keep pace with changes the marketplace and the direction technological innovation and 
customer demands our products may become obsolete less useful and our operating results will suffer 
the medical device industry general and the non invasive cancer treatment field particular are subject 
intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies because our products often have long 
development and government approval cycles must anticipate changes the marketplace and the direction 
technological innovation and customer demands compete successfully will need continue demonstrate 
the advantages our products and technologies over well established alternative procedures products and 
technologies and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers the advantages our products and 
technologies traditional surgery and other forms minimally invasive procedures brachytherapy chemotherapy 
other drugs remain alternatives the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
consider the competition for the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems existing radiation therapy 
systems primarily using arm linacs which are sold large well capitalized companies with significantly greater 
market share and resources than have several these competitors are also able leverage their fixed sales 
service and other costs over multiple products product lines particular compete with number existing 
radiation therapy equipment companies including varian medical systems inc elekta brainlab and 
viewray inc varian has been the leader the external beam radiation therapy market for many years and has the 
majority market share for radiation therapy systems worldwide general because aging demographics and 
attractive market factors oncology believe that new competitors will enter the radiosurgery and radiation 
therapy markets the years ahead october varian announced new line arm gantries called the 
edge systems which varian claims are specifically designed for radiosurgery compete with our cyberknife 
systems addition some manufacturers conventional linac based radiation therapy systems including varian 
and elekta have products that can used combination with body and head frames and image guidance 
systems perform both radiosurgical and radiotherapy procedures may varian launched new radiation 
therapy product called halcyon which they have positioned against our tomotherapy product line 
furthermore many government academic and business entities are investing substantial resources research 
and development cancer treatments including surgical approaches radiation treatment mri guided radiotherapy 
systems proton therapy systems drug treatment gene therapy which the treatment disease replacing 
manipulating supplementing nonfunctional genes and other approaches successful developments that result 
new approaches for the treatment cancer could reduce the attractiveness our products render them obsolete 
our future success will depend large part our ability establish and maintain competitive position 
current and future technologies rapid technological development may render the cyberknife and tomotherapy 
systems and their technologies obsolete many our competitors have may have greater corporate financial 
operational sales and marketing resources and more experience and resources research and development than 
have cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed developing marketing technologies 
products that are more effective commercially attractive than our products that would render our technologies 
and products obsolete less useful may not have the financial resources technical expertise marketing 
distribution support capabilities compete successfully the future addition some our competitors may 
compete changing their pricing model lowering the price their products are unable maintain 
increase our selling prices our revenue and gross margins may suffer our success will depend large part our 
ability maintain competitive position with our technologies 
international sales our products account for significant portion our revenue which exposes risks 
inherent international operations 
our international sales percentage total revenue have increased over the last five fiscal years the 
percentage our revenue derived from sales outside the americas region was both 
and accommodate our international sales have invested significant financial and management 
resources develop international infrastructure that will meet the needs our customers anticipate that 
significant portion our revenue will continue derived from sales our products foreign markets and that 
the percentage our overall revenue that derived from these markets may continue increase this revenue and 
related operations will therefore continue subject the risks associated with international operations 
including 
economic political instability foreign countries including the market volatility resulting from the 
initiation the united kingdom the uk exit the european union the eu brexit 
import delays 
changes foreign regulatory laws governing among other matters the clearance approval and sales 
medical devices 
the potential failure comply with foreign regulatory requirements sell and market our products 
longer payment cycles associated with many customers outside the united states 
adequate coverage and reimbursement for the cyberknife and tomotherapy treatment procedures outside 
the united states 
failure local laws provide the same degree protection against infringement our intellectual 
property 
protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors 
changes trade and economic sanctions policies and the possibility that foreign countries may impose 
additional taxes tariffs other restrictions foreign trade 
relations with the governments the foreign countries which operate 
the inability obtain required export import licenses approvals 
risks relating foreign currency including fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates possibly causing 
fewer sales due the strengthening the dollar and 
contractual provisions governed foreign laws and various trade restrictions including prohibitions 
and restrictions exports certain products and technologies certain nations 
our inability overcome these obstacles could harm our business financial condition and operating results 
even are successful managing these obstacles our partners internationally are subject these same risks 
and may not able manage these obstacles effectively 
addition future imposition significant increases the level customs duties export quotas regulatory 
restrictions trade restrictions could materially harm our business 
enhanced international tariffs including potential tariffs imposed the united states and china that affect our 
products components within our products other trade barriers global trade war could increase our costs 
and materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
our global business could negatively affected trade barriers and other governmental protectionist measures 
any which can imposed suddenly and unpredictably there currently significant uncertainty about the future 
relationship between the united states and various other countries most significantly china with respect trade 
policies treaties government regulations and tariffs 
since the beginning there has been increasing public threats and some cases legislative executive 
action from united states and foreign leaders regarding instituting tariffs against foreign imports certain 
materials july the federal government imposed tariffs variety imports from china the 
federal government has also further proposed two additional lists products from china which impose 
additional tariffs these tariffs affect certain components including the linear accelerator for our tomotherapy 
systems which manufacture china and import into the united states well other components that 
import into the united states from our suppliers china has responded the new and proposed united states tariffs 
announcing plans impose tariffs ranging from wide range products retaliation which 
would impact our products the proposed new tariff lists remains unaltered and these additional tariffs are placed 
certain our components products any related counter measures are taken china our business 
financial condition and results operations may materially harmed the imposition tariffs could also increase 
our costs and require raise prices our products which may negatively impact the demand for our products 
the affected market are not successful offsetting the impact any such tariffs our revenue gross margins 
and operating results may adversely affected 
these tariffs have been recently announced and are subject number uncertainties they are implemented 
including future adjustments and changes the ultimate reaction other countries and the impact these tariffs 
other actions the united states china the global economy and our business financial condition and results 
operations cannot predicted this time nor can predict the impact any other developments with respect 
global trade further the imposition additional tariffs the united states could result the adoption 
additional tariffs china and other countries well further retaliatory actions any affected country any 
resulting trade war could negatively impact the global market for medical devices including radiation therapy 
devices and could have significant adverse effect our business these developments may have material 
adverse effect global economic conditions and the stability global financial markets and they may 
significantly reduce global trade and particular trade between china and the united states any these factors 
could depress economic activity restrict our access customers and have material adverse effect our business 
financial condition and results operations 
face risks related the current global economic environment which could adversely affect our business 
financial condition and results operations among other things delaying preventing our customers from 
obtaining financing purchase the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and implement the required 
facilities 
our business and results operations are materially affected conditions the global capital markets and the 
economy generally general economic slowdown and the volatility current economic conditions could adversely 
affect our business including our ability raise financing concerns over the slow economic recovery the level 
national debt currency fluctuations and volatility the rate growth japan china and other asian 
economies unemployment the availability and cost credit the housing market inflation levels negative 
interest rates energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed increased volatility and diminished 
expectations for the economy and the markets 
further the federal government has called for enacted substantial changes healthcare trade fiscal 
and tax policies which may include changes existing trade agreements and may have significant impact our 
operations for example the current administration has initiated the imposition tariffs certain foreign products 
including from china that have resulted and may result future retaliatory tariffs goods and products 
cannot predict the impact any that these changes could have our business economic conditions worsen 
new legislation passed related the healthcare system trade fiscal tax policies customer demand may not 
materialize levels require achieve our anticipated financial results which could have material adverse 
effect our business financial condition and results operations 
additionally uncertain credit markets and concerns regarding the availability credit could impact consumer 
and customer demand for our products well our ability manage normal commercial relationships with our 
customers suppliers and creditors including financial institutions the current situation continues deteriorate 
does not improve our business could negatively affected including reduced demand for our products resulting 
from slow down the general economy supplier customer disruptions and temporary interruptions our 
ability conduct day day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment 
collection funds from our customers vendors and suppliers for example the united states some our 
customers have been delayed obtaining have not been able obtain necessary financing for their purchases 
the cyberknife tomotherapy systems addition some our customers have been delayed obtaining 
have not been able obtain necessary financing for the construction renovation facilities house cyberknife 
tomotherapy systems the cost which can substantial these delays have some instances led our 
customers postponing the shipment and installation previously ordered systems cancelling their system orders 
and may cause other customers postpone their system installation cancel their agreements with 
increase delays and order cancellations this nature would adversely affect our product sales backlog and 
revenues and therefore harm our business and results operations addition the recent approval voters the 
referendum leave the has caused and may continue cause uncertainty the global markets the 
proposed exit from the implemented will take some period time complete and could result 
regulatory changes that impact our business will review the impact any resulting changes law 
that could affect our operations such labor policies financial planning product manufacturing and product 
distribution 
encounter manufacturing problems our manufacturing facilities not continue meet federal state 
foreign manufacturing standards may required temporarily cease all part our manufacturing 
operations which would result delays and lost revenue 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are complex and require the integration number components 
from several sources supply must manufacture and assemble these complex systems commercial quantities 
compliance with regulatory requirements and acceptable cost our linear accelerator components are 
extremely complex devices and require significant expertise manufacture and may encounter difficulties 
scaling production the cyberknife tomotherapy systems including problems with quality control and 
assurance component supply shortages increased costs shortages qualified personnel the long lead time 
required develop additional radiation shielded facilities for purposes testing our products and difficulties 
associated with compliance with local state federal and foreign regulatory requirements our manufacturing 
capacity does not keep pace with product demand will not able fulfill orders timely manner which 
turn may have negative effect our financial results and overall business conversely demand for our products 
decreases the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results 
our manufacturing processes and the manufacturing processes our third party suppliers are required comply 
with the fda qsr for any products imported into sold within the united states the qsr complex 
regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation the design testing production process and 
controls manufacturing labeling quality assurance packaging storage and shipping our products furthermore 
are required verify that our suppliers maintain facilities procedures and operations that comply with our 
quality requirements are also subject state licensing and other requirements and licenses applicable 
manufacturers medical devices and are required comply with iso quality system standards order 
produce products for sale europe and canada well various other foreign laws and regulations because our 
manufacturing processes include the production diagnostic and therapeutic ray equipment and laser equipment 
are subject the electronic product radiation control provisions the federal food drug and cosmetic act 
which requires that file reports with the fda applicable states and our customers regarding the distribution 
manufacturing and installation these types equipment the fda enforces the qsr and the electronic product 
radiation control provisions through periodic inspections some which may unannounced have been and 
anticipate the future being subject such inspections fda inspections usually occur every two three years 
during such inspections the fda may issue inspectional observations form fda listing instances where 
the manufacturer has failed comply with applicable regulations and procedures warning letters 
manufacturer does not adequately address the observations the fda may take enforcement action against the 
manufacturer including the imposition fines restriction the ability export product total shutdown 
production facilities and criminal prosecution third party supplier receive form fda with material 
major observations that are not promptly corrected fail pass qsr inspection fail comply with these 
iso and other applicable regulatory requirements our operations could disrupted and our ability generate sales 
could delayed our failure take prompt and satisfactory corrective action response adverse inspection 
our failure comply with applicable standards could result enforcement actions including public warning 
letter shutdown our manufacturing operations recall our products civil criminal penalties other 
sanctions which would cause our sales and business suffer addition because some foreign regulatory 
approvals are based approvals clearances from the fda any failure comply with fda requirements may 
also disrupt our sales products other countries cannot assure you that the fda other governmental 
authorities would agree with our interpretation applicable regulatory requirements that our third party 
suppliers have all instances fully complied with all applicable requirements any these events occur our 
reputation could harmed could lose customers and there could material adverse effect our business 
financial condition and results operations 
cannot achieve the required level and quality production may need outsource production rely 
licensing and other arrangements with third parties who possess sufficient manufacturing facilities and 
capabilities compliance with regulatory requirements even could outsource needed production enter into 
licensing other third party arrangements this could reduce our gross margin and expose the risks inherent 
relying others also cannot assure you that our suppliers will deliver adequate supply required 
components timely basis that they will adequately comply with the qsr failure obtain these components 
timely basis would disrupt our manufacturing processes and increase our costs which would harm our 
operating results 
are unable develop new products enhance existing products meet our customers needs and compete 
favorably the market may unable attract retain customers 
our success depends the successful development regulatory clearance approval introduction and 
commercialization new generations products treatment systems and enhancements and simplification 
existing products that will meet our customers needs provide novel features and compete favorably the market 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems which are currently our principal products are technologically 
complex and must keep pace with among other things the products our competitors and new technologies 
are making significant investments long term growth initiatives such initiatives require significant capital 
commitments involvement senior management and other investments our part which may unable 
recover our timeline for the development new products enhancements may not achieved and price and 
profitability targets may not prove feasible commercialization new products may prove challenging and may 
required invest more time and money than expected successfully introduce them once introduced new 
products may adversely impact orders and sales our existing products make them less desirable even 
obsolete compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact 
the successful implementation new products enhancements our inability develop gain regulatory approval 
for supply competitive products the market quickly and effectively our competitors could limit market 
acceptance our products and reduce our sales 
our ability successfully develop and introduce new products treatment systems and product enhancements and

the complexity our financial model contributes the difficulties determining the effectiveness our 
financial reporting systems and internal controls recognize revenue from range transactions including 
cyberknife and tomotherapy systems sales and services the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are complex 
products that contain both hardware and software elements the complexity the cyberknife and tomotherapy

acceptance our products will depend significant part the extent which public and private third party 
payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures that are performed with our products 
third party payors may establish change the reimbursement for medical products and services that could 
significantly influence the purchase medical products and services reimbursement policies other cost 
containment measures are instituted manner that significantly reduces the coverage payment for the 
procedures that are performed with our products our revenue may decline our existing customers may not continue 
using our products may decrease their use our products and may have difficulty obtaining new customers 
such actions would likely have material adverse effect our operating results 
cms reviews reimbursement rates annually and may implement significant changes future years which could 
discourage existing and potential customers from purchasing using our products further outside the united 
states reimbursement practices vary significantly country market acceptance our products may depend the 
availability and level coverage and reimbursement any country within particular time 
the safety and efficacy our products for certain uses not yet supported long term clinical data and our 
products may therefore prove less safe and effective than initially thought 
although believe that the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems have advantages over competing products 
and technologies not have sufficient clinical data demonstrating these advantages for all tumor indications 
addition have only limited five year patient survival rate data which common long term measure clinical 
effectiveness cancer treatment also have limited clinical data directly comparing the effectiveness the 
cyberknife systems other competing systems future patient studies clinical experience may indicate that 
treatment with the cyberknife system does not improve patient survival outcomes 
likewise because the tomotherapy systems have only been the market since have limited 
complication patient survival rate data with respect treatment using the system addition while the 
effectiveness radiation therapy well understood there growing but still limited number peer reviewed 
medical journal publications regarding the efficacy highly conformal treatment such that delivered the 
tomotherapy system future patient studies clinical experience not support our beliefs that the 
tomotherapy system offers more advantageous treatment for wide variety cancer types use the system 
could fail increase could decrease and our business would therefore adversely affected 
such results could reduce the rate reimbursement both public and private third party payors for procedures 
that are performed with our products slow the adoption our products physicians significantly reduce our 
ability achieve expected revenues and could prevent from becoming profitable addition future results and 
experience indicate that our products cause unexpected serious complications other unforeseen negative

third parties may claim are infringing their intellectual property and could suffer significant litigation 
licensing expenses prevented from selling our product 
the medical device industry characterized substantial amount litigation over patent and other 
intellectual property rights particular the field radiation treatment cancer well established and crowded 
with the intellectual property competitors and others also expect that other participants will enter the field 
number companies our market well universities and research institutions have issued patents and have 
filed patent applications which relate the use radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery treat cancerous 
and benign tumors 
determining whether product infringes patent involves complex legal and factual issues and the outcome 
patent litigation actions often uncertain have not conducted extensive search patents issued third 
parties and assurance can given that third party patents containing claims covering our products parts our 
products technology methods not exist have not been filed could not filed issued because the 
number patents issued and patent applications filed our technical areas fields our competitors other third 
parties may assert that our products and the methods employ the use our products are covered united 
states foreign patents held them 
addition because patent applications can take many years issue and because publication schedules for 
pending applications vary jurisdiction there may applications now pending which are unaware and 
which may result issued patents which our current future products infringe also because the claims 
published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant there may published patent 
applications that may ultimately issue with claims that infringe there could also existing patents that one 
more our products parts may infringe and which are unaware the number competitors the 
market for less invasive cancer treatment alternatives grows and the number patents issued this area grows 
the possibility patent infringement claims against increases regardless the merit infringement claims 
they can time consuming result costly litigation and diversion technical and management personnel some 
our competitors may able sustain the costs complex patent litigation more effectively than can 
because they have substantially greater resources addition any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and 
continuation any litigation could have material adverse effect our ability raise funds necessary 
continue our operations 
the event that become subject patent infringement other intellectual property lawsuit and the 
relevant patents other intellectual property were upheld valid and enforceable and were found infringe 
violate the terms license which are party could prevented from selling our products unless 
could obtain license are able redesign the product avoid infringement required licenses may not made 
available acceptable terms all are unable obtain license successfully redesign our system 
might prevented from selling our system there allegation determination that have infringed the 
intellectual property rights competitor other person may required pay damages pay ongoing 
royalties otherwise settle such matter upon terms that are unfavorable these circumstances may 
unable sell our products competitive prices all and our business and operating results could harmed 
may subject claims that our employees have wrongfully used disclosed alleged trade secrets their 
former employers 
common the medical device industry employ individuals who were previously employed other 
medical equipment biotechnology companies including our competitors potential competitors may 
subject claims that those employees have inadvertently otherwise used disclosed trade secrets other 
proprietary information their former employers litigation may necessary defend against these claims 
fail defending any such claims addition paying monetary damages may lose valuable intellectual 
property rights personnel even are successful defending against claims this nature litigation could 
result substantial costs and distraction management 
difficult and costly protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies and may not 
able ensure their protection 
our success depends significantly our ability obtain maintain and protect our proprietary rights the 
technologies used our products patents and other proprietary rights provide uncertain protections and may 
unable protect our intellectual property for example may unsuccessful defending our patents and other 
proprietary rights against third party challenges key patents expire our ability prevent competitors from 
copying our technology may limited addition patent reform legislation precedent could increase the 
uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution our patent applications and the enforcement defense our 
issued patents 
addition patents rely combination trade secrets copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure 
agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures protect our intellectual property 
rights these measures may not adequate safeguard the technology underlying our products these measures 
not protect our rights adequately third parties could use our technology and our ability compete the market 
would reduced although have attempted obtain patent coverage for our technology where available and 
appropriate there are aspects the technology for which patent coverage was never sought never received there 
are also countries which sell intend sell the cyberknife tomotherapy systems but have patents 
pending patent applications our ability prevent others from making selling duplicate similar technologies 
will impaired those countries which have patent protection although have several issued patents 
the united states and foreign countries protecting aspects the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems our 
pending united states and foreign patent applications may not issue may issue only with limited coverage may 
issue and subsequently successfully challenged others and held invalid unenforceable addition many 
countries limit the enforceability patents against certain third parties including government agencies 
government contractors these countries patents may provide limited benefit patent protection must 
ultimately sought country country basis which expensive and time consuming process with 
uncertain outcomes accordingly may choose not seek patent protection certain countries and will not 
have the benefit patent protection such countries 
similarly our issued patents and those our licensors may not provide with any competitive advantages 
competitors may able design around our patents develop products which provide outcomes comparable 
superior ours our patents may held invalid unenforceable result legal challenges third parties 
and others may challenge the inventorship ownership our patents and pending patent applications addition 
the laws some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights the same extent the laws 
the united states the event competitor infringes upon our patent other intellectual property rights 
enforcing those rights may difficult and time consuming even successful litigation enforce our intellectual 
property rights defend our patents against challenge could expensive and time consuming and could divert 
our management attention from our core business may not have sufficient resources enforce our intellectual 
property rights defend our patents against challenge addition may not prevail any lawsuits that 
initiate and the damages other remedies awarded any may not commercially valuable litigation also puts 
our patents risk being invalidated interpreted narrowly and our patent applications risk not issuing 
additionally may provoke third parties assert claims against 
also license patent and other proprietary rights aspects our technology third parties fields where 
currently not operate well fields where currently operate disputes with our licensees may arise 
regarding the scope and content these licenses further our ability expand into additional fields with our 
technologies may restricted our existing licenses licenses may grant third parties the future 
additionally have written agreements with collaborators regarding the ownership intellectual property 
arising from our collaborations these agreements generally provide that must negotiate certain commercial 
rights with collaborators with respect joint inventions inventions made our collaborators that arise from the 
results the collaboration some instances there may not adequate written provisions address clearly the 
resolution intellectual property rights that may arise from collaboration cannot successfully negotiate 
sufficient ownership and commercial rights the inventions that result from our use third party collaborator 
materials where required disputes otherwise arise with respect the intellectual property developed with the 
use collaborator technology may limited our ability utilize these intellectual property rights 
addition may face claims third parties that our agreements with employees contractors consultants 
obligating them assign intellectual property are ineffective conflict with prior competing contractual 
obligations assignment which could result ownership disputes regarding intellectual property have 
developed will develop and interfere with our ability capture the commercial value such intellectual 
property litigation may necessary resolve ownership dispute and are not successful may 
precluded from using certain intellectual property may lose our exclusive rights that intellectual property 
either outcome could harm our business 
the policies have place protect our trade secrets may not effective preventing misappropriation 
our trade secrets others addition confidentiality agreements executed our employees consultants and 
advisors may not enforceable may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets other proprietary 
information the event unauthorized use disclosure litigating trade secret claim expensive and time 
consuming and the outcome unpredictable addition courts outside the united states are sometimes less 
willing protect trade secrets moreover our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge 
methods and know how are unable protect our intellectual property rights may unable prevent 
competitors from using our own inventions and intellectual property compete against and our business may 
harmed 
unfavorable results legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
are and may become party legal proceedings claims and other legal matters the ordinary course

guarantee that our insurance coverage will sufficient cover any damages awarded against further legal 
proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof can result adverse publicity and damage our reputation which 
could adversely impact our business 
because the majority our product revenue derived from sales the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
which have long and variable sales and installation cycle our revenues and cash flows may volatile and 
difficult predict 
our primary products are the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems expect generate substantially all 
our revenue for the foreseeable future from sales and service contracts for the cyberknife and tomotherapy 
systems the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems have lengthy sales and purchase order cycles because they are 
major capital equipment items and require the approval senior management purchasing institutions addition 
sales some our customers are subject competitive bidding public tender processes these approval and 
bidding processes can lengthy selling our systems from first contact with potential customer complete 
order generally spans six months two years and involves personnel with multiple skills the sales process the 
united states typically begins with pre selling activity followed sales presentations and other sales related 
activities after the customer has expressed intention purchase cyberknife tomotherapy system 
negotiate and enter into definitive purchase contract with the customer the negotiation terms that are not 
standard for accuray may require additional time and approvals typically following the execution the contract 
the customer begins the building renovation radiation shielded facility house the cyberknife 
tomotherapy system which together with the subsequent installation the cyberknife tomotherapy system 
can take months complete order construct this facility the customer must typically obtain radiation 
device installation permits which are granted state and local government bodies each which may have 
different criteria for permit issuance permit was denied for installation specific hospital treatment center 
our cyberknife tomotherapy system could not installed that location addition some our customers 
are cancer centers facilities that are new and these cases may necessary for the entire facility 
completed before the cyberknife tomotherapy system can installed which can result additional 
construction and installation delays our sales and installations cyberknife and tomotherapy systems tend 
heaviest during the third month each fiscal quarter 
under our revenue recognition policy generally not recognize revenue attributable cyberknife 
tomotherapy system purchase until after installation has occurred are responsible for providing installation 
for international sales through distributors typically recognize revenue when the system shipped and have 
evidence purchase commitment from the end user under our current forms purchase and service contracts 
record majority the purchase price revenue for cyberknife tomotherapy system upon installation 
delivery the system events beyond our control may delay installation and the satisfaction contingencies 
required receive cash inflows and recognize revenue including delays the customer obtaining funding 
financing delays construction the customer site delays the customer obtaining receipt regulatory 
approvals such certificates need 
the long sales cycle together with delays the shipment and installation cyberknife and tomotherapy 
systems customer cancellations that could affect our ability recognize revenue could adversely affect our cash 
flows and revenue which would harm our results operations and may result significant fluctuations our 
reporting quarterly revenues because these fluctuations likely that some future quarters our operating 
results will fall below the expectations securities analysts investors that happens the market price our 
stock would likely decrease these fluctuations also mean that you will not able rely upon our operating results 
any particular period indication future performance 
depend third party distributors market and distribute our products international markets our 
distributors fail successfully market and distribute our products our business will materially harmed 
depend number distributors our international markets cannot control the efforts and resources 
our third party distributors will devote marketing the cyberknife tomotherapy systems our distributors may 
not able successfully market and sell the cyberknife tomotherapy systems may not devote sufficient time 
and resources support the marketing and selling efforts and may not market the cyberknife tomotherapy 
systems prices that will permit the product develop achieve sustain market acceptance some 
jurisdictions rely our distributors manage the regulatory process and are dependent their ability 
effectively addition distributor terminated goes out business may take period 
time locate alternative distributor seek appropriate regulatory approvals and train its personnel market 
the cyberknife tomotherapy systems and our ability sell and service the cyberknife tomotherapy 
systems the region formerly serviced such terminated distributor could materially and adversely affected 
any our distributors could become insolvent otherwise become unable pay amounts owed when due 
any these distributor relationships end and are not replaced our revenues from product sales the ability 
service our products the territories serviced these distributors could adversely affected any these factors 
could materially and adversely affect our revenue from international markets increase our costs those markets 
damage our reputation are unable attract additional international distributors our international revenue may 
not grow our distributors experience difficulties not actively market the cyberknife tomotherapy 
systems not otherwise perform under our distribution agreements our potential for revenue and gross margins 
from international markets may dramatically reduced and our business could harmed 
the high unit price the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems well other factors may contribute 
substantial fluctuations our operating results which could adversely affect our stock price 
because the high unit price the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and the relatively small number 
units installed each quarter each installation cyberknife tomotherapy system can represent significant 
percentage our revenue for particular quarter therefore not install cyberknife tomotherapy 
system when anticipated our operating results will vary significantly from our expectations this particular 
concern the current volatile economic environment where have had experiences with customers cancelling 
postponing orders for our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and delaying any required build outs these 
fluctuations and other potential fluctuations mean that you should not rely upon our operating results any 
particular period indication future performance 
strategy assist our sales efforts may offer extended payment terms which may potentially result 
higher days sales outstanding reduced cash flows particular period and greater payment defaults 
offer longer extended payment terms for qualified customers some circumstances june 
customer contracts with extended payment terms more than one year amounted approximately our total 
accounts receivable balance while qualify customers whom offer longer extended payment terms their 
financial positions may change adversely over the longer time period given for payment this may result 
increase payment defaults which would affect our revenue recognize revenue such transactions 
cash basis any increase days sales outstanding could also negatively affect our cash flow

lengthy and unpredictable the fda clearance process generally takes from three twelve months but

march the patient protection and affordable care act known the accordable care act aca and 
the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law the aca provides for among 
other things excise tax sales medical devices including our products effective the 
excise tax was suspended for two year period beginning january and was recently further suspended 
through december and when enacted this tax burden may have material negative impact our 
business results operations and cash flow addition these two pieces legislation include large number 
other health related provisions including expanding medicaid eligibility requiring most individuals have health 
insurance establishing new regulations health plans establishing health insurance exchanges requiring 
manufacturers report payments other transfers value made physicians and teaching hospitals modifying 
certain payment systems encourage more cost effective care and reduction inefficiencies and waste and 
including new tools address fraud and abuse the laws also include decrease the annual rate inflation for 
medicare payments hospitals and the establishment independent payment advisory board suggest 
methods reducing the rate growth medicare spending not yet know the full impact that the aca will 
have our business the taxes imposed the aca and the expansion the government role the 
healthcare industry may result decreased profits lower reimbursement third party payors for our 
products reduced volume medical procedures conducted with our products all which could have material 
adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations the federal government may take 
further action regarding the aca including but not limited repeal replacement most recently the tax act 
was signed into law december which among other things removed penalties for not complying with the 
individual mandate carry health insurance additionally all portion the aca and related subsequent 
legislation may modified repealed otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge which could result 
lower numbers insured individuals reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business 
addition since the adoption the affordable care act other legislation designed keep federal healthcare 
costs down has been proposed passed for example under the sequestration required the budget control act 
amended the american taxpayer relief act medicare payments for all items and services 
under parts and incurred after april have been reduced future federal legislation 
may impose further limitations the coverage amounts reimbursement available for our products from 
governmental agencies third party payors these limitations could have negative impact the demand for our 
products and services and therefore our financial position and results operations 
since the enactment the aca cms continues its efforts move away from fee for service payments for 
furnishing items and services medicare the past several rulemaking cycles cms has increased packaging 
policies and created larger payment bundles across the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system 
opps one example cms expansion comprehensive ambulatory payment classifications apcs under 
which payment for adjunctive and secondary items services and procedures are packaged into the most costly 
primary procedure the claim level beyond the opps cms innovation center has launched number 
alternative payment model apm demonstrations that involve episode based payment since for example 
cmmi has created the process creating major federal initiatives test episode based payments such 
the bundled payments for care improvement bpci oncology care model ocm and specialty practitioners 
payment model opportunities 
furthermore the patient access and medicare protection act pampa froze payment for some 
radiation therapy delivery and related services and requires cms provide report congress the 
development apm for radiation therapy services provided non facility settings while these types 
payment packaging policies and episode based payments may impact reimbursement for overall patient care 
including items and services furnished patients they also create incentives for providers carefully assess the 
value proposition technology purchases and uses the impacts these payment and delivery system changes are 
their infancy and their overall effects remain under review 
future legislative policy initiatives directed reducing costs could introduced either the federal state 
level cannot predict what healthcare reform legislation regulations any including any potential repeal 
amendment the aca will enacted the united states elsewhere what impact any legislation 
regulations related the healthcare system that may enacted adopted the future might have our business 
the effect ongoing uncertainty public perception about these matters will have the purchasing decisions 
our customers however the implementation new legislation and regulation may materially lower 
reimbursements for our products materially reduce medical procedure volumes and significantly and adversely 
affect our business

overview 
products and markets 
company 
are radiation oncology company that develops manufactures sells and supports precise innovative 
treatment solutions which set the standard care with the aim helping patients live longer better lives our 
leading edge technologies the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems including the radixact system the next 
generation tomotherapy platform are designed deliver advanced radiation therapy including radiosurgery 
stereotactic body radiation therapy intensity modulated radiation therapy image guided radiation therapy and 
adaptive radiation therapy tailored the specific needs each patient the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
are complementary offerings serving largely separate patient populations treated the same medical specialty 
radiation oncology both systems have advanced capabilities that offer increased treatment flexibility meet the 
needs expanding patient population including patients requiring retreatment with radiation therapy also 
offer comprehensive software solutions enable and enhance the precise and efficient radiosurgery and 
radiotherapy treatment with our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems addition these products also 
provide services which include post contract customer support warranty period services and post warranty 
services installation services training and other professional services 
the cyberknife systems 
the cyberknife systems are robotic systems designed deliver radiosurgery treatments cancer tumors 
anywhere the body the cyberknife systems are the only dedicated full body robotic radiosurgery systems 
the market radiosurgery alternative traditional surgery for tumors and performed outpatient basis 
one five treatment sessions enables the treatment patients who typically might not otherwise treated with 
radiation who may not good candidates for surgery who desire non surgical treatments the use 
radiosurgery with cyberknife systems treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly recent years 
but currently only small portion the patients who develop tumors treatable with cyberknife systems are treated 
with these systems determination when may may not appropriate use cyberknife system for 
treatment the discretion the treating physician and depends the specific patient however the cyberknife 
systems are generally not used treat very large tumors which are considerably wider than the radiation beam 
that can delivered cyberknife systems diffuse wide spread disease often the case for late stage 
cancers because they are not localized though cyberknife systems might used treat focal area the 
disease and systemic diseases like leukemia and lymphoma which are not localized organ but rather 
involve cells throughout the body 
our cyberknife series systems have the option fixed collimator iris variable aperture collimator 
and multi leaf collimator incise mlc the incise mlc designed specifically for the series with the 
incise mlc clinicians can deliver the same precise radiosurgery treatments they have come expect with the 
cyberknife system faster and for wider range tumor types than prior cyberknife systems the incise mlc 
makes faster and more efficient treat wider range tumor types with the cyberknife series system 
including larger tumors and those with multiple sites disease 
believe the long term success the cyberknife systems dependent number factors including the 
following 
continued adoption our cyberknife series systems 
greater awareness among doctors and patients the benefits radiosurgery conducted with the cyberknife 
systems 
continued evolution clinical studies demonstrating the safety efficacy and other benefits using the 
cyberknife systems treat tumors various parts the body 
change medical practice leading utilization stereotactic body radiosurgery more regularly 
alternative surgery other treatments 
continued advances our technology that improve the quality treatments and ease use the 
cyberknife systems 
receipt regulatory approvals various countries which are expected improve access radiosurgery 
with the cyberknife systems such countries 
medical insurance reimbursement policies that cover cyberknife system treatments and 
our ability expand sales cyberknife systems countries throughout the world where not 
currently sell have not historically sold significant number cyberknife systems 
tomotherapy systems including radixact the next generation tomotherapy platform 
the tomotherapy systems are advanced fully integrated and versatile radiation therapy systems for the 
treatment wide range cancer types the tomotherapy systems are specifically designed for image guided 
intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt the tomotherapy systems include the tomotherapy series 
systems with configurations tomoh tomohd and tomohda based scanner platform the systems 
provide continuous delivery radiation from degrees around the patient delivery from clinician specified 
beam angles these unique features combined with daily image guidance enable physicians deliver highly 
accurate individualized dose distributions that precisely conform the shape the patient tumor while 
minimizing dose normal healthy tissue resulting fewer side effects for the patient the tomotherapy systems 
are capable treating all standard radiation therapy indications including breast prostate lung and head and neck 
cancers addition complex and novel treatments such total marrow irradiation the radixact system the 
next generation tomotherapy platform includes our integrated accuray precision treatment planning software and 
new idms data management system the radixact system leverages the tomotherapy system efficient daily 
low dose fan beam mvct image guidance and unique ring gantry architecture delivering precise radiation 
treatments for more patients faster with simpler more automated workflows believe the radixact system and 
other tomotherapy systems offer clinicians and patients significant benefits over other radiation therapy systems 
the market believe our ability capture more sales will influenced number factors including the 
following 
continued adoption our tomotherapy systems including the adoption the radixact system 
markets where available 
greater awareness among doctors and patients the unique benefits radiation therapy using 
tomotherapy systems because their ring gantry architecture and ability deliver treatment from 
degrees around the patient 
advances our technology that improve the quality treatments and ease use tomotherapy 
systems 
greater awareness among doctors the now established reliability tomotherapy systems and 
our ability expand sales tomotherapy systems countries throughout the world where not 
currently sell have not historically sold significant number tomotherapy systems 
sale our products 
generating revenue from the sale our systems lengthy process selling our systems from first contact with 
potential customer signed sales contract that meets our backlog criteria discussed below varies 
significantly and generally spans between six months and two years the length time between receipt signed 
contract and revenue recognition generally governed the time required the customer build renovate 
prepare the treatment room for installation the system 
the united states primarily market directly customers including hospitals and stand alone treatment 
facilities through our sales organization and also market customers through sales agents and group purchasing 
organizations outside the united states market customers directly and through distributors and sales agents 
addition our offices the united states have sales and service offices europe asia and south america 
backlog 
for orders that cover both products and services only the portion the order that recognizable product 
revenue reported backlog the portion the order that recognized service revenue for example post 
contract customer support pcs installation training and professional services not included reported 
backlog product backlog totaled million june compared million june 
order for the product portion system sales agreement counted backlog must meet the following 
criteria 
the contract properly executed both the customer and customer purchase order that incorporates 
the terms our contract quote will considered equivalent signed and executed contract the contract 
has either cleared all its contingencies contained contingencies when signed 
have received minimum deposit letter credit the sale customer where deposit 
deemed not necessary customary sale government entity large hospital group hospitals 
cancer care group that has sufficient credit customers with trade existing equipment sales via tender 
awards indirect channel sales that have signed contracts with end customers 
the specific end customer site has been identified the customer the written contract written 
amendment and 
less than years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above 
although our backlog includes only contractual agreements with our customers for the purchase cyberknife 
systems tomotherapy systems including the radixact systems and related upgrades cannot provide 
assurance that will convert backlog into recognized revenue due primarily factors outside our control the 
amount backlog recognized into revenue primarily impacted four items cancellations age outs 
amendments the terms our contracts and foreign currency fluctuations orders could cancelled for reasons 
including without limitation changes customers needs financial condition changes government health 
insurance reimbursement policies changes regulatory requirements addition cancellations after 
years have not been able recognize revenue contract remove the backlog amount associated 
with the contract and the order considered aged out contracts may age out for many reasons including but not 
limited inability the customer pay inability the customer adapt their facilities accommodate our 
products timely manner inability timely obtain licenses necessary for customer facilities operation 
our equipment our backlog also includes amounts not denominated dollars and therefore fluctuations the 
dollar compared other currencies will impact backlog generally strengthening the dollar will

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations based our consolidated 
financial statements which have been prepared accordance with accounting principles generally accepted the 
united states america gaap the preparation these consolidated financial statements requires 
management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities and the 
disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the consolidated financial statements well revenue 
and expenses during the reporting periods evaluate our estimates and judgments ongoing basis base 
our estimates historical experience and various other factors believe are reasonable under the 
circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value assets and 
liabilities actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates actual conditions differ from our 
assumptions 
all our significant accounting policies and methods used the preparation our consolidated financial 
statements are described note the company and its significant accounting policies the consolidated 
financial statements the methods estimates and judgments that use applying our accounting policies require 
make difficult and subjective judgments often result the need make estimates regarding matters that 
are inherently uncertain management believes the critical accounting policies and estimates are those related

valuation inventories share based compensation expense convertible notes income taxes allowance for doubtful 
accounts and loss contingencies 
revenue recognition 
frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements deliverables and 
have make number reasoned judgments with respect elements these sales arrangements including how 
allocate the proceeds received from arrangement whether there are multiple elements the arrangement 
whether any undelivered elements are essential the functionality the delivered elements and the appropriate 
timing revenue recognition with respect these arrangements for sale arrangements that contain multiple 
elements allocate the arrangement consideration each element based the relative selling price method 
whereby the relative selling price each deliverable determined using vendor specific objective evidence 
vsoe fair value exists vsoe fair value for each element based our standard rates charged for the 
product service when such product service sold separately based upon the price established the 
company pricing committee when that product service not yet being sold separately when are not able 
establish vsoe for all deliverables arrangement with multiple elements which may due infrequently

assessment recoverability goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess the purchase price over the fair value tangible and identified intangible net 
assets businesses acquired goodwill not amortized but evaluated for impairment annual basis and 
when impairment indicators are present have one operating segment and one reporting unit therefore our 
consolidated net assets including existing goodwill and other intangible assets are considered the carrying

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives our purchased intangible assets are 
complex and subjective they can affected variety factors including external factors such industry and 
economic trends and internal factors such changes our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
valuation inventories 
the valuation inventory requires estimate obsolete excess inventory well damaged inventory 
the determination obsolete excess inventory requires estimate the future demand for our products 
regularly review inventory quantities hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily 
historical usage rates and our estimates product demand support future sales and service our demand 
forecast for specific products greater than actual demand and fail reduce purchasing and manufacturing 
output accordingly could required write off inventory beyond the current reserve which would negatively 
impact our gross margin 
share based compensation expense

the vesting term and the contractual term the option illustrated the simplified method use the 
monte carlo simulation model estimate the fair value market stock units msus the assumptions used 
calculating the fair value share based payment awards represent management best estimates but these estimates 
involve inherent uncertainties and the application management judgment result factors change and 
use different assumptions our share based compensation expense could materially different the future 
recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected vest over the requisite service period the 
award estimate our forfeiture rate based analysis our actual forfeitures and will continue evaluate the

potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates
