item risk factors 
our operations and financial results are subject various risks and uncertainties including those 
described the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results 
operations cash flows and the trading price our common stock 
risks related our business 
uncertainty the global economy general and any potential downturn the semiconductor and 
electronics industries particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels 
and revenue 
purchases our products and services are dependent upon the commencement new design projects 
manufacturers and electronics systems companies the and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are 
characterized constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving 
standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations product supply and demand 
the and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns connection with 
anticipation maturing product cycles both these industries and their customers products while 
spending eda products and services has grown recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor 
industry uncertain and may result decrease spending eda products and services 
while cannot predict global economic conditions including for example economic slowdown 
china uncertainty about future economic conditions and future decline consumer spending could negatively 
impact our customers businesses reducing the number new chip designs and their overall research and 
development spending including their spending eda products and services and result decrease demand 
for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among 
our customers problems delays with our hardware suppliers with the supply delivery our hardware 
products could also adversely affect our ability grow our business adversely affect our future revenues and 
financial results our future business and financial results are subject considerable uncertainty that could 
impact our stock price economic conditions deteriorate the future particular semiconductor 
electronics systems industry revenues not grow our suppliers our hardware components and products are 
subject problems delays our future revenues and financial results could adversely affected however 
economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact our revenues and financial results may 
deferred due cautious customer research and development spending and our mix licenses that result 
recurring revenue 
customer consolidation could affect our operating results 
there has been trend toward customer consolidation our industry through business combinations 
including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships the extent this trend continues could make 
dependent fewer customers who may able exert increased pressure our prices and other contract 
terms and could increase the portion our total sales concentration for any single customer customer 
consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services such customers streamline 
research and development operations reduce purchases delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could 
negatively impact our financial condition 
our failure respond quickly technological developments customers increasing technological 
requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 
the industries which compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes industry 
standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements new products currently 
the industries serve are experiencing the following trends 
changes the design and manufacturing ics including migration advanced process nodes and 
the introduction three dimensional transistors such fin based multigate transistors finfets 
present major challenges the semiconductor industry particularly design design automation 
design manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself with migration advanced 
process nodes the industry must adapt more complex physics and manufacturing challenges such 
the need draw features silicon that are many times smaller than the wavelength light used 
draw the features via lithography models each component electrical properties and behavior also 
become more complex requisite analysis design verification and manufacturing capabilities 
novel design tools and methodologies must invented and enhanced quickly remain competitive 
the design electronics the smallest nanometer ranges 
the challenges advanced node design are leading some customers work with more mature less 
risky manufacturing processes that may reduce their need upgrade enhance their eda products 
and design flows 
potential slowdown moore law which may reduce slow the need for customers upgrade 
enhance their eda products and design flows 
the ability design socs increases the complexity managing design that the lowest level 
represented billions shapes fabrication masks addition socs typically incorporate 
microprocessors and digital signal processors that are programmed with software requiring 
simultaneous design the and the related software embedded the 
with the availability seemingly endless gate capacity there increase design reuse the 
combining off the shelf design with custom logic create ics socs the unavailability 
broad range high quality design including our own that can reliably incorporated into 
customer design with our software products and services could lead reduced demand for our 
products and services 
increased technological capability the fpga which programmable logic chip creates 
alternative implementation for some electronics companies this could reduce demand for our 
implementation products and services 
growing number low cost engineering services businesses could reduce the need for some 
companies invest eda products and 
adoption cloud computing technologies with accompanying new business models for increasing 
number software categories including eda 
are unable respond quickly and successfully these trends may lose our competitive position 
and our products technologies may become obsolete compete successfully must develop acquire 
license new products and improve our existing products and processes schedule that keeps pace with 
technological developments and the requirements for products addressing broad spectrum designers and 
designer expertise our industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware 
platforms must enhanced periodically reduce the likelihood that competitor surpasses the capabilities 
offer our introduction new products could reduce the demand and revenue our older products affect 
their pricing must also able support range changing computer software hardware platforms and 
customer preferences rapid transition different business models associated with cloud computing 
technologies could result reduced revenue cannot guarantee that will successful keeping pace 
with all any the customer trends 
have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal 
period are affected the timing revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping 
hardware and products 
various factors affect our operating results and some them are not within our control our operating 
results for any period are affected the timing revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and 
prototyping hardware and products addition have recorded net losses the past and may record net 
losses the future 
substantial portion the product revenue related our hardware business and some our offerings 
recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based part our expectations hardware 
and delivered particular quarter therefore changes hardware and bookings deliveries 
relative expectations will have more immediate impact our revenue than changes software services 
bookings for which revenue generally recognized over time 
recent years made significant investments expand our offerings through among other things 
research and development and acquisitions continue expand our offerings portion the revenue 
related our bookings will deferred until complete and deliver the licensed our customers 
result costs related the research and development the may incurred prior the recognition the 
related revenue 
revenue related our hardware and products inherently difficult predict because sales our 
hardware and products depend the commencement new projects for the design and development 
complex ics and systems our customers our customers willingness expend capital deploy our hardware 
products those projects and the availability our hardware products for delivery therefore our 
hardware sales may delayed may decrease our customers delay cancel projects because their 
spending constrained there are problems delays with the supply delivery our hardware 
products our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and markets are highly competitive and our 
customers may choose purchase competitor hardware product based cost performance other 
factors these factors may result lower revenue which would have adverse effect our business results 
operations cash flows 
our software license mix such that substantial proportion licenses require ratable revenue recognition 
and expect the license mix combined with the modest growth spending our customers the 
semiconductor sector may make difficult for rapidly increase our revenue future fiscal periods the

risk were borrow under our revolving credit facility and interest rates were increase our debt 
service obligations the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained

correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn and that were fully exercise our right 
increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change interest rates would 
result approximately million change annual interest expense our indebtedness under our 
revolving credit facility the future may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange floating

rate swaps with respect all our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps enter into may not fully 
mitigate our interest rate risk 
various factors could increase our future borrowing costs reduce our access capital including 
lowering withdrawal the ratings assigned our notes rating agencies 
may the future seek additional financing for variety reasons and our future borrowing costs and 
access capital could affected factors including the condition the debt and equity markets the 
condition the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level indebtedness and our business and

critical accounting estimates 
preparing our consolidated financial statements make assumptions judgments and estimates that can 
have significant impact our revenue operating income and net income well the value certain 
assets and liabilities our consolidated balance sheets base our assumptions judgments and estimates 
historical experience and various other factors that believe reasonable under the circumstances actual 
results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions conditions least quarterly 
evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes deemed necessary believe that 
the assumptions judgments and estimates involved the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition 
business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value financial instruments have 
the greatest potential impact our consolidated financial statements therefore consider these our 
critical accounting estimates for information our significant accounting policies see note the notes

accounting for income taxes 
are subject income taxes the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant 
judgment required evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that 
occur during the ordinary course business for which the ultimate tax determination uncertain our provision 
for income taxes could adversely affected our earnings being lower than anticipated countries where 
have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated countries where have higher statutory rates losses 
incurred jurisdictions for which are not able realize the related tax benefit changes foreign currency 
exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes our existing businesses acquisitions 
and investments changes our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes our assessment 
valuation allowances changes the relevant tax laws interpretations these tax laws and developments 
current and future tax examinations 
only recognize the tax benefit income tax position judge that more likely than not that 
the tax position will sustained solely its technical merits tax audit including resolution any related 
appeals litigation processes make this judgment must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax 
laws regulations and administrative practices judge that income tax position meets this recognition 
threshold then must measure the amount the tax benefit recognized estimating the largest amount 
tax benefit that has greater than cumulative probability being realized upon settlement with taxing 
authority that has full knowledge all the relevant facts inherently difficult and subjective estimate 
such amounts this requires determine the probability various possible settlement outcomes must 
reevaluate our income tax positions quarterly basis consider factors such changes facts 
circumstances changes tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse applicable statute 
limitations and new audit activity such change recognition measurement would result recognition

benefits see note the notes consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
begin recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 
have persuasive evidence arrangement with customer 
delivery has occurred 
the fee for the arrangement considered fixed determinable the outset the 
arrangement and 
collectibility the fee probable 
significant judgment involved the determination whether the facts and circumstances 
arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement considered fixed determinable and that 
collectibility the fee probable and these judgments can affect the amount revenue that recognize 
particular reporting period for installment contracts that not include substantial upfront payment 
consider fee fixed determinable only the arrangement has payment periods that are less than equal 
the term the licenses and the payments are collected equal nearly equal installments when evaluated 
over the entire term the arrangement longer were have history collecting under the original 
contract without providing concessions term licenses revenue from term licenses would required 
recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such change could have 
material adverse effect our results operations 
must also make judgments when assessing whether contract amendment term arrangement 
primarily the context license extension renewal constitutes concession have established 
history collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed fixed determinable without 
providing concessions payments products services 
generally are able estimate whether collection probable but significant judgment applied 
assess the creditworthiness our customers make this determination key external and internal factors are 
considered developing our creditworthiness assessment including public information historical and current 
financial statements and past collection history our experience were change could have material 
adverse effect our results operations our judgment collection fee not probable not

efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes different conditions were prevail 
such that accurate estimates could not made then the use the completed contract method would required 
and the recognition all revenue and costs would deferred until the project was completed such change 
could have material impact our results operations

process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe tpe takes into account multiple 
factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related each deliverable key external and

expected generate the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected 
generate the future the appropriate weighted average cost capital and the cost savings expected 
derived from acquiring asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and different 
estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could allocated the acquired assets and assumed

revenue recognition 
software and revenue recognition 
cadence licenses its software and products using three different license types 
term licenses 
subscription licenses and 
perpetual licenses 
term licenses cadence term license arrangements offer customers the right 
access and use all products delivered the outset arrangement throughout the entire term 
the arrangement generally two three years with rights return and 
remix among the products delivered the outset the arrangement long the cumulative 
contractual value all products use does not exceed the total license fee determined the 
outset the arrangement 
subscription licenses addition the rights term license cadence subscription license 
arrangements also offer customers the right 
use unspecified additional products that become commercially available during the term the 
arrangement and 
remix into other unspecified additional products that may become available during the term 
the arrangement long the cumulative contractual value all products use does not 
exceed the total license fee determined the outset the arrangement 
general product and maintenance revenue associated with term and subscription licenses recognized 
ratably over the term the license commencing upon the later the effective date the arrangement 
delivery the licensed product 
perpetual licenses cadence perpetual licenses consist software licensed perpetual basis with 
right return ability remix the licensed software cadence licenses its design under perpetual license 
per design basis 
general product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vsoe exists for the undelivered 
maintenance recognized upon delivery the licensed product and maintenance revenue recognized ratably 
over the maintenance term vsoe does not exist for the undelivered maintenance perpetual license 
product revenue recognized ratably over the maintenance term certain other criteria are met revenue for 
design recognized upon delivery and accrue the expected costs maintenance 
hardware revenue recognition 
cadence generally has minimum two deliverables arrangements involving the sale lease its 
hardware products the first deliverable the hardware product and software essential the functionality the 
hardware product and the second deliverable the right receive maintenance the hardware product and its 
software cadence allocates consideration between these deliverables based the relative standalone selling 
price for each deliverable consideration allocated the hardware product and its essential software 
recognized revenue the time delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been 
met consideration allocated maintenance recognized revenue ratably over the maintenance term 
services revenue recognition 
services revenue primarily consists revenue received for performing engineering services these services 
are generally not related the functionality the products licensed certain instances cadence will 
customize its fixed fee basis revenue from service contracts recognized either the time and 
materials method work performed the percentage completion method service contract 
considered part multiple element arrangement mea that includes software contract revenue 
generally recognized ratably over the duration the software contract for contracts with fixed not exceed 
fees cadence estimates monthly basis the percentage completion based the progress completion 
the services cadence has history accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary complete 
projects number internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization 
and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes different conditions were prevail 
such that accurate estimates could not made then the use the completed contract method would required 
and the recognition all revenue and costs would deferred until the project was completed such change 
could have material impact cadence results operations 
revenue recognition criteria 
although the timing and amount revenue recognition differs based the deliverables each 
arrangement cadence begins revenue recognition for arrangement when persuasive evidence 
arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee fixed determinable and collection the resulting 
receivable probable 
persuasive evidence arrangement generally cadence uses contract signed the customer 
evidence arrangement for subscription and term licenses licenses its products and hardware leases 
contract signed the customer does not exist cadence has historically used purchase order evidence 
arrangement for software perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixed price 
service projects such training classes and small methodology service engagements for all other service 
engagements cadence uses signed professional services agreement and statement work evidence 
arrangement cases where both signed contract and purchase order exist cadence considers the signed 
contract the most persuasive evidence the arrangement sales through cadence distributors are 
evidenced master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the 
distributor transaction transaction basis 
product delivery software and vip and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered 
customers electronically electronic delivery occurs when cadence provides the customer access the software 
occasionally cadence will deliver software dvd with standard transfer terms free board 
shipping point design also delivered electronically via download from secure site cadence software 
and license agreements generally not contain conditions for acceptance delivery entire hardware 
system deemed occur upon its successful installation for certain hardware products installation the 
responsibility the customer the system fully functional the time shipment and delivery deemed 
complete when the products are shipped with freight terms shipping point 
fee fixed determinable cadence assesses whether fee fixed determinable the outset the 
arrangement primarily based the payment terms associated with the transaction cadence has established 
history collecting under the original contract without providing concessions payments products services 
for installment contracts that not include substantial upfront payment cadence only considers that fee 
fixed determinable the arrangement has payment periods that are equal less than the term the 
licenses and the payments are collected equal nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term 
the arrangement cadence has history collecting receivables under software installment contracts 
five years for which the fee has been assessed fixed determinable 
significant judgment involved assessing whether fee fixed determinable cadence must also 
make these judgments when assessing whether contract amendment term arrangement primarily the 
context license extension renewal constitutes concession cadence experience has been that able 
determine whether fee fixed determinable while cadence does not expect that experience change 
cadence longer were have history collecting under the original contract without providing concessions 
revenue would required recognized when payments become due and payable such change could have 
material impact cadence results operations 
collection probable cadence assesses the probability collecting from each customer the outset 
the arrangement based number factors including the customer payment history its current 
creditworthiness and geographic location cadence judgment collection fee not probable cadence 
does not record revenue until the uncertainty removed which generally upon receipt cash payment 
multiple element arrangements 
mea any arrangement that includes contemplates rights for combination software 
hardware products services training maintenance single arrangement from time time cadence may 
include individual deliverables separately priced and separately executed contracts with the same customer 
cadence evaluates all relevant facts and circumstances determining whether the separate contracts should 
accounted for individually distinct arrangements whether the separate contracts are substance mea 
significant judgment involved determining whether group contracts might closely related that 
they are effect part single arrangement cadence judgments about whether several contracts together 
comprise mea can affect the timing revenue recognition under those contracts which could have effect 
its results operations for the periods involved 
for mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements cadence allocates the total consideration 
based the relative standalone selling prices each element these circumstances cadence required 
use hierarchy determine the standalone selling price used for allocating consideration deliverables 
follows 
vendor specific objective evidence fair value vsoe 
third party evidence selling price tpe and 
best estimate the selling price besp 
vendor specific objective evidence fair value cadence vsoe for maintenance based upon the 
customer stated annual renewal rates and vsoe for services based the price charged when the services 
are sold separately cadence has not established vsoe for certain products including software and licenses 
and hardware products for annual maintenance that not cancellable the customer 
third party evidence selling price tpe determined based competitor prices for similar 
deliverables when sold separately generally cadence offerings contain significant differentiation such that 
comparable pricing products with similar functionality cannot obtained furthermore cadence unable 
reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are when those products are sold 
standalone basis therefore cadence typically not able obtain tpe and tpe not used determine any 
standalone selling prices 
best estimate the selling price cadence calculates the besp its hardware products based its 
pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products cadence 
process for determining besp for its software deliverables takes into account multiple factors that vary 
depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related each deliverable key external and internal factors 
considered developing the besps include prices charged cadence for similar arrangements historical 
pricing practices and the nature the product addition when developing besps cadence may consider other 
factors appropriate including the pricing competitive alternatives they exist and product specific 
business objectives 
for meas that contain software and nonsoftware elements cadence allocates the consideration software 
software related elements group and any nonsoftware element separately based the standalone 
selling price hierarchy the consideration allocated each element then recognized revenue when the basic 
revenue recognition criteria are met for each element once the consideration allocated the group 
software and software related elements then follows the recognition principles software revenue recognition 
accounting standards 
for meas involving only software and software related deliverables vsoe must exist allocate the total 
fee among all delivered and undelivered elements vsoe all undelivered elements exists revenue 
recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe the undelivered elements 
deferred and the remaining portion the arrangement fee recognized front the elements are delivered 
vsoe does not exist for all elements support the allocation the total fee among all elements the 
arrangement vsoe does not exist for all undelivered elements apply the residual method revenue 
recognized ratably over the term the undelivered elements

taxes collected from customers and remitted governmental authorities cadence applies the net basis 
presentation for taxes collected from customers and remitted governmental authorities 
derivative financial instruments 
cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions protect 
against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities foreign currency forward 
exchange contract acts hedge increasing value when underlying assets decrease value underlying 
liabilities increase value due changes foreign exchange rates conversely foreign currency forward 
exchange contract decreases value when underlying assets increase value underlying liabilities decrease 
value due changes foreign exchange rates the forward contracts are not designated accounting hedges 
and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized other income net advance the actual 
foreign currency cash flows the fair value these forward contracts recorded accrued liabilities other 
current assets these forward contracts generally have maturities days less 
receivables 
cadence receivables net includes invoiced accounts receivable and the current portion unbilled 
receivables unbilled receivables represent amounts cadence has recorded revenue for which payments from 
customer are due over time cadence accounts receivable and unbilled receivables were initially recorded the 
transaction value cadence long term receivables balance includes receivable balances invoiced more 
than one year after each balance sheet date 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
each fiscal quarter cadence assesses its ability collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances 
for portion its receivables when collection not probable cadence analyzes the creditworthiness its 
customers historical experience changes customer demand and the overall economic climate the industries 
that cadence serves provisions are made based upon specific review customer receivables and are recorded 
operating expenses 
inventories 
inventories are stated the lower cost market value cadence inventories include high technology 
parts and components for complex emulation and prototyping hardware systems these parts and components are 
specialized nature and may subject rapid technological obsolescence while cadence has programs 
minimize the required inventories hand and considers technological obsolescence when estimating required 
reserves reduce recorded amounts market values reasonably possible that such estimates could change 
the near term cadence policy reserve for inventory excess month demand for other known 
obsolescence realization issues

established completion working model the product and amortization begins when product available 
for general release customers the period between the achievement technological feasibility and the general 
release cadence products has typically been short duration costs incurred during fiscal and 
were not material 
goodwill 
cadence conducts goodwill impairment analysis annually and necessary changes facts and 
circumstances indicate that the fair value cadence single reporting unit may less than its carrying amount 
cadence goodwill impairment test consists two steps the first step requires that cadence compare the 
estimated fair value its single reporting unit the carrying value the reporting unit net assets including 
goodwill the fair value the reporting unit greater than the carrying value its net assets goodwill not 
considered impaired and further testing required the fair value the reporting unit less than the 
carrying value its net assets cadence would required complete the second step the test analyzing 
the fair value its goodwill the carrying value the goodwill exceeds its fair value impairment charge

long lived assets including acquired intangibles 
cadence definite lived long lived assets consist property plant and equipment and other acquired 
intangibles acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized straight line basis over the remaining 
estimated economic life the underlying products and technologies which range from one fourteen years 
cadence reviews its definite lived long lived assets for impairment whenever events changes 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount long lived asset asset group may not recoverable 
recoverability asset asset group measured comparison its carrying amount the expected future 
undiscounted cash flows that the asset asset group expected generate determined that the carrying 
amount asset group not recoverable impairment loss recorded the amount which the carrying 
amount the asset asset group exceeds its fair value 
non marketable investments 
cadence non marketable investments include its investments privately held companies these 
investments are initially recorded cost and are included other assets the consolidated balance sheets 
cadence accounts for these investments using either the cost method the equity method accounting 
cadence reviews the fair value its non marketable investments regular basis determine whether the 
investments these companies are other than temporarily impaired cadence considers investee financial 
performance and other information received from the investee companies well any other available 
estimates the fair value the investee companies its review cadence determines the carrying value

deferred revenue 
deferred revenue arises when customers are billed for products services advance revenue 
recognition cadence deferred revenue consists primarily unearned revenue product licenses and the 
related maintenance for which revenue recognized over the duration the license the fees for term and 
subscription licenses are generally billed quarterly advance and the related revenue recognized over multiple 
periods over the ensuing license period maintenance perpetual licenses generally renewed annually billed 
full advance and the corresponding revenue recognized over the month maintenance term

accounting for income taxes 
cadence accounts for the effect income taxes its consolidated financial statements using the asset and 
liability method this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing 
carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from differing treatment items such depreciation for tax 
and accounting purposes these differences result deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted 
tax rates expected apply taxable income the years when those temporary differences are expected 
recovered settled 
cadence then records valuation allowance reduce the deferred tax assets the amount that cadence 
believes more likely than not realized based its judgment all available positive and negative 
evidence the weight given the potential effect negative and positive evidence commensurate with the 
extent which the strength the evidence can objectively verified this assessment which completed 
taxing jurisdiction basis takes into account number types evidence including the following 
the nature and history current cumulative financial reporting income losses 
sources future taxable income 
the anticipated reversal expiration dates the deferred tax assets and 
tax planning strategies 
cadence takes two step approach recognizing and measuring the financial statement benefit uncertain 
tax positions the first step evaluate the tax position for recognition determining whether the weight 
available evidence indicates that more likely than not that the tax position will sustained audit 
including resolution any related appeals litigation processes the second step measure the tax benefit 
the largest amount that more than likely being realized upon settlement the audit cadence 
classifies interest and penalties unrecognized tax benefits income tax expense benefit 
restructuring charges 
cadence records personnel related restructuring charges with customary termination benefits when the costs 
are both probable and estimable cadence records personnel related restructuring charges with non customary 
termination benefits when the plan has been communicated the affected employees cadence records facilitiesrelated restructuring charges the period which the affected facilities are vacated connection with 
facilities related restructuring plans cadence has made number estimates and assumptions related losses 
excess facilities that have been vacated consolidated particularly the timing subleases and sublease 
terms closure and space reduction costs included the restructuring charges include payments required under 
leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned lease buyout costs and 
certain contractual costs maintain facilities during the period after abandonment 
cadence records estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs along with other 
personnel related restructuring costs long term asset impairments related abandoned assets and other costs 
associated with the restructuring plan cadence regularly evaluates the adequacy its lease loss accruals and 
severance and related benefits accruals and adjusts the balances based actual costs incurred changes 
estimates and assumptions subsequent adjustments restructuring accruals are classified restructuring and 
other charges the consolidated income statements 
stock based compensation 
cadence recognizes the cost employee services received exchange for awards equity instruments 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense measured the grant date based 
the value the award and recognized expense less expected forfeitures over the requisite service period 
which typically the vesting period cadence recognizes stock based compensation expense the straight line 
method for awards that only contain service condition and the graded vesting method for awards that 
contain both service and performance condition 
the fair value stock options and purchase rights issued under cadence espp are calculated using the 
black scholes option pricing model the computation the expected volatility assumption used for new awards 
based implied volatility when the remaining maturities the underlying traded options are least one 
year when the remaining maturities the underlying traded options are less than one year expected volatility 
based weighting historical and implied volatilities when determining the expected term cadence 
reviews historical employee exercise behavior from options having similar vesting periods the risk free interest 
rate for the period within the expected term the option based the yield united states treasury notes for 
the comparable term effect the time grant the expected dividend yield used the calculation zero 
because cadence has not historically paid and does not expect pay dividends the foreseeable future
