industry background 
believe four principal forces drive the need for our products and services the widespread 
use manufacturers cad product development which shortens product cycles the adoption 
manufacturers quality standards such six sigma and iso and its offshoot 
which stress the measurement every step manufacturing process reduce eliminate defects 
the inability traditional measurement devices address many manufacturing problems such 
throughput efficiency and accuracy especially with respect large components for products such 
automobiles aircraft heavy duty construction equipment and factory retrofits and the growing 
demand capture and synthesize large volumes three dimensional data for modeling and analysis 
cad improves the manufacturing process the creation physical products involves the 
processes design engineering production and measurement and quality inspection these basic 
processes have been profoundly affected the computer hardware and software revolution that began 
the cad software was developed automate the design process providing manufacturers 
with computerized design capability and shortening the time between design changes today most 
manufacturers use some form cad software create designs and engineering specifications for 
new products and quantify and modify designs and specifications for existing products while 
manufacturers previously designed their products remain production for longer periods time 
current manufacturing practices must accommodate more frequent product introductions and 
modifications while satisfying more stringent quality and safety standards assembly fixtures and 
measurement tools must linked the cad design enable production keep with the rate 
design change 
quality standards dictate measurement reduce defects the name given the 
quality system requirements the automotive industry developed chrysler ford general motors 
and major truck manufacturers companies registered under are considered have higher 
standards and better quality products six sigma set quality standards that embodies the 
principles total quality management focused measuring results and reducing product service 
failure rates per million all aspects six sigma company infrastructure must analyzed 
and necessary restructured increase revenues and raise customer satisfaction levels the 
all encompassing nature these and other quality standards has resulted manufacturers measuring 
every aspect their processes including stages product assembly that may never have been 
measured before part because the lack suitable measurement equipment 
traditional products not measure significant aspect the manufacturing process 
entails measurement and quality inspection historically manufacturers have measured and inspected 
products using hand measurement tools such scales calipers micrometers and plumb lines for 
simple measuring tasks test check fixtures for certain large manufactured products and traditional 
fixed coordinate measurement machines cmm for objects that require higher precision 
measurement however the broader utility each these measurement methods limited 
although hand measurement tools are often appropriate for simple geometric measurements 
including hole diameters length and width rectangular component their use for complex part 
measurements such the fender car limited also these devices not allow for the 
measurements directly compared electronically the cad model the part test fixtures 
customized fixed tools used make comparative measurements complex production parts 
master parts are relatively expensive and must reworked discarded each time dimensional 
change made the part being measured addition these manual measuring devices not permit 
the manufacturer electronically compare the dimensions object with its cad model 
conventional cmms are generally large fixed base machines that provide very high levels 
precision and provide link the cad model the object being measured however fixed base 
cmms require that the object being measured brought the cmm and fit within the cmm 
measurement grid manufactured subassemblies increase size and become integrated into even 
larger assemblies they become less transportable thus diminishing the utility conventional cmm 
consequently manufacturers must continue use hand measurement tools expensive customized 
test fixtures measure large unconventionally shaped objects addition some parts 
assemblies are not easily accessible and cannot measured using traditional devices 
the market demands three dimensional data various factors contribute market demand for 
faro products and services conventional surveying equipment limited single point 
measurements and does not have the capacity capture and analyze large volumes threedimensional data data requirements for construction civil engineering and public safety 
applications become more complex single point measurement devices will become increasingly more 
difficult utilize those applications 
escalating global competition has created demand for higher quality products with shorter life 
cycles customers require more rapid design greater control the manufacturing process tools 
compare components their cad specifications the ability precisely measure components that 
cannot measured inspected conventional devices and the ability capture and analyze large 
volumes three dimensional data moreover they increasingly require measurement capabilities 
integrated into manufacturing processes and available the factory floor these changing 
demands have contributed the demand for faro products and services

financing for future acquisitions necessary satisfactory terms otherwise complete acquisitions 
the future the past have used our stock consideration for acquisitions our common stock 
may not remain price which can used consideration for acquisitions without diluting our 
existing shareholders and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively 
addition realization the benefits acquisitions often requires integration some all 
the sales and marketing distribution manufacturing engineering software development customer 
service finance and administrative organizations the acquired companies the integration 
acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the management the 
acquired companies our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions may subject variety 
risks and uncertainties including 
the inability assimilate effectively the operations products technologies and personnel

and typically requires significant time and expense for further penetrate the potential market 
specific customer which may delay our ability generate additional revenue 
our success depends part our ability further penetrate our customer base during 
approximately our revenue was attributable sales our existing customers are not 
able continue further penetrate our existing customer base our sales growth may further decline 
however most our customers have decentralized buying process for measurement devices and 
must spend significant time and resources increase revenues from specific customer for example 
may provide products only one our customer manufacturing facilities for specific 
product line within manufacturing facility cannot offer any assurance that will able 
maintain increase the amount sales our existing customers which could adversely affect our 
financial results 
our failure attract and retain qualified personnel could lead loss sales decreased

critical accounting policies 
the preparation our consolidated financial statements requires our management make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities revenues and 
expenses well disclosure contingent assets and liabilities base our estimates historical 
experience along with various other factors believed reasonable under the circumstances the 
results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources some these judgments can subjective and 
complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
conditions while for any given estimate assumption made our management there may 
other estimates assumptions that are reasonable believe that given the current facts and 
circumstances unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate assumption would 
materially impact the financial statements 
response the sec financial reporting release cautionary advice regarding 
disclosure about critical accounting policies have selected our critical accounting policies for 
purposes explaining the methodology used our calculation addition any inherent 
uncertainties pertaining the possible effects our financial condition the critical policies 
discussed below are our processes recognizing revenue the reserve for excess and obsolete 
inventory income taxes the reserve for warranties goodwill impairment business combinations and 
stock based compensation these policies affect current assets current liabilities and operating results 
and are therefore critical assessing our financial and operating status these policies involve certain 
assumptions that incorrect could have adverse impact our operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognized when the price fixed collectability reasonably assured the title and 
risks and rewards ownership have passed the customer and the earnings process complete 
revenue related our measurement imaging and realization equipment and related software 
generally recognized upon shipment consider the earnings process complete the shipping 
date fees billed customers associated with the distribution products are classified revenue 
warrant our products against defects design materials and workmanship for one year provision 
for estimated future costs relating warranty expense recorded when products are shipped 
separately sell extended warranties extended warranty revenues are recognized straight line basis 
over the term the warranty costs relating extended warranties are recognized incurred 
revenue from sales software only recognized when further significant production 
modification customization the software required and when the following criteria are met 
persuasive evidence sales agreement exists delivery has occurred and the sales price fixed 
determinable and deemed collectible these software arrangements generally include short term 
maintenance that considered post contract support pcs generally establish vendor specific 
objective evidence vsoe fair value for this pcs component based our maintenance renewal 
rate maintenance renewals when sold are recognized straight line basis over the term the 
maintenance agreement revenues resulting from sales comprehensive support training and 
technology consulting services are recognized such services are performed and are deferred when 
billed advance the performance services revenues are presented net sales related taxes 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
because the value inventory that will ultimately realized cannot known with exact 
certainty rely upon both past sales history and future sales forecasts provide basis for the 
determination the reserve inventory considered potentially obsolete have withdrawn those 
products from the market had sales the product for the past months and have sales 
forecasted for the next months inventory considered potentially excess the quantity hand 
exceeds months expected remaining usage the resulting obsolete and excess parts are then 
reviewed determine substitute usage future need exists items without identified current 
future usage are reserved amount equal the first first out fifo cost such 
inventory our products are subject changes technologies that may make certain our products 
their components obsolete less competitive which may increase our historical provisions the 
reserve 
income taxes 
review our deferred tax assets regular basis evaluate their recoverability based upon 
expected future reversals deferred tax liabilities projections future taxable income over 
two year period and tax planning strategies that might employ utilize such assets including net 
operating loss carryforwards based the positive and negative evidence recoverability 
establish valuation allowance against the net deferred assets taxing jurisdiction which 
operate unless more likely than not that will recover such assets through the above means 
the future our evaluation the need for the valuation allowance will significantly influenced 
our ability achieve profitability and our ability predict and achieve future projections taxable 
income over least two year period 
significant judgment required determining our worldwide provision for income taxes the 
ordinary course operating global business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax 
outcome uncertain establish provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax 
positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that not meet the minimum 
probability threshold described financial accounting standards board fasb accounting 
standards codification asc topic income taxes which tax position that more likely 
than not sustained upon examination the applicable taxing authority the ordinary course 
business are examined various federal state and foreign tax authorities regularly assess the 
potential outcome these examinations and any future examinations for the current prior years 
determining the adequacy our provision for income taxes assess the likelihood and amount 
potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes 
the period which the facts that gave rise revision become known 
reserve for warranties 
establish the time sale liability for the one year warranty included with the initial 
purchase price equipment based upon estimate the repair expenses likely incurred for the 
warranty period the warranty period measured installation months for each major product group 
the warranty reserve included accrued liabilities the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets the warranty expense estimated applying the actual total repair expenses for each product 
group the prior period and determining rate repair expense per installation month this repair 
rate multiplied the number installation months warranty for each product group determine 
the provision for warranty expenses for the period evaluate our exposure warranty costs the 
end each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group 
the number units remaining under warranty and the remaining number months each unit will 
under warranty have history new product introductions and enhancements existing 
products which may result unforeseen issues that increase our warranty costs while such expenses 
have historically been within expectations cannot guarantee this will continue the future 
goodwill impairment 
goodwill represents the excess cost business acquisition over the fair value the net assets 
acquired not amortize goodwill however perform annual review the fourth quarter 
each year more frequently indicators potential impairment exist determine the carrying 
value the recorded goodwill indefinite lived intangible assets impaired asset impaired 
the difference between the value the asset reflected the financial statements and its current fair 
value recognized expense the period which the impairment occurs 
each period and for any our reporting units can elect perform qualitative assessment 
determine whether necessary perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
believe result our qualitative assessment that not more likely than not that the fair 
value reporting unit containing goodwill less than its carrying amount then the first and second 
steps the quantitative goodwill impairment test are unnecessary elect bypass the qualitative 
assessment option the qualitative assessment was performed and resulted the company being 
unable conclude that not more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit containing 
goodwill greater than its carrying amount will perform the two step quantitative goodwill 
impairment test perform the first step the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
calculating the fair value the reporting unit using discounted cash flow method and market 
approach method and then comparing the respective fair value with the carrying amount the 
reporting unit the carrying amount the reporting unit exceeds its fair value perform the 
second step the quantitative goodwill impairment test measure the amount the impairment loss 
any management has concluded there was goodwill impairment for the years ended 
december and 
business combinations 
allocate the fair value purchase consideration the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
based their fair values the acquisition date the excess the fair value purchase consideration 
over the fair value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded goodwill when 
determining the fair values assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant 
estimates and assumptions especially with respect intangible assets critical estimates valuing 
intangible assets include but are not limited expected future cash flows which include 
consideration future growth rates and margins customer attrition rates future changes technology 
and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based the 
assumptions management believes market participant would use pricing the asset liability 
amounts recorded business combination may change during the measurement period which

restricted stock awards and stock options with market condition estimated the date grant

required determining the expected volatility our common stock and the expected life that 
individuals will hold their stock options prior exercising expected volatility for stock options 
based the historical and implied volatility our own common stock while the volatility for our 
restricted stock units with market condition based the historical volatility our own stock and 
the stock companies within our defined peer group the expected life stock options derived

our goodwill december and related our previous acquisitions evaluate 
each reporting unit fair value compared its carrying value december each year more 
frequently events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair 
value first perform qualitative assessment determine whether the existence events 
circumstances leads determination that more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit 
less than its carrying amount and necessary perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
step the quantitative goodwill impairment test performed the fair value the reporting units 
measured using discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks 
involved for each reporting unit and market approach the key assumptions used the discounted cash 
flow model include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates these 
rates are susceptible change and require significant management judgment the market approach relies 
analysis publicly traded companies similar and derives range revenue and profit 
multiples the publicly traded companies used the market approach are selected based our defined 
peer group the resulting multiples are then applied each reporting unit determine fair value
