compared any time our history the most excited about our current business portfolio 
and the overall outlook for our end markets seventeen years ago teledyne was largely comprised 
low margin service businesses whose technology was often owned our customers today 
are leading manufacturer proprietary high technology products for demanding markets 
and critical applications 
teledyne instruments are used continuously monitor air quality across the globe provide 
broad spectrum imaging sensors and cameras for applications ranging from commercial 
machine vision space based sensors search the origin the universe certain products 
are well engineered that they can last for years the ocean floor autonomously travel 
for months sea others systems have operated for decades deep space seven billion 
miles from earth 
over the last several years have endured cuts defense spending followed severe 
decline offshore energy markets while exceptionally pleased with our execution and our 
responses such challenges also excited the feeling that the majority such turmoil 
behind for the first time years there obvious storm the horizon for teledyne 
our largest end markets 
despite the recent headwinds achieved record operating margin the third quarter 
generated record full year cash flow and were largely able maintain gaap earnings 
even including acquisition related charges furthermore our year end backlog was over 
million greater than last year 
looking forward most our commercial businesses are growing marine instrumentation 
comparisons will ease significantly and our government businesses are recovering 
addition our largest acquisition date currently pending and should completed shortly 
finally while have reduced our manufacturing footprint and headcount when necessary 
over the last few years firmly believe that the quality and depth teledyne management has 
never been higher 
our business portfolio continued 
evolve and improve for example 
enhanced our software capabilities 
with the acquisition caris the 
leading developer geospatial software 
designed for the hydrographic and marine 
mapping community 
teledyne lecroy was already the market 
leader serial data protocol analyzers

finally increased our products for life sciences and 
pharmaceutical applications with the acquisition hanson 
research whose instruments help determine the release rate 
active pharmaceutical ingredient tablet capsule form dissolves into solution 
worth noting that have not sold any businesses which 
have acquired however will exit those businesses which become 
commoditized which longer find attractive july 
sold teledyne printed circuit technology while part teledyne 
for over years the divestiture was consistent with our focus 
high technology higher margin proprietary engineered products 
december were delighted announce the acquisition

specifically internally funded research and development was record approximately 
million eight percent sales and with relevant customer funded the value was closer 
twelve percent also differentiate 
ourselves from most companies our size having 
centralized applied research laboratory that 
bolsters our product development capabilities 
selected new products and honors included teledyne lecroy oscilloscope which 
was named electronics products product the year both february and 
january teledyne optech received the annual grand award for technology from mapps 
national association firms the surveying spatial data and geographic information systems 
possess one the broadest portfolios unmanned marine vehicles 
markets 
and december teledyne built autonomous underwater vehicle made headlines when 
the 
drone was seized international waters 
conclusion are much leaner company today and our current market outlook the 
most favorable years while there will always some turbulence nevertheless believe 
are 
entering more stable period multi year growth revenue and earnings

the government was the objective simulation framework contract with the missile defense agency which represented 
our total sales 
described under risk factors there are risks associated with doing business with the government 
approximately our government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed price type contracts compared 
and under these types contracts bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may 
exceed the fixed contract price such contracts are typically not subject renegotiation profits fail anticipate 
technical problems estimate costs accurately control costs during performance additionally government contracts 
are subject termination the government its convenience without identification any default when contracts 
are terminated for convenience recover costs incurred committed settlement expenses and profit work completed 
prior termination had one government contract terminated for convenience compared with eight

orders during 
seasonality 
material portion our business considered seasonal 
raw materials and suppliers 
generally our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations the supply raw materials but not without some 
price volatility while some our businesses provide services for those businesses that sell hardware and product portion 
the value that provide labor oriented such design engineering assembly and test activities manufacturing our 
products use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors including international 
sources some the items use for the manufacture our products including certain gyro components for some marine 
navigation applications certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes certain infrared detectors substrates and 
certain ceramics and molding compounds used our sonar systems well certain scintillator materials used the 
production our ray detectors are purchased from limited single sources including international sources due 
technical capability price and other factors while over the years have not experienced much difficulty procuring raw 
materials components sub assemblies and other supplies required our manufacturing processes disruption the global 
economy and financial markets could trigger increased pricing otherwise affect our suppliers and negatively impact our 
ability procure such supplies 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing approach varies segment and products within our segments shared fundamental tenet 
the commitment work closely with our customers understand their needs with aim secure preferred supplier and 
longer term relationships 
our segments use combination internal sales forces third party distributors and commissioned sales representatives 
market and sell our products and services our teledyne instruments companies and other businesses have been working 
over the years consolidate share internal sales and servicing efforts several teledyne businesses have been marketing

ability provide superior products and technical solutions addition competitive pricing 
through teledyne technologies international corp and other subsidiaries have established offices foreign 
countries facilitate international sales for various businesses locations include brazil china france germany italy 
japan malaysia singapore south korea switzerland and the united arab emirates 
competition 
believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability invest the development new and 
enhanced products are critical obtaining and maintaining leadership our markets and the industries which 
compete although have certain advantages that believe help compete effectively our markets each our 
markets highly competitive with regard our defense businesses common the defense industry for work 
programs shared among number companies including competitors any event because the diversity 
products sold and the number markets serve encounter wide variety competitors none which believe 
offer all the same product and service lines serve all the same markets our businesses vigorously compete 
the basis quality product performance and reliability technical expertise price and service many our competitors 
have and potential competitors could have greater name recognition larger installed base products more extensive 
engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel 
resources than

discussed below while there are risks associated with acquisitions generally including closing and integration risks 
there are additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from and 
foreign policy changes political instability and exchange rate fluctuations with this acquisition greater percentage 
teledyne revenues and expenses will arise from international sources the acquisition will also significantly expand 
teledyne international employee base and manufacturing footprint result the acquisition the financial results 
the combined company will more exposed currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased proportion assets 
liabilities and earnings will denominated non dollar currencies the combined company will present its financial 
statements dollars and will have significant proportion net assets expenses and income non dollar 
currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro the combined company financial results and capital 
ratios will therefore sensitive movements foreign exchange rates depreciation non dollar currencies relative 
the dollar could have adverse impact the combined company financial results 
while most the products made and markets served are complementary teledyne the acquisition will 
expand the size teledyne digital imaging segment relative its other segments continued innovation and research and 
development efforts will required maintain leadership position imaging products and semiconductor production 
business also may more capital intensive than many teledyne other businesses increasing teledyne capital 
requirements approximately one quarter revenue relates long term contracts many which involve advancements 
technology and are fixed price discussed below inherent risk fixed price contracts that actual performance costs 
may exceed the projected costs which the contracts are agreed the failure anticipate technical problems estimate costs 
accurately control costs during the performance fixed price contract can reduce its profitability result loss 
may not realize all the anticipated benefits the proposed acquisition those benefits may take 
longer realize than expected may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties integrating the two 
businesses 
our ability realize the anticipated benefits the pending acquisition will depend large extent our ability 
integrate our business with business combining two independent businesses complex costly and time consuming 
process result will required devote significant management attention and resources integrating the business 
practices and operations the company and the integration process may disrupt the combined business and 
implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization the full benefits the acquisition that are currently expected our 
failure meet the challenges involved integrating the two businesses and realize the anticipated benefits the proposed 
acquisition could cause interruption loss momentum the activities and teledyne and could adversely 
affect our results operations addition the overall integration the businesses may result material unanticipated 
problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss customer relationships and diversion management attention 
addition even the operations the businesses the teledyne and are integrated successfully may not realize the 
full benefits the proposed acquisition including the synergies cost savings sales growth opportunities that expect 
the full benefits may not achieved within the anticipated time frame all additional unanticipated costs may 
incurred the integration the two businesses all these factors could adversely affect our earnings decrease delay the 
expected accretive effect the proposed acquisition negatively impact the price our common stock result 
cannot assure that the combination teledyne and businesses will result the realization the full benefits 
anticipated from the proposed acquisition 
order close the proposed acquisition will need incur significant level debt that could have 
significant consequences for our business and any investment our securities 
the proposed acquisition will teledyne largest acquisition date connection with the announcement the 
proposed acquisition december entered into million bridge credit facility fund the acquisition and 
related transaction costs order meet the requirement under the city code takeovers and mergers that have

significant consequences for our business and any investment our common stock including 
increasing our vulnerability adverse economic industry competitive developments 
reducing our ability use our cash flow fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities

limiting our ability making large acquisitions 
limiting our ability obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt 
service requirements acquisitions and general corporate other purposes and 
limiting our flexibility planning for reacting changes our business market conditions and placing 
competitive disadvantage compared our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may able 
take advantage opportunities that our leverage prevents from exploiting 
the pending acquisition subject various closing conditions well other uncertainties and there can 
assurances whether and when may completed failure consummate the proposed acquisition 
could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 
the consummation the proposed acquisition subject certain customary conditions number the 
remaining conditions are not within our control and possible that such conditions may prevent delay otherwise 
materially adversely affect the completion the acquisition meetings held january shareholders voted 
favor the resolution approve the scheme arrangement and voted pass special resolution approve the 
implementation the scheme the waiting periods required under both the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements 
act amended and respect the state department itar registration have expired clearance 
expiration the waiting period under german merger control laws remains outstanding after discussions with the german 
authorities and teledyne submitted revised application for clearance february respect the acquisition 
the german authorities have one month review such revised submission clearance from the french ministry economy 
and finance and the french ministry defense respect the acquisition also remains outstanding 
under the city code takeovers and mergers may certain cases invoke condition the acquisition 
cause the acquisition not proceed only the panel takeovers and mergers satisfied that the circumstances giving 
rise that condition not being satisfied are material significance the company the context the acquisition because 
this consent requirement the conditions may provide less protection than the customary conditions offer for 
domestic company therefore may required proceed with the acquisition the event material adverse change 
cannot predict with certainty whether and when any the remaining required conditions will satisfied 
another uncertainty may arise the proposed acquisition does not receive timely receive the required regulatory approvals 
and clearances another event occurs that delays prevents the acquisition such delay failure complete the 
acquisition and the acquisition process may cause uncertainty other negative consequences that may materially and adversely 
affect our business financial condition and results operations and the extent that the current price our common stock 
reflects assumption that the acquisition will completed the price per share for our common stock could negatively

are subject the risks associated with international sales and international operations which could harm our 
business results operations 
during sales international customers accounted for approximately our total revenues compared with 
and sold products customers over countries the top five countries 
for international sales were china the united kingdom germany south korea and japan constituting approximately 
our total sales our acquisitions including caris bowtech products limited bowtech and icm bolt 
reson lecroy and dalsa contributed greater international sales noted above our 
pending acquisition will add our international presence anticipate that future sales international customers will 
continue account for significant and increasing percentage our revenues particularly since business and growth plans for 
many teledyne businesses focus sales outside the united states including emerging markets such china brazil and 
west africa 
risks associated with international sales include but are not limited 
political and economic instability 
international terrorism 
export controls including export controls related china sanctions related russia and increased scrutiny

changes legal and regulatory requirements 
and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products 
changes tax laws and tariffs 
changes china and russia relations 
difficulties protection and enforcement intellectual property rights 
transportation including piracy international waters and 
exchange rate fluctuations 
any these factors could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition 
exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost our products international customers and therefore reduce our 
competitive position given our several canada based businesses volatility the value the canadian dollar relative the 
dollar other foreign currencies could adversely affect the business operations and the financial condition our digital 
imaging segment 
june the united kingdom held referendum which voters approved exit from the european 
union commonly referred brexit the announcement brexit caused significant volatility global stock 
markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted the strengthening the dollar against foreign currencies 
which conduct business the announcement brexit and the potential withdrawal the from the may also 
create further global economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the economies the the countries and 
other nations may cause our current and future customers reduce their spending our products and services and may cause 
certain based customers source products from businesses based outside the for example brexit related 
uncertainty could lead reconsideration airbus future investment and spending the which could reduce 
sales for our based businesses that supply airbus given our several based businesses including our pending 
acquisition volatility the value the british pound relative the dollar other foreign currencies could 
increase the cost raw materials and components for our based businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the 
business operations and the financial condition our based businesses 
sales our products and services internationally are subject and local government regulations and procurement 
policies and practices including regulations relating import export control violations export control rules could result 
the impositions fines and penalties the suspension our ability export items from one more businesses the entire 
corporation depending the scope the suspension this could have material effect our ability perform certain 
international contracts attempts the new presidential administration withdraw from materially modify international 
trade agreements which were raised possibility the presidential campaign could adversely affect our business 
financial condition and results operations 
among other things are subject the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which generally prohibits 
companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose obtaining keeping business 
otherwise obtaining favorable treatment further the united kingdom also implemented the bribery act which 
increased the level anti bribery law enforcement and compliance relative the fcpa any determination that had

our growth strategy includes acquisitions acquisitions involve various inherent risks such 
our ability assess accurately the value strengths weaknesses internal controls contingent and other liabilities and 
potential profitability acquisition candidates 
the potential loss key personnel acquired business 
our ability integrate acquired businesses and achieve identified financial operating and other synergies 
anticipated result from acquisition 
our ability assess integrate and implement internal controls acquired businesses accordance with section 
the sarbanes oxley act 
the distraction management resulting from the need integrate acquired businesses 
increased competition for acquisition targets which may increase acquisition costs 
the potential impairment assets 
potential unknown liabilities associated with business acquire which invest including environmental 
liabilities 
the risks associated with acquiring privately held companies which generally not have formal comprehensive 
internal controls and compliance systems place public companies 
production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations 
risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally including those arising from and foreign 
government policy changes actions and exchange rate fluctuations and 
unanticipated changes business and economic conditions affecting acquired business 
while conduct financial and other due diligence connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form 
protection including indemnification from seller and sometimes escrow portion the purchase price cover 
potential issues such acquired companies may have weaknesses liabilities that are not accurately assessed brought our 
attention the time the acquisition further indemnities escrows may not fully cover such matters particularly matters 
identified after closing 
they have over the last few years acquisitions may also change the nature and level various risks faced 
teledyne for example our acquisition bolt increased our exposure the offshore energy exploration market the 
bolt acquisition the dalsa acquisition and the lecroy acquisition increased the percentage sales 
attributable commercial customers opposed the government noted above our pending acquisition 
increases our international presence and the percentage sales related the digital imaging segment these acquisitions 
coupled with our other recently acquired companies located outside the united states also increased the percentage 
revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure and foreign policy changes 
and exchange rate fluctuations additionally the businesses dalsa and lecroy are more capital intensive than other 
teledyne businesses which could result increasing teledyne capital requirements 
under sec rules teledyne must issue report management assessment the effectiveness internal controls over 
financial reporting the sec permits limited time based exclusion for acquisitions give company opportunity 
evaluate more fully the internal controls acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new additional internal 
controls our management report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our acquisitions caris 
quantum data frontline usa and hanson allowing additional time evaluate existing internal controls and implement 
additional controls appropriate with regard future acquisitions can provide assurance that will able 
provide report that contains significant deficiencies material weaknesses with respect these acquired companies 
other acquisitions 
connection with our acquisitions including ones which not complete may incur significant transaction costs 
are required expense incurred such transaction costs which may have material adverse impact our quarterly 
financial results further the acquisitions public companies such bolt and lecroy now routinely trigger purported 
class action lawsuits filed shareholders the target companies the defense which has increased transaction costs among 
other things 
changes future business conditions could cause business investments goodwill and other long lived assets become 
impaired resulting significant losses and write downs that would reduce our operating income 
january teledyne goodwill was million and net acquired intangible assets were million 
under current accounting guidance are required test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinite lived 
intangible assets for impairment based upon fair value approach rather than amortizing them over time have chosen 
perform our annual impairment reviews goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter 
each fiscal year also are required test goodwill for impairment between annual tests events occur circumstances 
change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events circumstances 
could include significant change the business climate including significant sustained decline entity market value 
legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale disposition significant portion the business other 
factors the fair market value less than the carrying value including goodwill could required record 
impairment charge the valuation reporting units requires judgment estimating future cash flows discount rates and 
estimated product life cycles making these judgments evaluate the financial health the business including such 
factors industry performance changes technology and operating cash flows have grown through acquisitions the 
amount goodwill and net acquired intangible assets significant portion our total assets result the amount any 
annual interim impairment could significant and could have material adverse effect our reported financial results for 
the period which the charge taken also may required record earnings charge incur unanticipated expenses

results operations 
united states and global responses terrorism continuing turmoil middle eastern countries and nuclear proliferation 
concerns increase uncertainties with respect and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our 
business and operations 
air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts well after the high profile 
outbreaks disease while travel our sales and service personnel various regions has been affected such factors 
additional declines air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition 
many our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and turn could adversely affect our aerospace and 
defense electronics segment the paris terrorist attacks the syrian refugee crisis could result governments europe 
imposing greater restrictions the movement personnel goods which could adversely impact our businesses located 
within the european union our ability sell products that region addition prolonged virus epidemic pandemic 
the threat thereof could result worker absences lower productivity voluntary closure our offices and manufacturing 
facilities disruptions our supply chain travel restrictions our employees and other disruptions our businesses 
moreover health epidemics may force local health and government authorities mandate the temporary closure our offices 
and manufacturing facilities 
deterioration financial performance airlines could result reduction discretionary spending for upgrades 
avionics and flight communications equipment which would adversely affect our aerospace and defense electronics 
segment 
higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airline related customers our aerospace and defense electronics 
segment conversely lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered 
our marine and other instrumentation businesses addition instability the middle east other oil producing regions could 
adversely affect expansion plans the oil and gas industry customers our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses 
our revenue from government contracts subjects many risks 
our revenue from government contracts depends the continued availability funding from the 
government and accordingly have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may canceled 
diverted other uses delayed 
perform work number contracts with the department defense and other agencies and departments 
the government including sub contracts with government prime contractors sales under contracts with the 
government whole including sales under contracts with the department defense prime contractor 
subcontractor represented approximately our total revenue compared with and 
performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have material effect our business results 
operations and financial condition 
government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability congressional appropriations and the failure 
congress appropriate funds for programs which participate could negatively affect our results operations the 
government shutdown during negatively affected many our businesses and the failure congress approve future 
budgets timely basis could delay procurement our products and services and cause lose future revenues 
additionally defense spending expected continue decline some areas over the next few years continued emphasis 
federal deficit and debt reduction could lead further decrease overall defense spending the continued war 
terrorism also could result diversion funds from programs which teledyne participates budgetary concerns could 
result future contracts being awarded more price than other competitive factors and smaller defense budgets could 
result government sourcing programs and more intense competition programs that are not sourced which could 
result lower revenues and profits 
the sequestration provision the budget control act originally imposed billion defense cuts over nine 
years starting fiscal year which represented approximately planned defense funding over the period 
november the bipartisan budget act the budget act was signed into law the budget act raises the statutory 
limit the amount permissible federal debt the debt ceiling until march and raises the sequester caps imposed the 
budget control act billion split equally between defense and domestic spending billion government 
fiscal year and billion government fiscal year december congress passed and the president 
signed the consolidated appropriations act which provides funding for the government for the government 
fiscal year providing trillion discretionary funding for federal agencies through september the president 
signed continuing resolution september which was extended december and provides funding for the 
government fiscal levels through april congress has yet pass budget although both chambers are 
moving forward with appropriations bills the total statutory spending cap remains trillion set the relief 
authorized and the bipartisan budget act the original sequestration specified the budget act 
which set discretionary caps through 
continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate continued business for because not all the programs 
which participate have current capabilities may provided with continued funding changes policy and budget 
priorities the president his administration and the congress for various defense and nasa programs could continue 
impact our engineered systems aerospace and defense electronics and digital imaging segments for example changes 
national space policy that affect nasa budget have occurred there have also been significant reductions missile defense 
budgets our engineered systems segment may further impacted delays production runs under the jassm and 
harpoon missile programs well department defense directives introduce competitive bidding for programs 
which have previously served sole source the president has expressed concern over the cost the joint strike 
fighter program our aerospace and defense electronics segment may impacted volume and price reductions 
connection with this program the extent they are imposed the timing program cycles can affect our results operations 
for particular quarter year and cancellations significant programs such the objective simulation framework osf 
the shallow water combat submersible swcs would affect our results also not uncommon for the 
department defense delay the timing awards for major programs for six twelve months reductions and delays 
research and development funding the government may continue impact our revenues darpa reviews its 
programs aimed technologically enhance military capabilities and national security changes the darpa research and 
technology development programs which participate could occur uncertainty over budgets priorities with the new 
presidential administration could result delays funding changes funded programs and the timing awards that could 
have material impact our revenues finally various department defense initiatives such the emphasis 
sourcing positions the government and anticipated reductions cancellations existing programs could negatively 
impact our engineered systems segment 
our participation government programs may decrease subject renegotiation those programs evolve 
over time 
the government has been placing emphasis small business quotas and increasing small business contract set 
asides and minimum work percentages some cases prime contractors are required reduce participation large 
subcontractors like teledyne order fill small business quotas and responsive proposals and bids result our 
engineered systems segment could significantly impacted 
over time and for variety reasons programs can evolve and affect the extent our participation have been 
significant participant nasa programs primarily through our engineered systems segment and through teledyne scientific 
company the prior administration introduced significant changes the national space policy including the cancellation 
the nasa constellation program which includes ares launch vehicles teledyne brown engineering has developed the 
muses earth imaging platform part our commercial space based digital imaging business the muses platform 
depends continued operation the iss and may not successful developing the technology commercial 
relationships necessary make this investment profitable the launch muses has been delayed due several launch 
failures space and now scheduled for the summer continued delays launching muses could have adverse 
impact the success this platform while most recently early were awarded five year million contract 
nasa marshall space flight center develop and manufacture the launch vehicle stage adapter for the space launch 
system failure further transition our business successfully could result reduced sales addition delayed funding and 
changes support for nasa current space policy could negatively impact our business the new presidential administration 
could also lead changes the nation space policy some all which could materially impact our results 
our contracts with the government are subject termination rights that could adversely affect 
most our government contracts are subject termination the government either its convenience 
upon the default the contractor termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery costs incurred 
committed settlement expenses and profit work completed prior termination termination for default clauses impose 
liability the contractor for excess costs incurred the government procuring undelivered items from another 
source had one government contract terminated for convenience compared with eight and three 
contracts were terminated for default during such three year period 
may lose money generate less than expected profits our fixed price and other government contracts and 
may lose money fail meet certain pre specified targets government contracts 
there guarantee that government contracts will profitable number our government prime 
contracts and subcontracts are fixed price type contracts our total government contracts were fixed price 
and under these types contracts bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may 
exceed the fixed contract price under such contracts must absorb cost overruns notwithstanding the difficulty 
estimating all the costs will incur performing these contracts cannot assure that our contract loss provisions our 
financial statements will adequate cover all actual future losses may lose money generate lower profits some 
contracts fail meet these estimates may also lose money non fixed price cost reimbursement contracts that 
contain dis incentives penalties related cost schedule performance 
our business subject government contracting regulations including increasingly complex regulations 
cybersecurity and our failure comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and 
prospects 
like other government contractors are subject various audits reviews and investigations including private party 
whistleblower lawsuits relating our compliance with federal and state laws more routinely the government may 
audit the costs incur our government contracts including allocated indirect costs such audits could result 
adjustments our contract costs any costs found improperly allocated specific contract will not reimbursed and 
such costs already reimbursed would need refunded have recorded contract revenues based upon costs expect 
realize final audit worst case scenario should business division involved charged with wrongdoing should 
the government determine that the business division not presently responsible contractor that business 
division and conceivably our company whole could temporarily suspended the event conviction could 
debarred for three years from receiving new government contracts government approved subcontracts addition 
could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and damages fines and penalties such charges were 
proven were result negotiated settlements the department defense well other government contracting 
agencies have adopted new rules and regulations requiring contractors implement set cyber security measures attain 
the safeguarding contractor systems that process store transmit certain information implementation and compliance 
with these new cyber security requirements complex and costly and could result unforeseen expenses lower profitability 
and the case non compliance penalties and damages all which could have adverse effect our business 
our indebtedness and any failure comply with our covenants that apply our indebtedness could materially and 
adversely affect our business 
january had million total outstanding indebtedness this indebtedness included 
million senior unsecured notes million term loans and amounts outstanding under our million credit facility result our pending acquisition expect that our total indebtedness will initially 
increase approximately million our indebtedness could harm our business among other things reducing the 
funds available make new strategic acquisitions reducing our flexibility planning for reacting changes our 
business and market conditions our indebtedness exposes interest rate risk since portion our debt obligations are 
variable rates our indebtedness could also have material adverse effect our business increasing our vulnerability 
general adverse economic and industry conditions downturn our business general adverse economic and industry 
conditions downturn our business could result our inability repay this indebtedness timely manner 
our pension expense and the value our pension assets are affected factors outside our control including the 
performance plan assets the stock market interest rates and actuarial experience 
have domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most our employees hired prior 
approximately our active employees also have several smaller domestic and foreign based pension plans 
january the value the combined pension assets greater than our combined pension benefit obligations the 
accounting rules applicable our pension plans require that amounts recognized the financial statements determined 
actuarial basis rather than contributions are made the plan two significant elements determining our pension 
income pension expense are the expected return plan assets and the discount rate used projecting pension benefit 
obligations declines the stock market and lower rates return could increase required contributions our qualified 
pension plan and result change shareholders equity our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns 
the credit financial stock markets deteriorate any decreases increases market interest rates will affect the discount rate 
assumption used projecting pension benefit obligations addition changes other actuarial assumptions such mortality 
assumptions change due legislative regulatory actions could impact our pension income expense well funding 
obligations each year beginning with the society actuaries released revised mortality tables which updated life 
expectancy assumptions consideration these tables updated the mortality assumptions used determining our 
pension and post retirement obligations consideration these tables modified the mortality assumptions used 
determining our pension and post retirement benefit obligations the impact these mortality assumptions increased our 
pension obligation and increased future pension expense made voluntary pretax cash contribution 
million the domestic pension plan contributions were made the domestic pension plan since the contribution 
and the extent decreases our pension assets are not offset voluntary contributions recovered through future asset 
returns mitigated increase the rate which the benefit obligation discounted other actions our required cash 
contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans for additional discussion pension matters see the 
discussion under item management discussion and analysis results operations and financial condition and 
notes and our notes consolidated financial statements 
our business and operations could suffer the event cyber security breaches

numerous factors including our ability anticipate customer and market requirements changes technology and industry 
standards our ability differentiate our offerings from offerings our competitors and market acceptance may not 
able develop and introduce new enhanced products timely and cost effective manner develop and introduce 
products that satisfy customer requirements 
our new products also may not achieve market acceptance correctly address new industry standards and technological 
changes may also lose any technological advantage competitors fail develop new products timely manner 
additionally new products may trigger increased warranty costs information such products augmented actual 
usage accelerated entry new products meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional 
warranty costs development and testing time periods might accelerated condensed 
intend both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products expand into new market segments 
may unsuccessful accessing these and other new markets our products not meet our customers requirements

become obsolete non competitive 
the markets for some our products and services are characterized rapid technological development evolving 
industry standards changes customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements faster than 
anticipated change one more the technologies related our products services market demand for products 
services based particular technology could result faster than anticipated obsolescence certain our products

operations and financial condition currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject change which 
may contribute the obsolescence our products services the political agenda the new presidential administration 
may affect the level environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending scientific research which 
could adversely impact the sales our products and services including sales pollution monitoring instruments and 
instruments used measure the earth climate and climate change such undersea gliders and space based imaging sensors 
may not able reduce the costs our products satisfy customers cost reduction mandates which could harm 
our sales margins 
more and more customers continue seek price reductions our products while continually work reduce our 
manufacturing and other costs our products without affecting product quality and reliability there assurance that 
will able and timely manner satisfy the pricing pressures our customers cost reductions raw 
materials and other components used our products may beyond our control depending market conditions customers 
may seek lower cost products from china and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower 
the airline industry heavily regulated and fail comply with applicable requirements our results operations 
could suffer 
governmental agencies throughout the world including the federal aviation administration the faa prescribe 
standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation 
products specific regulations vary from country country although compliance with faa requirements generally satisfies

increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services 
each our markets highly competitive many our competitors have and potential competitors could have greater 
name recognition larger installed base products more extensive engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution 
capabilities and greater financial technological and personnel resources than new existing competitors may also 
develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services industry acquisition and 
consolidation trends particularly among aerospace and defense contractors have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace 
and defense related engineering services large prime contractors source increased amounts major acquisition programs 
and also require significant expansion small business participation meet government contracting goals low cost 
competition from china and other developing countries could also result decreased demand for our products increasing 
competition could reduce the volume our sales the prices may charge which would negatively impact our revenues 
smaller defense budgets both the united states and europe could result additional competition for new and existing 
defense programs 
product liability claims product recalls and field service actions could have material adverse effect our reputation 
business results operations and financial condition and may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other 
insurance coverage 
manufacturer and distributor wide variety products including monitoring instruments products used 
offshore oil and gas production products used commercial aviation and products used medical devices most recently 
including ray detectors and generators our results operations are susceptible adverse publicity regarding the quality 
safety our products part product liability claims challenging the safety our products may result decline sales for 
particular product which could adversely affect our results operations this could the case even the claims themselves 
are proven untrue settled for immaterial amounts 
while have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities have self insured retentions 
deductibles under such policies with respect portion these liabilities awarded damages could more than our 
accruals could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit well cannot assure that for and future 
years insurance carriers will willing renew coverage provide new coverage for product liability 
product recalls can expensive and tarnish our reputation and have material adverse effect the sales our 
products cannot assure that will not have additional product liability claims that will not recall any products 
have been joined among number defendants often over lawsuits alleging injury death result 
exposure asbestos addition because the prominent teledyne name may continue mistakenly joined 
lawsuits involving company business that was not assumed part our spin off date have not 
incurred material liabilities connection with these lawsuits however our historic insurance coverage including that its 
predecessors may not fully cover such claims and the defense such matters coverage typically depends the year 
purported exposure and other factors nonetheless intend vigorously defend our position against these claims 
certain gas generators historically manufactured teledyne energy systems inc contained sealed wetted asbestos 
component while the company has transitioned replacement material had placed warning labels its products and took 
care the handling this discontinued material employees there assurance that the company will not face product 
liability workers compensation claims involving this component 
our teledyne brown engineering inc laboratory knoxville tennessee performs radiological analyses our 
teledyne dalsa professional imaging unit develops image sensors used medical and dental ray applications along with 
portable ray generators used non destructive testing and security applications addition our teledyne dalsa digital 
imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used eye examination and general surgical vision applications errors and 
omissions analyses may occur erroneous images could captured our insurance coverage indemnities may not

teledyne brown engineering inc and other teledyne companies manufacture components for customers the nuclear 
power market including utilities and certain governmental entities certain liabilities associated with such products are covered 
the price anderson nuclear industries indemnity act and other statutory and common law defenses and have received 
indemnities from some our customers however there assurance will not face product liability claims related 
such products that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which have liability coverage protection 
our business and financial results could adversely affected conditions and other factors associated with our 
suppliers 
some items purchase for the manufacture our products are purchased from limited single sources supply due 
technical capability price and other factors for example dalsa has single source supply for ccd semiconductor 
wafers used assemble image sensors and external single source supply for cmos semiconductor wafers used 
assemble ray panel products lecroy continues outsource portion its research and development activities third 
party engineering firm malaysia where may more difficult for enforce our intellectual property rights have 
also outsourced from time time the manufacturing certain parts components subsystems and even finished products 
single limited sources including international sources disruption these sources could cause delays reductions 
shipments our products increases our costs which could have adverse effect our financial condition operations 
international sources possess additional risks some which are similar those described above regard international 
sales with any continuing disruption the global economy and financial markets some our suppliers may also continue 
face issues gaining access sufficient credit and materials maintain their businesses which could reduce the availability 
some components and the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers could adversely affect our ability continue 
manufacture and sell our products continuing economic pressure suppliers may also trigger increased pricing workforce 
reductions reduced workweeks and shrinking supply base possibly creating longer lead times obtain needed components 
for our products delays material acceptance and greater risk receiving counterfeit parts 
some our commercial product lines may have one limited number customers the loss which could adversely 
affect our business financial results 
while commercial customer accounted for more than our total sales during and and have 
hundreds customers the various industries that serve some our product lines may have one few key customers 
the loss which could adversely affect our business financial results commercial customer accounted for more 
than total sales teledyne largest commercial customer and customer our instrumentation 
segment accounted for and total sales and respectively 
newer products such our ray generators and ray panel products may initially more heavily dependent 
singular limited number customers until market acceptance obtained due contractual terms similarly some older 
product lines may more heavily dependent singular limited number customers either such case program 
delays such customer customers well the loss such customer customers could adversely affect our business 
financial results 
face risks related sales through distributors and other third parties that not control which could harm our 
business 
sell portion our products through third parties such distributors value added resellers and oems collectively 
distributors using third parties for distribution exposes teledyne many risks including concentration credit risk and 
compliance risks may rely one more key distributors for product and the loss these distributors could reduce our 
revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection accounts 
receivables and financial results violations the fcpa similar anti bribery laws distributors other third party 
intermediaries could have material impact our business failing manage risks related our use distributors may 
reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position and could result sanctions against 
compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations well the effects potential 
environmental liabilities could have material adverse financial effect 
like other industry participants are subject various federal state local and international environmental laws and 
regulations may subject increasingly stringent environmental standards the future particularly greenhouse gas 
emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase future developments administrative actions liabilities 
relating environmental and climate change matters could have material adverse effect our business results operations 
financial condition environmental regulations hydraulic fracturing and the use seismic energy sources for offshore 
energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines our instrumentation segment 
our manufacturing operations including former operations could expose material environmental liabilities 
additionally companies acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed brought our 
attention the time the acquisition 
the environmental protection agency epa has focused greenhouse gases ghgs maintaining ghgs 
threaten the public health and welfare the american people the epa also maintains that ghg emissions from road 
vehicles contribute that threat the epa endangerment finding covers emissions six greenhouse gases the epa 
continuing efforts limit ghg emissions could adversely affect our manufacturing operations increase prices for energy 
fuel and transportation require accommodate changes parameters such the way parts are manufactured and may 
some cases require redesign certain our products this could lead increased costs which may not able 
recover from customers delays product shipments and loss market share competitors

natural and man made disasters could adversely affect our business results operations and financial condition 
several our facilities result their locations could subject catastrophic loss caused earthquakes 
hurricanes tornados floods ice storms other natural disasters many our production facilities and our headquarters are 
located california and thus are areas with above average seismic activity and may also risk damage wildfires 
teledyne dalsa semiconductor facilities quebec canada have been impacted severe ice storms including storm 
addition have manufacturing facilities the southeastern united states and texas that have been threatened and 
struck major hurricanes october lecroy and other teledyne facilities incurred business interruptions and were 
without power for several days result hurricane sandy our facilities alabama florida nebraska tennessee and 
virginia have also been threatened tornados june tornado caused substantial damage and interrupted business 
our teledyne hastings instruments facility hampton virginia april tornados caused substantial damage 
huntsville alabama while teledyne brown engineering main facility huntsville alabama incurred minimal building

our financial statements are based estimates required generally accepted accounting principles the united

conditions 
our financial statements are prepared conformity with gaap these principles require our management make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the 
reported amounts revenue and expenses during the reporting period for example estimates are used when accounting for 
items such asset valuations allowances for doubtful accounts allowance for excess and obsolete inventory depreciation and 
amortization impairment assessments employee benefits taxes recall and warranty costs product and general liability and 
contingencies while base our estimates historical experience and various assumptions that believe

guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors all fraud control system 
matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives the control 
system are met addition the design control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the 
benefit controls must relative their costs because the inherent limitations all control systems system 
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances fraud any within the company have been 
detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments decision making can faulty and that breakdowns 
can occur because simple error mistake further controls can circumvented individual acts some persons 
collusion two more persons management override the controls the design any system controls also 
based part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood future events and there can assurance that any design 
will succeed achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may inadequate because 
changes conditions the degree compliance with the policies procedures may deteriorate because inherent 
limitations cost effective control system misstatements resulting from error fraud may occur and may not detected 
provisions our governing documents applicable law and our change control severance agreements could make 
acquisition teledyne more difficult 
our restated certificate incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and the general corporation law the

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis assets and liabilities and their reported 
amount the financial statements which will result taxable deductible amounts the future evaluating our ability 
recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise consider all available positive and negative 
evidence including scheduled reversals deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and 
results recent operations projecting future taxable income begin with historical results adjusted for the results 
discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount future state federal and foreign pretax operating 
income adjusted for items that not have tax consequences the assumptions about future taxable income require significant 
judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates are using manage the underlying businesses evaluating the 
objective evidence that historical results provide consider three years cumulative operating income based the 
company history operating earnings expectations future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies 
management believes that possible that some portion deferred taxes will not realized future tax benefit and

could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions conditions our critical accounting policies are 
those that are reflective significant judgment complexity and uncertainty and may potentially result materially different 
results under different assumptions and conditions have identified the following critical accounting policies revenue

accounting for income taxes for additional discussion the application these and other accounting policies see note

customer fixed determinable and collectability reasonably assured 
determine the appropriate method which recognize revenue analyzing the terms and conditions our 
contracts arrangements entered into with our customers the majority our revenue relates product sales and 
recognized upon shipment the customer fixed determinable prices and with reasonable assurance collection 
passage title the customer and fulfillment all significant obligations revenue recognized net estimated sales 
returns and other allowances the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits customers the 
remaining revenue generally associated with long term contracts design develop and manufacture highly engineered 
products used commercial defense applications such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting 
percentage completion poc method 
the company standard terms sale are fob shipping point for small percentage sales where title and risk 
loss passes destination point and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met the company recognizes 
revenue upon delivery the customer any significant obligation the customer with respect sales transaction remains 
following shipment revenue recognition deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled general our revenue 
arrangements not involve acceptance provisions based customer specified acceptance criteria those circumstances 
when customer specified acceptance criteria exist and cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications 
prior the shipment then revenue deferred until customer acceptance obtained 
have few contracts that require the company warehouse certain goods for which revenue recognized when all 
risks loss borne the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met

method for these contracts dependent the nature the contract products provided depending the contract may 
measure the extent progress toward completion using the units delivery method cost cost method upon attainment 
scheduled performance contract milestones which could time event expense driven for example for costreimbursable contracts use the cost cost method measure progress toward completion under the cost cost method 
accounting recognize revenue and estimated profit allowable costs are incurred based the proportion that the 
incurred costs bear total estimated costs another example for contracts that require provide substantial number 
similar items record revenue and estimated profit poc basis using units delivery the basis measure 
progress toward completing the contract occasionally appropriate combine individual customer orders and treat them 
one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for single large project 
accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative assessing risks estimating 
contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues contract revenue may include estimated 
amounts not contractually agreed the customer including price redetermination cost performance incentives such 
award and incentives fees priced change orders claims and requests for equitable adjustment the poc method requires 
management judgment make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over long time period since certain 
contracts extend over long period time the impact revisions cost and revenue estimates during the progress work 
may adjust the current period earnings cumulative catch basis this method recognizes the current period the

business combinations goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
the results for all acquisitions are included the company consolidated financial statements from the date each 
respective acquisition business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method assigning the purchase price 
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded their fair 
values and the excess the purchase price over the amounts assigned recorded goodwill determine the fair value 
such assets and liabilities generally consultation with third party valuation advisors acquired intangible assets with finite 
lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives adjustments fair value assessments are recorded goodwill over the 
purchase price allocation period 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized review goodwill and acquired 
indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
these assets may not recoverable the company also performs annual impairment test the fourth quarter each 
year would test goodwill and acquired indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests events 
occur circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these

annual impairment test completed the fourth quarter each year 
for goodwill impairment testing the company estimates the fair value the reporting units using discounted cash 
flow model based our best estimate amounts and timing future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business 
and strategic plans and compares the estimated fair value the carrying value the reporting unit including goodwill the 
discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins 
discount rates and terminal values over multi year period there are inherent uncertainties related these assumptions and 
management judgment applying them the analysis goodwill impairment while the company believes has made 
reasonable estimates and assumptions calculate the fair value its reporting units possible material change could 
occur actual results are not consistent with management estimates and assumptions goodwill may overstated and 
charge would need taken against net earnings 
january the company had reporting units for goodwill impairment testing the carrying value 
goodwill included the company individual reporting units ranges from million million the company 
analysis indicated that all instances the fair value the company reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
and consequently did not result impairment charge the excess the estimated fair value over the carrying value 
expressed percentage carrying value the respective reporting unit for each the company reporting units 
the fourth quarter the annual testing date ranged from approximately

result goodwill impairment charge future period order evaluate the sensitivity the fair value calculations used 
the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decrease the fair values each reporting unit and 
compared those values the reporting unit carrying values based this sensitivity analysis the company did not identify 
any goodwill impairment due the many variables inherent the estimation reporting unit fair value and the relative

revenue recognition

persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery has occurred services have been rendered our price 
our customer fixed determinable and collectability reasonably assured 
determine the appropriate method which recognize revenue analyzing the terms and conditions our 
contracts arrangements entered into with our customers the majority our revenue relates product sales and 
recognized upon shipment the customer fixed determinable prices and with reasonable assurance collection 
passage title the customer and fulfillment all significant obligations revenue recognized net estimated sales 
returns and other allowances the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits customers the 
remaining revenue generally associated with long term contracts design develop and manufacture highly engineered 
products used commercial defense applications such contracts are generally accounted for using contract 
accounting percentage completion poc method 
the company standard terms sale are fob shipping point for small percentage sales where title and risk 
loss passes destination point and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met the company recognizes 
revenue upon delivery the customer any significant obligation the customer with respect sales transaction 
remains following shipment revenue recognition deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled general our 
revenue arrangements not involve acceptance provisions based customer specified acceptance criteria those 
circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist and cannot demonstrate that the product meets 
those specifications prior the shipment then revenue deferred until customer acceptance obtained 
have few contracts that require the company warehouse certain goods for which revenue recognized when 
all risks loss are borne the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
also have small number multiple elements arrangements free product training installation additional

consideration among the elements also extended non customary warranties not represent significant portion 
our revenue however when our revenue arrangements include extended non customary warranty provision the 
revenue deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period 
for contracts that require substantial performance over long time period generally one more years revenue 
recorded under the poc method record net revenue and estimated profit work our contracts progresses the 
poc method for these contracts dependent the nature the contract products provided depending the 
contract may measure the extent progress toward completion using the units delivery method cost cost 
method upon attainment scheduled performance contract milestones which could time event expense driven 
for example for cost reimbursable contracts use the cost cost method measure progress toward completion 
under the cost cost method accounting recognize revenue and estimated profit allowable costs are incurred 
based the proportion that the incurred costs bear total estimated costs another example for contracts that require 
provide substantial number similar items record revenue and estimated profit poc basis using units ofdelivery the basis measure progress toward completing the contract occasionally appropriate combine 
individual customer orders and treat them one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the 
customer for single large project 
accounting for contracts using the poc method requires management judgment relative assessing risks 
estimating contract revenue and cost and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues contract revenue may 
include estimated amounts not contractually agreed the customer including price redetermination cost 
performance incentives such award and incentives fees priced change orders claims and requests for equitable 
adjustment the poc method requires management judgment make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally 
over long time period since certain contracts extend over long period time the impact revisions cost and 
revenue estimates during the progress work may adjust the current period earnings cumulative catch basis this 
method recognizes the current period the cumulative effect the changes current and prior quarters additionally

value the company assets and liabilities focusing the most observable inputs when available 
level quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities
