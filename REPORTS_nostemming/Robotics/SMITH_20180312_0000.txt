investor meeting providing update navio which its handheld robotics

surgical robotics solutions the meeting followed the footsteps 
with surgical robotics once again equating the most important sector theme 
arguably surgical robotics has gained momentum with corporates hospitals and 
surgeons investing this area our physician expert lunch emphasized that 
surgical robotics was here stay and should not compared the short lived 
buzz image guided surgery solutions the early most physicians who 
were using surgical robot technology suggested that greater surgical 
accuracy precision was likely result better clinical outcomes which was 
especially relevant era where care coordination reimbursement models 
bundled payments for care improvement initiative and comprehensive care for 
joint replacement model are gaining momentum and importance although 
comprehensive clinical data still some time away stryker mako leading 
these initiatives confidence building the physician community that surgical 
robotics unlikely fad and instead should show better outcomes 
especially with knee joints where patient satisfaction remains well below hips 
with respect technology stryker mako robotic solution was considered 
many physicians have spoken the gold standard although several also 
raised praise for smith nephew navio solution due its simplicity flexibility 
and mobility 
smith nephew investor meeting the company invited the experienced 
physician jimmy chow who practices phoenix arizona and has used 
several robotic systems including navio and mako chow pointed out that

the metal from the primary hip knee implant need have separate 
robot for hips and knees not practical change hip and knee indication with 
mako and smith nephew journey knee implant newer and better 
implant stryker triathlon system while navio may have several advantages 
equally have heard several advantages mako from other physicians 
the biggest challenge for smith nephew likely share voice 
market which will see new and additional solutions enter the market 
companies with significantly larger resources zimmer biomet working 
rosa robot and expects launch its solution for total knee procedures during 
smith nephew remains quiet about how many robots has placed 
date for competitive reasons but given that its system was launched well 
after mako the first mover advantage stryker material nevertheless 
view navio significant opportunity for smith nephew and understand 
from the company that will step its investments which includes increase 
the number capital equipment sales people estimate that there are 
the far navio has not materially contributed smith 
nephew above market knee growth numbers but early indications are positive 
with hospital systems who are using navio showing increase pull 
through total hips and knees our current forecast treat smith 
nephew navio opportunity optionality our view are months 
away from getting better feeling whether navio can have material impact 
the company mid term organic sales growth potential 
ceo search resolved summer although not focus the smith nephew 
investor meeting understand that the company should position 
announce its new ceo the summer understand that the 
preference for someone with medical device background and both europeans 
and americans are being considered for the role appears however that 
several potential american ceos have very high compensation expectations 
which limits the number candidates our view this could mean that 
potential ceo candidate more likely come from larger conglomerate 
where they are currently charge division 
other tid bits the interest cementless knees increasing helped improved 
rough and innovative surface textures that can help improve osseointegration 
and fixation the implant the patient bone our physician panel remains 
touch sceptical based some the historical challenges these implants have 
faced over the past years nevertheless stryker affirmed the success 
having with its cementless technology with the mix now standing around 
our discussion with smith nephew highlighted that continues follow this 
space closely and emphasized that the company has well developed 
printing program 
investment conclusion while found aaos interesting remain uncertain 
whether smith nephew navio can equate material opportunity over the 
mid term this evolving space significant investments are required for both 
technology leadership and share voice and with more competitors entering 
this space over the coming months the path for success unlikely 
easy one for smith nephew remain equal weight believe smith
