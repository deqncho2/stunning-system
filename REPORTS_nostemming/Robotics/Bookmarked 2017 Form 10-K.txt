actions have taken may take offset these cycles may not sufficient 
capital equipment providers the electronics and semiconductor industries such teradyne have the 
past been negatively impacted both sudden slowdowns the global economies and recurring cyclicality 
within those industries these cycles have resulted periods over supply trend believe will continue 
occur for newer generations electronic products our business and results operations depend significant 
part upon capital expenditures manufacturers semiconductors and other electronics which turn depend 
upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption deterioration economic 
conditions may reduce customer purchases our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings 
addition such adverse changes economic conditions and resulting slowdowns the market for our products 
may among other things result increased price competition for our products increased risk excess and 
obsolete inventories increased risk the collectability our accounts receivable from our customers potential 
reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs accounts receivable increased risk restructuring charges and 
higher operating costs percentage revenues which each case and together adversely affect our 
operating results are unable predict the likely duration frequency and severity disruptions financial 
markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and cannot ensure that 
the level revenues new orders for fiscal quarter will sustained subsequent quarters have taken 
actions address the effects general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including 
implementing cost control and reduction measures cannot predict whether these measures will sufficient 
offset global market specific disruptions that might affect our test businesses and may need take 
additional different measures the future 
are subject intense competition 
face significant competition throughout the world each our reportable segments some our 
competitors have substantial financial and other resources pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and 
distribution their products also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal 
development several our customers some our competitors have introduced announced new products 
with certain performance characteristics that may considered equal superior those currently offer 
expect our competitors continue improve the performance their current products and introduce new 
products new technologies that provide improved cost ownership and performance characteristics new

customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customer use resale the product 
the ordinary course business 
our equipment has non software and embedded software components that function together deliver the 
equipment essential functionality revenue recognized upon shipment delivery destination point 
provided that customer acceptance criteria can demonstrated prior shipment certain contracts require 
perform tests the product ensure that performance meets the published product specifications customer 
requested specifications which are generally conducted prior shipment where the criteria cannot 
demonstrated prior shipment revenue deferred until customer acceptance has been received also defer 
the portion the sales price that not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 
for multiple element arrangements allocate revenues all deliverables based their relative selling

exist goodwill considered impaired when the net book value reporting unit exceeds its estimated 
fair value 
teradyne has the option perform qualitative assessment step zero determine whether morelikely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount teradyne determines this 
the case teradyne required perform the two step goodwill impairment test identify potential goodwill 
impairment and measure the amount goodwill impairment loss recognized teradyne determines that 
more likely than not that the fair value the reporting unit greater than its carrying amounts the two step 
goodwill impairment test not required when performing the two step process the first step involves 
comparison the estimated fair value reporting unit its carrying amount including goodwill 
performing the first step teradyne determines the fair value reporting unit using the results derived from 
income approach and market approach the income approach estimated through the discounted cash flow 
dcf analysis determining fair value requires the exercise significant judgment including judgments 
about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing expected future cash 
flows discount rates are based weighted average cost capital wacc which represents the average 
rate business must pay its providers debt and equity plus risk premium the wacc used test goodwill 
derived from group comparable companies the cash flows employed the dcf analysis are derived 
from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value the 
reporting unit utilizing the market comparable method which based revenue and earnings multiples from 
comparable companies the estimated fair value reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill 
the reporting unit not impaired and the second step the impairment test not necessary the carrying 
amount reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step the goodwill impairment test 
must performed the second step the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value the 
reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount goodwill measure the amount impairment loss any 
the implied fair value goodwill determined the same manner the amount goodwill recognized 
business combination whereby the estimated fair value the reporting unit allocated all the assets and 
liabilities that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets the reporting unit had been acquired 
business combination and the fair value the reporting unit was the purchase price paid the carrying
