fiscal and respectively sales customers taiwan accounted for approximately and our 
net sales fiscal and respectively did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 
our net sales during fiscal 
our international sales are substantially all dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject certain 
government export restrictions have not experienced any material difficulties date result export restrictions 
the semiconductor industry characterized seasonality and wide fluctuations supply and demand our business 
tends generate historically stronger revenues the first and second quarters and comparatively weaker revenues the third 
and fourth quarters our fiscal year however broad fluctuations our overall business changes semiconductor industry 
and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition atmel and our pending acquisition 
microsemi can have more significant impact our results than seasonality 
backlog 
april our backlog was approximately million compared million april 
our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent months 
primarily produce standard products that can shipped from inventory within relatively short time after receive 
order our business and large extent that the entire semiconductor industry characterized short term orders 
and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject changes delivery schedules 
cancellation the customer option without significant penalty thus while backlog useful for scheduling production 
backlog any particular date may not reliable measure our sales for any future period 
competition 
the semiconductor industry intensely competitive and has been characterized price erosion and rapid technological 
change compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many which have greater market 
recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than have with which pursue 
engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution their products also compete with number companies that 
believe have copied cloned pirated reverse engineered our proprietary product lines such countries china and 
taiwan are continuing take actions vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property 
worldwide basis 
currently compete principally the basis the technical innovation and performance our embedded control 
products including the following product characteristics 
performance 
analog digital and mixed signal functionality and level functional integration 
memory density 
low power consumption 
extended voltage ranges 
reliability 
packaging alternatives 
complete development tool line 
believe that other important competitive factors the embedded control market include 
ease use 
functionality application development systems 
dependable delivery quality and availability 
technical and innovative service and support 
time market 
price 
believe that compete favorably with other companies all these factors but may unable compete 
successfully the future which could harm our business 
patents licenses and trademarks 
maintain portfolio and foreign patents expiring various dates through also have numerous 
additional and foreign patent applications pending not expect that the expiration any particular patent will have 
material impact our business while our intention continue patent our technology and manufacturing processes 
believe that our continued success depends primarily the technological skills and innovative capabilities our personnel 
and our ability rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products with any operating company the scope and strength 
our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual 
property rights may insufficient provide meaningful protection commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations 
intellectual property rights worldwide basis complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright 
and trade secret laws further the laws particular foreign countries often fail protect our intellectual property rights the 
same extent the laws the 
have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and cross licenses with other companies and those licenses 
relate semiconductor products and manufacturing processes typical the semiconductor industry and our 
customers from time time receive and may continue receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement 
patent and other intellectual property rights diligently investigate all such notices and respond believe 
appropriate most cases believe that can obtain necessary licenses commercially reasonable terms however 
cannot certain that this would the case that litigation damages for any past infringement could avoided 
litigation which could result substantial costs and require significant attention from management may necessary 
enforce our intellectual property rights defend against claimed infringement the rights others the failure obtain 
necessary licenses the necessity engaging defensive litigation could harm our business 
environmental regulation 
must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related the use storage 
discharge and disposal certain chemicals and gases used our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed 
comply with these regulations and believe that our activities are conducted material compliance with such regulations 
any changes such regulations their enforcement could require acquire costly equipment incur other 
significant expenses comply with environmental regulations any failure adequately control the storage use 
discharge and disposal regulated substances could result significant future liabilities 
increasing public attention has been focused the environmental impact electronic manufacturing operations while 
have not experienced any materially adverse effects our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our 
business and results operations could suffer for any reason fail control the storage use adequately restrict 
the discharge disposal hazardous substances under present future environmental regulations

such selling assets restructuring debt obtaining additional equity capital terms that may onerous highly dilutive 
our ability refinance our indebtedness will depend the capital markets and our financial condition such time 
are dependent orders that are received and shipped the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility future 
product shipments 
our net sales any given quarter depend upon combination shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both 
received and shipped that same quarter which refer turns orders measure turns orders the beginning 
quarter based the orders needed meet the shipment targets that set entering the quarter historically have relied 
our ability respond quickly customer orders part our competitive strategy resulting customers placing orders with 
relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders percentage our business are 
relatively high any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility future product shipments turns orders correlate 
overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult predict varying levels 
turns orders make more difficult forecast net sales significant portion our products are manufactured 
foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability satisfy certain turns orders not achieve sufficient level 
turns orders particular quarter relative our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 
intense competition the markets serve may lead pricing pressures reduced sales our products reduced market 
share 
the semiconductor industry intensely competitive and has been characterized price erosion and rapid technological 
change compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many which have greater market 
recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than the 
semiconductor industry has experienced significant merger and acquisition activity and consolidation recent years which has 
resulted several our competitors becoming much larger terms revenue product offerings and scale may 
unable compete successfully the future which could harm our business our ability compete successfully depends 
number factors both within and outside our control including but not limited 
the quality performance reliability features ease use pricing and diversity our products 
our success designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies 
our ability ramp production and increase capacity needed our wafer fabrication and assembly and test 
facilities 
the rate which customers incorporate our products into their own applications and the success such 
applications 
the rate which the markets that serve redesign and change their own products 
our ability obtain adequate foundry and assembly and test capacity and supplies raw materials and other 
supplies acceptable prices

our ability address the needs our customers and 
general market and economic conditions 
historically average selling prices the semiconductor industry decrease over the life any particular product the 
average selling prices our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have remained 
relatively constant while average selling prices our memory and non proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing 
products have declined over time the overall average selling price our products affected these trends however 
variations our product and geographic mix sales can cause wider fluctuations our overall average selling price any 
given period 
have experienced and expect continue experience modest pricing declines certain our more mature 
proprietary product lines primarily due competitive conditions have been able moderate average selling price 
declines many our proprietary product lines continuing introduce new products with more features and higher prices 
however there can assurance that will able the future have experienced the past and expect 
continue experience the future varying degrees competitive pricing pressures our memory and non proprietary 
analog interface mixed signal and timing products may unable maintain average selling prices for our products 
result increased pricing pressure the future which could adversely impact our operating results 
are dependent wafer foundries and other contractors perform key manufacturing functions for and our 
licensees our superflash and other technologies also rely foundries and other contractors 
rely outside wafer foundries for significant portion our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 
and fiscal approximately and respectively our net sales came from products that were produced outside 
wafer foundries also use several contractors located primarily asia for portion the assembly and testing our 
products specifically during fiscal approximately our assembly requirements and our test requirements 
were performed third party contractors compared approximately our assembly requirements and our test 
requirements during fiscal our reliance third party contractors and foundries increased result our acquisitions 
atmel micrel smsc supertex and issc microsemi relies wafer foundries for significant portion its wafer 
fabrication needs accordingly upon completion our acquisition microsemi our reliance third party contractors and 
foundries will increase significantly the disruption termination any our contractors could harm our business and 
operating results 
our use third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions our business our future 
operating results could suffer any contractor were experience financial operational production difficulties situations 
when demand exceeds capacity they were unable maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs 
approximately their current levels the countries which such contractors are located were experience political 
upheaval infrastructure disruption these third parties are unable unwilling timely deliver products services 
conforming our quality standards may not able qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products 
timely manner terms favorable all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that 
are important fail adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that desire control costs any such event 
could experience interruption production increase manufacturing and production costs decline product 
reliability and our business and operating results could adversely affected further our use subcontractors increases the 
risks potential misappropriation our intellectual property 
certain our superflash and other technology licensees also rely outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication 
services our licensees were experience any disruption supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the 
revenue receive our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 
our operating results will suffer ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity fail maintain manufacturing 
yields 
the manufacture and assembly integrated circuits particularly non volatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices 
such those that produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive wide variety factors including the 
level contaminants the manufacturing environment impurities the materials used the performance our wafer 
fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues typical the semiconductor 
industry have from time time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer 
are unable maintain yields above approximately the current levels this could include delays the recognition 
revenue loss revenue future orders and customer imposed penalties for our failure meet contractual shipment 
deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when operate less than optimal capacity although 
operated normal capacity levels during fiscal and fiscal there can assurance that such production levels will 
maintained future periods 
our operating results are impacted both seasonality and the wide fluctuations supply and demand the 
semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry characterized seasonality and wide fluctuations supply and demand since 
significant portion our revenue from consumer markets and international sales our business tends generate historically 
stronger revenues the first and second quarters and comparatively weaker revenues the third and fourth quarters our 
fiscal year however broad fluctuations our overall business changes semiconductor industry and global economic 
conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition atmel and our pending acquisition microsemi can have 
more significant impact our results than seasonality result periods when these broad fluctuations changes 
business conditions acquisitions occur difficult assess the impact seasonal factors our business the 
semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized diminished product demand and 
production over capacity have sought reduce our exposure this industry cyclically selling proprietary products 
that cannot easily quickly replaced geographically diverse customer base across broad range market segments 
however have experienced substantial period period fluctuations operating results and expect the future 
experience period period fluctuations operating results due general industry economic conditions 
our business dependent selling through distributors 
sales through distributors accounted for approximately our net sales fiscal and approximately our 
net sales fiscal not have long term agreements with our distributors and and our distributors may each 
terminate our relationship with little advance notice 
any future adverse conditions the global economies the global credit markets could materially 
impact the operations our distributors any deterioration the financial condition our distributors any disruption the 
operations our distributors could adversely impact the flow our products our end customers and adversely impact our 
results operation addition during industry economic downturn possible there will oversupply 
products and decrease demand for our products from our distributors which could reduce our net sales given period 
and result increase inventory returns violations the foreign corrupt practices act similar laws our 
distributors other channel partners could have material adverse impact our business 
our success depends our ability introduce new products timely basis 
our future operating results depend our ability develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively 
the basis price and performance and which address customer requirements the success our new product introductions 
depends various factors including but not limited 
effective new product selection 
timely completion and introduction new product designs 
procurement licenses for intellectual property rights from third parties under commercially reasonable terms 
timely filing and protection intellectual property rights for new product designs 
availability development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for 
engineers understand and use and 
market acceptance our customers end products 
because our products are complex have experienced delays from time time completing new product development 
addition our new products may not receive maintain substantial market acceptance may unable timely design 
develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 
our success also depends upon our ability develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor 
design and process technologies are subject rapid technological change and require significant expenditures and 
other companies the industry have from time time experienced difficulties effecting transitions advanced process 
technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields delays product deliveries our future 
operating results could adversely affected any transition future process technologies substantially delayed 
inefficiently implemented 
may lose sales our suppliers raw materials and equipment fail meet our needs 
our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting 
standards generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only limited number suppliers capable 
delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business 
could become more difficult obtain worldwide use semiconductors product applications increases additionally 
consolidation our supply chain due mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number suppliers change the 
relationships that have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility increase costs have experienced 
supply shortages from time time the past and occasion our suppliers have told they need more time than expected 
fill our orders that they will longer support certain equipment with updates spare and replacement parts particular 
have recently experienced longer lead times for equipment which need for capacity expansion certain our 
manufacturing facilities interruption any materials equipment sources the lack supplier support for particular 
piece equipment could harm our business 
our reported financial results may adversely affected new accounting pronouncements changes existing 
accounting standards and practices including asc which will impact our revenue recognition 
prepare our financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the these 
accounting principles are subject interpretation changes the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and 
varying interpretations accounting standards and practices have occurred the past and are expected occur the future 
new accounting pronouncements change the interpretation existing accounting standards practices may have 
significant effect our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting transactions completed before the 
change announced effective may the fasb issued accounting standards update asu revenue from 
contracts with customers topic which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally 
accepted accounting principles the unites states america gaap the standard core principle that company 
will recognize revenue when transfers promised goods services customers amount that reflects the consideration 
which the company expects entitled exchange for those goods services upon our adoption asu 
beginning with our fiscal year commencing april will longer defer revenue until sale the distributor the 
end customer but rather will required estimate the effects returns and allowances provided distributors and record

particular thailand has experienced periods severe flooding recent years while our facilities thailand have 
continued operate normally there can assurance that any future flooding thailand would not have material adverse 
impact our operations operations any our facilities our subcontractors facilities are interrupted may not 
able shift production other facilities timely basis and may need spend significant amounts repair replace 
our facilities and equipment experienced business interruptions would likely experience delays shipments 
products our customers and alternate sources for production may unavailable acceptable terms this could result 
reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation orders loss customers although maintain business interruption 
insurance such insurance will likely not enough compensate for any losses that may occur and any losses damages 
incurred result business interruptions could significantly harm our business 
additionally operations our customers and licensees may disrupted for number reasons the event customer 
disruptions sales our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise 
our licensees are unable manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology there decrease product 
demand due business disruption our royalty revenue may decline 
our technology licensing business exposes various risks

anti takeover defenses our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage takeover attempts which could 
also reduce the market price our common stock 
our certificate incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay prevent change control 
microchip these provisions could also make difficult for stockholders elect directors that are not nominated the 
current members our board directors take other corporate actions including effecting changes our management 
these provisions include 
the ability our board directors issue shares preferred stock and determine the price and other terms 
those shares including preferences and voting rights without stockholder approval which could used 
significantly dilute the ownership hostile acquiror 
the right our board directors elect director fill vacancy created the expansion our board 
directors the resignation death removal director which prevents stockholders from being able fill 
vacancies our board directors 
the requirement that special meeting stockholders may called only the holders more the 
combined voting power all classes our capital stock which could delay the ability our stockholders 
force consideration proposal take action including the removal directors 
the ability our board directors majority vote amend the bylaws which may allow our board 
directors take additional actions prevent unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability acquiror 
amend the bylaws facilitate unsolicited takeover attempt and 
advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply nominate candidates our board directors 
propose matters acted upon stockholders meeting which may discourage deter potential 
acquiror from conducting solicitation proxies elect the acquiror own slate directors otherwise 
attempting obtain control 
addition delaware corporation are subject section the delaware general corporation law these 
provisions may prohibit large stockholders particular those owning more our outstanding voting stock from 
merging combining with for certain period time the application section also could have the effect 
delaying preventing change control 
any these provisions could under certain circumstances depress the market price our common stock 
result our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly recent years and 
may the future incur impairments goodwill intangible assets including impairments related microsemi following 
our completion our acquisition such company 
when acquire business substantial portion the purchase price the acquisition allocated goodwill and other 
identifiable intangible assets the amount the purchase price which allocated goodwill determined the excess 
the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired march had goodwill million and net 
intangible assets million connection with the completion our pending acquisition microsemi our balance 
goodwill and intangible assets will increase significantly review our indefinite lived intangible assets including 
goodwill for impairment annually the fourth fiscal quarter whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount those assets more likely than not impaired factors that may considered assessing whether goodwill 
intangible assets may impaired include decline our stock price market capitalization reduced estimates future 
cash flows and slower growth rates our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management 
make judgments and assumptions based historical experience and rely heavily projections future operating 
performance because operate highly competitive environments projections our future operating results and cash 
flows may vary significantly from our actual results goodwill impairment charges were recorded fiscal fiscal 
material intangible asset impairment charges were recorded fiscal fiscal recognized 
million intangible asset impairment charges future periods determine that our goodwill intangible assets are 
impaired will required write down these assets which would have negative effect our consolidated financial 
statements 
our foreign pension plans are unfunded and any requirement fund these plans the future could negatively affect our 
cash position and operating capital 
connection with our acquisition atmel assumed unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain our 
french and german employees plan benefits are managed accordance with local statutory requirements benefits are based 
years service and employee compensation levels the projected benefit obligation totaled million march 
the plans are unfunded compliance with local statutory regulations and have immediate intention funding 
these plans benefits are paid when amounts become due commencing when participants retire expect pay 
approximately million fiscal for benefits earned should legislative regulations require complete partial funding 
these plans the future could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our 
results operations affect the way conduct business 
climate change regulations the federal state local level international jurisdictions could require limit 
emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more less available increase 
our investment control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects undertake other costly activities 
these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations virtue requirements for 
new equipment new permits may required for our current operations expansions thereof failure timely receive 
permits could result fines suspension production cessation operations one more facilities addition 
restrictions carbon dioxide other greenhouse gas emissions could result significant costs such higher energy costs 
and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost 
complying failing comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have adverse 
effect our operating results 
further any sustained adverse change climate could have direct adverse economic impact such water and 
power shortages and higher costs water energy control the temperature our facilities certain our operations are

strategy 
our goal worldwide leader providing specialized semiconductor products for wide variety embedded 
control applications our strategic focus embedded control solutions including general purpose and specialized 
microcontrollers development tools and related software analog interface mixed signal and timing products wired and 
wireless connectivity products memory products and technology licensing provide highly cost effective embedded 
control solutions that also offer the advantages small size high performance extreme low power usage wide voltage range 
operation mixed signal integration and ease development thus enabling timely and cost effective integration our 
solutions our customers their end products license our superflash technology and other technologies wafer 
foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use the manufacture advanced 
microcontroller products gate array radio frequency and analog products that require embedded non volatile memory 
sell our products broad base domestic and international customers across variety industries the principal 
markets that serve include consumer automotive industrial office communication computing and aerospace our business 
subject fluctuations based economic conditions within these markets 
our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership 
substantial portion our manufacturing resources important component our business strategy enabling maintain 
high level manufacturing control resulting being one the lowest cost producers the embedded control 
industry owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations and employing statistical process control 
techniques have been able achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources 
allows shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows capture portion the wafer 
manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin outsource significant portion our manufacturing 
requirements third parties 
employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes developing our embedded control products believe our 
processes afford both cost effective designs existing and derivative products and greater functionality new product 
designs while many our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines 
use common process technology for both microcontroller and non volatile memory products this allows more fully 
leverage our process research and development costs and deliver new products market more rapidly our engineers utilize 
advanced computer aided design cad tools and software perform circuit design simulation and layout and our house 
photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable rapidly verify design techniques processing test wafers quickly and 
efficiently 
are committed continuing our investment new and enhanced products including development systems and our 
design and manufacturing process technologies believe these investments are significant factors maintaining our 
competitive position our current research and development activities focus the design new microcontrollers digital 
signal controllers memory analog and mixed signal products flash systems development systems software and 
application specific software libraries are also developing new design and process technologies achieve further cost 
reductions and performance improvements our products 
market and sell our products worldwide primarily through network direct sales personnel and distributors our 
distributors focus primarily servicing the product and technical support requirements broad base diverse 
customers believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide effective means reaching 
this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily major strategic accounts three 
geographical markets the americas europe and asia currently maintain sales and support centers major metropolitan 
areas north america europe and asia believe that strong technical service presence essential the continued 
development the embedded control market many our client engagement managers cems embedded system engineers 
eses and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed engineering 
environment believe that the technical knowledge our sales force key competitive advantage the sale our 
products the primary mission our ese team provide technical assistance strategic accounts and conduct periodic 
training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers 
major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors provide technical assistance and end user support

critical accounting policies and estimates 
general 
our discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations based upon our consolidated financial 
statements which have been prepared accordance with accounting principles generally accepted the review the 
accounting policies use reporting our financial results regular basis the preparation these financial statements 
requires make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts assets liabilities revenues and expenses and 
related disclosure contingent liabilities ongoing basis evaluate our estimates including those related revenue 
recognition business combinations share based compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated 
convertible debt and contingencies base our estimates historical experience and various other assumptions that are 
believed reasonable under the circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
value assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due 
actual outcomes being different from those which based our assumptions review these estimates and judgments 
ongoing basis believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates 
used the preparation our consolidated financial statements also have other policies that consider key accounting 
policies such our policy regarding revenue recognition original equipment manufacturers oems however not 
believe these policies require make estimates judgments that are difficult subjective our policies described 
below 
revenue recognition distributors 
our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights which prevent the sales pricing 
from being fixed determinable the time shipment our distributors therefore revenue recognition deferred until 
the pricing uncertainty resolved which generally occurs when the distributor sells the product their customer the time 
shipment these distributors record trade receivable for the selling price there legally enforceable right 
payment relieve inventory for the carrying value goods shipped since legal title has passed the distributor and record the 
gross margin deferred income shipments distributors our consolidated balance sheets 
connection with our acquisitions atmel and micrel acquired certain distributor relationships where revenue was 
recognized upon shipment the distributors based certain contractual terms prevailing business practices that resulted 
the price being fixed and determinable such time following acquisition undertake efforts align the contract terms 
and business practices the acquired entity with our own once these efforts are complete revenue recognition changed with 
respect such distributor relationships acquired the atmel acquisition october these business practices were 
conformed those our other distributors resulting the deferral revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product 
their customers with respect such distributor relationships acquired the micrel acquisition the december quarter 
these distributor contracts were changed consistent with those our other distributors which resulted the deferral 
revenue recognition under such contracts until the distributor sells the product their customers 
deferred income shipments distributors effectively represents the gross margin the sale the distributor 
however the amount gross margin that recognize future periods could less than the deferred margin result 
credits granted distributors specifically identified products and customers allow the distributors earn competitive 
gross margin the sale our products their end customers and price protection concessions related market pricing 
conditions 
sell the majority the items our product catalog our distributors worldwide uniform list price however 
distributors resell our products end customers broad range individually negotiated price points the majority our 
distributors resales require reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances remit back the 
distributor portion their original purchase price after the resale transaction completed the form credit against the 
distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are per unit basis and are not given the distributor 
until they provide information regarding the sale their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based 
the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors discounts price less than our cost have 
historically been rare the effect granting these credits establishes the net selling price our distributors for the product and 
results the net revenue recognized when the product sold the distributors their end customers thus portion 
the deferred income shipments distributors balance represents the amount distributors original purchase price that 
will credited back the distributors the future not reduce deferred income shipments distributors 
accounts receivable anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income 
shipments distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which generally the time the distributor sells the 
product march had approximately million deferred revenue and million deferred cost 
sales recognized million deferred income shipments distributors march had approximately 
million deferred revenue and million deferred cost sales recognized million deferred 
income shipments distributors the deferred income shipments distributors that will ultimately recognized our 
income statement will lower than the amount reflected the balance sheet due additional price credits granted 
the distributors when the product sold their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted the 
deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that recognize the distribution channel our business 
distributor advances reflected reduction deferred income shipments distributors our consolidated balance 
sheets totaled million march and march sales distributors our payment terms generally 
require the distributor settle amounts owed for amount excess their ultimate cost the sales price our 
distributors may higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe because distributors often negotiate price 
reductions after purchasing products from and such reductions are often significant our practice apply these 
negotiated price discounts future purchases requiring the distributor settle receivable balances current basis 
generally within days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has adverse impact the working capital our 
distributors such have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby advance cash the distributors 
reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled least quarterly basis and are 
estimated based the amount ending inventory reported the distributor multiplied negotiated percentage such 
advances have impact our revenue recognition our consolidated statements income process discounts taken 
distributors against our deferred income shipments distributors balance and true the advanced amounts generally after 
the end each completed fiscal quarter the terms these advances are set forth binding legal agreements and are 
unsecured bear interest unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can 
canceled any time 
reduce product pricing through price protection based market conditions competitive considerations and other 
factors price protection granted distributors the inventory they have hand the date the price protection 
offered when reduce the price our products allows the distributor claim credit against its outstanding accounts 
receivable balances based the new price the inventory has hand the date the price reduction there 
immediate revenue impact from the price protection reflected reduction the deferred income shipments 
distributors balance 
products returned distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial our consolidated results 
operations routinely evaluate the risk impairment the deferred cost sales component the deferred income 
shipments distributors account because the historically immaterial amounts inventory that have been scrapped and 
historically rare instances where discounts given distributor result price less than our cost believe the deferred 
costs are recorded their approximate carrying value 
recent updates revenue recognition 
may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with 
customers topic which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting 
principles the united states america gaap august the fasb issued asu revenue from 
contracts with customers topic deferral the effective date which delayed the effective date the new standard 
one year december for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after that date accordance with the 
delay the new standard was effective for the company beginning april the standard core principle that 
company will recognize revenue when transfers promised goods services customers amount that reflects the 
consideration which the company expects entitled exchange for those goods services the new standard allows 
for the amendment applied either retrospectively each prior reporting period presented retrospectively 
cumulative effect adjustment the date adoption march the fasb issued asu revenue from 
contracts with customers topic principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net which 
clarifies the implementation guidance principal versus agent considerations april the fasb issued asu from contracts with customers topic identifying performance obligations and licensing which clarifies the 
implementation guidance identifying performance obligations may the fasb issued asu revenue from 
contracts with customers topic narrow scope improvements and practical expedients which addresses 
implementation issues that were raised stakeholders and discussed the revenue recognition transition resource group 
for discussion the financial statement impact related the adoption these standards see recently issued accounting 
pronouncements not yet adopted note our consolidated financial statements

inventories 
inventories are valued the lower cost net realizable value using the first first out method write down our 
inventory for estimated obsolescence unmarketable inventory amount equal the difference between the cost 
inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions actual 
market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional inventory write downs may required inventory 
impairment charges establish new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed income even 
circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable estimating our inventory obsolescence 
primarily evaluate estimates demand over month period and record impairment charges for inventory hand excess 
the estimated month demand estimates for projected month demand are generally based the average shipments 
the prior three month period which are then annualized adjust for any potential seasonality our business the estimated 
month demand compared our most recently developed sales forecast further reconcile the month demand 
estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates appropriate based specific situations for example demand can 
adjusted for new products for which historic sales are not representative future demand alternatively demand can 
adjusted down the extent any existing products are being replaced discontinued 
periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production 
levels our manufacturing facilities are charged directly cost sales result production being below normal 
operating levels our wafer fabrication facilities approximately million was charged cost sales fiscal 
operated slightly below normal capacity levels our thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter fiscal 
resulting approximately million charges cost sales there was charge cost sales for reduced 
production levels each fiscal and fiscal 
income taxes 
part the process preparing our consolidated financial statements are required estimate our income taxes 
each the jurisdictions which operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with 
assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment items for tax and accounting purposes these differences 
result deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets must then assess the 
likelihood that our deferred tax assets will recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and the 
extent believe that recovery not likely must establish valuation allowance provided valuation allowances for 
certain our deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits where more likely 
than not that some portion all such assets will not realized due the tax cuts and jobs act the act released 
our valuation allowance foreign tax credits during the period ending march which was provisional are still 
evaluating how the act impacts our valuation allowance state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits and 
may report adjustment the valuation allowances under staff accounting bulletin sab subsequent quarters 
should determine that would not able realize all part our net deferred tax asset the future adjustment 
the deferred tax asset would charged income the period such determination was made 
various taxing authorities the and other countries which business scrutinize the tax structures employed 
businesses companies our size and complexity are regularly audited the taxing authorities the jurisdictions 
which they conduct significant operations during the year ended march various foreign jurisdictions finalized their 
audits the close these audits did not have adverse impact our financial statements are currently being audited 
the tax authorities the united states and various foreign jurisdictions this time not know what the outcome 
these audits will record benefits for uncertain tax positions based assessment whether more likely than not 
that the tax positions will sustained based their technical merits under currently enacted law this threshold not met 
tax benefit the uncertain tax position recognized the threshold met recognize the largest amount the tax 
benefit that more than likely realized upon ultimate settlement 
the accounting model defined accounting standards codification asc related the valuation uncertain 
tax positions requires presume that the tax position will examined the relevant taxing authority that has full 
knowledge all relevant information and that each tax position will evaluated without consideration the possibility 
offset aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even believe the possibility 
examination taxing authority discovery the related risk matters remote where have long history the 
taxing authority not performing exam overlooking issue will record adjustment previously recorded 
position new information facts related the position are identified subsequent period all adjustments the 
positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will recorded periods subsequent the 
initial recognition the taxing authority has completed audit the period the statute limitation expires due the 
inherent uncertainty the estimation process and consideration the criteria the accounting model amounts recognized 
the financial statements periods subsequent the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure 
the position under the accounting model 
december the act was enacted into law the act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and 
modifications including the reduction the federal corporate income tax rate from the requirement for 
companies pay one time transition tax earnings certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the 
creation new taxes certain foreign sourced earnings fiscal year end taxpayer certain provisions the act began 
impact our third quarter fiscal while other provisions will impact beginning fiscal 
the corporate tax rate reduction effective january since have fiscal year rather than calendar year 
are subject rules relating transitional tax rates result our fiscal federal statutory rate will blended rate 
addition the impacts tax reform fiscal the act also establishes new tax laws that will effective for our 
fiscal including but not limited new provision designed tax low taxed income foreign subsidiaries which 
allows for the possibility using foreign tax credits ftcs and deduction offset the income tax liability 
subject some limitations limitations the deductibility certain executive compensation limitations the 
deductibility interest expense and limitations the use ftcs reduce the income tax liability while each 
these provisions expected have impact our tax expense for fiscal and future periods expect the tax lowtaxed income foreign subsidiaries have the most significant adverse impact 
due the complexity the new tax low taxed income foreign subsidiaries are continuing evaluate this 
provision the act and the application asc based recent fasb deliberations appears will allowed 
make accounting policy choice either treating taxes due future inclusions taxable income currentperiod expense when incurred factoring such amounts into our measurement our deferred taxes our selection

distribution 
distributors accounted for approximately our net sales fiscal approximately our net sales fiscal 
and approximately our net sales fiscal single distributor accounted for more than our net sales 
each fiscal our distributors focus primarily servicing the product requirements broad base 
diverse customers believe that distributors provide effective means reaching this broad and diverse customer 
base believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors effective 
supply channel 
generally not have long term agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate our 
relationships with each other with little advance notice the loss the disruption the operations one more 
our distributors could reduce our future net sales given quarter and could result increase inventory returns 
march our distributors maintained days inventory our products compared days march 
and days march over the past ten fiscal years the days inventory maintained our distributors have 
fluctuated between approximately days and days prior our adoption asu revenue from contracts with 
customers topic april did not believe that inventory holding patterns our distributors materially 
impacted our net sales due the fact that recognized revenue based when the distributor sells the product their 
customer upon our adoption topic commencing april will required recognize revenue from 
distributors the time our products are sold the distributor result beginning april inventory holding patterns 
our distributors may have material impact our net sales

our net sales during fiscal 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million fiscal million fiscal and million fiscal 
gross profit percentage sales was fiscal fiscal and fiscal 
the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage the periods covered this form were 
charges approximately million fiscal and approximately million fiscal related the 
recognition acquired inventory fair value result our acquisitions which increased the value our acquired 
inventory and subsequently increased our cost sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was 
recognized 
for each fiscal and fiscal inventory write downs being higher than the gross margin impact sales 
inventory that was previously written down and 
for fiscal inventory write downs being lower than the gross margin impact sales inventory that was 
previously written down and 
fluctuations the product mix microcontrollers analog interface mixed signal and timing products memory 
products and technology licensing 
other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage the periods covered this form include 
continual cost reductions wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such new manufacturing 
technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques 
lower depreciation percentage cost sales 
increases the level assembly and test operations performed our internal facilities compared assembly 
and test operations performed our third party contractors which lower our manufacturing costs these 
functions are performed internally and 
favorable market conditions and product mix 
adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization required respond actual and anticipated 
business and industry related conditions when production levels are below normal capacity charge cost sales for the 
unabsorbed capacity fiscal and fiscal our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated 
normal capacity levels which measure percentage the capacity the installed equipment during the third quarter 
fiscal our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels response uncertain global economic 
conditions and our inventory position the time result production being below normal operating levels our wafer 
fabrication facilities approximately million was charged cost sales fiscal operated slightly below 
normal capacity levels our thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter fiscal resulting 
approximately million charges cost sales 
the process technologies utilized our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins our wafer fabrication 
facility located tempe arizona fab currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly 
utilizes our micron micron processes our wafer fabrication facility located gresham oregon fab 
predominantly utilizes our micron micron processes continue transition products more advanced process 
technologies reduce future manufacturing costs all our production fab and fab has been inch wafers during 
the periods covered this report consider normal capacity fab and fab our wafer fabrication 
facility colorado springs colorado fab currently utilizes processes between micron and micron that run wafers consider normal capacity fab result our acquisition micrel august 
acquired inch wafer fabrication facility san jose california and have since transitioned products previously 
manufactured this facility our fab fab and fab facilities during the quarter ended december 
decommissioned this san jose facility and june completed the sale these assets for proceeds million 
our overall inventory levels were million march compared million march and 
million march maintained days inventory our balance sheet march compared 
days inventory march and days march expect our days inventory levels the june 
quarter down six days four days compared the march levels believe our existing level 
inventory will allow maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance our customers 
anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily capacity utilization levels the overall 
product mix microcontroller analog interface mixed signal and timing products memory products and technology licensing 
revenue and the percentage net sales each these products particular quarter well manufacturing yields fixed 
cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions the markets serve 
operate assembly and test facilities thailand and philippines and result our acquisition atmel acquired 
test facility calamba philippines during fiscal approximately our assembly requirements were performed 
our thailand facilities compared approximately during fiscal and approximately during fiscal the 
percentage our assembly work that performed internally fluctuates over time based supply and demand conditions 
the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities third party contractors located 
primarily asia perform the balance our assembly operations during fiscal and fiscal approximately and 
respectively our test requirements were performed our thailand and philippines facilities compared 
approximately our test requirements performed our thailand facilities during fiscal the increase the 
percentage assembly and test work that was performed internally fiscal compared fiscal primarily due 
our recent investments assembly and test equipment which have increased our internal capacity capabilities the primary 
reason for the percentage reduction the assembly and test operations performed internally fiscal compared fiscal 
our acquisition atmel which outsourced most these activities believe that the assembly and test operations 
performed our internal facilities provide with significant cost savings compared contractor assembly and test costs 
well increased control over these portions the manufacturing process 
rely outside wafer foundries for significant portion our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 
approximately our total net sales came from products that were produced outside wafer foundries compared 
approximately during fiscal and approximately during fiscal 
our use third parties involves some reduction our level control over the portions our business that 
subcontract while review the quality delivery and cost performance our third party contractors our future operating 
results could suffer any third party contractor unable maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs 
approximately their current levels 
research and development 
expenses for fiscal were million sales compared million sales for 
fiscal and million sales for fiscal are committed investing new and enhanced 
products including development systems software and our design and manufacturing process technologies believe 
these investments are significant factors maintaining our competitive position costs are expensed incurred assets 
purchased support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related products which have 
achieved technological feasibility that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development process technologies new 
packages and software support new products and design environments 
expenses decreased million for fiscal compared fiscal primarily due reductions 
personnel and associated costs connection with synergies realized from our atmel acquisition and lower share based 
compensation expense due accelerated vesting equity awards held terminated atmel employees during fiscal 
our goal continue more efficient with our operating expenses our revenue increases expenses increased 
million for fiscal compared fiscal primarily due additional compensation and other costs 
from our acquisition atmel percentage revenue decreased fiscal compared fiscal and fiscal 
compared fiscal due our restructuring activities and synergies realized following the acquisitions atmel and 
micrel

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects tax foreign earnings and federal and state tax earnings had 
effective tax rate fiscal benefit fiscal and benefit fiscal excluding certain 
tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates the primarily due our mix 
earnings foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
our effective tax rate fiscal includes million tax expense estimated provisional basis calculated 
under sab related the one time transition tax certain foreign earnings million tax benefit estimated 
provisional basis related the revaluation our deferred tax assets and liabilities the newly enacted statutory tax rate 
and million tax benefit estimated provisional basis related the release valuation allowances against 
our foreign tax credit carryforwards these three adjustments increased reduced our effective tax rate and 
respectively our effective tax rate fiscal also includes million tax benefit received from current year 
generated credits which reduced our effective tax rate our effective tax rate also includes 
million tax benefit for share based compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate our effective tax

are also subject taxation many other jurisdictions where have operations the effective tax rates that pay 
these jurisdictions vary widely but they are generally lower than our combined federal and state effective tax rate our 
domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march was approximately and our domestic statutory tax rate 
for fiscal was approximately our non blended statutory tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were much 
lower than this amount the difference rates applicable foreign jurisdictions results from number factors including 
lower statutory rates historical loss carry forwards financing arrangements and other factors our effective tax rate has been 
and will continue impacted the geographical dispersion our earnings and losses 
our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates our operations thailand cayman and ireland our thailand 
manufacturing operations are currently subject numerous tax holidays granted based our investment property 
plant and equipment thailand our tax holiday periods thailand expire various times the future however 
actively seek obtain new tax holidays will subject tax the statutory tax rate not expect the 
future expiration any our tax holiday periods thailand have material impact our effective tax rate the 
remaining material components foreign income taxed rate lower than the are earnings accrued ireland 
statutory tax rate and earnings accrued microchip offshore technology company which was resident the cayman islands 
statutory tax rate the tax rate differential ireland thailand and cayman plus the tax holiday thailand make 
approximately the million benefit foreign income taxed lower rate than the federal rate for fiscal 
various taxing authorities the and other countries which business are increasing their scrutiny the tax 
structures employed businesses companies our size and complexity are regularly audited the taxing authorities the 
jurisdictions which they conduct significant operations for federal and general for state tax returns our fiscal 
and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination the taxing authorities are currently being audited 
the tax authorities the united states and various foreign jurisdictions this time not know what the outcome 
these audits will record benefits for uncertain tax positions based assessment whether more likely than not 
that the tax positions will sustained based their technical merits under currently enacted law this threshold not met

revenue recognition prior the adoption asc 
the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process complete evidenced agreement with the customer 
transfer title has occurred the pricing fixed determinable and collectability reasonably assured the company 
recognizes revenue from product sales original equipment manufacturers oems upon shipment and records reserves for 
estimated customer returns 
distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights which prevent the sales pricing 
from being fixed determinable the time the company shipment the distributors therefore revenue recognition 
deferred until the pricing uncertainty resolved which generally occurs when the distributor sells the product their 
customer the time shipment these distributors the company records trade receivable for the selling price there 
legally enforceable right payment relieves inventory for the carrying value goods shipped since legal title has passed 
the distributor and records the gross margin deferred income shipments distributors its consolidated balance sheets 
connection with its acquisitions atmel and micrel the company acquired certain distributor relationships where 
revenue was recognized upon shipment the distributors based certain contractual terms prevailing business practices 
that resulted the price being fixed and determinable such time following acquisition the company undertakes efforts 
align the contract terms and business practices the acquired entity with its own once these efforts are complete the 
related revenue recognition changed with respect such distributor relationships acquired the atmel acquisition 
october these business practices were conformed those the company other distributors which beginning 
october resulted the deferral revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product their customers with 
respect such distributor relationships acquired the micrel acquisition the december quarter these distributor 
contracts were changed consistent with those the company other distributors which resulted the deferral revenue 
recognition under such contracts until the distributor sells the product their customers 
deferred income shipments distributors effectively represents gross margin the sale the distributor the initial 
shipment date however the amount gross margin recognized the company future periods will less than the deferred 
margin result credits granted distributors specifically identified products and customers allow the distributors 
earn competitive gross margin the sale the company products their end customers and price protection concessions 
related market pricing conditions 
the company sells the majority the items its product catalog its distributors worldwide uniform list 
price however distributors resell the company products end customers broad range individually negotiated price 
points the majority the company distributors resales require reduction from the original list price paid often under 
these circumstances the company remits back the distributor portion their original purchase price after the resale 
transaction completed the form credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are 
per unit basis and are not given the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale their end 
customer the price reductions vary significantly based the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and 
other factors and discounts price less than the company cost have historically been rare the effect granting these 
credits establishes the net selling price from the company its distributors for the product and results the net revenue 
recognized the company when the product sold the distributors their end customers thus portion the deferred 
income shipments distributors balance represents the amount distributors original purchase price that will 
credited back the distributors the future the company does not reduce deferred income shipments distributors 
accounts receivable anticipated future price concessions rather price concessions are recorded against deferred income 
shipments distributors when incurred which generally the time the distributor sells the product 
march the company had approximately million deferred revenue and million deferred 
cost sales recognized million deferred income shipments distributors march the company 
had approximately million deferred revenue and million deferred cost sales recognized million 
deferred income shipments distributors the deferred income shipments distributors that will ultimately 
recognized the company income statement will lower than the amount reflected the balance sheet due price credits 
granted the distributors when the product sold their customers these price credits historically have resulted the 
deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that the company recognizes the distribution channel its 
business 
the company reduces product pricing through price protection based market conditions competitive considerations and 
other factors price protection granted distributors the inventory they have hand the date the price protection 
offered when the company reduces the price its products allows the distributor claim credit against its outstanding 
accounts receivable balances based the new price the inventory has hand the date the price reduction there 
immediate revenue impact from the price protection reflected reduction the deferred income shipments 
distributors balance 
products returned distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial the company 
consolidated results operations the company routinely evaluates the risk impairment the deferred cost sales 
component the deferred income shipments distributors account because the historically immaterial amounts 
inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given distributor result price less 
than the company cost the company believes the deferred costs have low risk material impairment 
shipping charges billed customers are included net sales and the related shipping costs are included cost sales the 
company collects and remits certain sales related taxes portion its sales inventory and reports such amounts under the 
net method its consolidated statements income 
for licenses other technology arrangements without upgrade period non royalty revenue from the license 
recognized upon delivery the technology the fee fixed determinable and collection the fee reasonably 
assured royalties are recognized when reported the company which generally coincides with the receipt payment 
certain limited circumstances the company enters into license and other arrangements for technologies that the company 
continuing enhance and refine under which obligated provide unspecified enhancements under these 
arrangements non royalty revenue recognized over the lesser the estimated period that the company has historically 
enhanced and developed refinements the specific technology typically one three years the upgrade period and the 
remaining portion the upgrade period after the date delivery all specified technology and documentation provided that 
the fee fixed determinable and collection the fee reasonably assured royalties received during the upgrade period 
are recognized revenue based amortization calculation the elapsed portion the upgrade period compared the 
entire estimated upgrade period royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported the 
company which generally coincides with the receipt payment 
changes revenue recognition resulting from the adoption asc 
may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with 
customers topic which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting 
principles the united states america gaap august the fasb issued asu revenue from 
contracts with customers topic deferral the effective date which delayed the effective date the new standard 
one year december for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after that date accordance with the 
delay the new standard was effective for the company beginning april the standard core principle that company 
will recognize revenue when transfers promised goods services customers amount that reflects the consideration 
which the company expects entitled exchange for those goods services the new standard allows for the amendment 
applied either retrospectively each prior reporting period presented retrospectively cumulative effect adjustment 
the date adoption march the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with customers topic 
principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net which clarifies the implementation 
guidance principal versus agent considerations april the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with 
customers topic identifying performance obligations and licensing which clarifies the implementation guidance 
identifying performance obligations may the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with customers

part the process preparing its consolidated financial statements the company required estimate its income 
taxes each the jurisdictions which operates this process involves estimating its actual current tax exposure together 
with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment items for tax and accounting purposes these 
differences result deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the company consolidated balance 
sheets the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will recovered from future taxable income 
within the relevant jurisdiction and the extent the company believes that recovery not likely must establish valuation 
allowance the company provided valuation allowances for certain its deferred tax assets including state net operating loss 
carryforwards and state tax credits where more likely than not that some portion all such assets will not realized 
due the tax cuts and jobs act the act the company released its valuation allowance foreign tax credits during the 
period ending march which was provisional the company still evaluating how the act impacts its valuation 
allowance state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits and may report adjustment the valuation 
allowances under staff accounting bulletin sab subsequent quarters should the company determine that would 
not able realize all part its net deferred tax asset the future adjustment the deferred tax asset would 
charged income the period such determination was made

merits under currently enacted law this threshold not met tax benefit the uncertain tax position recognized the 
threshold met recognize the largest amount the tax benefit that more than likely realized upon ultimate 
settlement

accounting rules for fair value clarify that fair value exit price representing the amount that would received sell 
asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants such fair value marketbased measurement that should determined based assumptions that market participants would use pricing asset 
liability basis for considering such assumptions the company utilizes three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes 
the inputs used measuring fair value follows 
level 
observable inputs such quoted prices active markets 
inputs other than the quoted prices active markets that are observable either directly 
indirectly and 
unobservable inputs which there little market data which require the reporting entity 
develop its own assumptions 
marketable debt instruments 
marketable debt instruments include instruments such corporate bonds and debt government agency bonds bank 
deposits municipal bonds and money market mutual funds when the company uses observable market prices for identical 
securities that are traded less active markets the company classifies its marketable debt instruments level when 
observable market prices for identical securities are not available the company prices its marketable debt instruments using 
non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data quoted market prices for similar 
instruments pricing models such discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from corroborated 
with observable market data non binding market consensus prices are based the proprietary valuation models pricing 
providers brokers these valuation models incorporate number inputs including non binding and binding broker 
quotes observable market prices for identical similar securities and the internal assumptions pricing providers brokers 
that use observable market inputs and lesser degree unobservable market inputs the company corroborates non binding 
market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists the 
discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs such libor based yield curves currency spot and forward rates
