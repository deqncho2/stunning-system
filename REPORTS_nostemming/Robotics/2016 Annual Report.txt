mainly driven technological advances and end user requirements and preferences well the emergence new standards and practices our ability compete these markets depends large part our 
success enhancing our existing products and developing new additive manufacturing systems and new consumables that will address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs prospective end users and 
respond technological advances and industry standards and practices cost effective and timely basis otherwise gain market acceptance 
even successfully enhance our existing systems create new systems likely that new systems and technologies that develop will eventually supplant our existing systems that our competitors will 
create systems that will replace our systems result any our products may rendered obsolete uneconomical our others technological advances

due all the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed this annual report you should not rely quarter over quarter and year over year comparisons our operating results indicator our 
future performance 
demand for our products and services does not grow expected our revenues may stagnate decline and our profitability may adversely affected 
the commercial marketplace for additive manufacturing which was once dominated conventional methods that not involve printing technology has been undergoing shift towards printing this 
true with respect prototype development and some extent with respect direct digital manufacturing ddm alternative traditional manufacturing the commercial marketplace does not continue 
transform towards the broader acceptance printing and ddm alternatives for prototype development and traditional manufacturing adopts printing based technologies other than the technologies 
that use may not able increase sustain current future levels sales our products and related materials and services and our results operations may adversely affected result 
table contents 
during the years and the growth rate the printing and additive manufacturing industries slowed significantly and our revenues declined each year relative the previous year experienced 
lower revenues across most regions and most product and service lines believe this trend was attributable part weak investment capital equipment customers within key verticals well difficult 
macroeconomic conditions certain global regions these factors when combined with excess capacity that have experienced result our significant growth the years and adversely impacted 
our profitability while were able mitigate this trend via cost reduction measures and thereby improve our operating results relative the extent that these trends continue for extended period 
time macroeconomic conditions worsen further that could affect our results operations more significant adverse manner 
additional goodwill other intangible assets that have recorded become impaired could have take further significant charges against earnings 
december the carrying value all our goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately million compared carrying value million december 
december however that carrying value was billion the significant decrease the carrying value our goodwill and other intangible assets over the course was primarily due impairment 
charges billion during 
under accounting principles generally accepted the united states america gaap are required review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events changes circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount goodwill may not recoverable during determined that certain indicators potential impairment existed that required interim goodwill impairment analysis these indicators 
included further significant decline our market capitalization for sustained period and weaker than expected operating results our reporting units for during also tested the recoverability our 
purchased intangible assets due certain indicators impairment including weaker than expected operating results our reporting units for reorganization initiatives for our operations lower forecasted 
profitability due technological and other trends well the increased uncertainty the printing environment 
these tests and analyses performed led non cash goodwill impairment charges million and non cash impairment charges million our intangible assets for further information 
please see notes and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this annual report 
during recorded impairment charges million our intangible assets addition during the fourth quarter performed quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment for our 
stratasys objet reporting unit following our quantitative assessment concluded that there narrow percentage difference between the estimated fair value and estimated carrying value our stratasys objet 
reporting unit which difference did not warrant that record impairment charge have approximately million goodwill allocated our stratasys objet reporting unit however which could 
subject impairment the future for further information please see note our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this annual report 
our ongoing consideration the factors described above well additional factors could result further significant charges against our earnings which could have material adverse effect our results 
operations 
declines the prices our products and services our volume sales together with our relatively inflexible cost structure may adversely affect our financial results and diminish the impact our cost 
reduction programs that initiated and 
our business subject price competition such price competition may adversely affect our ability maintain the same degree profitability especially during periods decreased demand decreased demand 
also adversely impacts the volume our systems sales occurred and again when our sales declined overall each case relative the previous year our business not able offset price 
reductions resulting from these pressures decreased volume sales due contractions the market improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures then our operating results will adversely 
affected 
and response declining sales volume and revenues implemented certain reorganization programs aimed reducing our costs and improving operating efficiencies these programs began 
show positive results successfully reducing our expenditures and improving our operating results relative certain our operating costs however are fixed and cannot readily reduced 
which diminishes the positive impact our reorganization programs our operating results particular prior this contraction our sales had increased our manufacturing capacity anticipation the 
growth the printing market over the long term which accompanied increased fixed costs the extent that the growth the market for our products slows further the printing market contracts 
may faced with excess manufacturing capacity and excess related costs that cannot readily reduced which will adversely impact our results operations 
the extent that other companies are successful developing marketing consumables for use our stratasys idea design and production series systems our revenues and profits would likely 
adversely affected 
sell substantial portion the consumables used our systems attempt protect against replication our proprietary consumables through patents and trade secrets and provide that warranties those 
systems may invalid customers use non genuine consumables that cause damage the printer other companies have developed and sold and may continue develop and sell consumables that are used with our 
systems which may reduce our consumables sales and impair our overall revenues and profitability 
table contents 
our product mix shifts too far into lower margin products our revenues mix shifts significantly towards our services business our profitability could reduced 
sales certain our existing products have higher margins than others for instance our high end systems and related consumables yield greater gross margin than our entry level systems some the sales 
our entry level systems may displace sales our other systems sales our entry level desktop printers have the effect reducing sales our higher margin products for any other reason our product 
mix shifts too far into lower margin products and are not able sufficiently reduce the engineering production and other costs associated with those products substantially increase the sales those products 
our profitability could reduced similar negative impact our gross margins could result due significant shift towards revenues generated our parts service business stratasys direct manufacturing 
and which are characterized lower margins relative our products 
until fairly recently have experienced rapid and significant growth our operations and intend continue grow over the long term and cannot adequately adapt our infrastructure and properly 
integrate the internal external sources our growth order generate the intended benefits from our results operations will suffer 
until had experienced rapid and significant growth our operations and intend continue grow over the long term the continued adaptation our infrastructure our growth will require 
among other things development our financial and management controls and management information systems management our sales channel increased capital expenditures the ability attract and retain 
qualified management personnel and the training new personnel cannot sure that our infrastructure systems procedures business processes and managerial controls will adequate support the expected 
long term growth our operations any delays problems associated with implementing transitioning new enhanced systems procedures controls accommodate and support the requirements

difficulty transitioning customers and other business relationships our company 
problems unifying management following transaction 
the loss key employees from our existing acquired businesses

some our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and more extensive name recognition than have and may also have greater financial marketing manufacturing distribution and 
other resources than have current and future competitors may able respond more quickly new emerging technologies and changes end user demands and devote greater resources the

industry overview 
historically prototype development and customized manufacturing have been performed traditional methods using metal extrusion computer controlled machining and manual modeling techniques which 
blocks material are carved milled into specific objects these subtractive manufacturing methodologies have numerous limitations they often require specialist technicians and can time and labor intensive 
the time intensity traditional modeling can leave little room for design error subsequent redesign without meaningfully impacting product time market and development cost result prototypes have 
traditionally been created only selected milestones late the design process which prevents designers from truly visualizing and verifying the design object the preliminary design stage the inability 
iterate design rapidly hinders collaboration among design team members and other stakeholders and reduces the ability optimize design time market and optimization become necessary trade offs the 
design process 
printing addresses the inherent limitations traditional modeling technologies through its combination functionality quality ease use speed and cost printing can significantly more efficient and 
effective than traditional model making techniques for use across the design process from concept modeling and design review and validation fit and function prototyping pattern making and tooling direct 
manufacturing repeatable cost effective parts short run parts and customized end products introducing modeling earlier the design process evaluate fit form and function can result faster time market 
and lower product development costs 
for customized manufacturing printers eliminate the need for complex manufacturing set ups and reduce the cost and lead time associated with conventional tooling ddm involves the use production 
systems for the direct manufacture parts that are subsequently incorporated into the user end product manufacturing process ddm particularly attractive applications that require short run low volume 
parts rapid turn around and for which tooling would not appropriate due small volumes ddm also enables the production objects that have been topologically designed designed the basis 
computerized determination where place the key components the object and how connect them process that generally unavailable using conventional subtractive manufacturing methodologies 
the first commercial printers were introduced the early and since the early printing technology has evolved significantly terms price variety and quality materials accuracy ability 
create complex objects ease use and suitability for office environments printing already replacing traditional prototype development methodologies across various industries such architecture

powder binding and 
digital light projection 
the companies that use these technologies compete with include systems corporation eos gmbh and envisiontec gmbh hp recently launch multi jet fusion technology could become 
competition well 
these technologies which compete for additive manufacturing users possess various competitive advantages and disadvantages relative one another within the key categories upon which competition centers 
including resolution accuracy surface quality variety and properties the materials they use and produce capacity speed color transparency the ability print multiple materials and others due these multiple 
categories end users usually make purchasing decisions which technology choose based the characteristics that they value most this decision often application specific the competitive environment that 
has developed therefore intense and dynamic players often position their technologies capture demand various verticals simultaneously 
for our entry level and lower end systems and materials face competition from variety sources including fdm sla and dlp companies such xyz printing ultimaker and formlabs the competing 
offerings the lower end categories vary based cost printer and part quality support materials speed ease use software ecosystem and reliability 
are positioned compete our industry mainly the following bases which view competitive strengths

key measures our performance 
revenues 
our consolidated revenues result primarily from sales our products which include both our systems and related consumable materials provision related services and iii our direct manufacturing 
service effect revenues and deliver services principally through the following channels 
sales resellers who purchase and resell our products and who provide support services for our printing systems 
sales systems that are marketed independent sales agents pursuant which sell directly end users pay commissions such agents and directly handle the sale consumables and provision 
support services and 
sales systems and all related products and services well our direct manufacturing solutions service that effect and provide our customers directly 
there overlap among the channels some independent sales agents for our higher end products also serve resellers our other products 
product revenues 
product revenues are influenced number factors including among other things the adoption rate our products end user product design application and manufacturing activity and iii the capital 
expenditure budgets end users and potential end users all which may significantly influenced macroeconomic factors purchases our printing and production systems especially our higher end 
higher priced systems typically involve longer sales cycles 
product revenues also depend upon the volume consumables that sell sales our consumable materials are linked the number systems that are installed and active worldwide sales consumables 
are also driven system usage which generally function the size the particular system and the level design and manufacturing activity and budget the particular end user larger systems generally 
use greater amounts consumables due their greater capacity and the higher levels design and production 
services revenues 
services revenues derive from our direct manufacturing parts services that provide variety technologies and custom manufacturing solutions maintenance and warranty and iii other service contracts 
addition connection with direct sales generally charge separately for installation and training additional services revenues are generated from services contracts most often entered into directly with end users 
subsequent the expiration the initial warranty period 
costs revenues 
our costs revenues consist costs products and costs services costs products consist primarily components and subassemblies purchased for the manufacture our systems and raw materials 
such thermoplastic and photopolymer materials for the manufacture our consumables well any royalties paid with respect sales certain those consumables costs products also include 
manufacturing and manufacturing related labor costs indirect production costs depreciation and amortization expense related mainly developed technology assets acquired part our business combinations 
table contents 
our costs services revenues consist primarily costs our service personnel material and other production costs our direct manufacturing service business and installation costs which include engineers 
dedicated site training and support and travel costs these engineers both costs products and costs services include related facilities costs 
our most significant components cost revenues are costs materials used for our printers wages and related benefits costs which together accounted for approximately our total direct cost sales 
additional significant item our cost revenues the amortization expense that primarily incur connection with developed technology assets acquired part our business combinations these 
amortization expenses varies based the timing and type acquisitions and were million million and million for the years ended december and respectively 
for the year ended december hypothetical rise commodity prices for raw materials would have caused approximate million increase cost revenues our consolidated statement 
income and comprehensive income wages and related benefits increase wages due wage inflation would have caused approximate million increase cost revenues our consolidated 
statement income and comprehensive income during did not notice particular trends that changed were expected change the near future the absolute relative significance the components 
our costs revenues material manner also believe that inflation has not had material effect our operations our financial condition during the three most recent fiscal years 
currently not foresee significant change either the raw materials used for production wage inflation that would materially impact our business for further information please see item 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this annual report 
gross profit 
the gross profit and gross margin for our products are influenced number factors the most important these the mix our products sold specifically the gross margins our high end production 
series and design series systems well our consumables are typically higher than the gross margins our entry level products and makerbot desktop printers accordingly increase the 
percentage sales our entry level products could cause our profit margins decrease furthermore believe that our worldwide installed base systems increases subsequent sales our proprietary 
consumables will also increase also seek reduce our costs revenues improving our ability use less costly components and increasing manufacturing efficiencies the production our systems 
addition will also seek achieve lower material costs and leverage our overall capabilities our direct manufacturing service business 
products gross margins are also impacted the mix revenues generated from sales resellers based different geographical areas opposed sales that are facilitated independent sales agents directly 
service gross margins are influenced mainly the volume revenues generated from our direct manufacturing service business well the ratio service engineers our installed base given geographic 
area that ratio impacts travel costs and efficiency our service engineers

goodwill assessment december 
during the fourth quarter performed quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment for our stratasys objet reporting unit 
following our quantitative assessment concluded that the fair value stratasys objet reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount approximately with carrying amount goodwill assigned this 
reporting unit the amount million when evaluating the fair value stratasys objet reporting unit used discounted cash flow model which utilized level measures that represent unobservable inputs 
into our valuation method 
key assumptions used determine the estimated fair value include expected cash flow for years following the assessment date which including expected revenue growth costs produce operating profit 
margins and estimated capital needs estimated terminal value using terminal year growth rate determined based the growth prospects the reporting unit and discount rate based

recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence final agreement exists delivery has occurred services have been rendered the selling price fixed determinable and collectability reasonably 
assured 
revenues from sales resellers are generally recognized sell basis upon shipment and when title and risk loss have been transferred the resellers when products and services are sold reseller the 
reseller responsible for the installation the system and for other support services and therefore considered the primary obligor the arrangement with the end customers products and services sold directly
