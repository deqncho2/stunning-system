efforts reduce chemical substances 
still have some difficulties completely eliminating prtr designated substances such toluene xylene and ethylbenzene generated during 
coating and cleaning processes surveyed the per unit consumption prtr designated substances then conducted activities 
reduce the per unit consumption from introduced eco friendly paints and thinners and improved the recovery rate cleaning oils from 
introduced water based paints some painting processes standardized cleaning thinners used painting processes the company 
and started water based cleaning processes result achieved approximately reduction compared with the 
benchmark other than the painting and cleaning processes also work hard reduce the environmental burden from anticorrosion oils
