have negative effects 
the announcement the referendum the united kingdom the membership the european union referred

markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted the strengthening the dollar against certain foreign currencies 
which conduct business described item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign

business operations reducing their profitability because increased operating costs our customers require large amounts 
energy run their businesses particularly the air transportation industry higher energy prices can reduce passenger and cargo air 
carrier profitability result increased jet and ground support equipment fuel prices higher energy prices also increase food 
processors operating costs through increased energy and utility costs run their plants higher priced chemical and petroleum based 
raw materials used food processing and higher fuel costs run their logistics and service fleet vehicles 
food processors are also affected the cost and availability raw materials such feed grains livestock produce and dairy 
products increases the cost and limitations the availability such raw materials can negatively affect the profitability food

various governmental agencies funding for such contracts tied national defense budgets and procurement programs that are 
annually negotiated and approved disapproved the department defense the executive branch and the congress for 
example there were any shifts spending priorities funding for the military aircraft programs were reduced canceled 
result the sequestration policy changes for other reasons the resulting loss revenue could have material adverse impact 
our jbt aerotech business many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable private 
contracts particular defense contracts are unilaterally terminable the option the government with compensation only 
for work completed and costs incurred date addition any deliverable delays under such contracts result our nonperformance could also have negative impact these contracts 
non compliance with the laws and regulations governing government contracts subcontracts may result significant

condition results operations and cash flows 
may lose money not achieve our expected profitability fixed price contracts 
customary for several the business areas which operate may provide products and services under fixed price 
contracts under such contracts are typically responsible for cost overruns our actual costs and any gross profit realized these 
fixed price contracts may vary from our estimates which the pricing for such contracts was based there are inherent risks and 
uncertainties the estimation process including those arising from unforeseen technical and logistical challenges longer than 
expected lead times for sourcing raw materials and assemblies fixed price contract may significantly limit prohibit our ability 
mitigate the impact unanticipated increases raw material prices including the price steel and other significant raw materials

may able devote greater resources research and development new systems services and technologies than are able 
moreover some our competitors operate narrow business areas allowing them concentrate their research and development 
efforts more directly products and services for those areas than may able 
high capacity products products with new technology may more likely experience reliability quality operability 
problems 
even with rigorous testing prior release and investment product quality processes problems may found newly developed 
enhanced products after such products are launched and shipped customers resolution such issues may cause project delays 
additional development costs and deferred lost revenue 
new products and enhancements our existing products may also reduce demand for our existing products could delay purchases 
customers who instead decide wait for our new enhanced products difficulties that arise our managing the transition from 
our older products our new enhanced products could result additional costs and deferred lost revenue

critical accounting estimates 
prepare our consolidated financial statements conformity with generally accepted accounting principles such are 
required make certain estimates judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain ongoing basis our 
management evaluates these estimates judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because the critical impact that these 
factors have the reported amounts assets and liabilities the dates the financial statements and the reported amounts 
revenue and expenses during the periods presented management has discussed the development and selection these critical 
accounting estimates with the audit committee our board directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used preparing our financial statements 
inventory valuation 
inventory recorded the lower cost net realizable value order determine net realizable value evaluate each 
component inventory regular basis determine whether excess obsolete record the estimated decline the 
carrying value excess obsolete inventory reduction inventory and expense included cost sales the period 
which identified our estimate excess and obsolete inventory critical accounting estimate because highly susceptible 
change from period period addition requires management make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
order quantify excess obsolete inventory begin preparing candidate listing the components inventory that have 
not demonstrated usage within the most recent three year period this list then reviewed management personnel determine 
whether this list potential excess obsolete inventory items have orders expected demand the near term the remaining items 
the candidate listing are written down their estimated net realizable value inherent the estimates net realizable value are 
estimates related our future manufacturing schedules customer demand possible alternative uses and ultimate realization 
potentially excess inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess the cost acquired business over the amounts assigned the identifiable net assets goodwill 
not amortized but tested for impairment reporting unit level annual basis whenever event occurs circumstances 
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying amount are required make 
certain subjective and complex judgments assessing whether event that could indicate impairment goodwill has occurred 
and must make assumptions and estimates determine the fair value our reporting units may first assess qualitative factors 
make this determination conclude that not more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying 
amount based our qualitative assessment then quantitative test not necessary 
may also choose bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test performing the quantitative test 
determine the fair value reporting unit using the income approach valuation method use discounted cash flow model 
which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus terminal value the end that time horizon are discounted their present 
value using appropriate cost capital rate judgment required developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow 
model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future 
capital expenditures and working capital requirements among others the estimated fair value reporting unit exceeds its 
carrying value consider that goodwill not impaired the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there indication 
potential impairment and impairment loss recorded calculate the impairment loss comparing the fair value the 
reporting unit less its carrying amount including goodwill 
completed our annual goodwill impairment test october using quantitative assessment approach result 
this assessment noted that the fair value each reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value and therefore none our 
goodwill was impaired 
income taxes 
determining our current income tax provision assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments items for tax 
and accounting purposes these differences result deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded our consolidated balance 
sheets when maintain deferred tax assets must assess the likelihood that these assets will recovered through adjustments 
future taxable income the extent believe based available evidence more likely than not that all some portion the 
asset will not realized establish valuation allowance record allowance reducing the asset value believe more 
likely than not being realized based our expectation future taxable income believe the accounting estimate related the 
valuation allowance critical accounting estimate because highly susceptible change from period period requires 
management make assumptions about our future income over the lives the deferred tax assets and the impact increasing 
decreasing the valuation allowance potentially material our results operations 
forecasting future income requires use significant amount judgment estimating future income use our internal 
operating budgets and long range planning projections develop our budgets and long range projections based recent results 
trends economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance our backlog planned timing new product launches 
and customer sales commitments significant changes the expected realization the net deferred tax assets would require that 
adjust the valuation allowance resulting change net income 
december congress passed and the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act makes 
broad and complex changes the tax code including but not limited reducing the federal corporate income tax rate 
from percent percent requiring companies pay one time transitional tax certain repatriated earnings

expense allowing for deduction related foreign derived intangible income fdii and changing the rules related 
the uses and limitations net operating loss carryforwards generated tax years beginning after december see note

defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
the measurement pension and other post retirement plans costs requires the use assumptions for discount rates investment 
returns employee turnover rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the actuarial assumptions used our pension and 
post retirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks ensure that they appropriately 
account for our future pension and post retirement benefit obligations while believe that the assumptions used are appropriate 
differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results 
our accrued pension and other post retirement benefits liability reflects the funded status our worldwide plans the projected 
benefit obligation net plan assets our discount rate assumption determined developing yield curve based high quality 
corporate bonds with maturities matching the plan expected benefit payment streams the plans expected cash flows are then 
discounted the resulting year year spot rates the projected benefit obligation sensitive changes our estimate the

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 
beginning the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with customers topic plus number related 
asu designed clarify and interpret topic the new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance 
gaap the core principle the asu requires companies reevaluate when revenue recorded based upon newly defined criteria 
either point time over time goods services are delivered the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature 
amount timing and uncertainty revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and 
estimates and changes those estimates the new standard became effective for january previously disclosed 
will adopt topic modified retrospective basis 
completed our gap assessment and determined that certain contracts will qualify for over time recognition for our 
manufactured equipment that highly engineered unique customer specifications addition expect that due the nature 
our equipment and installation contracts that will combine these into one performance obligation under topic revenue 
recognized for contracts that meet certain criteria will result revenue being recognized the equipment being manufactured 
which acceleration revenue compared our current revenue recognition methodology recognizing revenue generally 
when the equipment shipped the customer this conclusion specific equipment contracts for which the equipment highly 
engineered unique customer specifications dependent whether our contract with the customer provides upon customer 
cancellation with enforceable right payment for performance completed date where the contract does not provide explicit 
language regarding cancellation payments revenue will recognized point time usually upon completion the installation 
the equipment therefore some revenue will deferred and recognized later date this impacts both equipment contracts with 
installation that qualify one performance obligation and that were previously recognized upon shipment well certain 
equipment contracts for which revenue was recognized under percentage completion accounting under legacy gaap 
continue execute our implementation plan and have developed new revenue accounting policies and processes changed our 
internal controls over revenue recognition created pro forma disclosures and continue implement system changes and 
enhancements are the process evaluating all contracts not completed january and have preliminarily determined 
the net impact adopting this standard will reduction retained earnings within the range million million this 
differs significantly from the expected impact previously disclosed and due solely due interpretations published subsequent our 
previous disclosure regarding what constitutes enforceable right payment for full year results expect the financial 
statement impact this deferral will substantially offset the requirement defer revenue contracts that under legacy gaap 
would have been recognized but will deferred until under the new standard our assessment the foregoing 
ongoing and subject finalization such that the actual impact the adoption may differ materially from the estimated ranges 
described above 
upon adoption the new revenue standard the first quarter the timing revenue recognition for certain projects will vary 
and may recorded upon shipment based contract terms when previously such projects were recorded over time the impact 
future revenue trends uncertain will depend future orders and contract terms however cash flows and overall profitability 
contract completion are unchanged the new standard

including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december however early adoption permitted 
entities are required use modified retrospective approach for leases that exist are entered into after the beginning the earliest 
comparative period the financial statements are the process evaluating the impact this standard will have our 
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
october the fasb issued asu income taxes intra entity transfers assets other than inventory the new 
guidance intended simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers the core principle requires entity immediately 
recognize the tax consequences intercompany asset transfers the asu effective for annual reporting periods including interim 
periods within those annual periods beginning after december however early adoption permitted only the beginning 
annual period for which financial statements interim annual have already been issued the company will adopt this

assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period actual results could differ from these estimates 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities three months less 
inventories 
inventories are stated the lower cost net realizable value which includes estimate for excess and obsolete inventories 
inventory costs include those costs directly attributable products including all manufacturing overhead but excluding costs 
distribute cost determined the last first out lifo basis for all domestic inventories except certain inventories relating 
construction type contracts which are stated the actual production cost incurred date reduced the portion these costs 
identified with revenue recognized the first first out fifo method used determine the cost for all other inventories 
property plant and equipment 
property plant and equipment are recorded cost depreciation for financial reporting purposes provided principally the 
straight line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets land improvements years buildings years and 
machinery and equipment years gains and losses are reflected other expense net the consolidated statements 
income upon the sale retirement assets expenditures that extend the useful lives property plant and equipment are capitalized 
and depreciated over the estimated new remaining life the asset 
capitalized software costs 
other assets include the capitalized cost internal use software including internet web sites the assets are stated cost less 
accumulated amortization and were million and million december and respectively these software 
costs include the amount paid for purchases software and internal and external costs incurred during the application development 
stage software projects these costs are amortized straight line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets for internal 
use software the useful lives range from three ten years for internet web site costs the estimated useful lives not exceed three 
years 
goodwill 
test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events occur changes circumstances indicate 
that impairment may have occurred impairment testing performed for each our reporting units first assessing qualitative 
factors see further testing goodwill required conclude that more likely than not that reporting unit fair value 
less than its carrying amount based our qualitative assessment then quantitative test required may also choose bypass 
the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test performing the quantitative test determine the fair value 
reporting unit using the income approach valuation method use discounted cash flow model which cash flows anticipated 
over several periods plus terminal value the end that time horizon are discounted their present value using appropriate 
cost capital rate judgment required developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions 
include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and 
working capital requirements among others the estimated fair value reporting unit exceeds its carrying value consider that 
goodwill not impaired the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there indication potential impairment and 
impairment loss recorded calculate the impairment loss comparing the fair value the reporting unit less its carrying 
amount including goodwill impairment would limited the carrying value the goodwill 
completed our annual goodwill impairment test october using quantitative assessment approach result 
this assessment noted that the fair value each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and therefore determined that none 
our goodwill was impaired 
acquired intangible assets 
our acquired intangible assets are being amortized straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from less than 
year years have determined the trade names for our and acquired businesses avure tipper tie and 
plf have indefinite lives 
the carrying values intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for recoverability annual basis and whenever events 
occur changes circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred the facts and circumstances considered include 
assessment the recoverability the cost intangible assets from future cash flows derived from the use the asset not 
possible for predict the likelihood any possible future impairments such impairment were occur the magnitude 
any impairment however any potential impairment would limited the carrying value the indefinite lived intantigible asset 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are subject amortization over the expected period economic benefit evaluate 
whether events circumstances have occurred that warrant revision the remaining useful lives intangible assets cases 
where revision deemed appropriate the remaining carrying amounts the intangible assets are amortized over the revised 
remaining useful life 
impairment long lived assets 
our long lived assets other than goodwill and acquired intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events changes 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount the long lived asset may not recoverable the carrying amount long lived 
asset not recoverable exceeds the sum the undiscounted cash flows expected result from the use and eventual disposition 
the asset determined that impairment loss has occurred the loss measured the amount which the carrying amount 
the long lived asset exceeds its fair value

each customer arrangement evaluated determine the presence multiple deliverables for multiple element revenue 
arrangements such the sale equipment with service agreement allocate the contract value the various elements based 
relative selling price for each element and recognize revenue consistent with the nature each deliverable 
our standard agreements generally not include customer acceptance provisions however there customer specific acceptance 
provision the associated revenue deferred until have satisfied the acceptance provision 
certain our product sales are generated from construction type contracts and revenue recognized under the percentage 
completion method under this method revenue recognized work progresses each contract however revenue recognition 
does not begin until substantial portion the labor hours are incurred ensure that revenue not recognized based solely upon 
materials procurement depending upon the product measure progress using input method such costs incurred output 
method such units completed milestones achieved any expected losses are charged earnings total the period the losses 
are identified 
progress billings generally are issued upon the completion certain phases the work stipulated the contract revenue 
excess progress billings contracts amounted million and million december and respectively 
these unbilled receivables are reported trade receivables the consolidated balance sheets progress billings and cash collections

recently adopted accounting standards 
july the fasb issued asu inventory topic simplifying the measurement inventory the core 
principle the asu that entities that historically used the lower cost market the subsequent measurement inventory will 
instead required measure inventory the lower cost and net realizable value the guidance will not change gaap for 
inventory measured using lifo the retail inventory method the asu effective for annual reporting periods including interim 
periods within those annual periods beginning after december this guidance became effective for january

employee shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows employer make policy 
election account for forfeitures they occur the new standard became effective for january during 
awards vested and resulted million tax benefit reported earnings and classified operating activity within 
the condensed consolidated statements cash flows the elimination the apic pool affects the treasury stock method used 
calculate weighted average shares outstanding however the impact was not material elected change our policy surrounding 
forfeitures and beginning january longer estimate the number awards expected forfeited but rather account for 
them they occur are required implement this portion the guidance using modified retrospective approach and such 
have recorded cumulative adjustment million retained earnings january

statutory rates individual tax basis liability was not established the withholding limits not exceed the maximum cash 
paid for tax withholdings are classified financing activity the condensed consolidated statement cash flows consistent with 
prior years 
august the fasb issued asu statement cash flows topic classification certain cash receipts and 
cash payments and restricted cash the new guidance intended reduce the existing diversity practice how certain cash 
receipts and cash payments are presented and classified the statement cash flows the core principle the asu requires the

some combination thereof depending upon the nature the issue entities are required use retrospective transition approach for 
all the issues identified for each period presented the company adopted the new asu september there was

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 
beginning the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with customers topic plus number related 
asu designed clarify and interpret topic the new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance 
gaap the core principle the asu requires companies reevaluate when revenue recorded based upon newly defined criteria 
either point time over time goods services are delivered the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature 
amount timing and uncertainty revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and 
estimates and changes those estimates the new standard became effective for january previously disclosed 
will adopt topic modified retrospective basis 
completed our gap assessment and determined that certain contracts will qualify for over time recognition for our 
manufactured equipment that highly engineered unique customer specifications addition expect that due the nature 
our equipment and installation contracts that will combine these into one performance obligation under topic revenue 
recognized for contracts that meet certain criteria will result revenue being recognized the equipment being manufactured 
which acceleration revenue compared our current revenue recognition methodology recognizing revenue generally 
when the equipment shipped the customer this conclusion specific equipment contracts for which the equipment highly 
engineered unique customer specifications dependent whether our contract with the customer provides upon customer 
cancellation with enforceable right payment for performance completed date where the contract does not provide explicit 
language regarding cancellation payments revenue will recognized point time usually upon completion the installation 
the equipment therefore some revenue will deferred and recognized later date this impacts both equipment contracts with 
installation that qualify one performance obligation and that were previously recognized upon shipment well certain 
equipment contracts for which revenue was recognized under percentage completion accounting under legacy gaap 
continue execute our implementation plan and have developed new revenue accounting policies and processes changed our 
internal controls over revenue recognition created pro forma disclosures and continue implement system changes and 
enhancements are the process evaluating all contracts not completed january and have preliminarily determined 
the net impact adopting this standard will reduction retained earnings within the range million million this 
differs significantly from the expected impact previously disclosed and due solely due interpretations published subsequent our 
previous disclosure regarding what constitutes enforceable right payment for full year results expect the financial 
statement impact this deferral will offset the requirement defer revenue contracts that under legacy gaap would have 
been recognized but will deferred until under the new standard our assessment the foregoing ongoing and 
subject finalization such that the actual impact the adoption may differ materially from the estimated ranges described above 
february the fasb issued asu leases topic the new standard will replace most existing lease guidance 
gaap the core principle the asu the requirement for lessees report right use asset and lease payment 
obligation the balance sheet but recognize expenses their income statements manner similar today accounting and for 
lessors the guidance remains substantially similar current gaap the asu effective for annual reporting periods including 
interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december however early adoption permitted entities are 
required use modified retrospective approach for leases that exist are entered into after the beginning the earliest 
comparative period the financial statements are the process evaluating the impact this standard will have our 
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
october the fasb issued asu income taxes intra entity transfers assets other than inventory the new 
guidance intended simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers the core principle requires entity immediately 
recognize the tax consequences intercompany asset transfers the asu effective for annual reporting periods including interim 
periods within those annual periods beginning after december however early adoption permitted only the beginning 
annual period for which financial statements interim annual have already been issued the company anticipates the 
adoption the effective period and are currently evaluating the effect any that the asu will have our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures 
march the fasb issued asu compensation retirement benefits asc improving the presentation 
net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit cost the new guidance will improve the presentation pension 
cost providing additional guidance the presentation net benefit cost the income statement and the components eligible 
for capitalization assets the core principle the asu provide more transparency the presentation these costs 
requiring the service cost component reported the same line item other compensation costs arising from services rendered 
the pertinent employees during the period the other components net benefit cost are required presented separately from 
the service cost component and outside subtotal income from operations the amendments require that the consolidated 
statements income impacts applied retrospectively while balance sheet changes should applied prospectively such upon 
adoption the company expects revise operating income for fiscal year million and report this income non 
operating income operating income for the fiscal year will reduced million and operating income for will 
revised million there will impact net income the balance sheet statement cash flows 
the asu effective for annual reporting periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 
however early adoption permitted the beginning annual period for which financial statements interim 
annual have not been issued made available for issuance the company will adopt the newly issued asu january

the fair value framework requires the categorization assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions inputs used 
price the assets liabilities level provides the most reliable measure fair value whereas level generally requires significant 
management judgment the three levels are defined follows

indirectly for example quoted prices for similar assets liabilities active markets quoted prices for identical assets
