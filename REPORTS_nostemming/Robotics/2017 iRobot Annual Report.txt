competition 
the market for robots highly competitive rapidly evolving and subject changing technologies shifting customer 
needs and expectations and the likely increased introduction new products number established companies have 
developed are developing robots that will compete directly with our product offerings and many our competitors have 
significantly more financial and other resources than possess our competitors include consumer electronics companies 
such samsung xiaomi and shark traditional floor cleaning brands with robotic offerings such dyson bissell and 
hoover well developers robot floor cleaning products 
while believe many our customers purchase our roomba floor vacuuming robots and braava mopping robots 
supplement rather than replacement for their traditional vacuum cleaners and wet floor cleaning methods compete 
some cases with providers traditional cleaning products 
believe that the principal competitive factors the market for robots include product features performance for the 
intended mission cost purchase total cost system operation including maintenance and support ease use integration 
with existing equipment quality reliability customer support brand and reputation

risk factors 
operate rapidly changing environment that involves number risks some which are beyond our control this 
discussion highlights some the risks which may affect future operating results these are the risks and uncertainties 
believe are most important for you consider additional risks and uncertainties not presently known which currently 
deem immaterial which are similar those faced other companies our industry business general may also impair 
our business operations any the following risks uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition and 
operating results would likely suffer 
operate emerging market which makes difficult evaluate our business and future prospects 
robots represent new and emerging market accordingly our business and future prospects are difficult evaluate 
cannot accurately predict the extent which demand for consumerr robots will increase all you should consider the 
challenges risks and uncertainties frequently encountered companies using new and unproven business models rapidly 
evolving markets these challenges include our ability 
form 
are also subject international and federal state and local laws and regulations designed protect the 
environment regulate energy efficiency and regulate the discharge materials into the environment believe that our 
policies practices and procedures are properly designed prevent unreasonable risk environmental damage and associated 
financial liability date environmental control regulations have not had significant adverse effect our overall 
operations 
generate sufficient revenue and gross margin maintain profitability 
acquire and maintain market share our consumer market 
attract and retain customers our consumer robots 
attract and retain engineers and other highly qualified personnel and 
expand our product offerings beyond our existing robots 
fail successfully address these and other challenges risks and uncertainties our business results operations and 
financial condition would materially harmed 
our business currently depends solely our consumer robots and our sales growth and operating results would 
negatively impacted are unable enhance our current consumer robots develop new consumer robots competitive 
prices timely manner the consumer robot market does not achieve broad market acceptance 
for the years ended december december and january derived and 
our total revenue from our consumer robots respectively for the foreseeable future expect that our revenue will 
derived solely from sales consumer robots general and home floor care products particular accordingly our future 
success depends upon our ability further penetrate the consumer home care market enhance our current consumer products 
and develop and introduce new consumer products offering enhanced performance and functionality competitive prices 
the development and application new technologies involves time substantial costs and risks our inability achieve 
significant sales our newly introduced robots enhance develop and introduce other products timely manner 
all would materially harm our sales growth and operating results 
even consumer robots gain wide market acceptance our robots may not adequately address markett requirements and 
may not continue gain market acceptance robots generally our robots specifically not gain wide market acceptance 
may not able achieve our anticipated level growth and our revenue and results operations would suffer 
face intense competition from other providers robots including diversified technology providers well 
competition from providers offering alternative products which could negatively impact our results 
operations and cause 
our market share decline 
number companies have developed are developing robots that will compete directly with our product offerings 
many current and potential competitors have substantially greaterr financial marketing research and manufacturing resources 
than possess and there can assurance that our current and future competitors will not more successful than 
also face competition from manufacturers lower cost devices which may drive down the average selling price the 
marketplace for floor cleaning products moreover while believe many off our customers purchase our floor vacuuming 
robots supplement rather than replacement for their traditional vacuum cleaners also compete some cases with 
providers traditional vacuum cleaners 
the global market for robots highly competitive rapidly evolving and subject changing technologies shifting 
customer needs and expectations and the likely increased introduction new products our ability remain competitive will 
depend great extent upon our ongoing performance the areas product development and customer support 
the event that the robot market expands further expectt that competition will intensify additional competitors enter 
the market and current competitors expand their product lines companies competing with may introduce products that are 
competitively priced have increased performance functionality incorporate technological advances that have not yet 
developed implemented increased competitive pressure could result loss sales markett share cause lower 
prices for our products any which would harm our business and operating results 
some our competitors may aggressively discount their products and services order gain market share which could 
result pricing pressures reduced profit margins lost market share failure grow market share for addition new 
products may have lower selling prices higher costs than legacy products which could negatively impact our gross margins 
and operating results 
cannot assure you that our products will continue compete favorably that will successful the face 
increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced existing competitors new companies entering the 
markets which provide products our failure compete successfully could cause our revenue and market share decline 
which would negatively impact our results operations and financial condition 
fail enhance our brand our ability expand our customer base will impaired and our operating results may 
suffer 
any efforts expand our product offerings beyond our current markets may not succeed which could negatively 
impact our operating results 
efforts expand our product offerings beyond our current markets may nott succeed and may divert management 
resources from existing operations and require commit significant financial resources unproven business either 
which could significantly impair our operating results moreover efforts expand beyond our existing markets may never result 
new products that achieve market acceptance create additional revenue become profitable 
our financial results often vary significantly from quarter quarter due number factors which may lead 
volatility our stock price 
our quarterly revenue and other operating results have varied 
the past and are likely continue vary significantly 
from quarter quarter the future these fluctuations may due numerous factors including 
the size timing and mix orders from retail stores and distributors for our consumer robots

quarter even every fiscal year base our current and future expense levels our internal operating plans and sales 
forecasts including forecasts holiday sales for our consumer products significant portion our operating expenses such 
research and development expenses certain marketing and promotional expenses and employee wages and salaries not vary 
directly with sales and are difficult adjust the short term result sales for quarter are below our expectations 
might not able reduce operating expenses for that quarter accordingly sales shortfall during fiscal quarter and 
particular the fourth quarter fiscal year could have disproportionate effect our operating results for that quarter that 
year because quarterly fluctuations believe that quarter quarter comparisons our operating results are not

believe that developing and maintaining awareness the irobot brand critical achieving widespread acceptance 
our existing and future products and important element attracting new customers furthermore expect the 
importance global brand recognition increase competition develops customers not perceive our products

this occurs the trading price our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly over time 
depend single source manufacturers and our reputation and results operations would harmed these 
manufacturers fail meet our requirements 
currently depend largely several single source contract manufacturers for the manufacture certain our

lack direct control over production capacity and delivery schedules 
lack direct control over quality assurance manufacturing yields and production costs 
lack enforceable contractual provisions over the production and costs consumer products 
risk loss inventory while transit

our ongoing business the potential distraction 
management potential difficulty managing and maintaining key customer relationships expenses related the acquisition 
and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability integrate completed acquisitions 
combinations efficient and timely manner could have adverse impact our results operations addition may 
not able recognize any expected synergies benefits connection with our recently completed acquisitions sodc 
robopolis any future acquisitions combinations are not successful completing acquisitions combinations that 
may pursue the future may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without 
successful result addition future acquisitions could require use substantial portions our available cash result 
dilutive issuances securities 
our service providers may experience business interruptions delays quality control issues which may negatively 
impact our business and operating results 
expand our operations expect use additional enterprise resource planning systems and account and 
technology service providers that may also essential managing our business our ability manage our business would 
suffer one more our providers suffer interruption their business experience delays disruptions quality control 
problems their operations have change add systems and services while conduct reasonable diligence our 
service providers may not always able control the quality the systems and services receive from these providers 
which could impair our ability maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting and complete timely and 
accurate financial reporting and may impact our business operating results and financial condition 
our valuation estimates for our recently completed and future acquisitions are based upon assumptions that may differ

acquiring businesses the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including various identifiable intangible assets 
such acquired technology acquired trade names and acquired customer relationships based their respective fair values our 
estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable but which are inherently uncertain after

sales retailers consumer robots are typically subject agreements allowing for limited rights return rebates and 
price protection also provide limited rights returns for direct consumer sales generated through our line stores and 
certain international distributors accordingly reduce revenue for our estimates liabilities for these rights return 
rebates and price protection well discounts and promotions the time the related sale recorded the estimates for 
rights return are directly based specific terms and conditions included the customer agreements historical returns 
experience and various other assumptions that believe are reasonable under the circumstances the case new product

predecessor products until such time that have enough actual returns experience for the new products which typically 
two holiday return cycles that time incorporate that data into the development returns estimates for the new products
