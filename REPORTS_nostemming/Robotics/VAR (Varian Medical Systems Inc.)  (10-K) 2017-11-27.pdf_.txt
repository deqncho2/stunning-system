radiation therapy and the cancer care market 
radiotherapy the use certain types focused energy kill cancer cells and shrink tumors radiotherapy commonly used either alone 
combination with surgery chemotherapy targeted drugs one important advantage that radiation has its greatest effect replicating cells when 
radiation interacts with cell the therapeutic effect primarily mediated damaging cellular genetic material chromosomes which interrupts cell 
replication and results eventual cellular death since the need for replication particularly critical the survival cancer and since normal tissues are 
better able repair such damage radiation tends disproportionately kill cancer cells the clinical goal radiation oncology deliver the highest 
possible radiation dose directly the tumor kill the cancerous cells while minimizing radiation exposure surrounding healthy tissue order limit 
avoid complications side effects and secondary effects caused the treatment this goal has been the driving force clinical care advancements 
radiation oncology over the past two decades from conventional radiotherapy advanced forms treatment such imrt igrt vmat srs sbrt and 
proton therapy 
the process for delivering radiotherapy typically consists examining the patient planning the treatment simulating and verifying the treatment plan 
providing quality assurance for the equipment and software delivering the treatment verifying that the treatment was delivered correctly and recording the 
history and results the treatment the team responsible for delivering the radiotherapy treatment generally comprised physician specializing 
radiation oncology medical physicist dosimetrist for planning patient treatments medical physicist for conducting appropriate quality assurance 
procedures and radiation therapist for positioning the patients for treatment and operating the machines 
the most common form radiotherapy involves delivering ray beams from outside the patient body process sometimes referred external beam 
radiotherapy device called medical linear accelerator generates the high energy ray beams and delivers the radiation the patient lying 
treatment couch the radiation source rotates around patient delivering the radiation beam that shaped the tumor from different angles this 
concentrates radiation the tumor while the same time minimizing the dose delivered the surrounding healthy tissue conventional radiotherapy 
typically involves multiple fractionated treatments tumor treatment sessions the linear accelerator may also deliver electron beams for 
the treatment diseases closer the body surface

imrt advanced form external beam radiotherapy which the shape and intensity the radiation beams are varied optimally modulated across the 
target region imrt allows the radiation dose more precisely conformed the volume the tumor allowing physicians deliver higher doses 
radiation the tumor than conventional radiation treatments while limiting radiation dose nearby healthy tissue this way clinicians can design and 
administer individualized treatment plan for each patient targeting the tumor within millimeters imrt can used treat head and neck breast 
prostate pancreatic lung liver gynecological and central nervous system cancers imrt has become well accepted standard treatment for cancer and 
every year additional treatment centers from university hospitals local community clinics adopt imrt for their treatments are leading global 
provider products that enable imrt for the treatment cancer 
vmat significant further advancement imrt that allows physicians control three parameters simultaneously the rate which the linear 
accelerator gantry rotates around the patient the beam shaping aperture and iii the rate which the radiation dose delivered the patient this 
creates finely shaped imrt dose distribution that more closely matches the size and shape the tumor with faster treatment times our rapidarc 
radiotherapy products plan and deliver vmat treatments 
physicians hospitals and clinics place additional value radiotherapy equipment and treatments such vmat that enable shorter treatment times and 
greater patient throughput from the patient standpoint reduced treatment times means that the patient immobilized the treatment couch for shorter 
time period shorter treatment sessions decrease waiting times and since treatments are delivered fractions over the course many days can mean fewer 
disruptions patient daily routine from the physicians and hospitals standpoint shorter treatment times can lessen the chance tumors moving 
during treatment and can increase patient throughput shorter treatment times and increased patient throughput can increase the number treatments per day 
which particular concern countries with lower numbers treatment machines per capita and result can decrease the cost per treatment which 
turn can mean greater access advanced care for more patients 
igrt another advanced form external beam radiotherapy complementing imrt enhance treatments while imrt helps physicians more precisely 
conform the beam the tumor igrt allows physicians see how tumor moves shrinks during course treatment thereby improving treatment 
accuracy this allows clinicians tighten the margin certainty around the tumor and spare more the surrounding healthy tissue potentially improving 
outcomes believe igrt has become accepted standard for treatment the radiation oncology community 
srs and sbrt often collectively referred radiosurgery are advanced ablative radiation treatment procedures performed small number treatment 
sessions with high doses radiation radiosurgery typically incorporates advanced image guidance focus many small beams radiation from many 
orientations precisely the target and minimize the dose surrounding normal tissues radiation oncologists surgeons and other oncology specialists 
increasingly recognize radiosurgery useful tool treat cancerous and non cancerous lesions anywhere the body 
alternative external beam radiotherapy brachytherapy involves the insertion radioactive seeds wires ribbons directly into tumor body cavity 
near the tumor these techniques tend irradiate much less surrounding healthy tissue that physicians can prescribe higher total dose radiation 
typically over shorter period time brachytherapy often used for cancers the head and neck breast uterus cervix soft tissue and prostate 
proton therapy another form external beam radiotherapy that uses proton particles the form beam generated with cyclotron rather than ray 
beams from linear accelerator proton beam signature energy distribution curve also known the bragg peak allows for greater precision 
targeting tumor cells with even lower dose nearby healthy tissue than may delivered with ray beams from linear accelerator this makes proton 
therapy preferred option for treating certain cancers particularly cancers children and tumors near critical structures such the optic nerve pencil beam 
scanning capability which advanced way delivering the proton beam allows for greater sparing healthy tissue compared fan beam scanning 
the proton beam and external beam radiotherapy treatments although proton therapy has been clinical use for more than four decades has not been 
widely deployed due its high capital cost and the market still developing believe can apply our experience traditional radiotherapy proton 
therapy reducing the cost treatment per patient for existing clinical applications and expanding the use proton therapy into broader array cancer 
types believe that proton therapy will over time become more widely accepted method treatment 
the radiation oncology market growing globally due number factors worldwide the number new cancer cases diagnosed annually projected 
increase from approximately million almost million according the september lancet oncology report compiled the 
global task force radiotherapy for cancer control addition technological advancements have helped improve the precision and applicability 
radiotherapy and radiosurgery potentially expanding the use radiotherapy and radiosurgery equipment treat broader range cases technological

long waits for radiotherapy according peer reviewed publication the international journal radiation oncology biology and physics 
radiotherapy required more than half new cancer patients particularly low and middle income countries and according article published

item risk factors 
the following risk factors and other information included this annual report form should carefully considered although the risk factors 
described below are the ones management deems significant additional risks and uncertainties not presently known that presently deem less 
significant may also adversely affect our business operations any the following risks additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business 
operating results and financial condition could adversely affected 
risks relating our businesses 
our performance depends successful improvements our existing products and commercialization new products 
the markets which operate are characterized rapid change and technological innovation our performance depends the successful 
commercialization new products that reflect and respond changes the marketplace technology and customer demands 
our oncology systems products often have long development and government approval cycles are technologically complex and must demonstrate high 
performance remain competitive 
our software products compete markets characterized rapid technological advances changing delivery models evolving standards and frequent new 
product introductions and enhancements are expanding our software product lines and investing the development cloud and software service 
saas solutions the development and introduction new software platforms and software delivery models well different business models 
complex with many technology regulatory and legal hurdles cannot assure you can successfully develop and implement such platforms models 
that our customers will accept them 
our vpt products require capital commitment planning design development and testing well involvement senior management because the 
large footprint and high price many proton therapy systems there increasing demand for the development smaller more compact proton therapy 
systems other companies currently offer smaller less expensive proton therapy systems and our competitiveness will depend our ability timely 
develop new technologies reduce the size and price our system provide additional features and functionality that our competitors not 
may need spend more time and money than anticipated develop and introduce new products product enhancements may not able 
recover all meaningful part our investment new products may adversely impact orders and sales our existing products make them less desirable 
even obsolete which could adversely impact our revenues and operating results addition certain costs including installation and warranty costs 
associated with new products may disproportionately greater than the costs associated with other products and are unable lower these costs over 
time our operating results could adversely affected 
our ability successfully develop and introduce new products and product enhancements depends our ability 
properly identify and respond customer needs

complex quality assurance processes including the quality system regulation qsr the fda failure complete these processes timely and 
efficient basis could result delays that could affect our ability attract retain customers could cause customers delay cancel orders 
portion product revenue generally tied installation and acceptance the product and our recognition revenue associated with new products 
may deferred where takes longer manufacture install the new products customers may also decide not upgrade their equipment customers 
may delay delivery some our more sophisticated products because the longer preparation and renovation treatment rooms required 
compete highly competitive markets and may lose market share companies with greater resources more effective technologies forced 
reduce our prices 
the markets for cancer treatment are characterized rapidly evolving technology intense competition and pricing pressure radiotherapy and 
radiosurgery markets compete primarily with elekta and accuray incorporated addition our software products compete with the product offerings 
variety companies such philips medical systems raysearch laboratories and brainlab 
new competitors may enter our markets and have already entered some our newer markets such radiosurgery vmat and proton therapy established 
enterprise software developers with greater software development capability may enter the markets for cancer treatment software some these competitors 
may have greater financial marketing and other development resources than have compete successfully must provide technically superior proven 
products that deliver more precise cost effective high quality clinical capabilities complete package products and services and ahead our 
competitors 
our oncology systems products are generally sold basis total value the customer our business may suffer when purchase decisions are based 
solely upon price which can happen hospitals and clinics give purchasing decision authority group purchasing organizations new competitors may 
also delay the purchasing decisions customers they evaluate the products these competitors along with ours potentially extending our sales cycle 
and adversely affecting our gross orders and revenues 
the shift the proportion sales outside the united states towards emerging market countries which typically purchase less complex lower priced 
products compared more developed countries and which usually have stiffer price competition and longer periods from placement orders revenue 
recognition could also adversely impact our results operations 
the market for proton therapy products still developing and characterized rapidly evolving technology and pricing pressure our primary competitor 
the proton therapy market ion beam applications our ability compete successfully depends part our ability lower our product costs 
and develop and provide technically superior proven products that deliver precise cost effective high quality capabilities 
large amounts resources are being invested the research and development new therapies for cancer the successful development alternative 
therapies for cancer including for example pharmaceutical treatments such immunotherapy increased efficacy information about new therapies 
existing products pricing decisions competitors and the rate market penetration competitive products may render our products obsolete result 
lost market share for reduced utilization our products lower prices and reduced product sales

marketing advantage over our mainstream cancer treatment products also some our competitors may not subject the same standards regulatory 
and other legal requirements that are subject and therefore they could have competitive advantage developing manufacturing and marketing 
products and services any inability develop gain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities competitive products the market 
quickly and effectively our competitors could limit market acceptance our products and reduce our sales addition some our smaller competitors 
could acquired larger companies that have greater financial strength which could enable them compete more aggressively our competitors could 
also acquire some our suppliers distributors which could disrupt supply distribution arrangements and result less predictable and reduced revenues

the interoperability radiation oncology treatment products becoming increasingly important and sales our products could fall fail 
establish interoperability 
radiation oncology treatment becomes more complex our customers are increasingly focusing ease use and interconnectivity have directed 
substantial product development efforts into increasing the interconnectivity our products for more seamless operation within system making our 
software products easier use and reducing setup and treatment times increase patient throughput our equipment and software are highly 
sophisticated and high level training and education required use them safely and effectively the requirements are made even more important 
because they work together within integrated environments 
have emphasized open systems approach that allows customers mix and match our individual products incorporate products from other 
manufacturers share information with other systems products and use the equipment for offering various methods radiation and chemotherapy 
treatment have done this based our belief that such interconnectivity will increase the acceptance and adoption imrt igrt and vmat and will 
stimulate demand for our products there are competitive closed ended dedicated use systems that place simplicity use ahead flexibility have 
misjudged the importance our customers maintaining open systems approach are unsuccessful our efforts increase interconnectivity 
enhance ease use and reduce setup and treatment times our revenues could suffer obtaining and maintaining interoperability and compatibility can 
costly and time consuming while try use standard published protocols for communication with widely used oncology products manufactured other 
companies cannot this may need develop individual interfaces that our products communicate correctly with other products 
when other companies modify the design functionality their products this may affect their compatibility with our products addition when 
improve our products customers may reluctant adopt our new technology due potential interoperability issues for example clinic may 
unwilling implement one our new technologies because its third party software does not yet communicate correctly with our new product our ability 
obtain compatibility with products other companies may depend our ability obtain adequate information from them regarding their products 
many cases these third parties are our competitors and may schedule their product changes and delay their release relevant information place 
competitive disadvantage 
when modify our products make them interoperable compatible with third party products may required obtain additional regulatory 
clearances this process costly and could delay our ability release our products for commercial use also possible that despite our efforts may

goodwill allocated reporting units expected benefit from the business combination evaluate our reporting units when changes our operating 
structure occur and necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit 
level annual basis whenever events changes circumstances indicate its carrying value may not recoverable can opt perform 
qualitative assessment test reporting unit goodwill for impairment can directly perform the two step impairment test various factors are 
considered the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations financial performance and other relevant 
events affecting the reporting unit based our qualitative assessment determine that the fair value reporting unit more likely than not 
likelihood more than percent less than its carrying amount the two step impairment test will performed the first step compare the fair
