our strategy 
our focus our well intervention and robotics businesses believe that focusing these services will 
deliver favorable long term financial returns from time time make strategic investments that expand 
our service capabilities add capacity existing services our key operating regions believe that 
have competitive advantage terms performing well intervention services efficiently furthermore 
believe that when oil and gas companies begin increase overall spending levels will likely for 
production activities rather than for exploration projects our well intervention and robotics operations are 
intended service the life span oil and gas field well provide abandonment services the end 
the life field required governmental regulations thus over the longer term believe that 
fundamentals for our business remain favorable the need for prolongation well life and oil and gas 
production the primary driver demand for our services

shareholder letter 
looking forward toward the future shareholder letter 
suggested that does not look better and will likely worse 
than that statement turned out much more prescient 
than what had hoped for terms industry environment 
industry activity continued its downward trajectory oil prices 
reached cyclical low january dropping below barrel 
the dip oil prices could not have occurred worse time for the 
oilfield services industry when many its customers were finalizing 
and setting budgetary levels thus top drop 
revenues helix revenues fell another 
our company operates highly cyclical industry and our job 
board directors and management team navigate the volatility 
that arises from this industry characteristic our mission during the 
past two years has been weather the industry downturn and absorb 
the short term pain that comes with while the same time 
executing the capital expansion program set out accomplish 
few years back 
bolstered our balance sheet furtherance our objective 
weather protracted industry downturn sold million 
our common stock net the company and pushed out 
million debt maturities issuing convertible notes due and using the proceeds repurchase like amount 
our existing convertible notes that would have been payable furthermore early january sold 
additional million our common stock move that further served strengthen the company balance sheet 
did see some notable achievements for helix commenced operations for the gulf mexico with the 
the five year contract provides solid foundation work the gulf mexico with our alliance 
parties schlumberger and onesubsea launched the joint development riserless open water abandonment 
module roam system which will greatly expand our capabilities for performing more cost effective 
decommissioning activities for customers

helix energy solutions 
should see another major milestone for the company expect place service both the siem helix and 
siem helix chartered vessels for petrobras brazil both these vessels are under four year contracts with petrobras 
with petrobras options extend 
looking forward oil prices have recovered somewhat bouncing off its lows early oil prices closed the year 
above barrel although oil prices have not yet recovered the prior peak cycle levels sustainable oil prices above 
barrel combined with the ever present need for the industry replenish depleting oil and gas reserves should 
lead higher spending levels our customers

the jones act coastwise trade rules 
are also subject the merchant marine act commonly known the jones act which regulates the 
kind vessels that can carry goods between ports the and which has been applied offshore oil and gas 
work the the jones act interpreted large part letter rulings the cbp the cumulative effect 
these letter rulings has been establish framework for offshore operators understand when operation can 
carried out foreign flag vessel and when must carried out coastwise qualified flag vessel 
january the cbp and its parent agency the department homeland security the dhs 
initiated proposed modification and revocation certain letter rulings previously issued the cbp subject 
public comment april the proposed rulemaking would largely reverse the holdings years letter 
rulings from the cbp regarding the application the jones act offshore oil and gas work the ramifications 
the proposed modification and revocation prior letter rulings currently uncertain however such proposal 
adopted this development could potentially make more difficult and costly perform our offshore services 
the gulf mexico 
other federal and state regulatory agencies 
additional proposals and proceedings before various federal and state regulatory agencies and the courts 
could affect the oil and gas industry cannot predict when whether any such proposals may become 
effective 
these regulatory developments and legislative initiatives may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels 
such oil and natural gas areas the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future 
demand for our services which may turn adversely affect our future results operations 
environmental regulation 
overview 
our operations are subject variety national including federal state and local and international laws 
and regulations governing the discharge materials into the environment otherwise relating environmental 
protection numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations implement and enforce these laws 
that are often complex costly comply with and carry substantial administrative civil and possibly criminal 
penalties for failure comply 
under these laws and regulations may liable for remediation removal costs damages and other 
costs associated with releases hazardous materials including oil into the environment and that liability may 
imposed even the acts that resulted the releases were compliance with all applicable laws the time 
such acts were performed some the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable our business 
operations are discussed the following paragraphs but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and 
regulations that govern our operations 
opa 
the oil pollution act amended opa imposes variety requirements responsible 
parties related the prevention oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills waters the 
united states responsible party includes the owner operator onshore facility vessel pipeline 
and the lessee permittee the area which offshore facility located opa imposes liability each 
responsible party for oil spill removal costs and for other public and private damages from oil spills failure 
comply with opa may result the assessment civil and criminal penalties opa establishes liability limits equal 
the greater per gross ton effective december for vessels other than tankers 
liability limits are higher for other types facilities and could apply our operations resulted responsible party 
status for spill from such facility the liability limits are not applicable however the spill caused gross 
negligence willful misconduct the spill results from violation federal safety construction operating 
regulation iii party fails report spill fails cooperate fully the cleanup few defenses exist the 
liability imposed under opa 
addition opa requires owners and operators vessels over gross tons provide the coast guard 
with evidence financial responsibility cover the cost cleaning oil spills from such vessels currently 
own and operate six vessels over gross tons have provided satisfactory evidence financial 
responsibility the coast guard for all our vessels 
clean water act 
the clean water act imposes strict controls the discharge pollutants into the navigable waters the 
united states and imposes potential liability for the costs remediating releases petroleum and other 
substances the controls and restrictions imposed under the clean water act have become more stringent over 
time and possible that additional restrictions will imposed the future permits must obtained 
discharge pollutants into state and federal waters certain state regulations and the general permits issued under 
the national pollutant discharge elimination system program prohibit the discharge produced waters and sand 
drilling fluids drill cuttings and certain other substances related the exploration for and production oil and 
natural gas into certain coastal and offshore waters 
the clean water act provides for civil criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge 
oil and other hazardous substances and imposes liability responsible parties for the costs cleaning any 
environmental contamination caused the release hazardous substance and for natural resource damages 
resulting from the release many states have laws that are analogous the clean water act and also require 
remediation releases petroleum and other hazardous substances state waters our vessels carry diesel fuel 
for their own use offshore facilities and vessels operated have facility and vessel response plans deal 
with potential spills believe that our operations comply all material respects with the requirements the 
clean water act and state statutes enacted control water pollution 
clean air act 
the supreme court has held that greenhouse gasses are air pollutant under the federal clean air 
act and thus subject regulation the epa october the epa published final rule requiring the 
reporting greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas sources the united states 
annual basis beginning for emissions occurring november the epa expanded its 
greenhouse reporting rule include onshore petroleum and natural gas production offshore petroleum and natural 
gas production onshore natural gas processing natural gas transmission underground natural gas storage 
liquefied natural gas storage liquefied natural gas import and export and natural gas distribution facilities 
reporting greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities required annual basis under this 
expanded rule 
variety regulatory developments proposals requirements and legislative initiatives have been 
introduced the domestic and international regions which operate that are focused restricting the 
emissions carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases for example the congress has from 
time time considered legislation reduce greenhouse gas emissions and almost one half the states already 
have taken legal measures reduce greenhouse gas emissions primarily through the planned development 
greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs more stringent 
regulations under the clean air act other similar federal state law could materially impact our business 
cercla 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla contains 
provisions requiring the remediation releases hazardous substances into the environment and imposes liability 
without regard fault the legality the original conduct certain classes persons including owners and 
operators contaminated sites where the release occurred and those companies that transport dispose 
arrange for disposal hazardous substances released the sites under cercla those persons may subject 
joint and several liability for the costs cleaning the hazardous substances that have been released into the 
environment for damages natural resources and for the costs certain health studies third parties may also 
file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused the release hazardous substances 
operate foreign jurisdictions that have various types governmental laws and regulations relating 
the discharge oil hazardous substances and the protection the environment pursuant these laws and 
regulations could held liable for remediation some types pollution including the release oil 
hazardous substances and debris from production refining industrial facilities well other assets own 
operate that are owned operated our customers our subcontractors 
ocsla 
the outer continental shelf lands act amended ocsla provides the federal government with 
broad discretion regulating the production offshore resources oil and natural gas including authority 
impose safety and environmental protection requirements applicable lessees and permittees operating the 
ocs specific design and operational standards may apply ocs vessels rigs platforms vehicles and 
structures violations lease conditions regulations issued pursuant ocsla can result substantial civil and 
criminal penalties well potential court injunctions curtailing operations and cancellation leases because 
our operations rely offshore oil and gas exploration and production the government were exercise its 
authority under ocsla restrict the availability offshore oil and gas leases such action could have material 
adverse effect our financial condition and results operations equally important since august the 
agency has implemented policy guidelines ipd under which bsee will issue incidents 
noncompliance directly contractors for serious violations bsee regulations 
marpol 
the united states one approximately member countries the international maritime organization 
imo specialized agency the united nations that responsible for developing measures improve the 
safety and security international shipping and prevent marine pollution from ships the imo has negotiated 
the international convention for the prevention pollution from ships marpol marpol imposes 
environmental standards the shipping industry which are subject these standards relate oil spills 
management garbage the handling and disposal noxious liquids harmful substances packaged forms 
sewage and air emissions 
greenhouse gases and vessel engine emissions 
greenhouse gases and marine engine emissions are area increasing regulatory action may 
subject variety regulations from multiple regulatory bodies that are designed reduce greenhouse gases 
other particulate emissions including restrictions the types fuels used our vessels restrictions the types 
engines carbon neutralization offset measures and requirements collect and report data emissions 
and the costs attendant each these efforts 
the the epa regulates the standards for emissions from vessel engines both its own and 
participant the imo beginning the imo designated the waters off north american emission 
control area directives have been issued designed reduce the emission nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides 
these can impact both the fuel and the engines that may used onboard vessels addition states can 
and the case california have issue rules regulating emissions from vessels operating off their coasts 
the california air resources board notified the industry that their vessel fuel regulations would not sunset due 
the implementation the imo the emissions regulations the north american emission control area but 
would continue effect marine notice 
addition foreign nations and state actors may also impose emissions restrictions the has issued 
regulations regulation that requires monitoring and reporting the emissions vessels exceeding 
gross tons that call ports with the first reports due present the regulation for monitoring 
and reporting only but anticipated that the future the may move from requiring reporting emissions 
regulations aimed reducing them 
current compliance and potential material impact 
believe that are compliance all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and 
regulations which are subject not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and 
regulations will have material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings competitive position however 
changes the environmental laws and regulations claims for damages persons property natural resources 
the environment could result substantial costs and liabilities and thus there can assurance that will 
not incur significant environmental compliance costs the future such environmental liability could substantially 
reduce our net income and could have significant impact our financial ability carry out our operations 
insurance matters 
our businesses involve high degree operational risk hazards such vessels sinking grounding 
colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions are inherent marine operations these hazards 
can cause personal injury loss life severe damage and destruction property and equipment pollution

item risk factors 
shareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors addition the other information 
contained herein operate globally challenging and highly competitive markets and thus our business 
subject variety risks the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing helix are 
also subject variety risks that affect many other companies generally well additional risks and 
uncertainties not known that the date this annual report believe are not significant the 
risks described below you should aware that the occurrence the events described these risk factors and 
elsewhere this annual report could have material adverse effect our business results operations and 
financial position 
our business adversely affected low oil and gas prices which occur from time time 
cyclical oil and gas industry 
our services are substantially dependent upon the condition the oil and gas industry and particular 
the willingness oil and gas companies make capital expenditures for offshore exploration development drilling 
and production operations although our services are used for other operations during the entire life cycle well 
when industry conditions are unfavorable such the current environment oil and gas companies will likely 
continue reduce their budgets for expenditures all types operations the level both capital and operating 
expenditures generally depend the prevailing view future oil and gas prices which are influenced 
numerous factors including 
worldwide economic activity 
supply and demand for oil and natural gas especially the united states europe china and india 
regional conflicts and economic and political conditions the middle east and other oil producing regions 
actions taken the organization petroleum exporting countries opec 
the availability and discovery rate new oil and natural gas reserves offshore areas 
the exploration and production onshore shale oil and natural gas 
the cost offshore exploration for and production and transportation oil and natural gas 
the level excess production capacity 
the ability oil and gas companies generate funds otherwise obtain external capital for capital 
projects and production operations 
the sale and expiration dates offshore leases the united states and overseas 
technological advances affecting energy exploration production transportation and consumption 
potential acceleration the development alternative fuels 
shifts end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use natural gas 
weather conditions and natural disasters 
environmental and other governmental regulations and 
tax laws regulations and policies 
prolonged period low level activity oil and gas operators may continue adversely affect demand 
for our services and could lead even greater surplus available vessels and therefore increasingly downward 
pressure the rates can charge the market for our services the short term our customers reaction 
negative market conditions may continue seek renegotiate their contracts with lower rates both for 
existing contracts and when existing contracts expire cancel earlier work and shift later years cancel 
their contracts with even cancellation involves their paying cancellation fee the extent the impact 
these conditions our results operations and cash flows depends the length and severity the current 
unfavorable industry environment and the potential decreased demand for our services 
the majority our current backlog concentrated small number long term contracts 
although historically our service contracts were relatively short duration over the last several years 
have been entering into longer term contracts such the five year contract with for work the gulf 
mexico the petrobras contracts for well intervention services offshore brazil and the seven year contract for the 
december the contract the petrobras contracts and the contract for the represent 
approximately our total backlog any cancellation termination breach these contracts would have 
larger impact our operating results and our financial condition than shorter term contracts due the value 
risk the cancellation termination unwillingness perform these contracts could have material adverse 
effect our financial position results operations and cash flows 
our current backlog for our services may not ultimately realized and our contracts may 
terminated early 
december backlog for our services supported written agreements contracts totaled 
billion which million expected performed may incur capital costs substantial 
portion which expect recover from these contracts may charter vessels for the purpose performing 
these contracts and may forgo not seek other contracting opportunities light these contracts 
may not able perform under our contracts for various reasons addition our customers may 
seek cancel terminate suspend renegotiate our contracts the event our customers diminished demand 
for our services due industry conditions affecting our customers and their own revenues some these 
contracts provide for cancellation fee that substantially less than the expected rates from the contracts 
addition some our customers could experience liquidity issues could otherwise unable unwilling 
perform under contract which could lead customer seek repudiate cancel renegotiate the contract our 
inability the inability our customers perform under our their contractual obligations the early 
cancellation termination our contracts our customers could have material adverse effect our financial 
position results operations and cash flows 
time chartering vessels requires make ongoing payments regardless utilization and 
revenue generation from those vessels 
typically charter our rov support vessels under long term time charter agreements also have 
entered into long term charter agreements for the siem helix and siem helix vessels perform work under the 
petrobras contracts should our contracts with customers canceled terminated breached and not 
secure work for the chartered vessels are still required make charter payments making those payments 
absent revenue generation could have material adverse effect our financial position results operations and 
cash flows 
vessel upgrade modification repair and construction projects and customer contractual 
acceptance new vessels are subject risks including delays cost overruns and failure secure 
maintain contracts 
the our newbuild semi submersible well intervention vessel currently under construction 
additional rovs and trenchers are also constructed from time time depending available opportunities and 
market conditions vessels may constructed for our fleet without first obtaining service contracts covering those 
vessels specifically our vessel does not have any contracted backlog our failure secure service 
contracts for vessels other assets under construction could adversely affect our financial position results 
operations and cash flows addition incur significant upgrade modification refurbishment and repair 
expenditures our fleet from time time while some these projects are planned some are unplanned 
these projects are subject risks delay cost overruns inherent any large capital project resulting from 
numerous factors including 
shortages equipment materials skilled labor 
unscheduled delays the delivery ordered materials and equipment 
unanticipated increases the cost equipment labor and raw materials particularly steel 
weather interferences 
difficulties obtaining necessary permits meeting permit conditions 
design and engineering problems 
political social and economic instability war and civil disturbances 
delays customs clearance critical parts equipment 
financial other difficulties failures shipyards and suppliers 
disputes with shipyards and suppliers and 
work stoppages and other labor disputes 
delays the delivery vessels being constructed undergoing upgrades modifications refurbishment 
repair may result delay customer acceptance and contract commencement resulting loss revenue 
and cash flow and may cause our customers seek terminate shorten the terms their contracts and 
seek delay damages under applicable late delivery clauses for instance the siem helix continuing work 
through petrobras inspection and acceptance process including the completion modifications agreed 
between and petrobras the contracts with petrobras for our chartered vessels brazil have penalty provisions 
for late delivery the vessels petrobras which liquidated damages with respect the siem helix are 
continuing accrue until the vessel accepted petrobras these delay penalties escalate and can become 
significant with extended delay and the vessels are late delivery petrobras beyond certain date year 
from the latest required contractual delivery date the contracts also may terminated petrobras the event 
termination these and other contracts may not able secure replacement contract favorable 
terms all 
the estimated capital expenditures for vessel construction upgrade modification and refurbishment 
projects could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures moreover our vessels undergoing upgrades 
modifications refurbishment repair may not earn day rate during the period they are out service 
additionally vessels age they are more likely subject higher maintenance and repair activities and thus 
suffer lower levels utilization any significant period unplanned maintenance and repairs related our vessels 
could have material adverse effect our financial position results operations and cash flows 
our inability failure perform operationally under our contracts could result reduced 
revenues contractual penalties and ultimately contract termination 
our equipment and services are very technical and the offshore environment poses its own challenges 
performing the work pursuant the terms our contracts can difficult for various reasons including 
equipment failure reduced performance human error design flaws weather currents soil conditions failure 
perform accordance with contract specifications can result reduced rates zero rates contractual 
penalties and ultimately termination the event sustained non performance for example our services and 
charter agreements with petrobras provide that petrobras can assess fines based percentage our daily 
operating rate for certain failures equipment vessels personnel which fines may deducted petrobras 
from our monthly payments and ultimately petrobras has the right terminate should assessed penalties reach 
certain amount reduced revenues because our failure perform operationally could have material adverse 
effect our financial position results operations and cash flows 
sustained period unfavorable industry conditions could jeopardize our customers and other 
counterparties ability perform their obligations 
continued uncertain industry conditions could jeopardize the ability certain our counterparties 
perform their obligations including our customers insurers and financial institutions although assess the 
creditworthiness our counterparties prolonged period difficult industry conditions could lead changes 
counterparty liquidity and increase our exposure credit risk and bad debts particular our robotics business 
unit tends business with smaller customers that may not capitalized the same extent larger operators 
addition may offer extended payment terms our customers order secure contracts these 
circumstances may lead more frequent collection issues our financial results and liquidity could adversely 
affected and could incur losses 
because have certain capital debt and other obligations prolonged period low demand and 
rates for our services could eventually lead material adverse effect our liquidity 
although continue seek reduce the level our capital and other expenses and have raised capital 
means several equity offerings the event more prolonged period the current industry environment 
the failure our customers expend funds our services longer period lower rates for our services 
coupled with certain fixed obligations that have related debt repayment capital commitments long term time 
charter contracts for our vessels and certain other commitments related ongoing operational activities could 
eventually lead material adverse effect our liquidity and financial position 
may not able compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the oilfield services business which operate highly competitive oversupply offshore drilling 
rigs coupled with significant slowdown industry activities results increased competition from drilling rigs 
well substantially lower rates work that being performed several our competitors are substantially larger 
and have greater financial and other resources better withstand prolonged period difficult industry conditions 
order compete for customers these larger competitors may undercut substantially reducing rates 
levels are unable withstand other companies relocate acquire vessels for operations the regions 
which operate levels competition may increase further and our business could adversely affected 
our indebtedness and the terms our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our 
ability fulfill our debt obligations 
december had million consolidated indebtedness outstanding the level 
indebtedness may have adverse effect our future operations including 
limiting our ability refinance maturing debt obtain additional financing satisfactory terms fund 
our working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service 
requirements and other general corporate requirements 
increasing our vulnerability continued general economic downturn competition and industry conditions 
which could place disadvantage compared our competitors that are less leveraged 
increasing our exposure potential rising interest rates because portion our current and potential 
future borrowings are variable interest rates 
reducing the availability our cash flows fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures 
acquisitions investments and other general corporate requirements because will required use 
substantial portion our cash flows service debt obligations 
limiting our flexibility planning for reacting changes our business and the industry which 
operate and 
limiting our ability expand our business through capital expenditures pursuit acquisition 
opportunities due negative covenants senior secured credit facilities that place annual and aggregate 
limitations the types and amounts investments that may make and limit our ability use proceeds 
from asset sales for purposes other than debt repayment except certain circumstances where proceeds 
may reinvested under criteria set forth our credit agreements 
prolonged period weak economic conditions and other events beyond our control may make 
increasingly difficult comply with our covenants and other restrictions agreements governing our debt fail 
comply with these covenants and other restrictions could lead reduced liquidity event default the 
possible acceleration our repayment outstanding debt and the exercise certain remedies the lenders 
including foreclosure against our collateral these conditions and events may limit our access the credit markets 
need replace our existing debt which could lead increased costs and less favorable terms including 
shorter repayment schedules and higher fees and interest rates 
lack access the financial markets could negatively impact our ability operate our business 
and execute our strategy 
access financing may limited and uncertain especially times economic weakness capital and 
credit markets are limited may unable refinance may incur increased costs and less favorable terms 
associated with any refinancing our maturing debt also may incur increased costs and less favorable terms 
associated with any additional financing may require for future operations limited access the financial 
markets could adversely impact our ability take advantage business opportunities react changing 
economic and business conditions additionally capital and credit markets are limited this could potentially result 
our customers curtailing their capital and operating expenditure programs which could result decrease 
demand for our vessels and reduction fees and utilization addition certain our customers could 
experience inability pay suppliers including the event they are unable access financial markets 
needed fund their operations likewise our suppliers may unable sustain their current level operations 
fulfill their commitments and fund future operations and obligations each which could adversely affect our 
operations continued lower levels economic activity and weakness the financial markets could also adversely 
affect our ability implement our strategic objectives and dispose non core business assets 
our forward looking statements assume that our lenders insurers and other financial institutions will 
able fulfill their obligations under our various credit agreements insurance policies and contracts any our 
significant financial institutions were unable perform under these agreements and were unable find 
suitable replacements reasonable cost our financial position results operations liquidity and cash flows 
could adversely impacted 
further decline the offshore energy services market could result additional impairment 
charges 
december recorded goodwill impairment charge million related our robotics 
reporting unit december recorded asset impairment charges million related our helix 
vessel million related our vessel and million related certain capitalized vessel project costs 
also recognized goodwill impairment charge million related our well intervention reporting unit 
well losses totaling million primarily reflecting our share impairment charges that deepwater 
gateway and independence hub recorded december prolonged periods low utilization and day rates 
could result the recognition additional impairment charges for our vessels and robotics assets future cash 
flow estimates based information available the time indicate that their carrying value may not 
recoverable may also record additional impairment losses the future 
our business typically declines winter and bad weather the gulf mexico north sea can 
adversely affect our operations 
marine operations conducted the gulf mexico and north sea are seasonal and depend part 
weather conditions historically have enjoyed our highest vessel utilization rates during the summer and fall 
when weather conditions are favorable for offshore exploration development and construction activities 
typically have experienced our lowest utilization rates the first quarter common the industry may 
bear the risk delays caused some adverse weather conditions accordingly our results any one quarter are 
not necessarily indicative annual results continuing trends 
certain areas and near the gulf mexico and north sea experience unfavorable weather conditions 
including hurricanes and extreme storms relatively frequent basis substantially all our facilities and assets 
offshore and along the gulf mexico and the north sea are susceptible damage and total loss these 
storms damage caused high winds and turbulent seas could potentially cause curtail service operations 
for significant periods time until damage can assessed and repaired moreover even not experience 
direct damage from any these weather events may experience disruptions our operations because 
customers may curtail their offshore activities due damage their platforms pipelines and other related facilities 
the operation marine vessels risky and not have insurance coverage for all risks 
vessel based offshore services involve high degree operational risk hazards such vessels 
sinking grounding colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions are inherent marine 
operations these hazards can cause personal injury loss life severe damage and destruction property 
and equipment pollution environmental damage and suspension operations damage arising from such 
occurrences may result lawsuits asserting large claims insurance may not sufficient effective under all 
circumstances against all hazards which may subject successful liability claim for which are not 
fully insured could have material adverse effect our financial condition moreover cannot assure you that 
will able maintain adequate insurance the future rates that consider reasonable some 
instances certain insurance could become unavailable available only for reduced amounts coverage for 
example insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due war risk and terrorist acts and 
limitations for wind storm damages the current insurance our vessels amounts approximating replacement 
value the event property loss due catastrophic marine disaster mechanical failure collision other 
event insurance may not cover substantial loss revenue increased costs and other liabilities and therefore the 
loss any our vessels could have material adverse effect 
our customers may unable unwilling indemnify 
consistent with standard industry practice typically obtain contractual indemnification from our 
customers whereby they agree protect and indemnify for liabilities resulting from various hazards associated 
with offshore operations can provide assurance however that our customers will willing financially 
able meet these indemnification obligations also may choose not enforce these indemnities because 
business reasons 
enhanced regulations for deepwater offshore drilling may reduce the need for our services 
exploration and development activities and the production and sale oil and natural gas are subject 
extensive federal state local and international regulations conduct deepwater drilling the gulf 
mexico operator required comply with existing and newly developed regulations and enhanced safety 
standards before drilling may commence the bsee conducts many inspections deepwater drilling operations 
for compliance with its regulations including the testing blowout preventers operators also are required 
comply with the safety and environmental management system regulations sems within the deadlines specified 
the regulations and ensure that their contractors have sems compliant safety and environmental policies and 
procedures additionally each operator must demonstrate that has containment resources that are available 
promptly the event deepwater blowout regardless the company operator involved expected that 
the boem and the bsee will continue issue further regulations regarding deepwater offshore drilling our 
business significant portion which the gulf mexico provides development services newly drilled 
wells and therefore relies heavily the industry drilling new oil and gas wells the issuance permits 
significantly delayed other oil and gas operations are delayed reduced due increased costs demand for 
our services the gulf mexico may also decline moreover our vessels are not redeployed other locations 
where can provide our services profitable rate our business financial condition results operations and 
cash flows would materially adversely affected 
cannot predict with any certainty the substance effect any new additional regulations the 
united states other areas around the world the united states other countries where our customers 
operate enact stricter restrictions offshore drilling further regulate offshore drilling and thereby increase costs 
and cause delays for our customers and this results decreased demand for profitability our services our 
business financial condition results operations and cash flows could materially adversely affected 
government regulations may affect our business operations 
our business affected changes public policy and federal state local and foreign laws and 
regulations relating the offshore oil and gas industry offshore oil and gas operations are affected tax 
environmental safety labor cabotage and other laws changes those laws application interpretation 
existing laws and changes related administrative regulations enforcement priorities also possible that 
these laws and regulations may the future add significantly our operating costs those our customers 
otherwise directly indirectly affect our operations for example cbp has recently proposed modification and 
revocation prior letter rulings regarding the interpretation the jones act which proposal currently the 
public comment period the ramifications this interpretation the jones act are uncertain however believe 
that adopted proposed the new interpretation the jones act could adversely impact the operations noncoastwise qualified vessels working the gulf mexico including the and the chartered grand 
canyon which currently operate the area industry challenging the proposal whether the revised 
interpretation will adopted uncertain 
risks substantial costs and liabilities related environmental compliance issues are inherent our 
operations our operations are subject extensive federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating 
the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge materials into the environment 
permits are required for the operations various facilities and those permits are subject revocation modification 
and renewal government authorities have the power enforce compliance with their regulations and violations 
are subject fines injunctions both some cases those governmental requirements can impose liability for 
the entire cost cleanup any responsible party without regard negligence fault and impose liability 
for the conduct others conditions others have caused for our acts that complied with all applicable 
requirements when performed them possible that other developments such stricter environmental laws 
and regulations and claims for damages property persons resulting from our operations would result 
substantial costs and liabilities our insurance policies and the contractual indemnity protection seek obtain 
from our customers may not sufficient effective protect under all circumstances against all risk 
involving compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
failure comply with the foreign corrupt practices act foreign anti bribery legislation 
could have material adverse impact our business 
the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar anti bribery laws other jurisdictions 
including the united kingdom bribery act and brazil clean company act generally prohibit companies and 
their intermediaries from making improper payments foreign officials for the purpose obtaining retaining 
business operate many parts the world that have experienced governmental corruption some degree 
have robust ethics and compliance program that designed deter detect violations applicable laws 
and regulations through the application our anti corruption policies and procedures code business conduct 
and ethics training internal controls investigation and remediation activities and other measures however our 
ethics and compliance program may not fully effective preventing all employees contractors intermediaries 
from violating circumventing our compliance requirements applicable laws and regulations failure comply 
with the fcpa other anti bribery legislation could subject civil and criminal penalties create termination 
other rights connection with our existing contracts negatively impact our ability obtain future work lead 
other sanctions all which could have material adverse effect our business financial position results 
operations and cash flows and cause reputational damage could also face fines sanctions and other 
penalties from authorities the relevant foreign jurisdictions including prohibition our participating 
curtailment business operations those jurisdictions and the seizure vessels other assets 
our operations outside the united states subject additional risks 
our operations outside the united states are subject risks inherent foreign operations including 
the loss revenue property and equipment from expropriation nationalization war insurrection acts

energy industry with focus well intervention and robotics operations believe that focusing these 
services will deliver favorable long term financial returns from time time make strategic investments that 
expand our service capabilities add capacity existing services our key operating regions the long term 
prospects our well intervention fleet are enhanced the delivery the siem helix chartered vessel 
june the delivery the siem helix chartered vessel february and the completion and delivery 
the newbuild semi submersible vessel chartering newer vessels with additional capabilities 
including the grand canyon iii chartered vessel which expected service for may should 
enable our robotics business better serve the needs our customers also beneficial from long term 
perspective have secured our new fixed fee agreement for the helix producer the dynamic

schlumberger and schlumberger oilfield holdings ltd entered into strategic alliance agreement and related 
agreements for the parties strategic alliance design develop manufacture promote market and sell global 
basis integrated equipment and services for subsea well intervention the alliance expected leverage the

economic outlook and industry influences 
demand for our services primarily influenced the condition the oil and gas industry and particular 
the willingness oil and gas companies spend operational activities well capital projects the 
performance our business also largely dependent the prevailing market prices for oil and natural gas which 
are impacted domestic and global economic conditions hydrocarbon production and capacity geopolitical 
issues weather and several other factors including 
worldwide economic activity including available access global capital and capital markets 
supply and demand for oil and natural gas especially the united states europe china and india 
regional conflicts and economic and political conditions the middle east and other oil producing regions 
actions taken opec 
the availability and discovery rate new oil and natural gas reserves offshore areas 
the exploration and production onshore shale oil and natural gas 
the cost offshore exploration for and production and transportation oil and natural gas 
the level excess production capacity 
the ability oil and gas companies generate funds otherwise obtain external capital for capital 
projects and production operations 
the sale and expiration dates offshore leases the united states and overseas 
technological advances affecting energy exploration production transportation and consumption 
potential acceleration the development alternative fuels 
shifts end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use natural gas 
weather conditions and natural disasters 
environmental and other governmental regulations and 
domestic and international tax laws regulations and policies 
the significant decline oil prices since mid year and the resulting difficult industry environment has 
had significant adverse impact investments oil and gas exploration and production many oil and gas 
companies have terminated not renewed contracts for many their contracted rigs and have drastically cut 
investments exploration and production well other operational activities expect these challenging 
industry conditions continue through and beyond oil and gas prices fail increase level conducive 
increased activity levels increased competition for limited offshore oil and gas projects has driven down rates that 
drilling rig contractors are charging for their services which affects all offshore oil and gas services contractors 
including increased competition also expected affect utilization our assets addition the current 
volatile and uncertain macroeconomic conditions some countries around the world such brazil and more 
recently the following brexit may have direct and indirect impact our existing contracts and contracting 
opportunities and may introduce further currency volatility into our operations and financial results are 
continuing monitor the impact brexit and any exit agreements they are negotiated but the impact from 
brexit our business and operations will depend the outcome tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other 
negotiations well the impact brexit macroeconomic growth and currency volatility which are uncertain 
this time 
many oil and gas companies are increasingly focusing optimizing production their existing subsea 
wells believe that have competitive advantage terms performing well intervention services efficiently 
furthermore believe that when oil and gas companies begin increase overall spending levels will likely 
for production activities rather than for exploration projects our well intervention and robotics operations are 
intended service the life span oil and gas field well provide abandonment services the end the 
life field required governmental regulations thus over the longer term believe that fundamentals for 
our business remain favorable the need for prolongation well life oil and gas production the primary driver 
demand for our services 
our current strategy positioned for future recovery while coping with sustained period weak 
activity this strategy based the following factors the need extend the life subsea wells significant 
the commercial viability the wells plug and abandonment costs are considered our services offer 
commercially viable alternatives for reducing the finding and development costs reserves compared new 
drilling well extending and enhancing the commercial life subsea wells and past cycles well 
intervention and workover have been one the first activities recover and prolonged market downturn are 
important the commercial viability deepwater wells

united states such are required make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts 
revenues and expenses during the periods presented base our estimates historical experience available 
information and various other assumptions believe reasonable under the circumstances these estimates 
may change new events occur more experience acquired additional information obtained and our 
operating environment changes believe that the most critical accounting policies this regard are those 
described below while these issues require make judgments that are somewhat subjective they are 
generally based significant amount historical data and current market data see note for detailed 
discussion the application our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our services are derived from contracts which are both short term and long term 
duration our long term contracts are contracts that contain either lump sum provisions provisions for specific 
time material and equipment charges which are billed accordance with the terms such contracts 
recognize revenue earned estimated collectible amounts further record revenues net taxes 
collected from customers and remitted governmental authorities 
the majority our contracts contain provisions for specific time material and equipment charges 
revenues generated from these contracts are generally earned dayrate basis and recognized amounts are 
earned accordance with contract terms certain dayrate contracts with built rate changes require record 
revenues straight line basis may receive revenues for mobilization equipment and personnel under 
dayrate contracts revenues related mobilization are deferred and recognized over the period which 
contracted services are performed using the straight line method incremental costs incurred directly for 
mobilization equipment and personnel the contracted site which typically consist materials supplies and 
transit costs also are deferred and recognized using the same straight line method our policy amortize the 
revenues and costs related mobilization straight line basis over the estimated contract service period 
consistent with the general pace activity level services being provided and dayrates being earned over the 
contract period mobilization costs move vessels when contract does not exist are expensed incurred 
property and equipment 
property and equipment recorded cost depreciation expense derived primarily using the straightline method over the estimated useful life asset 
assets used operations are evaluated for impairment indicators whenever changes facts and 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount the asset asset group may not recoverable and may 
exceed its fair value our marine vessels are assessed vessel vessel basis while our robotics assets are 
grouped and assessed asset class the expected future cash flows used for the assessment recoverability 
are based judgmental assessments operating costs project margins and capital project decisions considering 
all available information the date review because there usually lack quoted market prices for long lived 
assets the fair value impaired assets typically determined based the present values expected future cash 
flows using discount rates believed consistent with those used principal market participants based 
multiple operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions similar assets where possible 
impairment has occurred recognize loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value 
the asset 
see note for additional information regarding our property and equipment 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
are required perform impairment analysis goodwill least annually more frequently 
whenever events circumstances occur indicating that might impaired have elected november 
our annual impairment assessment date for goodwill 
under the first step the goodwill impairment test the fair value each reporting unit compared its 
carrying amount including goodwill the carrying amount the reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill 
impairment indicated and second step performed measure the amount impairment loss november 
had one reporting unit with goodwill our robotics reporting unit used both the income approach 
discounted cash flow method and the market approach estimate the fair value our reporting units the fair 
value our robotics reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount approximately performed 
market capitalization reconciliation comparing the fair value equity fair value total invested capital less fair 
value total debt market capitalization which used validate the results the first step our goodwill 
impairment analysis 
based the results the first step performed the second step the impairment test for our robotics 
reporting unit there was implied fair value goodwill after allocated the fair value the reporting unit all 
the assets and liabilities the reporting unit were acquired business combination therefore concluded 
that goodwill our robotics reporting unit was fully impaired and recorded impairment charge million

conducted and income earned valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded when more likely 
than not that some all the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not realized 
consider the undistributed earnings our non subsidiaries without operations the 
permanently reinvested have not provided deferred income tax the accumulated earnings and profits 
from our non subsidiaries without operations the consider them permanently reinvested

intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
basis presentation 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles gaap certain reclassifications were made previously reported amounts the 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto make them consistent with the current presentation format 
have made all adjustments which were normal recurring adjustments that believe are necessary for fair 
presentation our consolidated financial statements applicable 
use estimates 
the preparation financial statements conformity with gaap requires management make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities and disclosures contingent 
assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities three months 
less they are carried cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts 
accounts and notes receivable are stated the historical carrying amount net write offs and allowance 
for uncollectible accounts the amount our net accounts receivable and our note receivable approximates fair 
value establish allowance for uncollectible accounts based historical experience well any specific 
collection issues that have identified uncollectible receivables are written off when settlement reached for 
amount that less than the outstanding historical balance when have determined that the balance will 
definitively not collected note 
property and equipment 
property and equipment recorded historical cost property and equipment depreciated straight 
line basis over the estimated useful life each asset the cost improvements capitalized while the cost 
repairs and maintenance charged expense incurred for the years ended december and 
repair and maintenance expense totaled million million and million respectively 
assets used operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes facts and circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount asset asset group may not recoverable because such carrying amount 
may exceed the asset asset group fair value upon review the sum undiscounted future cash flows 
expected generated the asset asset group less than its carrying amount impairment recorded 
the amount the impairment recorded calculated the difference between the carrying amount the asset 
asset group and its estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes the lowest level 
where there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent the cash flows other groups assets 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based 
assessments operating costs project margins and capital project decisions considering all available information 
the date review the fair value impaired assets typically determined based the present values 
expected future cash flows using discount rates believed consistent with those used principal market 
participants based multiple operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions similar 
assets where possible these fair value measurements fall within level the fair value hierarchy 
assets are classified held for sale when formal plan dispose the assets exists and those assets 
meet the held for sale criteria assets held for sale are reviewed for potential loss sale when commit 
plan sell and thereafter while those assets are held for sale losses are measured the difference between 
asset fair value less costs sell and the asset carrying amount estimates anticipated sales prices are 
judgmental and subject revision future periods although initial estimates are typically based sales prices for 
similar assets and other valuation data 
capitalized interest 
interest from external borrowings capitalized major projects until the assets are ready for their 
intended use capitalized interest added the cost the underlying asset and amortized over the useful life 
the asset the same manner the underlying asset capitalized interest component our net interest 
expense note 
equity investments 
periodically review our equity investments for impairment under the equity method accounting 
impairment loss would recorded whenever the fair value equity investment determined below its 
carrying amount and the reduction considered other than temporary judging other than temporary 
consider the length time and extent which the fair value the investment has been less than the carrying 
amount the equity investment the near term and long term operating and financial prospects the entity and 
our longer term intent retaining our investment the entity 
the event incur losses excess the carrying amount equity investment and reduce our 
investment balance zero would not record additional losses unless guaranteed obligations the 
investee are otherwise committed provide further financial support for the investee iii anticipated 
that the investee return profitability imminent provided commitment fund losses would 
continue record losses resulting negative equity method investment which presented liability 
goodwill 
are required perform annual impairment analysis goodwill elected november our 
annual impairment assessment date for goodwill however could required evaluate the recoverability 
goodwill prior the annual assessment date experience disruption the business unexpected significant 
declines operating results divestiture significant component the business emergence unanticipated 
competition loss key personnel sustained decline market capitalization the time our annual 
assessment goodwill november had one reporting unit with goodwill 
first assess qualitative factors order determine whether more likely than not that the fair value 
reporting unit less than its carrying amount including goodwill some the qualitative factors evaluated 
include among other things the results the most recent impairment analysis the most recent operating results 
the reporting unit the current outlook for the reporting unit and the current conditions the market which the 
reporting unit operates the qualitative assessment indicates potential impairment perform the first step 
the goodwill impairment analysis described below our policy bypass the qualitative assessment least 
once every three years and perform the first step the goodwill impairment analysis elected perform the 
first step the goodwill impairment analysis for both and light the continuation industry wide 
downturn result the substantial decline oil prices since late 
the goodwill impairment analysis two step process the first step identify whether potential 
impairment exists comparing the fair value the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the 
fair value reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill the reporting unit not considered have 
potential impairment and the second step the impairment analysis not necessary however the carrying 
amount reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step performed determine goodwill impaired 
and measure the amount impairment loss recognize any 
the second step compares the implied fair value goodwill with the carrying amount goodwill the 
implied fair value goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill not considered impaired however 
the carrying amount goodwill exceeds the implied fair value impairment loss recognized amount equal 
that excess the implied fair value goodwill determined the same manner the amount goodwill 
recognized business combination the fair value the reporting unit allocated all the assets and 
liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets the reporting unit were acquired business 
combination 
use both the income approach and the market approach estimate the fair value our reporting units 
under the first step our goodwill impairment analysis under the income approach discounted cash flow 
analysis performed requiring make various judgmental assumptions about future revenue operating 
margins growth rates and discount rates these judgmental assumptions are based our budgets long term 
business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and market place data under the market 
approach the fair value each reporting unit calculated applying average peer total invested capital 
ebitda defined earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization multiple future 
forecasted ebitda for each reporting unit judgment required when selecting peer companies that operate 
the same similar lines business and are potentially subject the same economic risks also perform 
market capitalization reconciliation comparing the fair value equity fair value total invested capital less fair 
value total debt market capitalization and evaluate the reasonableness the implied equity premium 
our goodwill subject impairment analysis was associated with our robotics segment result 
our goodwill impairment analysis recorded impairment charge million write off the 
goodwill associated with our robotics reporting unit our goodwill subject impairment analysis and 
was associated with our well intervention and robotics segments result our goodwill impairment 
analysis recorded impairment charge million write off the goodwill associated with our well 
intervention reporting unit november the fair value our robotics reporting unit exceeded the 
carrying amount goodwill based the first step the impairment analysis and impairment was recorded 
performed the qualitative assessment described above and concluded that there was indication 
goodwill impairment did not record any amount goodwill impairment 
recertification costs and deferred dry dock costs 
our vessels are required regulation periodically recertified recertification costs are incurred while 
vessel dry dock addition routine repairs and maintenance are performed and times major 
replacements and improvements are performed expense routine repairs and maintenance costs they are 
incurred defer and amortize dry dock and related recertification costs over the length time for which 
expect receive benefits from the dry dock and related recertification which generally months but can 
long months the appropriate permitting obtained dry dock and related recertification process typically 
lasts one two months period during which the vessel idle and generally not available earn revenue major 
replacements and improvements that extend the vessel economic useful life functional operating capability are 
capitalized and depreciated over the vessel remaining economic useful life 
december and capitalized deferred dry dock costs included within other assets net 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets note totaled million and million net 
accumulated amortization million and million respectively during the years ended december 
and dry dock amortization expense was million million and million 
respectively 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our services are derived from contracts which are both short term and long term 
duration our long term services contracts are contracts that contain either lump sum provisions provisions for 
specific time material and equipment charges which are billed accordance with the terms such contracts 
recognize revenue earned estimated collectible amounts further record revenues net taxes 
collected from customers and remitted governmental authorities 
unbilled revenue represents revenue attributable work completed prior period end that has not yet 
been invoiced all amounts included unbilled revenue are expected billed and collected within one year 
however also monitor the collectability our outstanding trade receivables continual basis connection 
with our evaluation allowance for doubtful accounts 
dayrate contracts revenues generated from specific time material and equipment contracts are 
generally earned dayrate basis and recognized amounts are earned accordance with contract terms 
certain dayrate contracts with built rate changes require record revenues straight line basis may 
receive revenues for mobilization equipment and personnel under dayrate contracts revenues related 
mobilization are deferred and recognized over the period which contracted services are performed using the 
straight line method incremental costs incurred directly for mobilization equipment and personnel the 
contracted site which typically consist materials supplies and transit costs also are deferred and recognized 
using the same straight line method our policy amortize the revenues and costs related mobilization 
straight line basis over the estimated contract service period consistent with the general pace activity level 
services being provided and dayrates being earned over the contract period mobilization costs move vessels 
when contract does not exist are expensed incurred 
lump sum contracts revenue significant lump sum contracts recognized under the percentage ofcompletion method based the ratio costs incurred total estimated costs completion determining 
whether contract should accounted for using the percentage completion method consider whether 
the customer provides specifications for the provision services 
can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs 
the contract includes provisions for enforceable rights regarding the goods services provided 
consideration received and the manner and terms payment 
the customer can expected satisfy its obligations under the contract and 
can expected perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage completion method recognize estimated contract revenue based costs 
incurred date percentage total estimated costs changes the expected cost materials and labor 
productivity scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs additionally weather and other external 
factors outside our control may affect the progress and estimated cost project completion and therefore 
the timing revenue recognition routinely review estimates related our contracts and reflect revisions 
profitability earnings current basis current estimate total contract cost indicates ultimate loss 
contract recognize the projected loss full when first determined recognize additional contract 
revenue related claims when the claim probable and legally enforceable

fair value measurements 
fair value defined the price that would received sell asset paid transfer liability 
orderly transaction between market participants the measurement date the fair value accounting rules establish 
three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used measuring fair value follows 
level observable inputs such quoted prices active markets 
level inputs other than the quoted prices active markets that are observable either directly 
indirectly and 
level unobservable inputs for which there little market data which require the reporting entity 
develop its own assumptions 
assets and liabilities measured fair value are based one more three valuation approaches
