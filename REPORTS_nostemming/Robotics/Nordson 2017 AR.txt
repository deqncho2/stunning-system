requires management make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts assets

used prepare financial statements base our estimates historical experience and assumptions believed 
reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
used management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical our results 
operations financial position are discussed below regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed 
with the audit committee the board directors 
revenue recognition most our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence 
arrangement exists the sales price fixed determinable collectibility reasonably assured and title and 
risk loss have passed the customer certain arrangements may include installation installation supervision

accounting the amounts assigned the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed connection with 
acquisitions are based estimated fair values the date the acquisition with the remainder any 
recorded goodwill the fair values are determined management taking into consideration information 
supplied the management the acquired entities and other relevant information such information typically 
includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts which management reviews and considers its 
estimates fair values the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired 
assets discounted present value the determination fair values requires significant judgment 
management particularly with respect the value identifiable intangible assets this judgment could result 
either higher lower value assigned amortizable depreciable assets the impact could result either 
higher lower amortization and depreciation expense 
goodwill goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value tangible and identifiable intangible

amount which the carrying value the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the reporting unit calculated 
the quantitative analysis described below did not record any goodwill impairment charges use 
independent valuation specialist assist with refining our assumptions and methods used determine fair values 
using these methods step one the discounted cash flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth operating 
margin and working capital turnover that are based management strategic plans tempered performance 
trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ published formula 
known the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value perpetual cash flows 
beyond the last projected period assuming constant weighted average cost capital wacc methodology 
and growth rate for each reporting unit sensitivity analysis performed vary the discount and terminal growth 
rates order provide range reasonableness for detecting impairment 
discount rates are developed using wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required 
rate return for equity and debt capital based observed market return data and company specific risk factors 
for the discount rates used ranged from percent percent depending upon the reporting unit size 
end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate return for the discounted cash flow 
method was percent the same the calculated wacc for total nordson the application the guideline 
public company method fair value determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity 
the comparable company guideline group determined based relative similarities each reporting unit since 
exact correlations are not available indication fair value for each reporting unit based the placement 
each reporting unit within range multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group 
valuation multiples are derived dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into 
total invested capital which the sum traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are 
applied against the revenue and ebitda each reporting unit while the implied indications fair value 
using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method the 
income approach includes management thoughtful projections and insights what the reporting units will 
accomplish the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value each reporting unit blend

our plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using single weighted average discount 
rate derived from the yield curve used measure the benefit obligation the beginning the period beginning 
used spot rate approach applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve the relevant 
projected cash flows the estimation the service and interest components benefit cost resulting more 
precise measurement this change did not affect the measurement total benefit obligations the change was

pension and postretirement expenses are expected approximately higher than 
income taxes income taxes are estimated based income for financial reporting purposes deferred income 
taxes reflect the net tax effect temporary differences between the carrying amounts assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes valuation 
allowances provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets based available evidence more 
likely than not that some portion all the deferred tax assets will not realized 
management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable 
carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the event were determine 
that would able realize the deferred tax assets the future excess the net recorded amount 
including the valuation allowance adjustment the valuation allowance would increase income the 
period such determination was made conversely should determine that would not able realize all

further each interim reporting period estimate effective income tax rate that expected 
applicable for the full year significant judgment involved regarding the application global income tax laws 
and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix income additionally interpretation tax laws
