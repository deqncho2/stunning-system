robo advice set revolutionise yes but not the way you thought 
interviewed incumbents with assets under management plus key 
start ups and venture capital funds europe the asia australia far 
robo advice offerings are limited only few steps the financial advisory 
process and rarely entail complete replacement the human financial advisor 
believe the most successful examples combine the two the cyborg model 
facilitator not disruptor incumbents look best placed win new entrants 
aim gain share and disrupt with accessible low cost financial advice service 
however don think start ups are the winner here the cost customer 
acquisition and the importance brand make the economics tough for 
incumbents robo advice can streamline costs improve productivity and address 
the untapped mass affluent markets partnering the technology successful 
start with incumbent captive network clients looks like win win 
solution that expect many incumbents pursue 
our framework suggests aum could reach years revenues 
for grab though early days competition intensifying almost all companies 
under coverage are involved deals with robo start ups assuming robo can 
take share financial assets for households with less than 
investable assets implies aum bull case with tailwinds 
from regulation and increased banking digitalization this could 
revenue risks could offset cost savings see risks that robo advice 
could accelerate the growth passives pressuring manufacturing fees 
increase transparency and competition lowering fees for advice and iii lead 
cannibalisation from customers switching cheaper services the net impact 
may less harsh than feared for nimble players able use robo streamline 
costs especially administrative functions estimate the opportunity for 
established advisors could lower the cost base 
who looks best positioned today while still early days structurally 
incumbents that think could potentially compete aggressively and 
successfully this area include standard life ubs and hargreaves europe

passives which further impacts manufacturing fees for incumbents existing clients 
could choose trade down service for lower price and iii greater transparency

but there opportunity for nimble firms the risks highlighted should push fas 
financial advisors deliver value for the fee with high touch service and broad 
product set this basis think the top end private banks are less likely 
disrupted indeed they could key winners robo advice platform would allow 
them enter the mass market and build nursery clients whom they could 
potentially upsell premium service ubs smartwealth the save costs

traditional financial advisory service includes many steps show simplified 
outline exhibit the process typically entails thorough assessment customer 
assets and liabilities future commitments family employment situation savings and 
retirement goals and before suggesting suitable asset allocation that generally 
also considers tax optimisation 
our view the robo advisers currently available the market not provide the full 
range steps but are limited client onboarding investment allocation and 
rebalancing exhibit below shows the advice process flow highlighting the areas where 
robos have focused their offering far

although there are different types robo advisers outline some their common 
features below our work suggests they share one clear overarching principal that

they wish invest such the most common robo products are those with tax 
advantages for example saving wrappers such isas the individual saving

the online channel against traditional face face advisory customers fill 
questionnaire ranging from few many questions and are provided with 
investment profile and suggested portfolio 
products robo advisers offer asset allocation products suitable for generic 
investment purposes typically the ultimate goal sell discretionary mandate 
client there are important nuances around the distinction between advice and 
guidance more this the section regulation provides tailwind with the result 
that some companies spoke with view robo advice tool improve and 
customize client interaction rather than fully fledged advisory service full financial 
planning with entire analysis the household balance sheet not generally

morningstar the united states and our conversations suggest 
probably towards the upper end this range for balance wealthfront 
average account and assuming fee would take years recover the cost 
acquisition which time the client might have switched powerful brand with 
broad pre existing network has better chance lowering the cost acquisition 
think this helps explain the very strong performance schwab and vanguard for

acquisition towards the bottom the range which would make the 
proposition more viable what the break even point although our conversations 
suggest less than aum required are not aware that any the start ups

regulation across the world regulators have been open innovative solutions put 
forward fintech start ups with the ultimate goal lowering costs for end users 
especially context driven lower returns notable example the regulatory 
sandbox the which allows businesses test innovate products services business 
models and delivery mechanisms live environment automating the investment 
process makes easier oversee and track while cognitive biases that typically 
characterize human advisors are better limited there rigid framework place 
however the lengthy and close relationship incumbents with the regulator and the 
importance customer suitability learned the hard way via misselling court cases for 
example arguably mean the bigger brokers banks are better placed make the robo 
tool mainstream our view for example our conversations with one the major 
private banks switzerland suggest that robo could help monitoring financial 
advisor interaction and ensuring compliance with the different national rules especially 
post mifid world 
the robo direct consumer model evolving into the cyborg model 
the need for human touch has led most robo advisors introduce call centers chat 
services reassure the customer the event she may need further clarification 
asset allocation portfolio performance and while the regulatory angle can part 
addressed close dialogue with the regulator and tests such those the 
regulatory sandbox for the fca the cost acquisition remains the achilles heel 
the model this has led evolution towards the model whereby 
fintech start ups provide advisors with ready made digital platforms for their clients 
successful examples here are vanguard and schwab model that the higher fee 
traditional advisors are now seeking replicate 
somewhat less common model whereby the robo advisor does not enter into 
contact with end user any stage this effectively platform only which sold 
leased third party company 
exhibit see more advantages cyborg model the likely winner 
morgan stanley research 
hnwi and uhnwi will continue need high level human advice 
their current format robo advisors aim assess client goal with respect the 
specific amount assets invested the platform regardless his her overall 
financial situation therefore see the most simplified versions robo adviceas 
limited high net worth and ultra high net worth clients are still likely need human 
advisor for several reasons 
current robo advisors don take into account the full balance sheet picture for 
example don know any robo advisor incorporating real estate considerations 
into asset allocation wealthfront trying evaluate the house price and rental 
dynamics the neighborhood their client lives however this data dependent and 
often the data not available all the sample tests have tried were never 
asked about liabilities mortgages family situation inheritance and children educational 
aspirations for example 
could this overcome potentially the next generation robo advisors for example 
miplan finametrica while some our interviews suggest players are planning roll 
out such offering involving much longer questionnaire with average time 
complete minutes versus the current minutes for the average robo advisor 
believe this raises barriers adoption given the balance struck between being 
commercial and being comprehensive the more successful companies are wary 
launching long fully fledged questionnaire this may deter customers from signing 
the most successful platforms combine basic risk assessment with quick time 
product 
robo advisor includes illiquid asset classes luxury items for example art 
yachts real estate prime holiday locations doing simply not viable this 
stage believe because transparent frequent information not available the 
reasons for investing assets such art luxury goods are not always measurable 
the same way measure risk and return the stock market iii investment 
illiquids requires different skills and regular rebalancing tax loss harvesting may not 
possible daily market values are not available for infrastructure private equity 
venture capital investments 
could this overcome think the chances that robo only advisor could take care 
more sophisticated requirements hnw and uhnwi are remote 
what winning model could look like 
how could robo advice change the financial advisory space 
robo advice has pledged democratize the investment process targeting 
traditionally underserved part the market below investable assets however 
the low pricing high tech interface proposition also appeals the mass affluent 
with the result that most the banks broker dealers and wealth management 
firms cover are now making moves into this space even some asset management 
companies traditionally engaged product manufacture only are now considering 
whether robo advice could good tool enhance distribution and reach the end

distinction current robo offerings that they typically target clients who have 
already decided they would like invest deliver lower price point typically roboadvisors have preference for portfolio construction via etfs even though some robos

likely drive additional growth etfs passives given global differences distribution

what are the biggest risks 
think cannibalization the existing offering arguably presents the biggest 
threat for example schwab success date has been predicated moving existing 
clients the new platform for incumbents focusing high end clients such 
ubs and credit suisse this arguably presents less risk however think banks 
and fas targeting the mass affluent could see some compression margins for banks 
one notable exception the where the retail distribution review has lowered 
economic incentives for banks target mass market affluent consumers leading some 
banks withdraw from this demographic completely hsbc lloyds rbs and 
santander theory robo low cost way for these firms move back into this

cerulli associates morningstar company data morgan stanley research estimates anecdotal evidence from our conversations europe where banks 
control the distribution channel and the market more opaque please note the above does not include any upfront exit fees 
our view financial advisors who are able charge premium prices manage assets not 
only behalf individuals but also for small businesses endowments and family 
offices providing not just advice but typically other value add services such loans 
unique collateral trusts setting charitable funds addition concierge services 
notary going closings behalf clients insurance paperwork the extent 
advisors differentiate themselves with these services they are better placed defend 
their gross margins for this reason think those servicing high net worth ultra high 
net worth are less likely disrupted 
for mass market mass affluent retail these additional services are less likely 
utilised and such the costs arguably are greater consideration with our research 
suggesting fees for advice are often above this segment could come under 
greater pressure and appears less defendable 
the manufacturing asset management side think increased usage robo advice 
could lead more fee pressure portfolio construction via etfs gains more traction 
the face cannibalization risk the solution ignore this offering altogether 
don think the most advanced companies have interviewed are aware the 
threat but prefer risk cannibalizing revenues rather than waiting for competitors 
new entrants eat their lunch 
what unlikely change 
don think robo advice will affect the way uhnwi are serviced think margins for 
these clients are already materially lower the higher aum allows for pricing 
discount given the significantly tailored service these clients receive including lombard 
lending leverage their investments see less incentive for this segment 
substitute wealth management for less tailored and lower cost offering think 
however that the use smart digital tools key streamline back office processes 
reporting aml kyc and most important improve the client proposition for 
example applying artificial intelligence order recognize customer patterns 
interests specific research reports cash flow analysis etc this leaves open the 
prospect that lower costs would over time have passed back customers 
are barriers entry high 
outside regulatory barriers what products can distributed retail and what 
fashion see challenges more surmountable that said the right infrastructure 
support growth requires material investment for example betterment has already 
raised years while bringing custody house being able offer fractional 
shares that investment can fully diversified are not common features 
fresh robo start ups but tend developed later the unit economics the 
models are proven successful and more equity raised 
glimpse into the future fully integrated model 
argue above robo advice start ups are unlikely lead wholesale disruption 
the financial advisory space rather expect collaboration merger between techsavvy lean robos and incumbents that are well positioned from brand and network 
standpoint this may lead some erosion gross margin partially compensated 
cost savings more this framing the opportunity 
longer term envisage big data artificial intelligence led full spectrum offering 
combination applications such mint app available the that helps clients 
create budgets aggregating bills and money together basic retail banking and 
wealth management services such service would use data customer transactions 
spending habits salary inputs employment situation and family status help take 
sustainable debt target savings goals that would allow the desired life style allocate 
investments sensible way and help with retirement and estate planning world 
where artificial intelligence applied financial advice customer could get daily 
weekly reminders via their smartphone smartwatch about their savings budget 
say potentially additional cash available for investment the role financial advisor 
something similar airplane pilot with his her understanding client needs 
better enabled technology she would have more time focus higher end 
more profitable clients

the first point think about the market size households 
below financial assets estimate base case 
aum fee this translates revenue 
opportunity however this likely overestimate the 
addressable market for several reasons for example part this 
aum probably already invested via traditional advice while the 
ability this cohort absorb losses lower than that hnw 
uhnw clients and thus the propensity invest may lower 
for this reason alongside our belief that current robo advice offerings are targeting 
more the mass market affluent consumer focus what view the 
immediately addressable market defined those clients with less than 
financial assets looking this opportunity currently see market 
aum the and europe 
the european side estimate total addressable market for households with less 
than for the see the advice gap market for the 
euro area given most countries retrocessions are still possible advice gap per 
doesn exist yet except for the netherlands where retrocessions have been banned 
overall using data from the household finance and consumption survey recently 
published see financial wealth the hands households with net 
financial wealth less for switzerland lack granular data similar 
that produced the office national statistics ons the and the ecb

expect the pressure mild the short term our conversations with key players 
this space suggest that some cannibalization bound happen ultimately however 
cost savings should able offset least part 
think high end private banks for example ubs and credit suisse are the least likely 
disrupted they offer premium service including for example lombard lending 
inheritance wealth preservation through generation charity illiquid investing and 
which are harder replicate robo advisors 
looking the average revenue margin for the pure play private banks switzerland 
and for those banks under our coverage where disclosure available estimate 
average revenue margins are this figure includes nii from lombard and ancillary 
lending thus probably overstates the underlying advice element this price point which 
includes other services appears broadly line with what being offered roboadvisers however this heavily skewed the fact that typical clients have higher 
aum and hence are able negotiate discount for example ubs uhnwi 
individuals with investable assets least generated revenue margin 
for this suggests the average revenue margin for other clients was 
and only total aum was with clients with less than investable 
assets this implies that the average gross margin for client with

investment trends financial advisers july shows planners 
believe robo advice not threat the industry 
mass market the australians who stand benefit from better financial 
advice and active engagement their retirement savings the cost serve and 
compliance burden makes the economics more challenging this segment 
how the market evolving 
first movers australia stockspot that are seeking replicate models like 
wealthfront and betterment have some traction but the market size and structure 
demands make the channel tough and demands deep and patient capital given the 
relatively low barriers entry dozens start ups clover six park plenty

thus far most incumbents have been quietly exploring the potential opportunity

platform within the self direct discretionary savings segment amp more actively

two major challenges 
highlight two major challenges the development the robo advice market the 
australian market 
challenge compulsory mysuper disengaged customers and low cost auto 
rebalancing lifestage funds australian compulsory retirement savings means every 
working australian contributes their wages superannuation pension 
account consequence most australians are aware they are actively saving but 
given the longer term nature and lack access these savings are generally 
disengaged until balances become meaningful consequence regulation has 
evolved for this segment generally mass market protect lower balance disengaged 
customers most these assets fall into low cost mysuper offer for around and many have lifestage auto rebalance capabilities set the funds trustees 
various digital tools financial health checks and calculators seeking enhance 
client experience and drive engagement already exist such within the workplace 
super segment core the robo advice opportunity fully integrated digital advice 
front end does not necessarily add meaningfully the existing value proposition and 
drive engagement however not having robo advice capability risks losing clients 
competitor new entrant most recognise low cost robo event driven advice solutions 
marriage buying house kids illness etc are necessary retaining clients from cradle 
grave and improve the economics servicing this segment 
challenge incumbents likely give robo advice away for free given the existing 
scale incumbents and the market dynamics detailed above expect large 
established brands give robo advice away for free part the existing offer 
members 
winners and losers 
while early days the evolution robo advice similar the introduction 
internet banking australian wealth managers super retirement investment financial 
planning will likely benefit from embedding robo advice into their existing models

incumbents start ups seeking build retail brand will likely struggle without deep

south korea 
robo advisor business set but time needed 
robo advisor asset management has been around since the early part this decade 
but the size the robo advisor market only around compared with the 
domestic asset management market the interest level artificial 
intelligence and robo advisory has surged after alphago beat top ranked players 
including korea sedol lee furthermore the area online mobile 
transactions and financial services south korea probably one the most advanced 
nations the world and the government has been pushing the fintech agenda 
proactively since the current fsc head took office two years ago addition internetonly banks and funding solutions lending crowd funding robo advisor has 
also been key initiative 
until now there have been offerings advisory type robo advisor funds and not 
discretionary type with kiwoom launching advisory type public offering rok 
global robo advisor fund early december 
while there are few robo advisor products available the market believe the 
proliferation robo advisor funds should come about once the first testbed process 
complete and the robo advisor algorithms from the first testbed become available 
the public investment products the robo advisor service remains relatively unknown 
most people survey carried out week period nov the korea financial 
investor protection foundation found that only respondents understood the 
robo advisor concept well while more than did not know what robo advisor 
furthermore there are more people who are unsure investing with robo advisors 
this time and hence more time likely needed for robo advisors gain solid 
ground

government pushing robo adviser initiative completion first testbed should the 
spark 
the robo adviser initiative the fsc really picked steam from april when the 
fsc held robo adviser discussion panel and the first robo adviser fund was launched 
kiwoom investment and asset management the robo adviser investment product 
has been operated very limited basis handful brokers and hence has not 
proliferated part owing low public awareness the service 
fsc launches official testbed august jump start robo advisory business 
order overcome concerns raised the trustworthiness robo advisers and 
stability operations the fsc announced the launch robo adviser testbed 
august the objective the first testbed launch was evaluate robo adviser 
algorithms order accumulate information needed set rules and also 
provide objective data the public the performance robo advisers once the first 
testbed completed the market should have more information robo advisers and 
financial companies should able sell robo advice services 
the testbed process was launched september receiving applications 
from robo adviser algorithm designers the evaluation the robo advisers will 
carried out committee made private sector experts the testing period 
has been set for months and hence evaluation results should confirmed some 
time march april 
initially robo adviser algorithms from diverse range companies applied for 
the first testbed participation level was high with banks brokers asset managers 
and robo adviser specialists and consortiums also applying for the testbed date 
two have dropped out leaving algorithms currently undergoing evaluation with 
the interim performance available online ratestbed 
fsc plans launch the second testbed and going forward aims have 
testbeds year 
the completion the first testbed could important inflection point and the 
performance results should also key factor this would further legitimize roboadviser algorithms viable alternative investment facilities the first testbed 
expected completed march and expect the best performing roboadviser algorithms and also those that are well supported managed incumbent 
major financial institutions lead the charge 
how might robo advice change investment patterns 
given korea rapidly aging demographics and expected prolonged low interest rate 
environment believe the asset management market likely gain 
importance for financial institutions how robo advisers will fit into the changing market 
remains seen but the government objective encouraging their development 
bridge the gap financial advisory services which have generally been confined 
affluent individuals furthermore there investor demand for more diversity asset 
management products and also lower costs 
korea asset management market continues grow with total fund assets under 
management aum reaching september and net assets 
end however are seeing change the flow money within 
the fund industry aum has been decreasing for equity type funds while special 
asset real estate and bond type funds have been showing strong aum growth 
another interesting trend the decline public offering mutual funds private 
mutual funds together with the increasing aum passive funds active funds

expect the fund market continue grow and the robo adviser market 
attracting increased attention investors continue look for better alternatives 
both performance and cost basis for the robo adviser market grow believe 
there are few key prerequisites 
the first regulatory testbed results come out showing positive returns with risks 
under control favorable news flow robo advisor performance would increase 
market interest and make more approachable for retail investors 
transparency performance and risks potential investors including those will 
limited financial experience this would require regular monitoring and evaluation 
robo advisors developers and regulators 
advisory fees and fund investment criteria are more affordable for the broader 
public and not only the affluent and institutional investors this would hinge 
how regulations and rules are set less human involvement would mean 
lower costs seems that the fee structure under consideration minimize 
upfront fees and charge fee the returns success fee 
distribution needs possible through relatively low cost channels including 
online rather than just offline channels this stage investment 
recommendations can only made through offline channels for discretionarytype robo advisor funds and likely take time for regulators allow 
discretionary type robo advisor funds sold through online channels 
exhibit shows market projection for the robo advisor business made kisti korea 
institute science and technology information which estimates the market size for 
robo advisor funds will reach around and nearly 
assuming that the above prerequisites are mostly met believe robo advisors should 
gain market interest but shown the recent launch isa individual savings 
accounts likely need time gain traction especially among retail investors 
consumers get acclimated new products 
exhibit korean robo advisor growth forecast 
source kisti transparent market research tmr morgan stanley research 
who will benefit from growth the robo adviser market 
too early predict the winners with any certainty but incumbents seem better 
positioned while the performance individual robo adviser funds will key factor 
also need see the results the testing period and what the ongoing performance 
would another important element distribution and the early stages what 
channels are used market and sell robo adviser funds will important 
based our analysis the performance the robo adviser algorithms using the 
official ratestbed site find that the algorithms sole robo adviser 
developers show higher returns average and also the top returns this does not 
mean that consortium based algorithms not have strong performers number 
these are showing good returns this stage 
think consortium based algorithms are more likely focus selling their own 
products assuming performance levels are satisfactory however robo adviser 
algorithms showing strong performance will probably sought after financial 
institutions both distributors and investors meaning risk return dynamics 
probably trumps all else the end the day hence believe open 
architecture should favored over closed one financial companies possess 
strong portfolio 
another interesting element the imminent launch internet banks 
kakaobank and bank which will online mobile platform only banks both 
appear have plans sell investment products 
banks positioning for robo advisers are pushing into this area response investor 
demand for more diversity product and frontline staff are better positioned sell 
less complicated products with the exception staff working the private banking 
side the level expertise providing investment advice not particularly high below 
are some examples key developments regarding robo advisers banks under our 
coverage among the banks think sfg and kfg are positioned spearhead the roboadviser market with each having its inherent strengths 
shinhan sfg has participated the first testbed together with robo adviser 
developer december and also was recently the first launch mobile based 
advisory type robo adviser services sfg has been ahead its peers the wealth 
management business taking the initiative focusing affluent retail customers 
providing both house shinhan bnp and external products and setting 
integrated branches securities bank sfg very well placed the more 
affluent districts seoul and has well trained staff follow through with this 
effort 
financial kfg also participating the first testbed together with developer 
called quarterback kfg has strength the retail mass market and also recently 
made inroads into the affluent retail market with the recent acquisition and full 
privatization securities former hyundai securities which had relative 
strengths the retail brokerage side kfg should have advantage over many 
the other banks add kfg key member the kakaobank internet bank

development still very early stage 
the development robo advice still the very early stages china with formal 
regulations and exact aum data while online sales financial products are quite 
common banks nonbanks and internet finance companies china and some firms 
claim that they offer robo advisory services believe most such services are still 
form regular online wealth management product sales with true robo advisory 
services still relatively scarce believe there are three obstacles for the development 
robo advisory services china 
there proper risk curve yet lower risk may not mean lower returns and vice 
versa 
given relatively less efficient capital markets many proactively managed products 
can still offer higher returns and hence are able command premium fee structure 
there are still not enough low cost financial instruments allow robo advisory 
services achieve the desired asset allocation and adjustments cost efficient way 
unlike peers the early movers china mainly use mutual funds the aum etfs 
very small compared the aum mutual funds some firms offer 
robo advisory services mutual fund selection but these not yet cover the full 
product spectrum 
one example robo adviser china 
december china merchants bank became the first bank china launch 
robo advisory services cmb has built leading retail franchise and has retail 
financial assets which are wealth management assets cmb wants use 
robo advice better meet the increasing financial demands individuals and maintain 
its market share versus peers and other fintech companies 
customer acquisition cmb can leverage its already large user base monthly active 
users reached and mobile banking contributed the total number 
transaction october from year earlier 
process the robo adviser embedded the cmb mobile app customers fill 
questionnaire and then cmb can offer the suggested portfolio based the preferred 
investment horizon and risk appetite currently customers can choose from types 
investment horizon and types risk appetite implying that cmb has total 
portfolios for all customers 
instruments the robo adviser offering almost all mutual funds which cover both 
domestic and foreign equities bonds and commodities mutual funds tend more 
standardized and transparent than private funds and have lower investment thresholds 
and higher liquidity than trust and broker asset management plans 
fees fees are higher than for mutual funds cmb offers value added service 
advice new portfolios when the market changes 
however given online and mobile financial product distribution channels are relatively 
well developed already see significant potential robo advisory services the long 
run once the risk curve and transaction cost the underlying financial products 
become more efficient 
japan 
robot adviser services expand from late major financial institutions 
also poised for market entry 
japanese robot adviser services should enter the expansion phase from late large 
financial institutions including banks and brokers started moving into robot adviser 
services japan but see potential for market penetration increase 
from late onwards drivers include structural factors such population aging 
with japan moving towards becoming super gray society well support from 
government financial policy promoting the shift from savings asset formation 
fiduciary duties involved product development sales and changes marketing 
strategy financial institutions efficiently capture the mass affluent market and 
widen the customer base megabanks and other large financial institutions have only 
just begun delving into fintech whole and not think robot adviser services 
have yet entered phase providing any meaningful earnings impact near term 
however over the medium term see potential for robot adviser services reach 
wider range customer groups new services are rolled out via collaboration 
with start companies and major companies sparking acceleration aum 
growth 
population trends are altering the individual asset management landscape over third 
japan total population will years older around according 
estimates the ministry internal affairs and communications statistics bureau this 
makes difficult maintain pension system based intergenerational support and 
thus increases the need for self funded retirement savings mentioned the 
financial services agency financial report sep the government and regulators 
aim promote shift from savings investment with respect japan private sector 
financial assets which are currently skewed toward cash and savings deposits they are 
attempting drive major changes the asset management environment facing 
individuals through systemic and tax system measures including the amendments 
the defined contribution pension act and expansion the nisa program roboadvisory services make possible efficient widening the customer base into the 
mass market they are also promising destination for retirement and other funds 
unlocked the mass retirement baby boomers and assets transferred between 
generations the main target market robot advisory business likely those 
their rather than wealthy customers but the existing customer base age 
groups around the retirement stage presents another potential target market 
types robot adviser and key players japan 
this stage can categorize services leveraging robot advisers into two types 
discretionary management assessment application management are completed online 
advisory type provides recommendations portfolio allocations and investment 
trusts but the actual management left clients exhibit shows start 
companies have led the move providing discretionary management type services 
while major financial institutions are increasingly offering advisory type services 
fintech start firms appear taking the lead the robot adviser space japan 
but major brokerage firms and banks are starting enter the field too for example 
mizuho bank smart folio offers free service that introduces clients optimal 
investment trusts the investable assets are low cost index funds rather than etfs given 
its partnership with blackrock the short term see limited earnings contribution 
mizuho retail business but amid strategies bolster retail products such 
investment trusts and insurance will monitor developments ahead see exhibit 
for details 
benefits and challenges 
the biggest benefit for users that they can receive uniform investment management 
services after obtaining neutral investment management advice even they not have 
investment management experience addition they can benefit from low costs 
utilizing the newest technology commissions for robot advisers are set lower rate 
than discretionary investment contracts wrap funds that mainly target high net worth 
individuals the mass affluent commissions trust fee furthermore users can 
invest etfs listed markets around the globe 
meanwhile risk the spread robot adviser services japan that individual 
financial assets are skewed heavily toward cash and savings deposits and the risk 
tolerance those asset classes unlikely rise over night even with the introduction 
nirp japan and the further decline already low interest rates savings there 
has been major change the tendency toward savings efforts increase product 
diversity and make use robot advisory services under low interest rate environment 
will also needed relevant example the low diversity the etf market 
discretionary management type robot adviser products japan like those overseas 
consist large part etfs but these are generally overseas etfs rather than etfs 
listed japan and account balances can also dollar denominated giving rise 
risk theo the reason given for the use overseas etfs services like theo 
that the small number domestic etfs does not allow for adequate international 
diversification investments the number etfs listed jpx markets rising year 
after year but still pales comparison with europe and the and the level 
diversity not high with many linked the nikkei stock average topix further 
although fees are currently lower than those wrap accounts they are not 
particularly low comparison with fees similar services available overseas greater 
diversity asset classes expansion etf market scale and reductions 
transaction costs are likely crucial the advancement the robo advisory

majority have had encouraging conversations with the regulator and are comfortable 
that their robo offering compliant will not challenged 
however the lengthy and close relationship incumbents with the regulator and the 
importance customer suitability learned the hard way via misselling court cases 
arguably mean bigger brokers banks are better placed make the robo tool 
mainstream 
believe the department labor fiduciary rule set take effect april 
will serve accelerant for robo advice the firms shift clients away from 
full service brokerage and into fee based advisory accounts the dol rule will require 
those who provide retirement advice act the best interest their clients and 
mandate fiduciary duty while such fiduciary standard already applies 
plans and fee based advisory plans there such requirement today brokerage ira 
accounts the new rule levels commission charges prohibits financial advisers from 
receiving payments that create conflicts interest and mandates specific disclosures 
before company can provide retirement and investment advice relating 
retirement accounts envision one the main impacts from the implementation 
the dol rule that firms begin move clients from full service brokerage accounts 
fee based advisory structures becomes challenging service clients full service 
brokerage relationship that compensated with commission revenue 
this shift from commission based accounts fee based advisory helps drives need 
for low cost advice specifically digital advice such robo advisers the regulatory 
burden dol will require firms have increased transparency fees and advice 
further opening the door for robo advisers firms look towards digital options that 
offer streamlined guidance clear price wide array clients from hnw 
mass market see digital advice expanding the wake dol with the next wave 
innovation going beyond today asset allocation and etf focused robo advisers 
deliver broad and personalized offerings all clients these highly customized 
portfolios could begin reshape the financial advisers value proposition and allow 
firms compliant with regulatory guidelines while also tapping into new customer 
base for more information please see our brokers initiation the trillion 
convergence wealth management initiating brokers overweight schw 
while the dol fiduciary rule may put hold changed repealed under trump 
administration this would not change the direction travel toward lower fee 
passive index products and fee based advisory and fiduciary services all tailwinds for 
robo advice services for more detail see our post election note tax reform 
deregulation approaching what the impact 
believe recent initiatives the fca famr advice unit aimed reducing the 
advice gap the market will incentivize the growth automated advice services with 
the advice unit first intake firms and second intake come 
think the automated financial advice landscape the could change materially the 
next couple years 
the fca has been arguing for some time that functioning retail investment market 
needs different delivery mechanisms order fully effective for broad range 
potential investors specifically the fca recognises that there are some households 
that having met their priority needs reduce debt and have enough emergency cash 
have some disposable income cash invest and would like specific simplified advice 
rather than holistic financial planning 
exhibit number advisers biggest decline banks building societies 
source apfa the financial adviser market edition 
within this context the retail distribution review introduced new rules the financial 
advisory market the april the objective was raise the standards the 
industry improve transparency while removing kickbacks for advisors for selling 
products consequence advisers have left the market the total 
mostly employed banks and building societies the result however has been that 
advice gap has been created the market the proportion firms refusing advice 
for portfolio lower than has more than doubled from 
the financial advice market review march has recommended making the 
regulatory environment clearer order enable financial advisory companies 
provide guidance streamlined advice without the risk incurring liabilities for not 
having carried out the full suitability checks required full advice consequence 
famr financial advice working group has been created composed fca members 
and practitioners with the purpose developing guide the top ten ways support 
employees financial health and devise strategy for rolling this out publish shortlist 
potential new terms describe guidance and advice design some rules thumb 
and nudges with the aim increasing consumer engagement these objectives should 
delivered early the second point the working group has already 
published consultation the implementation guidance versus advice 
exhibit who gets advice the 
think this may lead clearer operating environment for 
firms with lower risks being sued for not providing suitable 
advice moreover think that the creation the advice unit 
june part project innovate providing regulatory 
feedback firms developing automated models that seek 
deliver lower cost advice customers further step that 
shows the regulator intention help new initiatives order 
address the advice gap the market interesting note that 
out the firms the first intake are established financial 
services providers wanting bring automated advice the 
market scale 
source fundscape estimates 
europe 
from january ban inducements for independent advice and discretionary 
investment advice and enhanced transparency fees will come into effect europe 
thanks mifid this should make consumers more aware the price advisory 
services they consume however the fact that the vertically integrated value chains 
most european banks may not addressed they wouldn qualify independent 
could mean there little change the current structure mifid transposed into 
national law the members states july the landscape will become clearer 
robo advice specifically believe continental europe behind the the esas 
eba eiopa and esma have published couple papers the past year discussing 
the pros and cons automation financial advice however are not aware any 
proactive engagement the regulator along the lines the advice unit the 
fca also the reports concluded that given the nascent stage the industry 
immediate regulatory supervisory action currently required next steps mentioned 
are just regular monitoring the situation
