unit fair value using combination the discounted cash flow method the income approach and the 
guideline public company method the market approach and compare the result against the reporting unit 
carrying value net assets the carrying value reporting unit exceeds its fair value then second step 
performed determine goodwill impaired use independent valuation specialist assist with refining 
our assumptions and methods used determine fair values using these methods step one the discounted cash 
flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based 
general management strategic plans tempered performance trends and reasonable expectations about those 
trends terminal value calculations employ published formula known the gordon growth model method 
that essentially captures the present value perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming 
constant weighted average cost capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit 
sensitivity analysis performed vary the discount and terminal growth rates order provide range 
reasonableness for detecting impairment 
discount rates are developed using wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required 
rate return for equity and debt capital based observed market return data and company specific risk factors 
for the discount rates used ranged from percent percent depending upon the reporting unit size 
end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate return for the discounted cash flow 
method was percent the same the calculated wacc for total nordson the application the guideline 
public company method fair value determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity 
the comparable company guideline group determined based relative similarities each reporting unit since 
exact correlations are not available indication fair value for each reporting unit based the placement 
each reporting unit within range multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group 
valuation multiples are derived dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into 
total invested capital which the sum traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are 
applied against the revenue and ebitda each reporting unit while the implied indications fair value 
using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method the 
income approach includes management thoughtful projections and insights what the reporting units will 
accomplish the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value each reporting unit blend

the control premium was percent the test date august and slight discount the market

the fourth quarter adopted change the method used estimate the service and interest cost 
components net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 
historically for the vast majority our plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using 
single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used measure the benefit obligation the 
beginning the period beginning will use spot rate approach applying the specific spot rates 
along the yield curve the relevant projected cash flows the estimation the service and interest components 
benefit cost resulting more precise measurement this change does not affect the measurement total 
benefit obligations the change will accounted for change estimate that inseparable from change 
accounting principle and accordingly will accounted for prospectively starting the reductions 
service and interest costs for associated with this change are expected and respectively 
pension and postretirement expenses are expected approximately lower than primarily 
due the adoption the spot rate approach noted above 
income taxes income taxes are estimated based income for financial reporting purposes deferred income 
taxes reflect the net tax effect temporary differences between the carrying amounts assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes valuation 
allowances provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets based available evidence more 
likely than not that some portion all the deferred tax assets will not realized 
management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable 
carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the event were determine 
that would able realize the deferred tax assets the future excess the net recorded amount 
including the valuation allowance adjustment the valuation allowance would increase income the
