business strategy 
our goal fundamentally improve surgery and maximize the number patients who can derive the benefits mis through the use computeraided robotic technologies our objective create value for patients surgeons and hospitals summarized below 
patient value believe that the value surgical procedure patient can defined patient value procedure efficacy invasiveness 
define procedure efficacy measure the success the surgery resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness how disruptive and 
painful the treatment itself when the patient value vinci procedure deemed higher than alternate treatment options patients may seek 
out surgeons and hospitals that offer that specific vinci procedure potentially resulting local market share shift for the specific treatment 
vinci procedure adoption occurs procedure procedure and driven the relative patient value and total treatment costs vinci procedures 
compared alternative treatment options for the same disease state believe most patients will place higher value procedures that are not 
only more efficacious but also less invasive than alternative treatments our goal provide products surgeons who turn provide patients 
with procedure options that are both highly effective and less invasive than other surgical options 
surgeon value train surgeons the use our vinci surgical system and assist them building their practices their delivery high 
patient value provide ergonomic platform for surgeons perform their procedures seek provide surgeons with reliable and easy use 
products 
hospital value assist hospitals building value offering patient value using vinci products thereby increasing surgical revenue and 
reducing costs through lower complication rates and reduced length patient stay believe vinci surgery cost effective approach 
many surgeries compared alternative treatment options recognized many published studies 
clinical applications 
are the beneficiaries productive collaborations with leading surgeons exploring and developing new techniques and applications for vinci 
surgery important part our creative process primarily focus our development efforts those procedures which believe our products bring 
the highest patient value surgeon value and hospital value currently focus five surgical specialties gynecologic surgery urologic surgery general 
surgery cardiothoracic surgery and head and neck surgery key procedures which are focused include vinci prostatectomy dvp vinci 
hysterectomy dvh hernia repair vinci cholecystectomy vinci colon and rectal procedures vinci partial nephrectomy vinci 
sacrocolpopexy vinci mitral valve repair vinci lobectomy and vinci transoral robotic surgery total procedure volume was 
approximately which was gynecology was general surgery and was urology procedure volume from our market outside 
the was approximately which most procedures were urology representative surgical applications are described below 
gynecologic surgery 
hysterectomy removal the uterus one the most commonly performed surgeries gynecology and performed for variety underlying 
benign and cancerous conditions hysterectomies can performed using open surgery laparotomy mis techniques which include vaginal 
laparoscopic and robotic approaches prior the clearance vinci surgery for use gynecological procedures the majority 
hysterectomies performed were open surgeries believe that vinci surgery provides large number women the opportunity receive 
minimally invasive treatment alternative open hysterectomy estimate that nearly hysterectomies are performed with mis 
technique hysterectomies for benign conditions can performed using either multi port single site technology and believe majority 
vinci surgery performed using multi port techniques single site instruments enable surgeons perform surgery through single port via the 
patient belly button allowing for virtually scarless results 
sacrocolpopexy the abdominal open sacrocolpopexy one the most successful operations for vaginal vault prolapse sacrocolpopexy involves 
suturing synthetic mesh that connects and supports the vagina the sacrum tailbone sacrocolpopexy can performed using conventional 
laparoscopic technique however generally described difficult 
table contents 
and cumbersome perform surgeons have reported that the vinci surgical system capabilities may enable large number these procedures 
performed through minimally invasive technique conferring the benefits mis broader range sacrocolpopexy patients 
urologic surgery 
prostatectomy radical prostatectomy the removal the prostate gland patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer the standard 
approach removal the prostate has been via open surgical procedure the conventional laparoscopic approach option but difficult and 
poses challenges even the most skilled urologist the vinci surgical system has enabled large number surgeons convert from using 
open surgical technique minimally invasive technique 
partial nephrectomy partial nephrectomy the removal small portion kidney typically area the kidney containing tumor partial 
nephrectomies are most commonly performed patients diagnosed with clinically localized renal cancer excluding vinci surgery there are three 
common surgical approaches performing partial nephrectomies open surgical technique laparoscopy and hand assisted laparoscopy which 
hybrid the open and laparoscopic techniques surgeons have reported that the vinci surgical system capabilities may enable large number 
these procedures performed through minimally invasive technique conferring the benefits mis broader range partial nephrectomy 
patients treatment guidelines for patients with localized renal cancer recommend partial nephrectomy due the benefits nephron sparing surgery has 
long term patient outcomes published clinical literature has shown that the presence vinci surgical system associated with higherproportion patients receiving guideline recommended partial nephrectomy 
general surgery 
colorectal surgery these procedures typically involve benign cancerous conditions the lower digestive system particular the rectum 
colon common procedures this area include hemicolectomy sigmoidectomy low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection 
conventional laparoscopy not widely employed treat these types diseases due their high degree complexity surgeons have reported that 
the use the vinci surgery system and our latest technologies such the vinci surgical system endowrist stapler and endowrist vessel 
sealer have enabled them offer mis approaches broader range colorectal surgery patients 
hernia repair hernia occurs when organ fatty tissue squeezes through weak spot surrounding muscle connective fascia tissue during 
hernia repair surgery the weakened abdominal wall tissue secured and defects are repaired common types hernia are ventral and 
inguinal ventral abdominal hernia may occur through scar after surgery the abdomen inguinal hernia bulge the groin and more 
common men hernia repair can performed using traditional open surgery mis there wide range complexity hernia repair surgeries 
and varying surgeon opinion regarding optimal surgical approach the benefits minimally invasive and robotic hernia repair surgery vary 
patient 
cholecystectomy cholecystectomy the surgical removal the gall bladder commonly performed general surgery procedure cholecystectomy 
the primary method for the treatment gallstones and other gall bladder diseases most cholecystectomies are performed using multi port mis 
techniques although some surgeons choose perform cholecystectomy using manual single port instrumentation using vinci single site 
instruments many the technical challenges manual single port mis are reduced surgeons benefit from additional precision control and 
improved ergonomics multi port vinci techniques are also being used for certain cases and firefly technology can used visualize biliary 
anatomy three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces during single site and multi port vinci cholecystectomies 
bariatric surgery body literature points the benefit surgery treat patients for morbid obesity and its secondary effects such diabetes 
sleeve gastrectomy and roux gastric bypass rygb are the most commonly performed surgical procedures for morbid obesity the the 
body habitus morbidly obese patients can make laparoscopic surgery physically challenging for the surgeon and certain surgeons have found value 
using the vinci surgical system improve upon the ergonomics when performing minimally invasive surgery morbidly obese patients 
addition rygb can technically challenging procedure because the suturing stapling and tissue bowel manipulation that required 
surgeons using the vinci surgical system have reported reduction critical complication anastomotic leaks relative laparoscopic rygb 
cardiothoracic surgery 
thoracic surgery conventional approaches surgical procedures the thorax include both open and video assisted thoracoscopic approaches 
procedures performed via these methods include pulmonary wedge resection pulmonary lobectomy thymectomy mediastinal mass excision and 
esophagectomy many thoracic procedures remain open procedures surgeons have reported that the use the vinci surgery system thoracic 
surgery has enabled them offer mis 
table contents 
approaches broader range thoracic surgery patients and improved clinical outcomes compared open and video assisted thoracic surgery 
published single center multi center and national database clinical studies believe the endowrist stapler may have particular utility 
thoracic procedures 
mitral valve repair when patients are diagnosed with mitral valve disease there are typically two surgical treatment options from which they can 
choose mitral valve replacement mitral valve repair mitral valve repairs are generally preferred over mitral valve replacement for number 
reasons which include longevity and durability the repaired valve over replacement valve and the elimination reduction the patient postsurgical pharmaceutical regimen because mitral valve repairs are considered more technically challenging than mitral valve replacements they 
are only performed approximately the time several our surgeon customers have reported improvement their mitral valve repair rates 
over mitral valve replacements when using the vinci surgical system 
head and neck surgery 
transoral surgery head and neck cancers are typically treated either surgical resection chemo radiation combination both surgical 
resection performed open approach may require jaw splitting mandibulotomy this procedure while effective treating cancer 
potentially traumatic and disfiguring the patient mis approaches via the mouth transoral surgery are challenged line sight limitations 
dictated conventional endoscopic tools chemo radiation primary therapy does allow patients avoid traumatic surgical incisions however 
literature suggests that this modality diminishes patients ability speak and swallow normally surgeons have reported that vinci transoral 
surgery allows them treat cancers occurring the oropharynx tonsil and base tongue and larynx via the mouth and overcome some 
the line sight limitations conventional transoral surgery 
procedure mix 
our procedure business broadly split into two categories cancer and other highly complex procedures and less complex procedures for benign 
conditions cancer and other highly complex procedures tend reimbursed higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions thus 
hospitals are more sensitive the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions our strategy provide hospitals with attractive clinical 
and economic solutions each these categories our fully featured vinci system with advanced instruments including the endowrist one vessel 
sealer endowrist stapler products and our table motion product target the more complex procedure segment lower priced products including the threearm vinci system refurbished vinci and lower priced single site instruments are targeted towards less complex procedures 
clinical summary 
believe there are numerous additional applications that can addressed with the vinci surgical system and work closely with our surgeon 
customers refine and explore new techniques which vinci may bring value december had installed base vinci 
surgical systems including the europe asia and the rest the world estimate that surgeons using our technology 
completed approximately surgical procedures various types hospitals throughout the world during the year ended december those

third party coverage and reimbursement 
the and most markets ous where sell our products the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and 
surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for 
surgery when the procedure considered medically necessary the cms administers the medicare and medicaid programs the latter along with 
applicable state governments many other third party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the medicare program the single largest

governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services 
reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending the procedure performed the third party payor contract terms and other factors because 
both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services with without robotics regardless actual costs incurred 
the hospital physician furnishing the care including for the specific products used that procedure hospitals and physicians may decide not use 
our products reimbursement amounts are insufficient cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products 
domestic institutions typically bill various third party payors such medicare medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans

the fda coverage and reimbursement payors are generally determined the medical necessity the primary surgical procedure believe that the 
additional procedures intend pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable government agencies and insurance 
companies for appropriately selected patients hospitals not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for procedures performed with our 
products governmental and private payors policies not cover surgical procedures performed using our products may not able generate the

manufacturers the ppaca contains number provisions designed generate the revenues necessary fund health insurance coverage expansion 
including but not limited fees taxes certain health related industries including medical device manufacturers for sales between january and 
december medical device manufacturers were required pay excise tax sales tax certain medical device revenues under 
this provision incurred excise tax approximately million which was included cost revenue and reduction product gross

appropriations act includes two year moratorium the medical device excise tax such that medical device sales and are exempt from the 
medical device excise tax unless there further legislative action the tax will automatically reinstated for sales medical devices after january 
the ppaca also appropriates funding research the comparative effectiveness health care treatments and strategies remains unclear how this 
research will influence future medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions well influence other third party payor coverage and reimbursement 
policies the congress and state governments determine how implement the ppaca the full impact the ppaca the medical device industry

medicare payments providers per fiscal year which went into effect april and will remain effect through unless additional 
congressional action taken january the american taxpayer relief act was signed into law which among other things further 
reduced medicare payments several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers the medicare access and chip

modify repeal otherwise invalidate all certain provisions the ppaca for instance january executive order was issued which 
stated that the federal government policy seek the prompt repeal the ppaca and directed the heads all executive departments and agencies

risk factors 
risks relating our business 
our products not achieve market acceptance will not able generate the revenue necessary 
support our business 
the vinci surgical system and our other products represent fundamentally new way performing surgery achieving physician patient and thirdparty payor acceptance vinci surgery preferred method performing surgery will crucial our success our products fail achieve market 
acceptance customers will not purchase our products and will not able generate the revenue necessary support our business believe that 
physicians and third party payors acceptance the benefits procedures performed using our products will essential for acceptance our products 
patients physicians will not recommend the use our products unless can demonstrate that they produce results comparable superior existing 
surgical techniques even can prove the effectiveness our products through clinical trials surgeons may elect not use our products for any number 
other reasons for example cardiologists may continue recommend conventional heart surgery simply because such surgery already widely accepted 
addition surgeons may slow adopt our products because the perceived liability risks arising from the use new products and the uncertainty 
reimbursement from third party payors particularly light ongoing health care reform initiatives and the evolving health care environment 
following the elections 
expect that there will learning process involved for surgical teams become proficient the use our products broad use our products will 
require training surgical teams market acceptance could delayed the time required complete this training may not able rapidly train 
surgical teams numbers sufficient generate adequate demand for our products 
economic conditions could materially adversely affect our company 
recent years there have been credit and sovereign debt concerns certain european countries well concerns about continued slowed economic 
growth china and other ous markets have caused economic uncertainty disruptions the financial credit markets volatile currency exchange rates and 
energy costs concerns about inflation slower economic activity decreased consumer confidence reduced corporate profits and capital spending adverse 
business conditions and liquidity concerns uncertainty about current global economic conditions continues pose risk customers may choose 
postpone reduce spending response restraints credit there could additional effects from adverse conditions the credit markets our 
business including the insolvency key suppliers their inability obtain credit finance the development and manufacture our products resulting 
product delays and the inability our customers and distributors obtain credit finance purchases our products 
addition our business closely tied the overall healthcare system relating which there are concerns and uncertainties result explicit 
statements made the federal government about its intentions modify repeal otherwise invalidate all certain provisions the ppaca 
addition the federal government has called for substantial changes trade fiscal and tax policies which may include comprehensive tax reform and 
changes existing trade agreements including but not limited the north american free trade agreement nafta may have significant impact 
our operations cannot predict the impact any that these changes could have our business 
economic conditions worsen fail improve new legislation passed related the healthcare system trade fiscal tax policies customer 
demand may not materialize the levels require achieve our anticipated financial results which could have material adverse effect our business 
financial condition results operations cash flows 
because our markets are highly competitive customers may choose purchase our competitors products 
services may not accept vinci surgery which would result reduced revenue and loss market share 
vinci surgery relatively new technology that competes with established and emerging treatment options both disease management and 
reconstructive medical procedures these competitive treatment options include conventional mis open surgery interventional approaches and 
pharmacological regimens some these procedures are widely accepted the medical community 
table contents 
and many cases have long history use technological advances could make such treatments more effective less expensive than using our products 
which could render our products obsolete unmarketable studies could published that show that other treatment options are more beneficial and costeffective than vinci surgery cannot certain that physicians will use our products replace supplement established treatments that our 
products will continue competitive with current future technologies 
additionally expect face competition from companies that develop wristed robotic computer assisted surgical systems and products the 
future the following companies have introduced products the field robotic surgery have made explicit statements about their efforts enter the 
field auris surgical robotics inc avatera medical gmbh cambridge medical robotics ltd johnson johnson and google inc and their joint venture 
verb surgical inc medicaroid inc medrobotics corp meerecompany inc medtronic plc olympus corp samsung corporation smart robot 
technology group ltd transenterix inc and titan medical inc companies with substantial experience industrial robotics could potentially 
expand into the field surgical robotics and become competitor our revenues may reduced due pricing pressure eliminated our competitors 
develop and market products that are more effective less expensive than our products are unable compete successfully our revenues will suffer 
which could have material adverse effect our business financial condition result operations cash flows may not able maintain improve 
our competitive position against current potential competitors especially those with greater resources addition third party service providers that 
provide service vinci surgical system operators may emerge and compete with price offerings date substantially all our customers have 
sourced services their vinci surgical systems from through service contract commitments time and materials contracts are unable compete 
successfully with any third party service providers our revenues may suffer 
recently third party entities have begun offer robotic surgery consulting services targeted analyzing the cost effectiveness hospitals robotic 
surgery programs including procedures performed placement systems and consumption instruments and accessories currently provide similar 
services and analysis our customers but difficult assess the impact that this may have our business 
our customers may use unauthorized unapproved instruments and accessories which would result 
reduced revenue and loss market share 
large portion our revenue generated through our sales instruments and accessories third parties have attempted and may discover ways 
manufacture and sell counterfeit reprocessed instruments and alter instruments that are compatible and function with the vinci surgical system and 
such activities may reduce our market share our sales arrangements with customers generally prohibit the use unauthorized unapproved instruments 
and accessories with the vinci surgical systems warranties will void such instruments and accessories are used and programmed memory chip 
inside each instrument designed prevent the instrument from being used for more than the prescribed number procedures help ensure that its 
performance meets specifications during each procedure however these measures may not prevent the use unauthorized unapproved instruments and 
accessories our customers addition potential reductions our revenues and market share sales unauthorized instruments and accessories third 
parties may create safety and health risks vinci patients and could cause negative publicity for these products cause injuries and not function

our customers are subject competitive bidding public tender processes these approval and bidding processes can lengthy addition idn groups 
are creating larger networks vinci system operators have increasing purchasing power and are increasingly evaluating their vinci surgery programs 
optimize the efficiency the vinci system operations result hospitals may delay accelerate system purchases conjunction with timing 
their capital budget timelines further the introduction new products could adversely impact our sales cycle customers take additional time assess 
the benefits and costs such products result difficult for predict the length capital sales cycles and therefore the exact timing capital 
sales historically our sales vinci surgical systems have tended heaviest during the third month each fiscal quarter lighter the first and third 
fiscal quarters and heavier the fourth fiscal quarter 
have experienced procedure growth for number benign conditions including hysterectomies for benign conditions sacrocolpopexies hernia 
repair cholecystectomies and certain other surgeries many these types surgeries may postponed the short term patients avoid vacation 
periods and for other personal scheduling reasons patients may also accelerate procedures take advantage insurance funding cut off dates historically 
have experienced lower procedure volume the first and third fiscal quarters and higher procedure volume the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
timing procedures and changes procedure growth directly affect the timing instrument and accessory purchases and capital purchases customers 
the above factors may contribute substantial fluctuations our quarterly operating results because these fluctuations possible that some 
future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations securities analysts investors that happens the market price our stock would

march the president signed the ppaca which made changes that have impacted and are expected significantly impact the 
pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
the ppaca contains number provisions designed generate the revenues necessary fund health insurance coverage expansions among other 
things this includes fees taxes certain health related industries including medical device manufacturers for sales between january and 
december medical device manufacturers were required pay excise tax sales tax certain medical device revenues though 
there were some exceptions the excise tax this excise tax did apply all most our products sold within the united states december 
president obama signed into law the appropriations act the appropriations act includes two year moratorium the medical device excise tax such that 
medical device revenues and will exempt from the excise tax unless there further legislative action during that two year period the tax 
will automatically reinstated for sales medical devices after january the ppaca implemented number medicare payment system 
reforms including national pilot program payment bundling encourage hospitals physicians and other providers improve the coordination 
quality and efficiency certain healthcare services through bundled payment models and appropriated funding for comparative effectiveness research 
table contents 
the taxes imposed the ppaca and the expansion the government role the healthcare industry may result decreased profits lower 
reimbursement payors for our products and reduced medical procedure volumes all which may have material adverse impact our business 
financial condition results operations cash flows 
there have been judicial and congressional challenges certain aspects the ppaca and expect that the federal government will seek 
modify repeal otherwise invalidate all certain provisions the ppaca for instance january executive order was issued which 
was stated that the federal government policy seek the prompt repeal the ppaca and directed the heads all executive departments and 
agencies minimize the economic and regulatory burdens the ppaca maximum extent permitted law additional state and federal health care reform 
measures that may adopted the future could have material adverse effect our industry generally and our customers any changes 
uncertainty with respect future reimbursement rates changes hospital admission rates could impact our customers demand for our products and 
services which turn could impact our ability successfully commercialize our products could limit eliminate our spending certain development 
projects these changes could have material adverse effect our business financial condition results operations cash flows 
addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted these changes included aggregate reductions 
medicare payments providers per fiscal year which went into effect april and will remain effect through unless additional 
congressional action taken january the american taxpayer relief act was signed into law which among other things further 
reduced medicare payments several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute limitations 
period for the government recover overpayments providers from three five years macra repealed the formula which medicare made annual 
payment adjustments physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and new system incentive payments scheduled begin 
that are based various performance measures and physicians participation alternative payment models such accountable care organizations 
unclear what impact macra may have our business financial condition results operations cash flows 
further the federal state and local governments medicare medicaid managed care organizations and foreign governments have the past considered 
are currently considering and may the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended curb rising healthcare costs including those that 
could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services future significant changes the healthcare systems the 
other countries including retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes competitive bidding tender processes for certain products and 
services and other changes intended reduce expenditures along with uncertainty about whether and how changes may implemented could have 
negative impact the demand for our products are unable predict whether other healthcare policies including policies stemming from legislation 
regulations affecting our business may proposed enacted the future what effect such policies would have our business the effect ongoing 
uncertainty about these matters will have the purchasing decisions our customers 
are subject federal state and foreign laws governing our business practices which violated could 
result substantial penalties additionally challenges investigation into our practices could cause

the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act requires track and disclose the source any tantalum tin gold and tungsten 
used manufacturing which may originate the democratic republic the congo adjoining regions called conflict minerals these metals are 
central the technology industry and are present some our products component parts most cases acceptable alternative material exists which 
has the necessary properties because not possible determine the source the metals analysis must obtain good faith description the source 
the intermediate components and raw materials from parties our supply chain the components that incorporate those metals may originate from many 
sources and purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have long and difficult trace supply chain the spot price these materials 
varies producers the metal intermediates can expected change the mix sources used accordingly components and assemblies buy may have 
mix sources their origin are required carry out diligent effort determine and disclose the source these materials there can assurance 
can obtain this information accurately reliably all from intermediate producers who may unwilling unable provide this information 
further identify their sources supply notify these sources change addition these metals are subject price fluctuations and shortages which 
can affect our ability obtain the manufactured materials rely favorable terms from consistent sources these changes could have adverse

purchasers our products either refer patients purchase lease order arrange for recommend the purchase lease order healthcare 
products services for which payment may made under federal and state healthcare programs such medicare and medicaid and any other third party 
payor programs further the ppaca among other things amends the intent requirement the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes 
table contents 
person entity longer needs have actual knowledge this statute specific intent violate addition the ppaca provides that the 
government may assert that claim including items services resulting from violation the federal anti kickback statute constitutes false fraudulent 
claim for purposes the false claims statutes although would not submit claims directly government payors manufacturers can held liable under 
the federal false claim act they are deemed cause the submission false fraudulent claims for example providing inaccurate billing coding 
information customers promoting product off label 
these laws may affect our sales marketing and other promotional activities limiting the kinds financial arrangements may have with hospitals 
physicians other potential purchasers our products they particularly impact how structure our sales offerings including discount practices customer 
support education and training programs physician consulting and other service arrangements these laws are broadly written and often difficult 
determine precisely how these laws will applied specific circumstances violating anti kickback laws can result civil and criminal penalties which 
can substantial and include exclusion from government healthcare programs for noncompliance even unsuccessful challenge investigation into our 
practices could cause adverse publicity and costly defend and thus could harm our business and results operations 
the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements device manufacturers for any transfer value made distributed 
prescribers and other healthcare providers such information must made publicly available searchable format addition device manufacturers are 
required report and disclose any ownership investment interests held physicians and their immediate family members well any transfers 
value made such physician owners and investors during the preceding calendar year failure submit required information may result civil monetary 
penalties aggregate per year and aggregate million per year for knowing failures for all payments transfers value 
ownership investment interests not reported annual submission device manufacturers are required submit reports cms the day 
each calendar year 
addition there has been recent trend increased federal and state regulation payments made physicians including the tracking and reporting 
gifts compensation and other remuneration physicians certain states mandate implementation commercial compliance programs ensure 
compliance with these laws impose restrictions device manufacturer marketing practices and require the tracking and reporting gifts compensation 
and other remuneration physicians the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need build and maintain robust and expandable systems 
comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that healthcare company may 
found out compliance one more the requirements subjecting significant civil monetary penalties 
compliance with complex foreign and laws and regulations that apply our ous operations increases our cost doing business foreign 
jurisdictions and could expose our employees fines and penalties the united states and abroad these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws 
and regulations include laws such the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws foreign countries such the bribery act which 
became effective july violations these laws and regulations could result fines criminal sanctions against our officers our employees 
prohibitions the conduct our business and damage our reputation although have implemented policies and procedures designed ensure

states ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses order for market products for use the 
united states generally must first obtain clearance from the fda pursuant section the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca

regulatory agencies 
order conduct clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose demonstrating the safety and effectiveness medical device 
company must among other things apply for and obtain institutional review board irb approval the proposed investigation addition the 
clinical study involves significant risk defined the fda human health the sponsor the investigation must also submit and obtain fda 
approval investigational device exemption ide application many our products date have been would considered significant risk 
devices requiring ide approval prior investigational use may not able obtain fda and irb approval undertake clinical trials the united 
states for any new devices intend market the united states the future obtain such approvals may not able conduct studies which 
comply with the ide and other regulations governing clinical investigations the data from any such trials may not support clearance approval the 
investigational device failure obtain such approvals comply with such regulations could have material adverse effect our business financial 
condition and results operations certainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints produce meaningful useful data and free unexpected 
adverse effects that the fda will accept the validity foreign clinical study data cannot assured and such uncertainty could preclude delay market 
clearance authorizations resulting significant financial costs and reduced revenue 
addition some products may regulated the fda drugs biologics combination devices which carry still greater requirements for clinical 
trials regulatory submissions and approvals 
complying with fda regulations complex process and our failure comply fully could subject 
significant enforcement actions 
because our products including the vinci surgical system are commercially distributed numerous quality and post market regulatory requirements 
apply including the following 
continued compliance the qsr which requires manufacturers follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance 
procedures during the development and manufacturing process 
labeling regulations 
the fda general prohibition against false misleading statements the labeling promotion products for unapproved off label 
uses

letter more severe civil and criminal sanctions including the seizure our products and equipment ban the import export our products the 
fda has the past issued and could the future issue warning letters other communications fail satisfy remediate the matters discussed 
any such warning letters communications the fda could take further enforcement action including prohibiting the sale marketing the affected 
product our failure comply with applicable requirements could lead enforcement action that may have adverse effect our financial condition 
and results operations the receipt warning letter places certain limits the ability obtain fda issued certificates foreign government 
cfgs used for new and registration products certain foreign countries 
the fda also strictly regulates labeling advertising promotion and other activities relating the marketing our products medical devices may

cleared approved label possible that federal state enforcement authorities might take action they consider our promotional training materials 
constitute promotion unapproved use which could result significant fines penalties under variety statutory authorities including under the 
ffdca well laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
addition any modification change medical devices cleared for market requires the manufacturer make determination whether the change 
significant enough require new clearance have created labeling advertising and user training for the vinci surgical system describe 
specific surgical procedures that believe are fully within the scope our existing indications for use stated our clearances although 
have relied expert house and external staff consultants and advisors some whom were formerly employed fda and familiar with fda

compiled adequate information support the safety and efficacy using the vinci surgical system for all such specific procedures from time time 
modify our products including the hardware and software the vinci surgical system after obtain clearance from the fda for the devices 
ways that not believe require new clearance cannot assure that the fda would agree all cases with our determinations not seek new 
clearance for any these changes the fda disagrees with our assessments that new clearance was not required prior commercializing 
the devices with these changes modifications then the fda could impose enforcement sanctions and require obtain clearance for any 
modification our products may prohibited from marketing the modified device until such clearance granted

business model 
overview 
generate revenue from both the initial capital sales vinci surgical systems and from subsequent sales instruments accessories and service 
recurring revenue the vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately between million and million depending upon the model 
configuration and geography and represents significant capital equipment investment for our customers generate recurring revenue our customers 
purchase our endowrist and single site instrument and accessory products used performing procedures with the vinci surgical system our instruments 
and accessories have limited life and will either expire wear out they are used surgery which point they need replaced typically enter 
into service contracts the time systems are sold annual rate approximately depending upon the configuration the 
underlying system and composition the services offered under the contract these service contracts have generally been renewed the end the initial 
contractual service periods 
recurring revenue 
recurring revenue has generally grown faster rate than system revenue the last few fiscal years recurring revenue increased billion 
total revenue compared with billion total revenue and billion total revenue the growth 
recurring revenue and its increasing proportion total revenue largely reflect continued procedure adoption growing base installed vinci surgical 
systems the installed base vinci surgical systems has grown approximately december compared with december 
and december 
procedure mix products 
our procedure business primarily comprised cancer and other highly complex procedures and less complex procedures for benign 
conditions cancer and other highly complex procedures tend reimbursed higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions thus 
hospitals are more sensitive the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions our strategy provide hospitals with attractive clinical 
and economic solutions each these procedure categories our fully featured vinci system with advanced instruments including the endowrist 
vessel sealer endowrist stapler products and our table motion product target the more complex procedure segment lower priced products including the 
three arm vinci system refurbished vinci and single site instruments are targeted towards less complex procedures 
table contents 
procedure seasonality 
more than half vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions most notably benign hysterectomies hernia repairs and cholecystectomies 
the proportion these procedures for benign conditions has grown over time relation the total number procedures performed hysterectomies for 
benign conditions hernia repairs cholecystectomies and other short term elective procedures tend more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries 
for other life threatening conditions seasonality the for these procedures for benign conditions typically results higher fourth quarter procedure 
volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset seasonality outside the 
varies but often more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods

eastern european countries the remainder our ous markets provide our products through distributors 
intuitive surgical vinci system leasing 
since have entered into sales type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers way offer customers 
flexibility how they acquire vinci systems and expand vinci surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet the leases generally have 
commercially competitive terms compared with other third party entities that offer equipment leasing include both operating and sales type leases 
our system shipment and installed base disclosures exclude operating leases from our system average selling price computations 
the years ended december and shipped and systems under lease arrangements respectively which and 
were classified operating leases respectively generally the operating lease arrangements provide our customers with the right purchase the leased 
system sometime during the end the lease term revenue generated from customer purchases systems under operating lease arrangements lease 
buyouts was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively expect that revenue 
recognized from customer exercises the buyout options will fluctuate based the timing when and customers choose exercise their buyout

statements which included item financial statements and supplementary data which describes our significant accounting policies and methods 
used the preparation our consolidated financial statements the methods estimates and judgments that use applying our accounting policies 
require make difficult and subjective judgments often result the need make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most 
critical accounting estimates include 
the valuation and recognition investments which impacts our investment portfolio balance when assess fair value and interest and other 
income net when record impairments 
the valuation revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts which impacts revenue 
the estimation transactions hedge which impacts revenue and other expense 
the valuation inventory which impacts gross profit margins 
the assessment recoverability intangible assets and their estimated useful lives which primarily impacts gross profit margin operating 
expenses when record asset impairments accelerate their amortization

the recognition and measurement current and deferred income taxes including the measurement uncertain tax positions which impact our 
provision for taxes and

investments valuation 
fair value 
our investment portfolio may any time contain investments treasury and government agency securities non government securities 
taxable and tax exempt municipal notes corporate notes and bonds commercial paper cash deposits and money market funds the current market 
environment the assessment the fair value investments can difficult and subjective gaap establishes three levels inputs that may used 
measure fair value each level input has different levels subjectivity and difficulty involved determining fair value valuation level and 
instruments generally not require significant management judgment and the estimation not difficult level instruments include unobservable inputs 
that are supported little market activity and that are significant the fair value the assets liabilities the determination fair value for level 
instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity there were level securities for the periods presented 
other than temporary impairment 
after determining the fair value our available for sales instruments gains losses these securities are recorded other comprehensive income 
until either the security sold determine that the decline value other than temporary the primary differentiating factors considered 
classifying impairments either temporary other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability retain our investment the issuer for period 
time sufficient allow for any anticipated recovery market value the length the time and the extent which the market value the investment has 
been less than cost the financial condition and near term prospects the issuer given the current market conditions these judgments could prove 
wrong and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not able fulfill their obligations

hedge accounting for derivatives utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions 
when specific criteria required relevant accounting standards have been met changes fair values hedge contracts relating anticipated transactions 
are recorded other comprehensive income oci rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income their nature our 
estimates anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when determine that the transactions are 
longer probable within certain time frame are required reclassify the cumulative changes the fair values the related hedge contracts from oci 
net income 
inventory valuation inventory stated the lower standard cost which approximates actual costs market first first out basis the cost 
basis our inventory reduced for any products that are considered excessive obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market 
conditions actual future demand market conditions are less favorable than those projected management additional inventory write downs may

impairments from the analysis required gaap 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value asset not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value evaluate the recoverability the carrying value 
these identifiable intangible assets based estimated undiscounted cash flows generated from such assets the cash flow estimates the significant 
operating assumptions upon which they are based change the future may required record additional impairment charges 
the valuation and classification intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment useful lives for purposes amortization involves judgments 
and the use estimates the evaluation these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines required recurring

assets are shorter than had originally estimated accelerate the rate amortization over the assets new shorter useful lives impairment charge 
accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended december and considerable amount judgment required assessing 
impairment which includes financial forecasts conditions are different from management current estimates material write downs long lived assets may 
required which would adversely affect our operating results 
revenue recognition our system sale arrangements contain multiple elements including system system accessories instruments accessories and 
system service generally deliver all the elements other than service within days entering into the system sale arrangement each these elements 
separate unit accounting system accessories instruments accessories and service are also sold stand alone basis 
for multiple element arrangements revenue allocated each unit accounting based their relative selling prices relative selling prices are based 
first vendor specific objective evidence fair value vsoe then third party evidence selling price tpe when vsoe does not exist and then 
management best estimate the selling price esp when vsoe and tpe not exist 
our system sales arrangements generally include one year period free service and four additional years service that are generally billed for 
separately annual basis contractually stated price the revenue allocated the free service period deferred and recognized ratably over the free 
service period amounts billed for the additional years service are recorded into deferred revenue when they are billed and recognized ratably over the 
service period 
because have neither vsoe nor tpe for our systems the allocation revenue based esp for the systems sold the objective esp 
determine the price which would transact sale had the product been sold stand alone basis determine esp for our systems considering 
multiple factors including but not limited features and functionality the system geographies type customer and market conditions regularly 
review esp and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates 
accounting for stock options account for share based compensation accordance with the fair value recognition provisions gaap use 
the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input highly subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length 
time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the estimated volatility our common stock price over the expected term 
and the number options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the 
two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value stock options changes expected risk free rate return not significantly 
impact the calculation fair value and determining this input not highly subjective 
use implied volatility based freely traded options the open market believe implied volatility more reflective market conditions and 
better indicator expected volatility than historical volatility determining the appropriateness relying implied volatility considered the 
following 
the sufficiency the trading volume freely traded options 
the ability reasonably match the terms such the date the grant and the exercise price the freely traded options options granted and 
the length the term the freely traded options used derive implied volatility 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected outstanding the expected term based the 
observed and expected time exercise determine expected term based historical exercise patterns and our expectation the time will take for 
employees exercise options still outstanding 
table contents 
gaap requires develop estimate the number share based awards that will forfeited due employee turnover adjustments the 
estimated forfeiture rates can have significant effect our reported share based compensation recognize the cumulative effect the rate 
adjustments for all expense amortization the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based periodic 
review recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover revised forfeiture rate higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate 
may make adjustment that will result decrease the expense recognized the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed 
adjustments the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes the amount expense that recognize future periods

accounting for income taxes significant management judgment required determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and 
liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets accordance with gaap these estimates and judgments occur the 
calculation tax credits benefits and deductions and the calculation certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences the timing 
recognition revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes well the interest and penalties related uncertain tax positions 
significant changes these estimates may result increase decrease our tax provision the current subsequent period 
must assess the likelihood that will able recover our deferred tax assets recovery less than likelihood must increase our 
provision for taxes recording valuation allowance reduce our deferred tax assets the amount that more likely than not recoverable 
december believe more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will recovered with the exception our california deferred 
tax assets believe that due the computation california taxes under the single sales factor more likely than not that our california deferred tax 
assets will not realized should there change our ability recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would affected the period 
which such change takes place 
the calculation our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties the application complex tax regulations recognize liabilities for 
uncertain tax positions based two step process the first step evaluate the tax position for recognition determining the weight available 
evidence indicates that more likely than not that the position will sustained audit including resolution related appeals litigation processes 
any determine that tax position will more likely than not sustained audit then the second step requires estimate and measure the tax 
benefit the largest amount that more than likely realized upon ultimate settlement inherently difficult and subjective estimate such 
amounts have determine the probability various possible outcomes evaluate these uncertain tax positions quarterly basis this 
evaluation based factors including but not limited changes facts circumstances changes tax law effective settlement audit issues and 
new audit activity such change recognition measurement would result the recognition tax benefit additional charge the tax provision 
accounting for legal contingencies are involved number legal proceedings involving product liability intellectual property shareholder 
derivative actions securities class actions insurance employee related and other matters record liability and related charge earnings our 
consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss considered probable and the amount can reasonably estimated our assessment 
reevaluated each accounting period and based all available information including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents 
reasonable estimate known probable loss cannot made but range probable losses can estimated the low end the range losses 
recognized amount within the range better estimate than any other loss reasonably possible but not probable and can reasonably 
estimated the estimated loss range loss disclosed the notes the consolidated financial statements 
when determining the estimated probable loss range losses significant judgment required exercised order estimate the amount and 
timing the loss recorded estimates probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult make particularly when the matters are

investments december was approximately years interest rates rise the market value our investments may decline which could result 
realized loss are forced sell investment before its scheduled maturity hypothetical increase interest rate basis points would have 
resulted decrease the fair value our net investment position approximately million december not utilize derivative 
financial instruments manage our interest rate risks 
the uncertain financial markets have resulted tightening the credit markets reduced level liquidity many financial markets and extreme 
volatility fixed income and credit markets the credit ratings the securities have invested could further deteriorate and may have adverse 
impact the carrying value these investments

those european markets where have direct distribution channels well japanese yen and korean won operate number markets 
direct sales basis and incur operating expenses local currencies europe japan and south korea also purchase certain product components from 
non suppliers local currency result because portion our operations consist sales activities outside the have foreign exchange 
exposures non dollar revenues operating expenses accounts receivable accounts payable and foreign currency bank balances 
for the year ended december sales denominated foreign currencies euro british pound japanese yen and korean won were 
approximately total revenue the objective our hedging program mitigate the impact changes currency exchange rates our net cash 
flow from foreign currency denominated sales for the year ended december our revenue would have decreased approximately million 
the dollar exchange rate strengthened also hedge the net recognized non functional currency balance sheet exposures with foreign 
exchange forward contracts reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will adversely affected changes exchange rates strengthening 
the dollar exchange rate against all currencies which have exposure after considering foreign currency hedges and offsetting positions 
december would have resulted less than million decrease the carrying amounts those net assets actual gains and losses the future 
may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based changes the timing and amount foreign currency exchange rate 
movements and our actual exposure and hedging transactions bank counterparties foreign exchange forward contracts expose credit related losses 
the event their nonperformance mitigate that risk only contract with counterparties that meet certain minimum requirements under our counterparty 
risk assessment process monitor ratings and potential downgrades least quarterly basis based our ongoing assessment counterparty risk 
will adjust our exposure various counterparties 
although sell distributors outside the dollars strengthening the dollar can impact our distributors margins and could impact the 
end customers ability purchase our product our distributors seek recover the impact the change the dollar increasing product and service 
prices less than our revenue conducted through distributors outside the strengthening the dollar relative non currencies could have 
adverse impact our business
