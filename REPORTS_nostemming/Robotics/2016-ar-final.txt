industry background 
conventional laser technologies 
since the laser was invented over years ago laser technology has revolutionized broad range applications and 
products various industries including general manufacturing automotive medical research consumer products electronics 
semiconductors and communications lasers provide flexible non contact and high speed ways process and treat various 
materials they are incorporated into manufacturing medical and other systems oems system integrators and end users 
also they are widely used for various medical applications and test and measurement systems and transmit large volumes 
data optical communications systems for wide variety applications lasers provide superior performance and more 
cost effective solution than non laser technologies 
lasers emit intense light beam that can focused small area causing metals and other materials melt 
vaporize change their character these properties are utilized applications requiring very high power densities such 
cutting welding marking and engraving additive manufacturing ablation printing drilling cladding and other materials 
processing procedures lasers are well suited for imaging and inspection applications and the ability confine laser light 
narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective medical and sensing applications laser works converting 
electrical energy optical energy laser energy source excites pumps lasing medium which converts the energy 
from the source into emission consisting particles light called photons particular wavelength 
historically carbon dioxide gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser types used materials 
processing and many other applications they are named for the materials used create the lasing action laser 
produces light electrically stimulating gas filled tube and delivers the beam through free space using mirrors provide 
direction crystal laser uses arc lamp pulsed flash lamp diode stack array optically pump special crystal the 
most common crystal lasers use yttrium aluminum garnet yag crystals infused with neodymium ytterbium some 
crystal lasers also use mirrors free space deliver the beam direct the beam through fiber optics 
fiber lasers 
fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes the light source pump specialty optical fibers which are infused with rare 
earth ions these fibers are called active fibers and are comparable diameter human hair the laser emission created 
within optical fibers and delivered through flexible optical fiber cable result their different design and components 
annual report 
item business 
fiber lasers are more reliable efficient robust compact and easier operate than conventional lasers addition fiber lasers 
free the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high maintenance costs that are typical for conventional lasers 
although low power fiber lasers were introduced four decades ago their increased adoption the last decade has been 
driven primarily our improvements their output power levels and cost well their superior performance and lower 
cost ownership compared with conventional lasers have successfully increased output power levels developing 
improved optical components such diodes and active fibers that have increased their power capacities and improved their 
performance fiber lasers now offer output powers that exceed those conventional lasers many categories also 
semiconductor diodes historically have represented the majority the cost fiber lasers the past the high cost diodes 
meant that fiber lasers could not compete with conventional lasers price and limited their use high value added 
applications over the last fifteen years however our semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and reliable due 
part substantial advancements semiconductor diode technology packaging design and increased production volumes 
result the average cost per watt output power has decreased dramatically over the last fifteen years because these 
improvements our fiber lasers can now effectively compete with conventional lasers over wide range output powers and 
applications and begin compete with non laser technologies many applications that that did not use lasers historically 
pioneer the development and commercialization fiber lasers have contributed many advancements fiber laser 
technology and products 
advantages fiber lasers over conventional lasers 
believe that fiber lasers provide combination benefits that include 
superior performance fiber lasers provide uniform beam quality over the entire power range most 
conventional laser solutions the beam quality sensitive output power while fiber lasers the output beam 
virtually non divergent over wide power range non divergent beam enables higher levels precision increased 
power densities and the ability deliver the beam over greater distances where processing can completed the 
superior beam quality and greater intensity fiber laser beam allow tasks accomplished more rapidly with 
lower power units and with greater flexibility than comparable conventional lasers 
lower cost the purchase price for fiber lasers generally lower than that yag lasers and many lasers 
addition fiber lasers are less expensive operate due their better energy efficiency lower required maintenance 
costs and faster processing speeds fiber lasers convert electrical energy optical energy approximately times 
more efficiently than diode pumped yag lasers disc lasers approximately times more efficiently than 
conventional lasers and approximately times more efficiently than lamp pumped yag lasers because 
fiber lasers are much more energy efficient and place lower levels thermal stress their internal components 
they have substantially lower cooling requirements compared those conventional lasers which also improves 
overall energy efficiency fiber lasers have lower maintenance costs due the high performance and long life our 
single emitter diodes fiber optics and other optical components the higher power density the fiber laser beam 
also allows for higher processing speeds many applications which increases the operating efficiencies perpart basis 
ease use numerous features fiber lasers make them easier operate maintain and integrate into laser based 
systems compared conventional lasers many which require mirrors direct the beam there are moving 
parts fiber lasers and the beam contained flexible fiber optic cable they not require adjustments 
internal components mirrors direct the beam 
compact size fiber lasers are typically smaller and lighter weight than conventional lasers saving valuable floor 
space while conventional lasers are delicate due the precise alignment mirrors fiber lasers are more durable 
and able perform variable environments 
choice wavelengths and precise control beam the design fiber lasers generally provides broad range 
wavelength choices allowing users select the precise wavelength that best matches their application and materials 
the beam delivered through flexible fiber optic cable can directed the work area over longer distances 
without loss beam quality 
fiber amplifiers are similar design fiber lasers use many the same components such semiconductor diodes 
and specialty optical fibers and provide many the same advantages the applications that require amplification 
notwithstanding the benefits offered fiber lasers there remain applications and processes where conventional laser 
technologies may provide superior performance with respect particular features for example crystal lasers can provide 
higher peak power pulses necessary certain applications and fiber lasers cannot now generate the deep ultra violet light that 
used for photolithography many semiconductor applications addition lasers operate wavelengths that are 
optimal for use many non metallic materials including organic materials like wood

prospects and facilities these two countries are subject the economic and political environment russia and china 
recent years both countries have undergone substantial political economic and social change typical emerging 
economy neither china nor russia possesses well developed business financial legal and regulatory infrastructure that 
would generally exist more mature free market economy addition tax currency and customs legislation subject 
varying interpretations and changes which can occur frequently the future economic direction these two emerging market 
countries remains largely dependent upon the effectiveness economic financial and monetary measures undertaken the 
government together with tax legal regulatory and political developments our failure manage the risks associated with our 
operations russia and china and our other existing and potential future international business operations could have 
material adverse effect upon our results operations 
events over the past few years ukraine and crimea have resulted the united states and the european union 
imposing and escalating sanctions russia and certain businesses sectors and individuals russia the united states and 
the european union also suspended the granting certain types export licenses russia russia has imposed its own 
sanctions certain individuals the and may considering other sanctions the and the european union 
certain businesses individuals from them have large manufacturing facility and research and development operations 
russia which supplies components our and german manufacturing facilities and finished lasers our subsidiary 
china addition supply components from our and german manufacturing facilities our russian facility should 
there any disruption our supplies from our russian operations should the united states the european union 
russia implement different sanctions our production and deliveries well results operations would affected for 
example various trade sanctions against iran and syria require government authorization for sales there may 
subject legal liability enhanced disclosure requirements and reputational damage sell goods services violation 
trade sanctions such countries 
are subject many laws governing our international operations including those that prohibit improper payments 
government officials including but not limited the foreign corrupt practices act and the anti corruption laws the 
countries which operate violations these laws which are complex and often difficult interpret and apply could 
result significant criminal penalties sanctions that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition 
operating results and cash flows 
have experienced and expect experience the future fluctuations our quarterly operating results these 
fluctuations may increase the volatility our stock price and may difficult predict 
have experienced and expect continue experience fluctuations our quarterly operating results believe 
that fluctuations quarterly results may cause the market price our common stock fluctuate perhaps substantially 
factors which may have influence our operating results particular quarter include 
the increase decrease cancellation rescheduling significant customer orders 
the timing revenue recognition based the installation acceptance certain products shipped our 
customers 
seasonality attributable different purchasing patterns and levels activity throughout the year the areas where 
operate 
the timing customer qualification our products and commencement volume sales systems that include our 
products 
our ability obtain export licenses for our products timely basis all 
the rate which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies 
the gain loss key customer 
product customer mix 
competitive pricing pressures and new market entrants 
our ability design manufacture and introduce new products cost effective and timely basis 
annual report 
components products materials services our inability obtain these components materials products services from 
alternate sources acceptable prices and within reasonable amount time could impair our ability meet scheduled 
product deliveries our customers and could cause customers cancel orders 
our ability manage our inventory levels and any provisions for excess obsolete inventory 
our ability collect outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the incurrence expenses develop and improve application and support capabilities the benefits which may 
not realized until future periods all 
the incurrence expenses related impairment values for goodwill intangibles and other long lived assets 
different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our customers which affect the timing their spending 
foreign currency fluctuations 
economic and market conditions particular geography country and 
our ability control expenses 
these factors make difficult for accurately predict our operating results addition our ability accurately 
predict our operating results complicated the fact that many our products have long sales cycles some lasting long 
twelve months more once sale made our delivery schedule typically ranges from four weeks four months and 
therefore our sales will often reflect orders shipped the same quarter that they are received and will not enhance our ability 
predict our results for future quarters addition long sales cycles may cause incur significant expenses without 
offsetting revenues since customers typically expend significant effort evaluating testing and qualifying our products before 
making decision purchase them moreover customers may cancel reschedule shipments and production difficulties 
could delay shipments accordingly our results operations are subject significant fluctuations from quarter quarter and 
may not able accurately predict when these fluctuations will occur 
because lack long term purchase commitments from our customers our sales can difficult predict which could 
lead excess obsolete inventory and adversely affect our operating results 
generally not enter into long term agreements with our customers obligating them purchase our fiber lasers 
amplifiers our business characterized short term purchase orders and shipment schedules and some cases orders may 
canceled delayed without significant penalty result difficult forecast our revenues and determine the 
appropriate levels inventory required meet future demand addition due the absence long term volume purchase 
agreements forecast our revenues and plan our production and inventory levels based upon the demand forecasts our 
oem customers end users and distributors which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially this could lead 
increased inventory levels and increased carrying costs and risk excess obsolete inventory due unanticipated reductions 
purchases our customers addition provisions have been recorded result changes market prices certain 
components the value those inventories that was realizable through finished product sales due declines certain end 
market demand and uncertainties related the recoverability the value inventories due technological and product 
changes and excess quantities this regard recorded provisions for slow moving obsolete excess inventory totaling 
million million and million and respectively our oem customers end users 
distributors fail accurately forecast the demand for our products fail accurately forecast the timing such demand are 
unable consistently negotiate acceptable purchase order terms with customers our results operations may adversely 
affected

risks which could disrupt our business and may harm our financial results and condition 
the future may make acquisitions and investments new businesses products patents and technologies and 
expand into new geographic areas may acquire operations products technologies that expand our current capabilities 
acquisitions present number potential risks and challenges that could not met disrupt our business operations increase 
our operating costs and reduce the value the acquired company asset technology for example identify 
acquisition candidate may not able successfully negotiate finance the acquisition favorable terms even 
are successful may not able integrate the acquired businesses products patents technologies into our existing 
business and products retain key employees result the rapid pace technological change our industry may 
misjudge the long term potential acquired business product patent technology the acquisition may not 
complementary our existing business furthermore potential acquisitions and investments whether not consummated 
may divert our management attention and require considerable cash outlays the expense our existing operations 
addition complete future acquisitions may issue equity securities incur debt assume contingent liabilities have 
amortization expenses and write downs acquired assets which could adversely affect our profitability and result dilution 
our existing and future stockholders 
our future success substantially dependent the continued service our executive officers particularly our founder

the necessary personnel our ability extend and maintain our scientific expertise and grow our business could suffer 
significantly 
are subject litigation alleging that are infringing third party intellectual property rights intellectual property 
claims could result costly litigation and harm our business 
recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights many technology based 
industries including our own face risks and uncertainties connection with such litigation including the risk that patents 
issued others may harm our ability business that there could existing patents which are unaware that could 
pertinent our business and that not possible for know whether there are patent applications pending that our 
products might infringe upon since patent applications often are not disclosed until patent issued published moreover 
the frequency with which new patents are granted and the diversity jurisdictions which they are granted make 
impractical and expensive for monitor all patents that may relevant our business 
from time time have been notified allegations and claims that may infringing patents intellectual 
property rights owned third parties were named defendant action filed november the united states 
district court for the eastern district texas for patent infringement relating apparatus for coupling radiation beams 
into optical waveguides the complaint seeks unspecified damages injunctive relief and attorneys fees following federal 
jury trial won patent infringement lawsuit asserted imra america inc alleging that certain products 
produce infringe one patent allegedly owned imra america imra america has also informed that has 
patents and applications the united states and foreign jurisdictions directed fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers but has not 
asserted them against are engaged opposition proceedings japan and germany with respect several patents 
allegedly owned imra america which are part the same patent family for which imra america asserted one patent 
against the united states 
there can assurance that will able dispose without material effect any claims other allegations made 
asserted the future the outcome any litigation uncertain even ultimately are successful the merits any 
such litigation examination legal and administrative proceedings related intellectual property are typically expensive 
and time consuming generate negative publicity and divert financial and managerial resources some litigants may have 
greater financial resources than have and may able sustain the costs complex intellectual property litigation more 
easily than can 
not prevail any intellectual property litigation brought against could affect our ability sell our products 
and materially harm our business financial condition and results operations these developments could adversely affect our 
ability compete for customers and increase our revenues plaintiffs intellectual property cases often seek and sometimes 
obtain injunctive relief intellectual property litigation commenced against could force take actions that could 
harmful our business competitive position results operations and financial condition including the following 
stop selling our products using the technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
pay actual monetary damages royalties lost profits increased damages and the plaintiff attorneys fees which 
individually the aggregate may substantial and

annual report 
rely the significant experience and specialized expertise our senior management and scientific staff and 
are unable retain these key employees and attract other highly skilled personnel necessary grow our business 
successfully our business and results operations could suffer 
addition intellectual property lawsuits can brought third parties against oems and end users that incorporate our 
products into their systems processes some cases indemnify oems against third party infringement claims relating 
our products and often make representations affirming among other things that our products not infringe the intellectual 
property rights others result may incur liabilities connection with lawsuits against our customers any such 
lawsuits whether not they have merit could time consuming defend damage our reputation result substantial and 
unanticipated costs 
our inability protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies could result the unauthorized use our

rely patents trade secret laws contractual agreements technical know how and other unpatented proprietary 
information protect our products product development and manufacturing activities from unauthorized copying third 
parties our patents not cover all our technologies systems products and product components and may not prevent third 
parties from unauthorized copying our technologies products and product components seek protect our proprietary 
technology under laws affording protection for trade secrets also seek protect our trade secrets and proprietary 
information part requiring employees enter into agreements providing for the maintenance confidentiality and the 
assignment rights inventions made them while employed have significant international operations and 
are subject foreign laws which differ many respects from laws policing unauthorized use our trade secret 
technologies throughout the world and proving misappropriation our technologies are particularly difficult especially due 
the number our employees and operations numerous foreign countries the steps that take acquire ownership our 
employees inventions and trade secrets foreign countries may not have been effective under all such local laws which could 
expose potential claims the inability protect intellectual property developed our employees furthermore any 
changes unexpected interpretations the trade secret and other intellectual property laws any country which 
operate may adversely affect our ability enforce our trade secret and intellectual property positions costly and timeconsuming litigation could necessary determine the scope our confidential information and trade secret protection 
also enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and other suppliers protect our confidential information that 
deliver them however there can assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not breached that will 
able effectively enforce them that will have adequate remedies for any breach 
given our reliance trade secret laws others may independently develop similar alternative technologies duplicate 
our technologies and commercialize discoveries that have made therefore our intellectual property efforts may 
insufficient maintain our competitive advantage stop other parties from commercializing similar products

rely exclusively our own production capabilities manufacture certain our key components such 
semiconductor diodes specialty optical fibers and optical components not have redundant production lines for some 
our components such our diodes specialty optical fibers and some other components which are made single 
manufacturing facility these are not readily available from other sources our current costs our manufacturing activities 
were obstructed hampered significantly could take considerable length time could increase our costs for

overview 
develop and manufacture broad line high performance fiber lasers fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used 
numerous applications primarily materials processing sell our products globally oems system integrators and end 
users market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force 
are vertically integrated such that design and manufacture most our key components used our finished 
products from semiconductor diodes optical fiber preforms finished fiber lasers and amplifiers also manufacture certain 
complementary products used with our lasers including optical delivery cables fiber couplers beam switches optical 
processing heads and chillers addition offer laser based systems for certain markets and applications 
description our net sales costs and expenses 
net sales derive net sales primarily from the sale fiber lasers and amplifiers also sell diode lasers 
communications systems laser systems and complementary products sell our products through our direct sales 
organization and our network distributors and sales representatives well system integrators sell our products 
oems that supply materials processing laser systems communications systems medical laser systems and other laser systems 
for advanced applications end users also sell our products end users that build their own systems which incorporate 
our products use our products energy light source our scientists and engineers work closely with oems systems 
integrators and end users analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser amplifier specifications our 
sales cycle varies substantially ranging from period few weeks long one year more but typically several 
months 
sales our products generally are recognized upon shipment provided that obligations remain and collection the 
receivable reasonably assured our sales typically are made purchase order basis rather than through long term purchase 
commitments 
develop our products standard specifications and use common set components within our product 
architectures our major products are based upon common technology platform continually enhance these and other 
products improving their components and developing new components and new product designs 
cost sales our cost sales consists primarily the cost raw materials and components direct labor expenses and 
manufacturing overhead are vertically integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for our products well 
assemble finished products believe our vertical integration allows increase efficiencies leverage our scale and 
lower our cost sales cost sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related our manufacturing engineering and 
service operations related occupancy and equipment costs shipping costs and reserves for inventory obsolescence and for 
warranty obligations inventories are written off and charged cost sales when identified excess obsolete 
due our vertical integration strategy and ongoing investment plant and machinery maintain relatively high 
fixed manufacturing overhead may not able choose not adjust these fixed costs adapt rapidly changing 
market conditions our gross margin therefore significantly affected our sales volume and the corresponding utilization 
capacity and absorption fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expense consists primarily costs related compensation trade shows 
professional and technical conferences travel facilities depreciation equipment used for demonstration purposes and other 
marketing costs 
research and development our research and development expense consists primarily compensation development 
expenses related the design our products and certain components the cost materials and components build prototype 
devices for testing and facilities costs costs related product development are recorded research and development 
expenses the period which they are incurred 
general and administrative our general and administrative expense consists primarily compensation and associated 
costs for executive management finance legal information technology and other administrative personnel outside legal and 
professional fees insurance premiums and fees allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses such charges and 
benefits related the change allowance for doubtful debt 
factors and trends that affect our operations and financial results 
reading our financial statements you should aware the following factors and trends that our management 
believes are important understanding our financial performance 
net sales our net sales grew from million million representing three year 
compound annual growth rate approximately net sales growth was driven increasing demand for our products 
fueled their superior performance and decreasing average cost per watt output power which has resulted substantial 
improvement their competitiveness and increased market share compared traditional lasers including and yag lasers 
increased sales fiber lasers for cutting and welding applications and the development oem customers these 
applications iii the introduction new products including our high power lasers with higher output power levels quasicontinuous wave qcw lasers laser systems high power pulsed lasers and optical heads and other accessories and the 
development new applications for our products our annual revenue growth rates have varied net sales increased 
and and respectively 
our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures our customers particularly manufacturers using our 
products for materials processing which includes general manufacturing automotive aerospace heavy industry consumer 
semiconductor and electronics approximately our revenues were from customers using our products for 
materials processing although applications within materials processing are broad the capital equipment market general 
cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns for the foreseeable future our operations will continue 
depend upon capital expenditures customers for materials processing and will subject the broader fluctuations 
capital equipment spending 
our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter quarter the increase decrease sales from prior quarter 
can affected the timing orders received from customers the shipment installation and acceptance products our 
customers facilities the mix oem orders and one time orders for products with large purchase prices economic and 
political conditions certain country region and seasonal factors such the purchasing patterns and levels activity 
throughout the year the regions where operate historically our net sales have been higher the second half the year 
than the first half the year furthermore net sales can affected the time taken qualify our products for use new 
annual report 
the average selling prices our products generally decrease the products mature these decreases result from 
factors such decreased manufacturing costs and increases unit volumes increased competition the introduction 
new products and market share considerations the past have lowered our selling prices order penetrate new 
markets and applications furthermore may negotiate discounted selling prices from time time with certain 
customers that purchase multiple units 
applications the end markets that serve the adoption our products new customer qualification new 
application can lead increase net sales for period which may then slow until penetrate new markets obtain new 
customers 
gross margin our total gross margin any period can significantly affected total net sales any period 
product mix that the percentage our revenue the period that attributable higher lower power products and the 
mix sales between laser and amplifier sources and complete systems sales mix between oem customers who purchase 
devices from high unit volumes and other customers mix sales different geographies and other factors some 
which are not under our control 
our product mix affects our margins because the selling price per watt generally higher for mid power devices and 
certain specialty products than for high power devices and certain pulsed lasers sold large volumes the overall cost highpower lasers may partially offset improved absorption fixed overhead costs associated with sales larger volumes 
higher power products because they use greater number optical components and drive economies scale 
manufacturing also the profit margins systems can lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources depending 
the configuration volume and competitive forces among other factors 
the mix sales between oem customers and other customers can affect gross margin because provide sales price 
discounts products based the number units ordered the number oem customers increase and the number 
units ordered increases the average sales price per unit will reduced expect that the impact reduced sales price per 
unit will offset the manufacturing efficiency provided high unit volume orders but the timing and extent achieving 
these efficiencies may not always match the mix sales any given time period realized all 
invested million million and million capital expenditures and respectively 
most this investment relates expansion our manufacturing capacity and lesser extent research and development 
and sales related facilities 
high proportion our costs fixed costs are generally difficult may take time adjust response changes 
demand addition our fixed costs increase expand our capacity expand capacity faster than required sales 
growth gross margins could negatively affected gross margins generally decline production volumes are lower result 
decrease sales reduction inventory because the absorption fixed manufacturing costs will reduced gross 
margins generally improve when the opposite occurs both sales and inventory decrease the same period the decline 
gross margin may greater cannot reduce fixed costs choose not reduce fixed costs match the decrease the 
level production experience decline sales that reduces absorption our fixed costs have production 
issues our gross margins will negatively affected 
also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow moving have been rendered obsolete are determined 
excess any provision for such slow moving obsolete excess inventory affects our gross margins for example 
recorded provisions for slow moving obsolete excess inventory totaling million million and million 
and respectively 
sales and marketing expense expect continue expand our worldwide direct sales organization build and expand 
applications centers hire additional sales and marketing personnel our existing and new geographic locations well 
support sales new product lines increase the number units for demonstration purposes and otherwise increase 
expenditures sales and marketing activities order support the growth our net sales such expect that our sales 
and marketing expenses will increase the aggregate 
research and development expense plan continue invest research and development improve our existing 
components and products and develop new components products systems and applications technology the amount 
research and development expense incur may vary from period period general net sales continue increase 
expect research and development expense increase the aggregate 
general and administrative expense expect our general and administrative expenses increase continue 
invest systems and resources management finance legal information technology human resources and administration 
support our worldwide operations legal expenses vary from quarter quarter based primarily upon the level litigation and 
transaction activities 
major customers while have historically depended few customers for large percentage our annual net sales 
the composition this group can change from year year net sales derived from our five largest customers percentage 
our annual net sales were and and none our customers accounted for more 
than our net sales and and sales our largest customer accounted for and our net sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the united states 
gaap requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities 
and disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts net sales 
and expenses their nature these estimates and judgments are subject inherent degree uncertainty ongoing 
basis evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related inventories warranty obligations contingent 
liabilities income taxes and the fair value certain debt and equity instruments including stock based compensation base 
our estimates and judgments our historical experience and other assumptions that believe are reasonable under the 
circumstances the results which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates which may materially affect 
our operating results and financial position the accounting policies described below are those which our opinion involve 
the most significant application judgment involve complex estimation and which could different judgments 
estimates were made materially affect our reported results operations and financial position 
revenue recognition recognize revenue accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb 
accounting standards codification asc revenue from orders with multiple deliverables divided into separate units 
accounting when certain criteria are met these separate units generally consist equipment and installation the 
consideration for the arrangement then allocated the separate units accounting based their relative selling prices the 
selling price equipment based vendor specific objective evidence and the selling price installation based thirdparty evidence applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied separately for each separate unit accounting 
revenue for laser and amplifier sources generally recognized upon the transfer ownership which typically the time 
shipment installation revenue recognized upon completion the installation service which typically occurs within 
days delivery for laser systems that have customer specific processing requirements revenue recognized the latter 
customer acceptance date shipment date the customer acceptance made prior shipment returns and customer 
credits are infrequent and are recorded reduction revenue rights return generally are not included sales 
arrangements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable include million and 
million bank acceptance drafts issued china december and respectively bank acceptance drafts are 
bank guarantees payment specified dates the maturity these bank acceptance drafts less than days maintain 
allowance for doubtful accounts provide for the estimated amount accounts receivable that will not collected the 
allowance based upon assessment customer creditworthiness historical payment experience and the age outstanding 
receivables 
inventory inventory stated the lower cost first first out method market value inventory includes parts 
and components that may specialized nature and subject rapid obsolescence maintain reserve for excess 
obsolete inventory items the reserve based upon review inventory materials hand which compare with historic 
usage estimated future usage and age addition review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates 
current market value write downs are recorded reduce the carrying value the net realizable value with respect any part 
with costs excess current market value estimating demand and current market values inherently difficult particularly 
given that make highly specialized components and products determine the valuation excess and obsolete inventory 
making our best estimate considering the current quantities inventory hand and our forecast the need for this 
inventory support future sales our products often have limited information which base our forecasts future 
sales differ from these forecasts the valuation excess and obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory provisions 
may required because our vertical integration significant sudden decrease sales could result significant 
change the estimates excess obsolete inventory valuation 
warranty maintain accrual for warranty claims for units sold that are subject warranty estimate this 
accrual considering past claims experience the number units still carrying warranty coverage and the average life the 
remaining warranty period 
annual report 
respectively seek add new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers anticipate that the 
composition our significant customers will continue change generally not enter into agreements with our 
customers obligating them purchase our fiber lasers amplifiers any our significant customers were substantially

arm length basis differing tax rates between jurisdictions allocation factors tax credits nondeductible items and 
changes enacted tax rates significant judgment required determining our annual tax expense and evaluating our tax 
positions continue expand globally there risk that due complexity within and diversity among the various 
deferred taxes arise because the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting known

believe that triennial say pay votes support longer term focus company performance 
because the say pay vote occurs after have already implemented our executive compensation

their views the company executive compensation programs 
proxy statement 
the law requires the company hold advisory vote say pay frequency least once every six 
years our stockholders voted similar proposal with the three year say pay frequency 
receiving greater number votes than the one year two year alternatives continue believe that 
the say pay vote should conducted every three years and that this frequency appropriate for the 
following reasons 
addition because our executive compensation programs have typically not changed materially from 
year year and are designed operate over the long term and enhance long term performance are 
concerned that annual say pay vote could lead near term perspective that inappropriate for 
evaluating our executive compensation programs 
finally although believe that holding say pay vote every three years will reflect the right 
balance considerations the normal course will periodically reassess that view and can provide for 
say pay vote executive compensation more frequent basis changes our compensation 
programs other circumstances indicate that such vote would appropriate 
our board directors recommends
