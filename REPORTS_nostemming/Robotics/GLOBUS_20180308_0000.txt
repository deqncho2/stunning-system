aaos highlighted the substantial progress globus has made 
with its emerging technology platforms trauma and robotics 
believe both items are underappreciated the street and 
drive higher more diverse growth profile for globus remain 
overweight 
aaos highlights still underappreciated pipeline upgraded globus the 
start view that robotics and tam expansion create path longerterm value creation see our january report aaos reinforced those views with 
globus highlighting its robotics platform and newly launched trauma product 
lines the conference the street not placing enough value into globus 
emerging technology platforms which help diversify the growth drivers for 
the company robotics the street appreciates the system opportunity but 
not adequately accounting for the impact from implant pull through trauma 
see limited value reflected our dcf driven price target implies 
ebitda valuation while multiple may appear aggressive the valuation 
includes value from robotics and value from trauma which 
currently have limited ebitda contribution 
globus highlighted its trauma portfolio for the first time aaos 
following the recent approvals its products the current products have 
limited differentiation and serve base for potentially more differentiated 
products the future including integration with globus excelsius gps robotic 
system the trauma market size and physician diligence suggests 
that globus current portfolio includes the bread and butter products and can 
supply the majority cases being performed there currently limited 
incentive from product standpoint switch from the market leaders outside 
sales force execution but spine customers familiar with globus that take 
trauma cases could help create inroads price could used 
potential impact trauma see lot potential for globus bring value 
and innovation the trauma market that said given are the early stages 
the product ramp have kept our estimates the conversative side 
model relatively modest contribution from trauma growing 
believe our estimate half globus internal estimates 
model this growing excess market share 
assuming ebitda margins for trauma and ebitda multiple given 
double digit growth profile and discounting back attribute

value per share the trauma launch 
continue bullish the robotics opportunity for globus while much 
the robotics focus aaos centers ortho recon systems mako navio 
rosa remain bullish excelsius prospects spine commentary remains 
positive about half placements have been competitive accounts 
large variety procedures are being performed excelsius lateral posterior 
mis deformity etc and iii customers are almost exclusively using globus 
implants for excelsius cases this points significant potential for implant pullthrough which underappreciated the street our base case each system 
placement drives one incremental procedure per week adding additional 
revenue per system per year resulting share value driven 
robotics split for placements and for implant pull through our bull 
case scenario this becomes split and from placements and pullthrough respectively
