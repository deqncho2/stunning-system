international revenue accounted for approximately percent percent and percent our revenue and respectively

fluctuations and changing dynamics foreign competitiveness based variations the value the united states dollar relative other currencies 
factors contributing this variability include significant manufacturing activity europe significant sales denominated currencies other than the 
united states dollar and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies the united states dollar euro swedish kronor and british pound sterling 
the impact those fluctuations reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements but the aggregate did not have material impact our 
results operations 
experience fluctuations orders and sales due seasonal variations and customer sales cycles such the seasonal pattern contracting the

that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions senior management 
has discussed the development selection and disclosure these estimates with the audit committee our board directors believe the following 
critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognized when persuasive evidence arrangement exists upon delivery the product the customer fixed 
determinable price with reasonable assurance collection passage title and risk loss the customer indicated the contractual terms and 
fulfillment all significant obligations 
design market and sell our products primarily commercial off the shelf products certain customers request different system configurations 
generally based standard options accessories that offer general our revenue arrangements not involve acceptance provisions based upon 
customer specified acceptance criteria those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist revenue deferred until customer 
acceptance cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior shipment for any contracts with multiple elements training 
installation additional parts etc allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence fair value each 
element the arrangement objective and reliable evidence fair value any element not available use estimated selling price for purposes 
allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements addition judgments are required evaluating the credit worthiness our customers 
credit not extended customers and revenue not recognized until have determined that collectability reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts our policy maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability our customers make required 
payments credit limits are established through process reviewing the financial history and stability each customer where appropriate obtain 
credit rating reports and financial statements the customer when determining modifying their credit limits regularly evaluate the collectability 
our trade receivable balances based combination factors when customer account balance becomes past due initiate dialogue with the 
customer determine the cause determined that the customer will unable meet its financial obligation such the case bankruptcy 
filing deterioration the customer operating results financial position other material events impacting their business record specific allowance 
reduce the related receivable the amount expect recover given all information presently available actual write offs during the past three years 
have not been material our results operations 
also record allowance for all other customers based certain other factors including the length time the receivables are past due and historical 
collection experience with individual customers december our accounts receivable balance million reported net allowances 
for doubtful accounts million believe our reported allowances december are adequate the financial conditions those customers 
were deteriorate however resulting their inability make payments may need record additional allowances that would result additional 
selling general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period which such determination made 
inventory our policy record inventory write downs when conditions exist that indicate that our inventories are likely excess anticipated 
demand are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions regularly evaluate the ability realize 
the value our inventories based combination factors including the following historical usage rates forecasted sales usage product end life 
dates estimated current and future market values and new product introductions purchasing requirements and alternative usages are evaluated within these 
processes mitigate inventory exposure when recorded our write downs are intended reduce the carrying value our inventories their net realizable 
value and establish new cost basis december our inventories million are stated net inventory write downs actual demand for 
our products deteriorates market conditions are less favorable than those that project additional inventory write downs may required the future 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price acquired enterprise assets over the estimated fair value identifiable net assets 
acquired assess goodwill for potential impairment the reporting unit level during the third quarter each year whenever events circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value these assets may exceed their fair value may assess qualitative factors make this determination bypass such 
qualitative assessment and proceed directly testing goodwill for impairment using two step process qualitative factors may consider include but are 
not limited macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes the market for our products and services regulatory 
and political developments and entity specific factors such strategies and financial performance there are indicators that goodwill has been impaired 
proceed two step impairment test whereby the first step comparing the fair value reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value goodwill not impaired and further testing performed the second step performed 
the carrying value reporting unit exceeds its fair value the carrying value reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value impairment 
loss equal the difference recorded our impairment test the current year did not indicate impairment goodwill any our reporting units 
product warranties our products are sold with warranty provisions that require remedy deficiencies quality performance our products over 
specified period time generally twelve twenty four months cost our customers our policy record warranty liabilities levels that 
represent our estimate the costs that will incurred fulfill those 
warranty requirements the time that revenue recognized believe that our recorded liability million december adequate 
cover our future cost materials labor and overhead for the servicing our products sold through that date actual product failures material service 
delivery costs differ from our estimates our warranty liability would need revised accordingly
