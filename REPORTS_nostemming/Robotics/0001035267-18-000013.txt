our goal fundamentally improve surgery and maximize the number patients who can derive the benefits mis through the use computeraided robotic technologies our objective create value for patients surgeons and hospitals summarized below 
patient value believe that the value surgical procedure patient can defined patient value procedure efficacy invasiveness 
define procedure efficacy measure the success the surgery resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness how disruptive and painful 
the treatment itself when the patient value vinci procedure deemed higher than alternate treatment options patients may seek out 
surgeons and hospitals that offer that specific vinci procedure potentially resulting local market share shift for the specific treatment vinci 
procedure adoption occurs procedure procedure and driven the relative patient value and total treatment costs vinci procedures 
compared alternative treatment options for the same disease state believe most patients will place higher value procedures that are not only 
more efficacious but also less invasive than alternative treatments our goal provide products surgeons who turn provide patients with 
procedure options that are both highly effective and less invasive than other surgical options 
surgeon value train surgeons the use our vinci surgical system and assist them building their practices their delivery high 
patient value provide ergonomic platform for surgeons perform their procedures seek provide surgeons with reliable and easy use

vinci surgery cost effective approach many surgeries compared alternative treatment options recognized many published studies 
clinical applications 
are the beneficiaries productive collaborations with leading surgeons exploring and developing new techniques and applications for vinci 
surgery important part our creative process primarily focus our development efforts those procedures which believe our products bring 
the highest patient value surgeon value and hospital value currently focus five surgical specialties gynecologic surgery urologic surgery general 
surgery cardiothoracic surgery and head and neck surgery key procedures which are focused include vinci prostatectomy dvp vinci 
hysterectomy dvh hernia repair vinci colon and rectal procedures vinci partial nephrectomy vinci sacrocolpopexy vinci mitral valve 
repair vinci lobectomy and vinci transoral robotic surgery representative surgical applications are described below 
gynecologic surgery 
hysterectomy removal the uterus one the most commonly performed surgeries gynecology and performed for variety underlying 
benign and cancerous conditions hysterectomies can performed using open surgery laparotomy mis techniques which include vaginal 
laparoscopic and robotic approaches prior the clearance vinci surgery for use gynecological procedures the majority 
hysterectomies performed were open surgeries believe that vinci surgery provides large number women the opportunity receive 
minimally invasive treatment alternative open hysterectomy hysterectomies for benign conditions can performed using either multiport single site technology and estimate that majority vinci surgery performed using multi port techniques single site instruments 
enable surgeons perform surgery through single port via the patient belly button allowing for virtually scarless results 
sacrocolpopexy the abdominal open sacrocolpopexy one the most successful operations for vaginal vault prolapse sacrocolpopexy involves 
suturing synthetic mesh that connects and supports the vagina the sacrum tailbone 
sacrocolpopexy can performed using conventional laparoscopic technique however generally described difficult and cumbersome 
perform surgeons have reported that the vinci surgical system capabilities may enable large number these procedures performed 
through minimally invasive technique conferring the benefits mis broader range sacrocolpopexy patients 
urologic surgery 
prostatectomy radical prostatectomy the removal the prostate gland patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer the standard 
approach removal the prostate was via open surgical procedure the conventional laparoscopic approach option but difficult and 
poses challenges even the most skilled urologist the vinci surgical system has enabled large number surgeons convert from using 
open surgical technique minimally invasive technique 
partial nephrectomy partial nephrectomy the removal small portion kidney typically area the kidney containing tumor partial 
nephrectomies are most commonly performed patients diagnosed with clinically localized renal cancer excluding vinci surgery there are three 
common surgical approaches performing partial nephrectomies open surgical technique laparoscopy and hand assisted laparoscopy which 
hybrid the open and laparoscopic techniques surgeons have reported that the vinci surgical system capabilities may enable large number 
these procedures performed through minimally invasive technique conferring the benefits mis broader range partial nephrectomy 
patients treatment guidelines for patients with localized renal cancer recommend partial nephrectomy due the benefits nephron sparing surgery has 
long term patient outcomes published clinical literature has shown that the presence vinci surgical system associated with higherproportion patients receiving guideline recommended partial nephrectomy 
general surgery 
hernia repair hernia occurs when organ other tissue squeezes through weak spot surrounding muscle connective tissue during 
hernia repair surgery the weakened tissue secured and defects are repaired common types hernia are ventral and inguinal ventral abdominal 
hernia may occur through scar after surgery the abdomen inguinal hernia bulge the groin and more common men hernia repair can 
performed using traditional open surgery mis there wide range complexity hernia repair surgeries and varying surgeon opinion regarding 
optimal surgical approach the benefits minimally invasive and robotic hernia repair surgery vary patient 
colorectal surgery these procedures typically involve benign cancerous conditions the lower digestive system particular the rectum 
colon common procedures this area include hemicolectomy sigmoidectomy low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection surgeons 
have reported that the use the vinci surgery system and our latest technologies such the vinci surgical system endowrist stapler and 
endowrist vessel sealer have enabled them offer mis approaches broader range colorectal surgery patients 
cholecystectomy cholecystectomy the surgical removal the gall bladder commonly performed general surgery procedure cholecystectomy 
the primary method for the treatment gallstones and other gall bladder diseases most cholecystectomies are performed using multi port mis 
techniques although some surgeons choose perform cholecystectomy using manual single port instrumentation using vinci single site 
instruments many the technical challenges manual single port mis are reduced surgeons benefit from additional precision control and 
improved ergonomics multi port vinci techniques are also being used for certain cases and firefly technology can used visualize biliary 
anatomy three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces during single site and multi port vinci cholecystectomies 
bariatric surgery body literature points the benefit surgery treat patients for morbid obesity and its secondary effects such diabetes 
sleeve gastrectomy and roux gastric bypass rygb are commonly performed surgical procedures for morbid obesity the the body 
habitus morbidly obese patients can make laparoscopic surgery physically challenging for the surgeon and certain surgeons have found value 
using the vinci surgical system improve upon the ergonomics when performing mis morbidly obese patients addition rygb can 
technically challenging procedure because the suturing stapling and tissue bowel manipulation that required surgeons using the vinci 
surgical system have reported reduction critical complication anastomotic leaks relative laparoscopic rygb 
cardiothoracic surgery 
thoracic surgery conventional approaches surgical procedures the thorax include both open and video assisted thoracoscopic approaches 
procedures performed via these methods include pulmonary wedge resection pulmonary lobectomy thymectomy mediastinal mass excision and 
esophagectomy many thoracic procedures remain open procedures surgeons have reported that the use the vinci surgery system thoracic 
surgery has enabled them offer mis approaches broader range thoracic surgery patients and improved clinical outcomes compared open 
and 
table contents 
assisted thoracic surgery published single center multi center and national database clinical studies believe the endowrist stapler may 
have particular utility thoracic procedures 
mitral valve repair when patients are diagnosed with mitral valve disease there are typically two surgical treatment options from which they can 
choose mitral valve replacement mitral valve repair mitral valve repairs are generally preferred over mitral valve replacement for number 
reasons which include longevity and durability the repaired valve over replacement valve and the elimination reduction the patient postsurgical pharmaceutical regimen because mitral valve repairs are considered more technically challenging than mitral valve replacements they 
are only performed approximately the time several our surgeon customers have reported improvement their mitral valve repair rates 
over mitral valve replacements when using the vinci surgical system 
head and neck surgery 
transoral surgery head and neck cancers are typically treated either surgical resection chemo radiation combination both surgical 
resection performed open approach may require jaw splitting mandibulotomy this procedure while effective treating cancer 
potentially traumatic and disfiguring the patient mis approaches via the mouth transoral surgery are challenged line sight limitations 
dictated conventional endoscopic tools chemo radiation primary therapy does allow patients avoid traumatic surgical incisions however 
literature suggests that this modality diminishes patients ability speak and swallow normally surgeons have reported that vinci transoral 
surgery allows them operate tumors occurring the oropharynx tonsil and base tongue and larynx via the mouth and overcome some 
the line sight limitations conventional transoral surgery 
procedure mix 
our procedure business broadly split into two categories cancer and other highly complex procedures and less complex procedures for benign 
conditions cancer and other highly complex procedures tend reimbursed higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions thus 
hospitals are more sensitive the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions our strategy provide hospitals with attractive clinical 
and economic solutions each these categories our fully featured vinci system with advanced instruments including the endowrist one vessel 
sealer endowrist stapler products and our table motion product target the more complex procedure segment lower priced products including the threearm vinci system refurbished vinci and lower priced single site instruments are targeted towards less complex procedures our vinci 
surgical system priced between the vinci and surgical systems and offers customers access many the vinci features including 
vinci advanced instrumentation and imaging systems lower price point

third party coverage and reimbursement 
the and most markets ous where sell our products the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and 
surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for 
surgery when the procedure considered medically necessary the cms administers the medicare and medicaid programs the latter along with 
applicable state governments many other third party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the medicare program the single largest 
payor this program has significant impact other payors payment systems 
generally reimbursement for professional services performed facility physicians reported under billing codes issued the american medical 
association ama known current procedural terminology cpt codes physician reimbursement under medicare generally based fee 
schedule and determined the relative values the professional service rendered addition cms and the national center for health statistics nchs 
are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications billing codes used hospitals report inpatient procedures known icd 
procedural codes prior october and icd pcs codes and after october for medicare cms generally reimburses hospitals for 
services provided during inpatient stay based prospective payment system that determined classification system known medicare severity 
diagnostic related groupings drgs drgs are assigned using number factors including the principal diagnosis major procedures 
discharged status patient age and complicating secondary diagnoses among

completed with without robotic assistance continues assigned the clinically relevant drg 
governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services 
reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending the procedure performed the third party payor contract terms and other factors because 
both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services with without robotics regardless actual costs incurred 
the hospital physician furnishing the care including for the specific products used that procedure hospitals and physicians may decide not use 
our products reimbursement amounts are insufficient cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products 
domestic institutions typically bill various third party payors such medicare medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans 
for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products because our vinci surgical system has been cleared for commercial distribution the 
the fda coverage and reimbursement payors are generally determined the medical necessity the primary surgical procedure believe that the 
additional procedures intend pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable government agencies and insurance 
companies for appropriately selected patients hospitals not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for procedures performed with our 
products governmental and private payors policies not cover surgical procedures performed using our products may not able generate the 
revenues necessary support our business 
countries outside the reimbursement obtained from various sources including governmental authorities private health insurance plans and 
labor unions most foreign countries private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies addition health maintenance organizations 
are emerging certain european countries effectively conduct our business may need seek ous reimbursement approvals and not know 
these required approvals will obtained timely manner all some countries patients may permitted pay directly for surgical services 
however such pay practices are not common most countries 
the there have been and continue number legislative initiatives contain healthcare costs march the patient protection and 
affordable care act amended the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the ppaca was enacted the ppaca made changes 
that have significantly impacted healthcare providers insurers and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers the ppaca contained number 
provisions designed generate the revenues necessary fund health insurance coverage expansion including but not limited fees taxes certain 
health related industries including medical device manufacturers for sales between january and december medical device manufacturers 
were required pay excise tax sales tax certain medical device revenues under this provision incurred medical device excise 
tax mdet approximately million which was included cost revenue and reduction product gross profit margin the 
consolidated appropriations act the appropriations act enacted december included two year moratorium mdet such that medical 
device sales and were exempt from the mdet new legislation was passed january such that mdet will delayed until january 
the ppaca also appropriated funding research the comparative effectiveness health care treatments and strategies remains unclear how this 
research will influence future medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions well influence other third party payor coverage and reimbursement 
policies the ppaca well other federal state health care reform measures that may adopted the future could have material adverse effect 
our business the taxes imposed ppaca and the expansion the government role the healthcare industry may result decreased profits lower 
reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products and reduced procedural volumes all which may adversely affect our business financial 
condition and results operations 
addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted these changes included aggregate reduction 
medicare payments providers per fiscal year which went into effect april and will remain effect through unless additional 
congressional action taken january the american taxpayer relief act was signed into law which among other things further 
reduced medicare payments several types providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers the medicare access and chip 
reauthorization act enacted april macra repealed the formula which medicare made annual payment adjustments 
physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and new system incentive payments scheduled begin that are based 
various performance measures and physicians participation alternative payment models such accountable care organizations individual states the 
have also become increasingly aggressive passing legislation and implementing 
table contents 
regulations designed control product pricing including price patient reimbursement constraints and discounts and require marketing cost disclosure 
and transparency measures 
there have also been judicial and congressional challenges certain aspects the ppaca well efforts the administration modify 
repeal otherwise invalidate all certain provisions the ppaca since january the president has signed two executive orders designed 
delay the implementation certain provisions the ppaca otherwise circumvent some the requirements for health insurance mandated the 
ppaca the current administration has also announced that will discontinue the payment cost sharing reduction csr payments insurance 
companies until congress approves the appropriation funds for the csr payments the loss the csr payments expected increase premiums 
certain policies issued qualified health plans under the ppaca bipartisan bill appropriate funds for csr payments has been introduced the 
senate but the future that bill uncertain addition cms has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility setting 
benchmarks for insurers the individual and small group marketplaces which may have the effect relaxing the essential health benefits required under the 
ppaca for plans sold through such marketplaces because the tax cuts and jobs act enacted december the ppaca individual mandate 
penalty for not having health insurance coverage will eliminated starting further each chamber congress has put forth multiple bills designed 
repeal repeal and replace portions the ppaca although the majority these measures have not been enacted congress date congress will 
likely continue consider other legislation repeal repeal and replace elements the ppaca any regulatory legislative developments domestic 
foreign markets that eliminate reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability sell our products

not recommend the use our products unless can demonstrate that they produce results comparable superior existing surgical techniques even 
can prove the effectiveness our products through clinical trials surgeons may elect not use our products for any number other reasons for 
example cardiologists may continue recommend conventional heart surgery simply because such surgery already widely accepted addition surgeons 
may slow adopt our products because the perceived liability risks arising from the use new products and the uncertainty reimbursement from 
third party payors particularly light ongoing health care reform initiatives and the evolving health care environment following the 
elections 
expect that there will learning process involved for surgical teams become proficient the use our products broad use our products will 
require training surgical teams market acceptance could delayed the time required complete this training may not able rapidly train 
surgical teams numbers sufficient generate adequate demand for our products 
economic conditions could materially adversely affect our company 
uncertainty about global economic conditions including credit and sovereign debt concerns certain european countries and concerns about slowed 
economic growth china and other ous markets have caused and may continue cause disruptions the financial credit markets volatile currency 
exchange rates and energy costs concerns about inflation slower economic activity decreased consumer confidence reduced corporate profits and capital

difficulties may unable obtain credit finance purchases our products due restraints credit there could additional effects from adverse 
conditions the credit markets our business including the insolvency key suppliers their inability obtain credit finance the development 
and manufacture our products resulting product delays 
addition our business closely tied the overall healthcare system relating which there are concerns and uncertainties result efforts 
made the federal government modify repeal otherwise invalidate all certain provisions the ppaca addition the federal 
government has called for enacted substantial changes trade fiscal and tax policies which may include changes existing trade agreements 
including but not limited the north american free trade agreement nafta and may have significant impact our operations cannot predict 
the impact any that these changes could have our business 
economic conditions worsen new legislation passed related the healthcare system trade fiscal tax policies customer demand may not 
materialize the levels require achieve our anticipated financial results which could have material adverse effect our business financial 
condition results operations cash flows 
because our markets are highly competitive customers may choose purchase our competitors products 
services may not accept vinci surgery which would result reduced revenue and loss market share 
vinci surgery technology that competes with established and emerging treatment options both disease management and reconstructive medical 
procedures these competitive treatment options include conventional mis open surgery interventional approaches and pharmacological regimens some 
these procedures are widely accepted the medical community and many cases have long history use technological advances could make such 
treatments more effective less expensive than using our products which could render our products obsolete unmarketable studies could published 
that show that other treatment options are more beneficial and cost effective than vinci surgery cannot certain that physicians will use our 
products replace supplement established treatments that our products will continue competitive with current future technologies 
additionally face expect face competition from companies that develop have developed wristed robotic computer assisted surgical 
systems and products the following companies have introduced products the field robotic surgery have made explicit statements about their efforts

potentially expand into the field surgical robotics and become competitors our revenues may reduced due pricing pressure eliminated our 
competitors develop and market products that are more effective less expensive than our products are unable compete successfully our revenues 
will suffer which could have material adverse effect our business financial condition result operations cash flows may not able maintain 
improve our competitive position against current potential competitors especially those with greater resources

impact that this may have our business are unable compete successfully with any third party service providers our revenues may suffer 
our customers may use unauthorized unapproved instruments and accessories which would result 
reduced revenue and loss market share 
large portion our revenue generated through our sales instruments and accessories third parties have attempted and may discover ways 
manufacture and sell counterfeit reprocessed instruments and alter instruments that are compatible and function with the vinci surgical system and 
such activities may reduce our market share while our sales arrangements with customers generally prohibit the use unauthorized unapproved 
instruments and accessories with vinci surgical systems warranties will void such instruments and accessories are used and programmed memory 
chip inside each instrument designed prevent the instrument from being used for more than the prescribed number procedures help ensure that its

may delay accelerate system purchases conjunction with timing their capital budget timelines further idn groups are creating larger networks 
vinci system operators with increasing purchasing power and are increasingly evaluating their vinci surgery programs optimize the efficiency the 
vinci system operations further the introduction new products could adversely impact our sales cycle customers take additional time assess the 
benefits and costs such products result difficult for predict the length capital sales cycles and therefore the exact timing capital sales 
historically our sales vinci surgical systems have tended heaviest during the third month each fiscal quarter lighter the first fiscal quarter

have experienced lower procedure volume the first and third fiscal quarters and higher procedure volume the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
timing procedures and changes procedure growth directly affect the timing instrument and accessory purchases and capital purchases customers 
the above factors may contribute substantial fluctuations our quarterly operating results because these fluctuations possible that future

the ppaca contained number provisions designed generate the revenues necessary fund health insurance coverage expansions among other 
things this includes fees taxes certain health related industries including medical device manufacturers for sales between january and 
december medical device manufacturers were required pay excise tax sales tax certain medical device revenues though 
there were some exceptions the excise tax this excise tax did apply all most our products sold within the december the former 
president signed into law the appropriations act the appropriations act included two year moratorium the medical device excise tax such that medical 
device revenues and were exempt from the excise tax new legislation was passed january such that mdet will delayed until 
january 
the ppaca also implemented number medicare payment system reforms including national pilot program payment bundling encourage 
hospitals physicians and other providers improve the coordination quality and efficiency certain healthcare services through bundled payment 
models and appropriated funding for comparative effectiveness research

has been introduced the senate but the future that bill uncertain addition cms has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater 
flexibility setting benchmarks for insurers the individual and small group marketplaces which may have the effect relaxing the essential health

medicare payments providers per fiscal year which went into effect april and will remain effect through unless additional 
congressional action taken january the american taxpayer relief act was signed into law which among other things further 
reduced medicare payments several types providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute

generate revenue from the initial capital sales vinci surgical systems including systems under sales type lease arrangements and revenue from 
operating lease arrangements and from the subsequent sales instruments accessories and service the vinci surgical system generally sells for 
approximately between million and million depending upon the model configuration and geography and represents significant capital 
equipment investment for our customers our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire wear out they are used surgery 
which point they need replaced typically enter into service contracts the time systems are sold annual rate approximately 
depending upon the configuration the underlying system and composition the services offered under the contract these service contracts

procedure mix products 
our procedure business primarily comprised cancer and other highly complex procedures and less complex procedures for benign 
conditions cancer and other highly complex procedures tend reimbursed higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions thus 
hospitals are more sensitive the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions our strategy provide hospitals with attractive clinical 
and economic solutions each these procedure categories our fully featured vinci surgical system with advanced instruments including the 
endowrist vessel sealer endowrist stapler products and our table motion product target the more complex procedure segment lower priced products 
including the three arm vinci surgical system refurbished vinci surgical system and single site instruments are targeted towards less 
complex procedures our vinci surgical system priced between the vinci and surgical systems and offers customers access many the 
vinci features including vinci advanced instrumentation and imaging systems lower price point 
procedure seasonality 
more than half vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions most notably benign hysterectomies hernia repairs and cholecystectomies 
hysterectomies for benign conditions hernia repairs cholecystectomies and other short term elective procedures tend more seasonal than cancer 
operations and surgeries for other life threatening conditions seasonality the for these procedures for benign conditions typically results higher 
fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset 
seasonality outside the varies and more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods

prostate cancer the standard care for the surgical treatment prostate cancer expect that the number dvp procedures performed the 
will largely fluctuate with the overall prostatectomy market dvp the largest overall ous procedure 
kidney cancer procedures have also been strong contributor our recent global urology procedure growth clinical publications have demonstrated 
that the presence vinci system hospital market increases the likelihood that patient will receive nephron sparing surgery through partial 
nephrectomy which typically surgical society guideline recommended therapy 
ous procedures the ous procedure growth rate reflects continued vinci adoption european and asian markets growth was strong asia 
and varied country europe experienced strong procedure growth china systems sold under previous public hospital quota system have been 
installed and utilization those systems have increased however procedure growth moderating china future system placements and our ability 
sustain procedure growth china are dependent obtaining additional importation authorizations public hospital quotas well hospitals 
completing central purchasing tender process under such authorizations the most recent authorization expired the end the timing and 
magnitude future authorizations that may enable future system placements not certain have experienced strong procedure growth japan since 
receiving the national reimbursements outlined above for dvp and partial nephrectomy however adoption for these procedures has progressed 
procedure growth japan slowing future procedure growth japan will likely paced the timing procedure reimbursement approvals for 
procedures well the reimbursement levels for any these procedures addition dvp and partial nephrectomy january committee the 
mhlw recommended additional procedures for reimbursement the reimbursement level for each procedure uncertain this time and may 
insufficient for broad adoption addition possible that procedures will adopted slowly not all there can assurance that the perceived 
value vinci procedures greater than alternative therapies 
system demand 
future demand for vinci surgical systems will impacted factors including hospital response the evolving health care environment under the 
current administration procedure growth rates hospital consolidation trends evolving system utilization and point care dynamics capital

statements which included item financial statements and supplementary data which describes our significant accounting policies and methods 
used the preparation our consolidated financial statements the methods estimates and judgments that use applying our accounting policies 
require make difficult and subjective judgments often result the need make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most 
critical accounting estimates include 
the valuation and recognition investments which impacts our investment portfolio balance when assess fair value and interest and other 
income net when record impairments 
the valuation revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts which impacts revenue 
the estimation transactions hedge which impacts revenue and other expense 
the valuation inventory which impacts gross profit margins

expenses when record asset impairments accelerate their amortization

the fair value investments can difficult and subjective gaap establishes three levels inputs that may used measure fair value each level 
input has different levels subjectivity and difficulty involved determining fair value valuation level and instruments generally not require 
significant management judgment and the estimation not difficult level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported little 
market activity and that are significant the fair value the assets liabilities the determination fair value for level instruments requires the most 
management judgment and subjectivity there were level securities for the periods presented 
other than temporary impairment after determining the fair value our available for sales instruments gains losses these securities are recorded 
other comprehensive income until either the security sold determine that the decline value other than temporary the primary differentiating 
factors considered classifying impairments either temporary other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability retain our investment 
the issuer for period time sufficient allow for any anticipated recovery market value the length the time and the extent which the market 
value the investment has been less than cost the financial condition and near term prospects the issuer these judgments could prove wrong and

accounting for stock options account for share based compensation accordance with the fair value recognition provisions gaap use 
the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input highly subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length 
time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the estimated volatility our common stock price over the expected term

two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value stock options changes expected risk free rate return not significantly
