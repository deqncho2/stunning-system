utilize dealer networks including those affiliated with some our strategic allies such caterpillar and cnh global 
market sell and service many our products changes our product mix including increasing provision software and bundled 
solutions tailored the needs specific vertical markets impose new demands our distribution channels and may require 
significant changes the skills and expertise required successfully distribute our products and services the creation new 
distribution channels recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them the use and the selling our 
technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources order develop and expand our distribution channels 
must continue expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our 
investment systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult manage 
the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations our channel partners become familiar with our product 
offerings including our new product developments and newer types offering such software and services may make more

hackers who may attempt penetrate and sabotage our network security our website change frequently they may take advantage 
weaknesses third party technology standards which are unaware that not control and may not recognized

that unauthorized access customer data may obtained through inadequate use security controls customers vendors 
business partners cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result theft our intellectual property proprietary

some our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning not sufficient for all eventualities our systems 
are also subject intentional acts vandalism despite any precautions may take the occurrence natural disaster 
decision any our third party hosting providers close facility use without adequate notice for financial other reasons 
other unanticipated problems our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result loss critical

our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors product defects security vulnerabilities software 
errors 
our products including our software products are highly technical and complex and when deployed may contain errors defects 
security vulnerabilities must develop our products quickly keep pace with the rapidly changing market and have 
history frequently introducing new products products and services sophisticated ours could contain undetected errors 
defects especially when first introduced when new models versions are released such occurrences could result damage 
our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources increased customer service and support costs warranty claims 
and litigation 
warrant that our products will free defect for various periods time depending the product addition certain 
our contracts include epidemic failure clauses invoked these clauses may entitle the customer return obtain credits for 
products and inventory cancel outstanding purchase orders even the products themselves are not defective 
errors viruses bugs may present software hardware that acquire license from third parties and incorporate into 
our products third party software hardware that our customers use conjunction with our products our customers 
proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties implementing 
our solutions changes third party software hardware that our customers use conjunction with our software could also 
render our applications inoperable any errors defects security vulnerabilities our products any defects compatibility 
issues with any third party hardware software customers network environments discovered after commercial release could 
result loss revenues delay revenue recognition loss customers theft trade secrets data intellectual property and 
increased service and warranty cost any which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results operations 
undiscovered vulnerabilities our products alone combination with third party hardware software could expose them 
hackers other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could 
attack our products actual perceived security vulnerabilities our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers

are unable effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations our ability 
generate growth and revenue from new existing customers may adversely affected 
because our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex our personnel resources and infrastructure could 
become strained and our reputation the market and our ability successfully manage and grow our business may adversely 
affected the size complexity and diverse nature our business and the expansion our product lines and customer base have 
placed increased demands our management and operations and further growth any may place additional strains our 
resources the future our ability effectively compete and manage our planned future growth will depend among other 
things the following 
maintaining continuity our senior management and key personnel 
increasing the productivity our existing employees 
attracting retaining training and motivating our employees particularly our technical and management personnel 
deploying our solutions using third party information systems which may require changes our applications 
documentation and operational processes 
improving our operational financial and management controls and 
improving our information reporting systems and procedures 
the company has increasingly diversified the nature its businesses both organically and acquisition result increasing 
amount our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from 
those required manage our historical core businesses 
over the last few years have focused more saas subscription models result expect derive increasing portion 
our revenues the future from subscriptions this subscription model provides our customers the right access certain 
our software hosted environment use downloaded software for specified subscription period market acceptance such 
offerings affected variety factors including but not limited security reliability performance current license terms 
customer preference social community engagement customer concerns with entrusting third party store and manage their

increasing portion our revenue generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue our customers have 
obligation renew their agreements for our software maintenance subscription services after the expiration their initial 
contract period which typically ranges from one five years our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline fluctuate 
result number factors including overall economic conditions the health their businesses competitive offerings and 
customer dissatisfaction with our services customers not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and 
subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction the number licenses that sell even 
our customer acquisition rates not change will have negative impact our future maintenance revenue growth since its 
introduction our software service delivery model has also contributed subscription revenue any our assumptions 
about expenses revenue revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect our attempts improve 
efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will 
negatively impacted 
continually evaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models 
delivery methods and terms and conditions changes our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including 
the timing the release enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term the contract discounts promotions and 
other factors could impact the timing the recognition revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could 
adversely affect our operating results and financial condition may implement different licensing models which require the 
company recognize licensing fees over longer period over the last few years have increasingly offered additional products 
through saas model saas revenues are currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any significant increase 
the percentage our business generated from such subscription model could increase the amount revenue recognized 
over time opposed upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have negative impact our operating results 
any quarterly period due these complexities may not able accurately forecast our revenue which could cause 
miss our earnings estimates revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price 
face substantial competition our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates impair our operating 
results and financial condition 
our markets are highly competitive and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase the future our overall 
competitive position depends number factors including the price quality and performance our products the effectiveness 
our distribution channel and direct sales force the level customer service the development new technology and our ability 
participate emerging markets within each our markets encounter direct competition from other gnss software 
optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger and non competitors and new market 
entrants particularly from emerging markets such china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location 
information may subject competition from alternative location technologies such simultaneous location and mapping 
technology sell increasing amount software and subscription services face competition from group large 
well established companies with whom have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may 
subject increasing competition from mass market devices such smartphones and tablets used conjunction with relatively 
inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications the past these developments may 
require rapidly adapt technological and customer preference changes that have not previously been exposed including 
those related cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has the past resulted and 
the future may result price reductions reduced margins loss market share any which could decrease our revenue and 
growth rates impair our operating results and financial condition believe that our ability compete successfully the 
future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely our ability execute our strategy provide products 
with significantly differentiated features compared currently available products may not able implement this strategy 
successfully and our products may not competitive with other technologies products that may developed our competitors 
many whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than 
are dependent new products and services and are unable successfully introduce them into the market 
effectively compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline fail grow anticipated 
our future revenue stream depends large degree our ability bring new products and services market timely basis 
must continue make significant investments research and development order continue develop new products and 
services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance such products and services may encounter problems 
the future innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not successfully 
completed developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for 
technology products are difficult predict and might not achieve our goals the timing introducing new technology 
products could encounter increased costs the timely availability and cost effective production these products volume 
and their acceptance customers are important our future success are unable introduce new products and services 
other companies develop competing technology products and services not develop compelling new products and 
services our number customers may not grow anticipated may decline which could harm our operating results many 
our offerings are increasingly focused software and saas subscription services the software industry characterized 
rapidly changing customer preferences which require address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud 
computing life cycles software products can short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products 
the introduction third party solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence new industry standards 
could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete non competitive are not able develop 
software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs our customers are unable adapt 
new platforms technologies new industry standards that impact our markets our ability retain increase market share and 
operating results could materially adversely affected 
changes our effective tax rate may reduce our net income future periods

judgment required determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate largely based the geographic 
mix earnings statutory rates inter company transfer pricing and enacted tax laws number factors may increase our future 
effective tax rates including 
the jurisdictions which profits are determined earned and taxed

the tax act the changes included the tax act are broad and complex the final transition impacts the tax act may differ 
from the estimates provided elsewhere this report possibly materially due among other things changes interpretations 
the tax act any legislative action address questions that arise because the tax act any changes accounting standards 
for income taxes related interpretations response the tax act any updates changes provisional estimates have 
recorded regarding the tax act impacts including impacts from changes foreign earnings estimates the impact the newly 
enacted tax act our future effective tax rates uncertain and could adversely affect our effective tax rates the implementation 
new practices and processes designed comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could 
require make substantial changes our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could 
negatively affect our business results operations and financial condition 
additionally longstanding international tax norms that determine each country jurisdiction tax cross border international trade 
are evolving result the beps reporting requirements recommended the and the oecd october 
the oecd issued series reports recommending changes numerous long standing tax principles many these 
recommendations are being adopted various countries which business and may increase our taxes these countries 
the foreign countries where business may change tax laws regulations and interpretations prospective retroactive 
basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates these and other tax laws and related regulations 
change our financial results could materially impacted given the unpredictability these possible changes and their potential 
interdependency very difficult assess whether the overall effect such potential tax changes would cumulatively positive 
negative for our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 
are currently various stages multiple year examinations federal state and foreign taxing authorities including review 
our tax years the internal revenue service irs the irs the taxing authorities any other

recognition guidance under gaap effective fiscal the asc revenue recognition standard establishes principle 
for recognizing revenue upon the transfer promised goods services customers amount that reflects the expected 
consideration received exchange for those goods services the standard also provides guidance the recognition costs 
related obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts this new standard both technical and complex and have incurred 
significant costs implement and maintain compliance with this new standard the new standard may impact the timing and 
amounts revenue recognized similarly new lease standard asc effective fiscal replaces the current lease 
standard most prominent the recognition assets and liabilities lessees for those leases classified operating leases under 
the current lease standard adoption the new revenue recognition standard and lease standard along with any other changes 
accounting principles interpretations could also have significant effect our reported financial results any difficulties 
the implementation new changed accounting standards could cause fail meet our financial reporting obligations 
our estimates relating our critical accounting policies are based assumptions judgments that change prove incorrect 
our operating results could fall below expectations securities analysts and investors resulting decline our stock price

are dependent specific manufacturer and assembler for many our products and other manufacturers and 
specific suppliers critical parts for our products 
are substantially dependent upon flex ltd our preferred manufacturing partner for many our gnss products under 
our agreement with flex provide twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders with flex least thirty calendar 
days advance the scheduled delivery products our customers depending production lead time although purchase 
orders placed with flex are cancelable the terms the agreement would require purchase from flex all inventory not 
returnable usable other flex customers accordingly inaccurately forecast demand for our products may unable 
obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flex meet customers delivery requirements may accumulate excess 
inventories such inventories are not usable other flex customers our current contract with flex continues effect until 
either party gives the other ninety days written notice 
rely specific suppliers for number our critical components and other contract manufacturers including benchmark 
electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly certain products and components have experienced shortages 
components the past our current reliance specific limited group suppliers and contract manufacturers involves 
risks including potential inability obtain adequate supply required components reduced control over pricing and delivery 
schedules discontinuation increased prices for certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact 
the viability our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may exacerbated during any period economic 
recovery competitive environment any inability obtain adequate deliveries any other circumstance that would require 
seek alternative sources supply manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay 
our ability ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our 
reputation and brand well our operating results 
are dependent the availability and unimpaired use allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our 
products may subject harmful interference from new modified spectrum uses 
our gnss technology dependent the use satellite signals and terrestrial communication bands international allocations 
radio frequency are made the international telecommunications union itu specialized technical agency the united 
nations these allocations are further governed radio regulations that have treaty status and which may subject modification 
every two three years the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how 
each band used the country the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national 
telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage 
regulations 
any itu local reallocation radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing spectrum other 
modifications the permitted uses relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability 
our products and have significant negative impacts our customers both which could reduce demand for our products for 
example the fcc has been considering proposals repurpose spectrum adjacent the gps bands for terrestrial broadband 
wireless operations throughout the united states the fcc were permit implementation such proposals similar proposals 
terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference gps receivers within range such operations and 
impose costs retrofit replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use frequencies 
used our products well adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference our products 
many our products use other radio frequency bands such the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal 
provide enhanced gnss capabilities such real time kinematics precision the continuing availability these non gnss 
radio frequencies essential provide enhanced gnss products our precision survey agriculture and construction machine 
controls markets addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating adjacent frequency 
bands band may impair the utility and reliability our products any regulatory changes spectrum allocation 
allowable operating conditions could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition 
many our products rely gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded inoperable 
and result lost revenue 
gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject electronic and 
mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many the gps satellites currently orbit were originally designed 
have lives years and are subject damage the hostile space environment which they operate however the current 
deployment operational satellites orbit seven have been operation for more than years and over half have been 
use for more than years repair damaged malfunctioning satellites currently not economically feasible significant 
number satellites were become inoperable there could substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites 
reduction the number operating satellites below the satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility the 
gps system and the growth current and additional market opportunities addition software updates gps satellites and 
ground control segments can cause problems and depend public access open technical specifications advance such 
updates mitigate these problems 
are dependent continued operation gps the principal gnss currently operation the gps constellation operated 
the government which committed maintenance and improvement gps supporting policies were change 
user fees were imposed could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition 
many our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such the wide area augmentation system and national 
differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data mobile satellite services frequencies utilized our 
rtx corrections services some these augmentation systems are operated the government and rely continued funding 
and maintenance these systems any curtailment the operating capability these systems limitations access use 
the signals discontinuance service could result degradation our services product performance with adverse 
effect our business 
many our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are 
the process creating their own gnss systems and either have developed will develop products which use gnss 
signals from these systems the european community developing independent radio navigation satellite system known 
galileo national european authorities may provide preferential access signals companies associated with their markets 
including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use non gnss signals may also subject fcc 
waiver requirements and restrictions based upon international trade geopolitical considerations are unable develop 
timely and competitive commercial products using these systems obtain timely and equal access service signals this could 
result lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use their 
gnss systems the detriment trimble products using the gps system which would harm our business 
are subject the impact governmental and other certifications processes and regulations which could adversely 
affect our products and our business 
market many products that are subject governmental regulations and certifications before they can sold the european 
union increasingly regulates the use our products agriculture construction and other types machinery certification 
required for gnss receivers and data communications products which must conform the european harmonized gnss 
receiver standard and the radio equipment directive sold the european community delays publication the european 
harmonized gnss receiver standard could affect gnss product access european markets the future governmental 
authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface other 
specifications inability obtain any such certifications timely manner could have adverse effect our operating 
results governmental authorities may also propose other forms gps receiver performance standards which may limit design 
alternatives hamper product innovation impose additional costs some our products that use integrated radio communication 
technology require product type certification and some products require end user obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage inability delay obtaining such certifications changes applicable rules could adversely affect our ability 
bring our products market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore our operating results compliance 
with evolving product regulations our major markets could require that redesign our products cease selling products 
certain markets and increase our costs product development failure comply may result fines and limitations sales

allocate the fair value purchase consideration the assets acquired liabilities assumed and non controlling interests the 
acquiree based their fair values the acquisition date the excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair 
value these assets acquired liabilities assumed and non controlling interests the acquiree recorded goodwill 
when determining the fair values assets acquired liabilities assumed and non controlling interests the acquiree management 
makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect intangible assets critical estimates valuing intangible 
assets include but are not limited expected future cash flows which includes consideration future growth rates and margins 
customer attrition rates future changes technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value 
estimates are based the assumptions management believes market participant would use pricing the asset liability

process when perform quantitative assessment goodwill impairment the determination fair value reporting unit 
involves the use significant estimates and assumptions the discounted cash flows are based upon among other things 
assumptions about expected future operating performance using risk adjusted discount rates actual future results may differ from 
those estimates

stock based compensation 
recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made our employees and directors based estimated 
fair values net estimated forfeitures the awards include restricted stock units with time based market based and performancebased vesting conditions rights purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options 
the determination fair value share based payment awards the date grant using option pricing model affected 
our stock price well assumptions regarding number highly complex and subjective variables these variables include 
our expected stock price volatility over the term the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
risk free interest rates and any expected dividends addition the binomial model incorporates actual option pricing behavior 
and changes volatility over the option contractual term 
the fair value restricted stock units with market based vesting conditions valued the grant date using monte carlo 
simulation the monte carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions the binomial option pricing model 
outlined above however also incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market based vesting 
conditions may not satisfied and the impact the possible differing stock price paths for trimble and each the constituents

restructuring charges included our gaap presentation cost sales and operating expenses restructuring charges 
recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions employee headcount connection with 
our company restructurings exclude restructuring charges from our non gaap measures because believe they 
not reflect expected future operating expenses they are not indicative our core operating performance and they are not 
meaningful comparisons our past operating performance have incurred restructuring expense each the last 
three years however the amount incurred can vary significantly based whether restructuring has occurred the period 
and the timing headcount reductions 
amortization purchased intangible assets included our gaap presentation gross margin and operating expenses 
amortization purchased intangible assets gaap accounting requires that intangible assets are recorded fair 
value and amortized over their useful lives consequently the timing and size our acquisitions will cause our operating 
results vary from period period making comparison past performance difficult for investors this accounting 
treatment may cause differences when comparing our results companies that grow internally because the fair value 
assigned the intangible assets acquired through acquisition may significantly exceed the equivalent expenses that 
company may incur for similar efforts when performed internally furthermore the useful life that use amortize our 
intangible assets over may substantially different from the time period that internal growth company incurs and 
recognizes such expenses believe that excluding the amortization purchased intangible assets which primarily 
represents technology and customer relationships already developed provides alternative way for investors 
compare our operations pre acquisition those post acquisitions and those our competitors that have pursued internal 
growth strategies however note that companies that grow internally will incur costs develop intangible assets that 
will expensed the period incurred which may make direct comparison more difficult 
stock based compensation included our gaap presentation cost sales and operating expenses stock based 
compensation consists expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock 
purchase plan exclude stock based compensation expense from our non gaap measures because some investors may

inventory included our gaap presentation cost sales the increase inventory value amortized cost sales 
over the period that the related product sold exclude inventory step amortization from our non gaap measures 
because non cash expense that not believe indicative our ongoing operating results further believe 
that excluding this item from our non gaap results useful investors that allows for period over period

external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such 
legal due diligence integration and other required closing costs well adjustments the fair value earn out

unusual acquisition investment and divestiture gains losses although numerous acquisitions the costs that have 
been excluded from the non gaap measures are costs specific particular acquisitions these are one time costs that vary 
significantly amount and timing and are not indicative our core operating performance 
executive transition costs included our gaap presentation operating expenses are amounts paid the company 
former cfo upon his departure under the terms his executive severance agreement excluded these payments from

market interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily treasury bills debt securities and commercial paper interest 
and non interest bearing bank deposits well bank time deposits the main objective these instruments safety principal 
and liquidity while maximizing return without significantly increasing risk 
due the nature our cash equivalents and short term investments where they are readily convertible cash not anticipate 
any material effect our portfolio due fluctuations interest rates 
are exposed market risk due the possibility changing interest rates under our credit facilities our credit facility 
comprised revolving credit agreement and letter credit sub facility with maturity dates november and also 
two unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreements that are callable the bank any time may borrow funds under 
these facilities dollars certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest described under note notes 
the consolidated financial statements 
the end fiscal had outstanding revolving loan million under the credit facility and revolving 
credit line million under the uncommitted facilities hypothetical increase our borrowing rates the end 
fiscal could result approximately million annual increase interest expense these existing principal balances 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will different from what actually occurs the future 
furthermore the computations not anticipate actions that may taken our management should the hypothetical market 
changes actually occur over time result actual earnings effects the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
operate international markets which expose market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
between the dollar and various foreign currencies the most significant which the euro 
historically the majority our revenue contracts are denominated dollars with the most significant exception being 
europe where invoice primarily euros additionally portion our expenses primarily the cost manufacture cost 
personnel deliver technical support our products and professional services sales and sales support and research and 
development are denominated foreign currencies primarily the euro 
revenue resulting from selling local currencies and costs incurred local currencies are exposed foreign currency exchange 
rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income exchange rates vary operating income may differ from expectations 
fiscal revenue and operating income were favorably impacted foreign currency exchange rates million and 
million respectively 
enter into foreign currency forward contracts minimize the short term impact foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
cash and certain trade and inter company receivables and payables primarily denominated euro british pound new zealand 
dollars and canadian dollars these contracts reduce the exposure fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses the forward 
contracts these instruments are marked market through earnings every period and generally range from one two months
