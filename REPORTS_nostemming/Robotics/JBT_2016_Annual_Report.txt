increase energy raw material prices may reduce the profitability our customers which ultimately could negatively affect our business 
financial condition results operations and cash flows 
energy prices are volatile and have been historically high high energy prices have negative trickledown effect our customers business 
operations reducing their profitability because increased operating costs our customers require large amounts energy run their businesses 
particularly the air transportation industry higher energy prices can reduce passenger and cargo air carrier profitability result increased jet 
and ground support equipment fuel prices higher energy prices also increase food processors operating costs through increased energy and utility 
costs run their plants higher priced chemical and petroleum based raw materials used food processing and higher fuel costs run their logistics 
and service fleet vehicles 
food processors are also affected the cost and availability raw materials such feed grains livestock produce and dairy products increases 
the cost and limitations the availability such raw materials can negatively affect the profitability food processors operations

are highly regulated curb misappropriation funds and ensure uniform policies and practices across various governmental agencies funding 
for such contracts tied national defense budgets and procurement programs that are annually negotiated and approved disapproved the 
department defense the executive branch and the congress for example there were any shifts spending priorities funding for the 
military cargo loader program were reduced canceled result the sequestration policy changes for other reasons the resulting loss 
revenue could have material adverse impact our jbt aerotech business many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions 
that are not applicable private contracts particular defense contracts are unilaterally terminable the option the government with 
compensation only for work completed and costs incurred date addition any deliverable delays under such contracts result our nonperformance could also have negative impact these contracts 
non compliance with the laws and regulations governing government contracts subcontracts may result significant sanctions such

customers strategic targets such those relating transportation and food processing may greater risk future terrorist attacks than other 
targets the united states our airport authority airline air cargo and ground handling customers are particularly sensitive safety concerns and 
their businesses may decline after terrorist attacks threats during periods political instability when travelers are concerned about safety issues

may lose money not achieve our expected profitability fixed price contracts 
customary for several the business areas which operate may provide products and services under fixed price contracts under such 
contracts are typically responsible for cost overruns our actual costs and any gross profit realized these fixed price contracts may vary from 
our estimates which the pricing for such contracts was based there are inherent risks and uncertainties the estimation process including those 
arising from unforeseen technical and logistical challenges longer than expected lead times for sourcing raw materials and assemblies fixedprice contract may significantly limit prohibit our ability mitigate the impact unanticipated increases raw material prices including the 
price steel and other significant raw materials passing such price increases depending the volume our work performed under fixedprice contracts any one time differences actual versus estimated performance could have material adverse impact our business financial

even with rigorous testing prior release and investment product quality processes problems may found newly developed enhanced 
products after such products are launched and shipped customers resolution such issues may cause project delays additional development 
costs and deferred lost revenue 
new products and enhancements our existing products may also reduce demand for our existing products could delay purchases customers 
who instead decide wait for our new enhanced products difficulties that arise our managing the transition from our older products our new 
enhanced products could result additional costs and deferred lost revenue

critical accounting estimates 
prepare our consolidated financial statements conformity with generally accepted accounting principles such are required make 
certain estimates judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain ongoing basis our management evaluates these 
estimates judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because the critical impact that these factors have the reported amounts assets and 
liabilities the dates the financial statements and the reported amounts revenue and expenses during the periods presented management has 
discussed the development and selection these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee our board directors and the audit 
committee has reviewed this disclosure believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used preparing our financial 
statements 
inventory valuation 
inventory recorded the lower cost net realizable value order determine net realizable value evaluate each component inventory 
regular basis determine whether excess obsolete record the estimated decline the carrying value excess obsolete inventory 
reduction inventory and expense included cost sales the period which identified our estimate excess and obsolete 
inventory critical accounting estimate because highly susceptible change from period period addition requires management 
make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
order quantify excess obsolete inventory begin preparing candidate listing the components inventory that have not 
demonstrated usage within the most recent three year period this list then reviewed management personnel determine whether this list 
potential excess obsolete inventory items have orders expected demand the near term the remaining items the candidate listing are 
written down their estimated net realizable value inherent the estimates net realizable value are estimates related our future manufacturing 
schedules customer demand possible alternative uses and ultimate realization potentially excess inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess the cost acquired business over the amounts assigned the identifiable net assets goodwill not amortized 
but tested for impairment reporting unit level annual basis whenever event occurs circumstances change that would more likely 
than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying amount are required make certain subjective and complex judgments 
assessing whether event that could indicate impairment goodwill has occurred and must make assumptions and estimates determine the 
fair value our reporting units may first assess qualitative factors make this determination conclude that not more likely than not 
that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount based our qualitative assessment then quantitative test not necessary 
may also choose bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test performing the quantitative test determine the fair 
value reporting unit using the income approach valuation method use discounted cash flow model which cash flows anticipated over 
several periods plus terminal value the end that time horizon are discounted their present value using appropriate cost capital rate 
judgment required developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit 
margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital expenditures and working capital requirements among others the 
estimated fair value reporting unit exceeds its carrying value consider that goodwill not impaired the carrying value exceeds estimated 
fair value there indication potential impairment and calculate implied fair value goodwill the implied fair value calculated 
the difference between the fair value the reporting unit and the fair value the individual assets and liabilities the reporting unit excluding 
goodwill impairment charge recorded for any excess the carrying value over the implied fair value 
completed our annual goodwill impairment test october using quantitative assessment approach result this assessment 
noted that the fair value each reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value and therefore none our goodwill was impaired 
self insurance reserves 
purchase third party insurance for employee healthcare workers compensation automobile product and general liability claims that exceed 
certain level are responsible for the payment claims below the limits the applicable insurance coverage the obligations associated with the 
incurred losses are determined using actuarial estimates these estimates are based historical information along with certain assumptions about 
future events changes assumptions for medical costs industry data legal actions well changes actual claim experience could cause these 
estimates change which could potentially material our results operations and financial condition 
income taxes 
determining our current income tax provision assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments items for tax and accounting 
purposes these differences result deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded our consolidated balance sheets when maintain 
deferred tax assets must assess the likelihood that these assets will recovered through adjustments future taxable income the extent 
believe based available evidence more likely than not that all some portion the asset will not realized establish valuation 
allowance record allowance reducing the asset value believe more likely than not being realized based our expectation 
future taxable income believe the accounting estimate related the valuation allowance critical accounting estimate because highly 
susceptible change from period period requires management make assumptions about our future income over the lives the deferred tax 
assets and the impact increasing decreasing the valuation allowance potentially material our results operations 
forecasting future income requires use significant amount judgment estimating future income use our internal operating budgets 
and long range planning projections develop our budgets and long range projections based recent results trends economic and industry 
forecasts influencing our segments performance our backlog planned timing new product launches and customer sales commitments significant 
changes the expected realization the net deferred tax assets would require that adjust the valuation allowance resulting change net 
income 
defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
the measurement pension and other post retirement plans costs require the use assumptions for discount rates investment returns employee 
turnover rates retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the actuarial assumptions used our pension and post retirement benefit reporting 
are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and post retirement 
benefit obligations while believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our 
operating results 
our accrued pension and other post retirement benefits liability reflects the funded status our worldwide plans the projected benefit obligation 
net plan assets our discount rate assumption determined developing yield curve based high quality corporate bonds with maturities 
matching the plan expected benefit payment streams the plans expected cash flows are then discounted the resulting year year spot 
rates the projected benefit obligation sensitive changes our estimate the discount rate the discount rate used calculating the projected 
benefit obligation for the pension plan which represents all pension plan obligations was and 
decrease basis points the discount rate used our calculation would increase our projected benefit obligation million 
our pension expense sensitive changes our estimate the expected rate return plan assets the expected return assets used 
calculating the pension expense for the pension plan which represents all pension plan assets was for for and

goodwill 
test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events occur changes circumstances indicate that impairment 
may have occurred impairment testing performed for each our reporting units first assessing qualitative factors see further testing 
goodwill required conclude that more likely than not that reporting unit fair value less than its carrying amount based our 
qualitative assessment then quantitative test required may also choose bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 
performing the quantitative test determine the fair value reporting unit using the income approach valuation method use 
discounted cash flow model which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus terminal value the end that time horizon are discounted 
their present value using appropriate cost capital rate judgment required developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow 
model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates perpetuity growth rates future capital 
expenditures and working capital requirements among others the estimated fair value reporting unit exceeds its carrying value consider 
that goodwill not impaired the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there indication potential impairment and calculate 
implied fair value goodwill the implied fair value calculated the difference between the fair value the reporting unit and the fair value 
the individual assets and liabilities the reporting unit excluding goodwill impairment charge recorded for any excess the carrying value 
over the implied fair value 
completed our annual goodwill impairment test october using quantitative assessment approach result this assessment 
noted that the fair value each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and therefore determined that none our goodwill was impaired

transacting only with financially secure counterparties requiring credit approvals and establishing credit limits and monitoring counterparties 
financial condition our maximum exposure credit loss the event non performance the counterparty limited the amount drawn and 
outstanding the financial instrument allowances for losses are established based collectability assessments 
note fair value financial instruments 
the fair value framework requires the categorization assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions inputs used price the 
assets liabilities level provides the most reliable measure fair value whereas level generally requires significant management judgment 
the three levels are defined follows 
level unadjusted quoted prices active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the company can assess the measurement date 
level observable inputs other than those included level that are observable for the asset liability either directly indirectly for 
example quoted prices for similar assets liabilities active markets quoted prices for identical assets liabilities inactive markets 
level unobservable inputs reflecting management own assumptions about the inputs used pricing the asset liability
