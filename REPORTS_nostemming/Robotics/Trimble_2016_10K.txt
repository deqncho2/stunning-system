the recent past uncertainties the financial and credit markets have caused our customers postpone purchases and negative 
economic conditions may reduce future sales demand for our products and services negative economic conditions 
changes tax policy may depress the tax revenues government entities which are significant purchasers our products many 
our products are sold through dealer channels and our dealers depend the availability credit both finance purchases

believe that certain business opportunities our success will depend our ability form and maintain alliances with industry 
participants such caterpillar nikon hilti and cnh global our failure form and maintain such alliances the preemption 
disruption such alliances actions competitors will adversely affect our ability sell our products customers our 
relationships with substantial industry participants such caterpillar and cnh are complex and multifaceted and are likely 
evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives the parties since these strategic relationships contribute

technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources order develop and expand our distribution channels 
must continue expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels including our 
investment systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult manage 
the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations our channel partners become familiar with our product 
offerings including our new product developments and newer types offering such software and services may make more 
difficult introduce those products end users and delay end user adoption which could result lower revenues 
disruption dealer coverage within specific geographic end user markets could cause difficulties marketing selling

result number factors including overall economic conditions the health their businesses competitive offerings and 
customer dissatisfaction with our services customers not renew their contracts for our products our maintenance and 
subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer any reduction the number licenses that sell even 
our customer acquisition rates not change will have negative impact our future maintenance revenue growth since its 
introduction our software service delivery model has also contributed subscription revenue any our assumptions 
about expenses revenue revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect our attempts improve 
efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will 
negatively impacted 
continually evaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including specific license models 
delivery methods and terms and conditions changes our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs including the 
timing the release enhancements upgrades maintenance releases the term the contract discounts promotions and other 
factors could impact the timing the recognition revenue for our products related enhancements and services and could 
adversely affect our operating results and financial condition may implement different licensing models which require the 
company recognize licensing fees over longer period over the last few years have increasingly offered additional products 
software service saas model saas revenues are currently recognized ratably over the subscription period any 
significant increase the percentage our business generated from such subscription model could increase the amount 
revenue recognized over time opposed upfront which would delay revenue recognition and have negative impact

our markets are highly competitive and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase the future our overall 
competitive position depends number factors including the price quality and performance our products the effectiveness 
our distribution channel and direct sales force the level customer service the development new technology and our ability 
participate emerging markets within each our markets encounter direct competition from other gnss software 
optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger and non competitors and new market 
entrants particularly from emerging markets such china our products which commonly use gnss for basic location 
information may subject competition from alternative location technologies such simultaneous location and mapping 
technology sell increasing amount software and subscription services face competition from group large 
well established companies with whom have not previously competed our integrated hardware and software products may 
subject increasing competition from mass market devices such smartphones and tablets used conjunction with relatively 
inexpensive applications which have not been heavily used for commercial applications the past these developments may 
require rapidly adapt technological and customer preference changes that have not previously been exposed including 
those related cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms such competition has the past resulted and 
the future may result price reductions reduced margins loss market share any which could decrease our revenue and 
growth rates impair our operating results and financial condition believe that our ability compete successfully the 
future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely our ability execute our strategy provide products

successfully and our products may not competitive with other technologies products that may developed our competitors 
many whom have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and other resources than

compete with new disruptive product alternatives our customer base may decline fail grow anticipated 
our future revenue stream depends large degree our ability bring new products and services market timely basis

services enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance such products and services may encounter problems 
the future innovating and introducing new products and services our development stage products may not successfully 
completed developed may not achieve significant customer acceptance development and manufacturing schedules for 
technology products are difficult predict and might not achieve our goals the timing introducing new technology 
products could encounter increased costs the timely availability and cost effective production these products volume

other companies develop competing technology products and services not develop compelling new products and

our offerings are increasingly focused software and subscription services the software industry characterized rapidly 
changing customer preferences which require address multiple delivery platforms new mobile devices and cloud computing 
life cycles software products can short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products the 
introduction third party solutions embodying new disruptive technologies and the emergence new industry standards could 
make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete non competitive are not able develop 
software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs our customers are unable adapt 
new technologies new industry standards that impact our markets our ability retain increase market share and operating 
results could materially adversely affected

suppliers critical parts for our products 
are substantially dependent upon flextronics international limited our preferred manufacturing partner for many our 
gnss products under our agreement with flextronics provide twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders 
with flextronics least thirty calendar days advance the scheduled delivery products our customers depending 
production lead time although purchase orders placed with flextronics are cancelable the terms the agreement would require 
purchase from flextronics all inventory not returnable usable other flextronics customers accordingly 
inaccurately forecast demand for our products may unable obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from flextronics 
meet customers delivery requirements may accumulate excess inventories such inventories are not usable other 
flextronics customers our current contract with flextronics continues effect until either party gives the other ninety days 
written notice 
rely specific suppliers for number our critical components and other contract manufacturers including benchmark 
electronics and jabil for the manufacture test and assembly certain products and components have experienced shortages 
components the past our current reliance specific limited group suppliers and contract manufacturers involves 
risks including potential inability obtain adequate supply required components reduced control over pricing and delivery 
schedules discontinuation increased prices for certain components and economic conditions which may adversely impact 
the viability our suppliers and contract manufacturers this situation may exacerbated during any period economic 
recovery competitive environment any inability obtain adequate deliveries any other circumstance that would require 
seek alternative sources supply manufacture assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay 
our ability ship our products which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our 
reputation and brand well our operating results 
are dependent the availability and unimpaired use allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products 
may subject harmful interference from new modified spectrum uses 
our gnss technology dependent the use satellite signals and terrestrial communication bands international allocations 
radio frequency are made the international telecommunications union itu specialized technical agency the united 
nations these allocations are further governed radio regulations that have treaty status and which may subject modification 
every two three years the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority over how 
each band used the country the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national 
telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage 
regulations 
any itu local reallocation radio frequency bands including frequency band segmentation and sharing spectrum other 
modifications the permitted uses relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability 
our products and have significant negative impacts our customers both which could reduce demand for our products for 
example the fcc has been considering proposals repurpose spectrum adjacent the gps bands for terrestrial broadband 
wireless operations throughout the united states the fcc were permit implementation such proposals similar proposals 
terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference gps receivers within range such operations and 
impose costs retrofit replace affected receivers similarly other countries have considered proposals for use frequencies 
used our products well adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference our products 
many our products use other radio frequency bands such the public land mobile radio bands together with the gnss signal 
provide enhanced gnss capabilities such real time kinematics precision the continuing availability these non gnss 
radio frequencies essential provide enhanced gnss products our precision survey agriculture and construction machine 
controls markets addition transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating adjacent frequency 
bands band may impair the utility and reliability our products any regulatory changes spectrum allocation 
allowable operating conditions could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition 
many our products rely gnss technology gps and other satellite systems which may become degraded inoperable and 
result lost revenue 
gnss technology gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject electronic and 
mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption many the gps satellites currently orbit were originally designed 
have lives years and are subject damage the hostile space environment which they operate however the current 
deployment operational satellites orbit six have been operation for more than years and over half have been use 
for more than years repair damaged malfunctioning satellites currently not economically feasible significant 
number satellites were become inoperable there could substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites 
reduction the number operating satellites below the satellite standard established for gps may impair the utility the 
gps system and the growth current and additional market opportunities addition software updates gps satellites and 
ground control segments can cause problems and depend public access open technical specifications advance such 
updates mitigate these problems 
are dependent continued operation gps the principal gnss currently operation the gps constellation operated 
the government which committed maintenance and improvement gps supporting policies were change 
user fees were imposed could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition 
many our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such the wide area augmentation system and national 
differential gps system and satellites transmitting signal corrections data mobile satellite services frequencies utilized our 
rtx corrections services some these augmentation systems are operated the government and rely continued funding 
and maintenance these systems any curtailment the operating capability these systems limitations access use 
the signals discontinuance service could result degradation our services product performance with adverse 
effect our business 
many our products use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are 
the process creating their own gnss systems and either have developed will develop products which use gnss 
signals from these systems the european community developing independent radio navigation satellite system known 
galileo national european authorities may provide preferential access signals companies associated with their markets 
including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use non gnss signals may also subject fcc 
waiver requirements and restrictions based upon international trade geopolitical considerations are unable develop 
timely and competitive commercial products using these systems obtain timely and equal access service signals this could 
result lost revenue these authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use their 
gnss systems the detriment trimble products using the gps system which would harm our business 
are subject the impact governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely 
affect our products and our business 
market certain products that are subject governmental and similar certifications before they can sold for example 
certification required for gnss receivers and data communications products conforming the european harmonized gnss 
receiver standard and the radio equipment directive sold the european community delays publication the european 
harmonized gnss receiver standard could affect gnss product access european markets the future governmental 
authorities may propose gps receiver testing and certification for compliance with published gps signal interface other 
specifications inability obtain any such certifications timely manner could have adverse effect our operating 
results governmental authorities may also propose other forms gps receiver performance standards which may limit design 
alternatives hamper product innovation impose additional costs some our products that use integrated radio communication 
technology require product type certification and some products require end user obtain licensing from the fcc for frequencyband usage these are secondary licenses that are subject certain restrictions inability delay obtaining such certifications 
changes the rules the fcc could adversely affect our ability bring our products market which could harm our customer 
relationships and therefore our operating results any failure obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating 
results 
have claims and lawsuits against that may result adverse outcomes

non gaap income tax provision 
believe that providing investors with the non gaap income tax provision beneficial because provides for consistent

restructuring charges included our gaap presentation cost sales and operating expenses restructuring charges 
recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions employee headcount connection with 
our company restructurings exclude restructuring charges from our non gaap measures because believe they 
not reflect expected future operating expenses they are not indicative our core operating performance and they are not 
meaningful comparisons our past operating performance have incurred restructuring expense each the last 
three years however the amount incurred can vary significantly based whether restructuring has occurred the period 
and the timing headcount reductions 
amortization purchased intangible assets included our gaap presentation gross margin and operating expenses 
amortization purchased intangible assets gaap accounting requires that intangible assets are recorded fair 
value and amortized over their useful lives consequently the timing and size our acquisitions will cause our operating 
results vary from period period making comparison past performance difficult for investors this accounting 
treatment may cause differences when comparing our results companies that grow internally because the fair value 
assigned the intangible assets acquired through acquisition may significantly exceed the equivalent expenses that 
company may incur for similar efforts when performed internally furthermore the useful life that use amortize our 
intangible assets over may substantially different from the time period that internal growth company incurs and 
recognizes such expenses believe that excluding the amortization purchased intangible assets which primarily 
represents technology and customer relationships already developed provides alternative way for investors 
compare our operations pre acquisition those post acquisitions and those our competitors that have pursued internal 
growth strategies however note that companies that grow internally will incur costs develop intangible assets that 
will expensed the period incurred which may make direct comparison more difficult 
stock based compensation included our gaap presentation cost sales and operating expenses stock based 
compensation consists expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock 
purchase plan exclude stock based compensation expense from our non gaap measures because some investors may 
view not reflective our core operating performance non cash expense for fiscal years and 
stock based compensation was allocated follows

amortization acquisition related inventory step the purchase accounting entries associated with our business 
acquisitions require record inventory its fair value which sometimes greater than the previous book value the 
inventory included our gaap presentation cost sales the increase inventory value amortized cost sales 
over the period that the related product sold exclude inventory step amortization from our non gaap measures 
because non cash expense that not believe indicative our ongoing operating results further believe 
that excluding this item from our non gaap results useful investors that allows for period over period 
comparability 
acquisition divestiture items included our gaap presentation operating expenses acquisition costs consist 
external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such 
legal due diligence and integration costs well adjustments the fair value our earn out liabilities included 
our gaap presentation non operating income expense net acquisition divestiture items includes unusual acquisition 
investment divestiture gains losses although numerous acquisitions the costs that have been excluded from the 
non gaap measures are costs specific particular acquisitions these are one time costs that vary significantly amount 
and timing and are not indicative our core operating performance
