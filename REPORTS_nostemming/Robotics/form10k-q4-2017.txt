product sales and licensing agreements 
typically license our software customers under non exclusive license agreements that restrict 
use our software specified purposes within specified geographical areas the majority our 
licenses are network licenses that allow number individual users access the software 
defined network including some cases regional global networks license fees depend the 
type license product mix and number copies each product licensed 
number cases provide our customers the right mix portion the software they 
initially licensed for other specified synopsys products for example customer may use our front end 
design products for portion the license term and then exchange such products for back end 
place and route software for the remainder the term order complete the customer design 
this practice helps ensure the customer access the complete design flow needed design their 
product offering remix rights customers gives advantage over competitors who offer 
narrower range products because customers can obtain more their design flow from single 
vendor the same time because such cases the customer need not obtain new license and 
pay additional license fee for the use the additional products the use these arrangements 
could result reduced revenue compared licensing the individual products separately without mix

risk factors 
description the risk factors associated with our business set forth below investors should 
carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing our common stock 
the growth our business depends the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the growth the electronic design automation eda industry whole and our eda and 
intellectual property product sales particular dependent the semiconductor and electronics 
industries substantial portion our business and revenue depends upon the commencement 
new design projects semiconductor manufacturers and their customers the increasing complexity 
designs systems chips and integrated circuits and customers concerns about managing 
costs have previously led and the future could lead decrease design starts and design 
activity general with some customers focusing more one discrete phase the design process 
opting for less advanced but less risky manufacturing processes that may not require the most 
advanced eda products demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial 
condition and results operations could adversely affected growth the semiconductor and 
electronics industries slows stalls additionally the eda industry matures consolidation may 
result stronger competition from companies better able compete sole source vendors this 
increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate decline and exert downward pressure 
our operating margins which may have adverse effect our business and financial condition 
furthermore the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex 
ecosystems many our customers outsource the manufacture their semiconductor designs 
foundries our customers also frequently incorporate third party whether provided other 
vendors into their designs improve the efficiency their design process work closely with 
major foundries ensure that our eda and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their 
manufacturing processes similarly work closely with other major providers semiconductor 
particularly microprocessor optimize our eda tools for use with their designs and assure 
that their and our own products which may each provide for the design separate components 
the same chip work effectively together fail optimize our eda and solutions for use with 
major foundries manufacturing processes major providers products our access such 
foundry processes third party products hampered then our solutions may become less 
desirable our customers resulting adverse effect our business and financial condition 
consolidation among our customers and within the industries which operate well 
our dependence relatively small number large customers may negatively impact our 
operating results 
number business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships 
among our customers the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last 
several years and more could occur the future consolidation among our customers could lead 
fewer customers the loss customers increased customer bargaining power reduced customer 
spending software and services furthermore depend relatively small number large 
customers and such customers continuing renew licenses and purchase additional products 
from for large portion our revenue reduced customer spending the loss small number 
customers particularly our large customers could adversely affect our business and financial 
condition addition and our competitors from time time acquire businesses and technologies 
complement and expand our respective product offerings any our competitors consolidate

impact our business and operating results 
uncertainty the global economy and its potential impact the semiconductor and 
electronics industries particular may negatively affect our business operating results and 
financial condition 
while the global economy has shown improvement recent years there are still uncertainties 
surrounding the strength the recovery many regions uncertainty caused challenging global 
economic conditions could lead some our customers postpone their decision making decrease 
their spending and delay their payments such caution semiconductor companies could 
among other things limit our ability maintain increase our sales recognize revenue from 
committed contracts 
cannot predict the stability the economy whole the industries which operate 
further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and 
result credit downgrades the banks rely for foreign currency forward contracts credit and

our business and financial condition 
our operating results may fluctuate the future which may adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results are subject quarterly and annual fluctuations which may adversely affect our 
stock price our historical results should not viewed indicative our future performance due 
these periodic fluctuations 
many factors may cause our revenue earnings fluctuate including 
changes demand for our products especially products such hardware generating 
upfront revenue due fluctuations demand for our customers products and due 
constraints our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and 
services 
product competition the eda industry which can change rapidly due industry customer 
consolidation and technological innovation 
our ability innovate and introduce new products and services effectively integrate 
products and technologies that acquire 
failures delays completing sales due our lengthy sales cycle which often includes 
substantial customer evaluation and approval process because the complexity our 
products and services 
our ability implement effective cost control measures 
our dependence relatively small number large customers and such customers 
continuing renew licenses and purchase additional products from for large portion 
our revenue 
changes the mix our products sold increased sales our products with lower gross 
margins such our hardware products may reduce our overall margins 
expenses related our acquisition and integration businesses and technology 
changes tax rules well changes our effective tax rate including the tax effects 
infrequent unusual transactions 
delays increased costs quality issues resulting from our reliance third parties 
manufacture our hardware products which include sole supplier for certain hardware 
components and 
general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics 
industries 
the timing revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings fluctuate due factors 
that include 
cancellations changes levels orders the mix between upfront products revenue and 
time based products revenue 
delay one more orders for particular period particularly orders generating upfront 
products revenue such hardware 
delay the completion professional services projects that require significant modification 
customization and are accounted for using the percentage completion method 
delay the completion and delivery products development that customers have paid 
for early access 
customer contract amendments renewals that provide discounts defer revenue later 
periods 
the levels our hardware revenues which are recognized upfront and are primarily 
dependent upon our ability provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements 
and which may also impact our levels excess and obsolete inventory expenses and 
changes our revenue recognition model 
these factors any other factors risks discussed herein could negatively impact our revenue 
earnings and cause our stock price decline additionally our results may fail meet exceed the 
expectations securities analysts and investors such analysts may change their recommendation 
regarding our stock which could cause our stock price decline our stock price has been and may

products design starts and our customers budgetary constraints technology these industries 
evolves rapidly and characterized frequent product introductions and improvements well 
changes industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality 
requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease substantially increasing the 
complexity cost and risk chip design and manufacturing the same time our customers and 
potential customers continue demand overall lower total cost design which can lead the

business summary 
synopsys inc provides software intellectual property and services used designers across the 
entire silicon software spectrum from engineers creating advanced semiconductors software 
developers seeking ensure the security and quality their applications are global leader 
supplying the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use design and test 
integrated circuits ics also known chips also offer intellectual property products which 
are pre designed circuits that engineers use components larger chip designs rather than design 
those circuits themselves provide software and hardware used develop the electronic systems 
that incorporate chips and the software that runs them complement these offerings provide 
technical services and support help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems 
are also leading provider software tools and services that are used improve the security and 
quality software code wide variety industries including electronics financial services media 
automotive medicine energy and industrials 
our eda and customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies our 
solutions help these companies overcome the challenges developing increasingly advanced 
electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs while our 
products are important part our customers development process their research and 
development budget and spending decisions may affected their business outlook and willingness 
invest new and increasingly complex chip designs addition number consolidations have 
taken place the semiconductor industry over the past several years while not believe 
customer consolidations have had material impact our results the future impact ongoing 
consolidation uncertain for discussion potential risks please see the risk factor titled 
consolidation among our customers and within the industries which operate well our 
dependence relatively small number large customers may negatively impact our operating 
results part item risk factors 
despite global economic uncertainty have consistently grown our revenue since achieved these 
results not only because our solid execution leading technologies and strong customer relationships but 
also because our time based revenue business model under this model substantial majority our 
customers pay over time and typically recognize this revenue over the life the contract which averages 
approximately three years time based revenue consists time based products maintenance and service 
revenue the revenue recognize particular period generally results from selling efforts prior periods 
rather than the current period due our business model decreases well increases customer 
spending not immediately affect our revenues significant way 
our growth strategy based building our leadership our eda products expanding and 
proliferating our offerings and driving growth the software security and quality market continue 
expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market for instance the software security and 
quality space and hardware product sales grow expect experience increased variability our 
total revenue though expect time based revenue continue represent least all revenue 
other than hardware revenue overall our business outlook remains solid based our leading 
technologies customer relationships business model diligent expense management and acquisition 
strategy believe that these factors will help continue execute our strategies successfully 
fiscal year end

fiscal financial performance summary 
fiscal compared fiscal our financial performance reflects the following 
revenues were billion increase million primarily driven the 
overall growth our business mainly due higher tsl revenues hardware sales and 
professional services revenue 
total cost revenue and operating expenses were billion increase million 
primarily due increases headcount including those from acquisitions 
higher operating income million increase million 
during fiscal our revenue was time based 
effect new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update 
asu revenue from contracts with customers topic which supersedes the revenue 
recognition requirements revenue recognition topic this asu requires entity 
recognize revenue when goods are transferred services are provided customers amount 
that reflects the consideration which the entity expects entitled exchange for those goods 
services this asu also requires disclosures enabling users financial statements understand 
the nature amount timing and uncertainty revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with 
customers 
since the issuance topic the fasb has issued several amendments the asu including 
deferral the adoption date initially proposed clarification accounting for licenses intellectual 
property and identifying performance obligations 
topic will effective for beginning fiscal including interim periods within that reporting 
period the asu permits two retrospective methods for adoption will adopt topic using the 
modified retrospective method under which the cumulative effect initially applying the guidance 
recognized the date initial application 
under the modified retrospective transition method will evaluate each contract that effective 
the adoption date that contract had been accounted for under topic from contract inception 
some revenue that would have been recognized future periods under topic will recast under 
topic the revenue had been recognized prior periods this transition method requires 
that not adjust historical reported revenue amounts the revenue that would have been 
recognized under this method prior the adoption date will cumulative catch adjustment 
retained earnings and will not recognized revenue future periods previously planned 
because expect that slightly lower percentage our revenue will recognized over time under 
topic expect have small percentage our year end backlog adjusted retained 
earnings upon adoption 
derive the majority our total revenue from technology subscription license tsl contracts 
believe that the promised licenses software functional intellectual property and the promise 
provide substantive timely and technologically relevant updates and services our tsl contracts 
reflect inputs combined item that represents single overall promise provide customer access 
suite eda software integrated solution that will evolve our customers industries evolve 
through rapid technology changes accordingly have concluded that this single overall promise will 
recognized revenue over the term the contract period accordingly expect that there will 
not material change the nature and timing revenue recognition for our tsl contracts 
under topic 
the timing revenue recognition for our upfront products maintenance and professional services 
expected remain substantially unchanged 
continue assess all potential impacts topic other multiple element software 
arrangements that combine many software related deliverables the requirement have vsoe for 
undelivered elements not necessary separate revenue from delivered software licenses which 
essential criterion for separation under the current revenue standard revenue would longer 
recognized over the arrangement period for certain our term licenses and licenses are 
currently the process evaluating the impact these changes the remainder our 
arrangements 
topic also requires the deferral incremental costs obtaining contract with customer this 
will require capitalize incremental costs such commissions and other costs directly related 
obtaining customer contracts and amortize those costs over the period the assets are expected 
contribute future cash flows commissions paid for renewals are commensurate with the amounts 
paid for initial contracts the deferred incremental costs will recognized over the contract term 
under the existing rules expense commissions based shipments 
february the fasb issued asu leases topic which supersedes the lease 
requirements leases topic this asu requires lessee recognize right use asset and 
lease payment liability for most leases the consolidated statement financial position this asu 
also makes some changes lessor accounting and aligns with the new revenue recognition 
guidance this asu will effective for fiscal including interim periods within that reporting 
period and earlier adoption permitted are currently the process evaluating the impact 
adoption our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
october the fasb issued asu income taxes topic intra entity transfers 
assets other than inventory this asu requires the immediate recognition current and deferred 
income tax effects intra entity transfers assets other than inventory this asu will effective for 
fiscal including interim periods within that reporting period and earlier adoption permitted 
are currently the process evaluating the impact adoption our consolidated financial 
statements 
august the fasb issued asu derivatives and hedging topic targeted 
improvements accounting for hedging activities this asu requires expanded hedge accounting 
for risk components and refining the measurement hedge results better reflect entity hedging 
strategies this asu also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how 
entities assess hedge effectiveness this asu will effective for fiscal including interim periods 
within that reporting period and earlier adoption permitted are currently the process 
evaluating the impact adoption our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 
generate our revenue from the sale products that include software licenses maintenance and 
services and lesser extent hardware products software license revenue consists fees 
associated with the licensing our software maintenance and service revenue consists 
maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products and professional 
services fees hardware revenue consists sales field programmable gate array fpga based 
emulation and prototyping products 
most our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds products and various license 
rights bundled with post contract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide 
complete end end solution the customer throughout the contract our customers are typically 
using myriad products complete each phase chip design and are concurrently working 
multiple chip designs projects different phases the design during this time the customer 
looks release state the art technology keep with the pace change address 
requested enhancements our tools meet customer specifications provide support each 
stage the customer design including the final manufacturing the chip the tape out stage and 
other important services 
with respect software licenses primarily utilize two license types 
technology subscription licenses tsls tsls are time based licenses for finite term and 
generally provide the customer limited rights receive exchange certain quantities 
licensed software for unspecified future technology the majority our arrangements are 
tsls due the nature the business and customer requirements addition the licenses 
the arrangements also include post contract customer support which includes providing 
frequent updates and upgrades maintain the utility the software due rapid changes 
technology other intertwined services such multiple copies the tools assisting our 
customers applying our technology their development environment and rights remix 
licenses for other licenses 
perpetual licenses perpetual licenses continue long the customer renews maintenance 
plus additional years perpetual licenses not provide the customer any rights 
receive exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology customers 
purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 
for the two software license types recognize revenue follows 
tsls typically recognize revenue from tsl fees ratably over the term the license 
period customer installments become due and payable whichever later revenue 
attributable tsls reported time based products revenue the consolidated 
statements operations 
perpetual licenses recognize revenue from perpetual licenses full upon shipment the 
software payment terms require the customer pay least the license fee and 
the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition 
criteria are met revenue attributable these perpetual licenses reported upfront 
products revenue the consolidated statements operations for perpetual licenses 
which less than the license fee and the maintenance fee payable within one 
year from shipment recognize revenue customer installments become due and payable 
such revenue reported time based products revenue the consolidated statements 
operations 
our maintenance and service revenue consists maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses 
and hardware products and professional services fees recognize revenue from maintenance 
arrangements ratably over the maintenance period the extent cash has been received fees 
become due and payable and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees such 
services are performed and accepted the customers needed revenue attributable 
maintenance professional services and training reported maintenance and service revenue 
the consolidated statements operations 
hardware revenue consists sales fpga based emulation and prototyping products recognize 
revenue from sales hardware products full upon shipment all other revenue recognition criteria 
are met revenue attributable these sales reported upfront products revenue the 
consolidated statements operations 
also enter into arrangements which portions revenue are contingent upon the occurrence 
uncertain future events for example royalty arrangements refer this revenue contingent 
revenue contingent revenue recognized and when the event that removes the contingency 
occurs such revenue reported time based products revenue the consolidated statements 
operations these arrangements are not material our total revenue 
infrequently enter into multiple element arrangements that contain both software and non software 
deliverables such hardware have determined that the software and non software deliverables 
our contracts are separate units accounting recognize revenue for the separate units 
accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met revenue allocated hardware units 
accounting recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenue 
allocated software units accounting recognized depending the software license type tsl 
perpetual license such arrangements have not had material effect our consolidated financial 
statements and are not expected have material effect future periods 
also enter into arrangements deliver software products either alone together with other 
products services that require significant modification customization the software account 
for such arrangements using the percentage completion method have the ability make 
reasonably dependable estimates that relate the extent progress toward completion contract 
revenues and costs measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred 
complete the project revenue attributable these arrangements reported maintenance and 
service revenue the consolidated statements operations 
determine the fair value each element multiple element software arrangements that only 
contain software and software related deliverables based vendor specific objective evidence 
vsoe limit our assessment vsoe fair value for each element the price charged when 
such element sold separately have analyzed all the elements included our multiple element 
software arrangements and have determined that have sufficient vsoe allocate revenue the 
maintenance components our perpetual license products and professional services accordingly 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met recognize license revenue from perpetual 
licenses upon delivery using the residual method recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over 
the maintenance term and recognize revenue from professional services services are performed 
and accepted the customer with respect tsl arrangements due the complexity the tools 
the complexity the arrangement terms and intertwined services the license maintenance and other 
services are not separable and are considered combined unit additionally not have 
sufficient vsoe fair value allocate the fee between these services therefore recognize 
revenue from tsls ratably over the term the license assuming all other revenue recognition criteria 
are met 
revenue recognition involves certain judgment specifically connection with each transaction 
involving our products must evaluate whether persuasive evidence arrangement exists 
delivery software services has occurred the fee for such software services fixed 
determinable and collectability the full license service fee probable all four these criteria 
must met order for recognize revenue with respect particular arrangement apply 
these revenue recognition criteria follows 
persuasive evidence arrangement exists prior recognizing revenue 
arrangement our customary policy have written contract signed both the customer 
and purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated 
standard end user license arrangement purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred deliver our products our customers electronically physically 
for electronic deliveries delivery occurs when provide access our customers take 
immediate possession the software through downloading the customer hardware for 
physical deliveries the standard transfer terms are typically freight board fob shipping 
point generally ship our products license keys promptly after acceptance customer 
orders however number factors can affect the timing product shipments and 
result timing revenue recognition including the delivery dates requested customers and 
our operational capacity fulfill product orders the end fiscal quarter 
the fee fixed determinable our determination that arrangement fee fixed 
determinable depends principally the arrangement payment terms our standard payment 
terms for perpetual licenses require more the license fee and the 
maintenance fee paid within one year the arrangement includes these terms 
regard the fee fixed determinable and recognize all license revenue under the 
arrangement full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the arrangement does not include these terms not consider the fee fixed 
determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and 
payable the case tsl because the right exchange products receive 
unspecified future technology and because vsoe for maintenance services does not exist for 
tsl recognize revenue ratably over the term the license but not advance when 
customers installments become due and payable 
collectability probable judge collectability the arrangement fees 
customer customer basis pursuant our credit review policy typically sell customers 
with whom have history successful collection for new customer when existing 
customer substantially expands its commitments evaluate the customer financial position 
and ability pay and typically assign credit limit based that review increase the 
credit limit only after have established successful collection history with the customer 
determine any time that collectability not probable under particular arrangement 
based upon our credit review process the customer payment history recognize 
revenue under that arrangement customer payments are actually received 
valuation business combinations 
are required allocate the purchase price tangible assets liabilities and contingencies 
assumed and intangible assets acquired business combination any residual purchase price 
recorded goodwill the allocation the purchase price requires management make estimates 
determining the fair values assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect 
intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives our estimates may include 
but are not limited future cash flows acquired business the appropriate discounted rate and 
the cost savings expected derived from acquisition these estimates are inherently difficult 
subjective and unpredictable and different estimates were used the purchase price allocation the 
acquired assets and liabilities could different addition make judgments and estimates when 
assign useful lives intangible assets identified part our acquisitions these estimates are 
also inherently uncertain and used different estimates the useful life over which amortize 
intangible assets would different therefore our assessment the estimated fair value each 
these assets and liabilities can have material effect our consolidated financial statements 
valuation intangible assets 
evaluate our intangible assets for indications impairment whenever events changes 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not recoverable intangible assets consist 
purchased technology contract rights intangibles customer relationships trademarks and trade 
names covenants not compete capitalized software development and process research and 
development factors that could trigger impairment review include significant under performance 
relative expected historical projected future operating results significant changes the manner 
our use the acquired assets the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry 
economic trends this evaluation indicates that the value the intangible asset may impaired 
make assessment the recoverability the net carrying value the asset over its remaining 
useful life this assessment indicates that the intangible asset not recoverable based the 
estimated undiscounted future cash flows the technology over the remaining useful life reduce 
the net carrying value the related intangible asset fair value any such impairment charge could 
significant and could have material adverse effect our reported financial results did not 
record any impairment charges our intangible assets during fiscal 
income taxes 
our estimates and assumptions made our tax provisions may differ from the actual results 
reflected our income tax returns and record the required adjustments when they are identified 
resolved 
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and 
tax bases assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates effect for the year which expect the 
differences reverse and for tax loss and credit carryovers record valuation allowance 
reduce the deferred tax assets the amount that more likely than not realized evaluating 
our ability utilize our deferred tax assets consider all available positive and negative evidence

results operations 
revenue background 
generate our revenue from the sale products that include software licenses maintenance and 
services and lesser extent hardware products under current accounting rules and policies 
recognize revenue from orders receive for software licenses services and hardware products 
varying times 
most instances recognize revenue tsl software license order over the license 
term and term perpetual software license order the quarter which the license 
delivered the weighted average term the tsls and term licenses typically three years 
but varies from quarter quarter due the nature and timing the arrangements entered 
into during the quarter the weighted average term the tsls and term licenses entered 
into fiscal and was years years and years respectively 
revenue contracts requiring significant modification development accounted for using 
the percentage completion method over the period the development 
revenue hardware product orders generally recognized full the time the product 
shipped and when title transferred 
contingent revenue recognized and when the event that removes the contingency occurs 
revenue maintenance orders recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally 
one year 
revenue professional services orders generally recognized the services are 
performed 
infrequently enter into certain license arrangements wherein licenses are provided for 
finite term without any other services rights including rights receive exchange 
licensed software for unspecified future technology recognize revenue from these term 
licenses full upon shipment the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria 
are met 
our revenue any period equal the sum our time based products upfront products and 
maintenance and services revenues for the period derive time based products revenue largely 
from tsl orders received and delivered prior quarters and smaller extent from contracts 
which revenue recognized customer installments become due and payable and from contingent 
revenue arrangements derive upfront products revenue directly from term and perpetual license 
and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period derive maintenance 
revenue largely from maintenance orders received prior periods since our maintenance orders 
generally yield revenue ratably over term one year also derive professional services revenue 
primarily from orders received prior quarters since recognize revenue from professional services 
those services are delivered and accepted percentage completion for arrangements 
requiring significant modification our software and not when they are booked 
our revenue sensitive the mix tsls and perpetual licenses delivered during reporting period 
tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes revenue future periods 
for example order for three year tsl delivered the last day quarter typically 
generates revenue that quarter but each the succeeding quarters conversely 
order for perpetual licenses with greater than the license fee due within one year 
from shipment typically generates revenue the quarter the product delivered but 
future revenue additionally revenue particular quarter may also impacted perpetual 
licenses which less than the license fees and the maintenance fees are payable 
within one year from shipment the related revenue will recognized revenue the period when 
customer payments become due and payable 
most our customer arrangements are complex involving hundreds products and various license 
rights and our customers bargain with over many aspects these arrangements for example 
they often demand broader portfolio solutions support and services and seek more favorable 
terms such expanded license usage future purchase rights and other unique rights overall 
lower total cost single factor typically drives our customers buying decisions and compete 
all fronts serve customers highly competitive eda market customers generally negotiate the 
total value the arrangement rather than just unit pricing volumes

persuasive evidence arrangement exists prior recognizing revenue 
arrangement the company customary policy have written contract signed both the 
customer and the company purchase order from those customers that have previously 
negotiated standard end user license arrangement purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred the company delivers its products its customers electronically 
physically for electronic deliveries delivery occurs when the company provides access its 
customers take immediate possession the software through downloading the 
customer hardware for physical deliveries the standard transfer terms are typically freight 
board fob shipping point the company generally ships its products license keys 
promptly after acceptance customer orders however number factors can affect the 
timing product shipments and result timing revenue recognition including the 
delivery dates requested customers and the company operational capacity fulfill 
product orders the end fiscal quarter 
the fee fixed determinable the company determination that arrangement fee 
fixed determinable depends principally the arrangement payment terms the 
company standard payment terms for perpetual licenses require more the license 
fee and the maintenance fee paid within one year the arrangement includes 
these terms the company regards the fee fixed determinable and recognizes all license 
revenue under the arrangement full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition 
criteria are met the arrangement does not include these terms the company does not 
consider the fee fixed determinable and generally recognizes revenue when customer 
installments are due and payable the case tsl because the right exchange 
products receive unspecified future technology and because vsoe for maintenance 
services does not exist for tsl the company recognizes revenue ratably over the term 
the license but not advance when customers installments become due and payable 
collectability probable the company judges collectability the arrangement fees

customers with whom has history successful collection for new customer when 
existing customer substantially expands its commitments the company evaluates the 
customer financial position and ability pay and typically assigns credit limit based that 
review the company increases the credit limit only after has established successful 
collection history with the customer the company determines any time that collectability 
not probable under particular arrangement based upon its credit review process the
