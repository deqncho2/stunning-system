our target markets remain extremely competitive and expect competition intensify current competitors expand their product and service 
offerings industry standards continue evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets our competitors products 
services and technologies may less costly may offer superior functionality better features than ours which may result among other things 
lower than expected selling prices for our products addition some our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have 
longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive intellectual property portfolios and patent protections and greater 
financial sales marketing and distribution resources than these competitors may able more effectively identify and capitalize upon 
opportunities new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products increasingly 
smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business are unable 
successfully compete our target markets respond changes our target markets introduce new offerings meet the needs this 
competitive environment including significant international markets such china demand for our products services and technologies could 
decrease which would cause our revenue decline and cause our results operations suffer addition the competitive landscape our

typically find that over the rebates accrue each year are eventually claimed which substantially close and that this 
percentage varies program and customer recognize liability for these rebates the later the date which record the related 
revenue the date which offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date the original sale unless reasonably believe 
that the customer intends claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed revenue the amount which typically represents less than 
total revenue 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds mdfs mdfs represent monies paid our partners that are earmarked for

based primarily historical return rates however product returns for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates may determine 
that additional sales return allowances are required properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns

reported amounts assets and liabilities and disclosures contingent assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported 
amounts revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from our estimates going basis 
evaluate our estimates including those related revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories 
income taxes goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other 
contingencies these estimates are based historical facts and various other assumptions that believe are reasonable 
revenue recognition 
product revenue 
recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price fixed 
determinable and collection the related receivable reasonably assured for most sales use binding purchase order and certain cases 
use contractual agreement evidence arrangement consider delivery occur upon shipment provided title and risk loss have 
passed the customer the point sale assess whether the arrangement fee fixed determinable and whether collection reasonably 
assured determine that collection fee not reasonably assured defer the fee and recognize revenue the time collection becomes 
reasonably assured which generally upon receipt payment 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed serve sales incentives resellers our products various target 
markets account for rebates reduction revenue and accrue for the potential rebates and not apply breakage factor 
typically find that over the rebates accrue each year are eventually claimed which substantially close and that this 
percentage varies program and customer recognize liability for these rebates the later the date which record the related 
revenue the date which offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date the original sale unless reasonably believe 
that the customer intends claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed revenue the amount which typically represents less than 
total revenue 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds mdfs mdfs represent monies paid our partners that are earmarked for 
market segment development and expansion and are typically designed support our partners

activities while also promoting nvidia products account for mdfs reduction revenue and apply breakage factor certain types 
mdf program accruals for which believe can make reasonable and reliable estimate the amount that will ultimately unclaimed 
also record reduction revenue establishing sales return allowance for estimated product returns the time revenue recognized 
based primarily historical return rates however product returns for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates may determine 
that additional sales return allowances are required properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
license and development revenue 
for license arrangements that require significant customization our intellectual property components generally recognize the related revenue 
over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements determine progress completion based actual cost 
incurred date percentage the estimated total cost required complete the project provision for estimated losses contracts made 
the period which the loss becomes probable and can reasonably estimated costs incurred advance revenue recognized are recorded 
deferred costs uncompleted contracts the amount billed exceeds the amount revenue recognized the excess amount recorded 
deferred revenue 
for license arrangements that not require significant customization but where are obligated provide further deliverables over the term the 
license agreement record revenue over the life the license term with consideration received advance the performance period classified 
deferred revenue 
royalty revenue recognized related the distribution sale products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties 
recognize royalty revenue upon receipt confirmation earned royalties and when collectability reasonably assured from the applicable 
licensee 
advertising expenses 
expense advertising costs the period which they are incurred advertising expenses for fiscal years and were 
million million and million respectively 
rent expense 
recognize rent expense straight line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid 
product warranties 
generally offer limited warranty end users that ranges from one three years for products order repair replace products for any 
manufacturing defects hardware component failures cost revenue includes the estimated cost product warranties that are calculated the 
point revenue recognition under limited circumstances may offer extended limited warranty customers for certain products also 
accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues loss probable and can reasonably estimated

employee severance facilities and related costs restructuring charges were not significant for fiscal years and 
litigation investigation and settlement costs

third party claims against will resolved without litigation fines and substantial settlement payments that occurs our business financial 
condition and results operations could materially and adversely affected information becomes available that causes determine that
