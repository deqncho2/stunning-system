the rise the machines 
what rpa robotic process automation piece software 
these virtual workers don sleep make mistakes and operate 
often referred robot sits top systems taking informa 
compliant manner addition the simplicity the technology ena 
tion from one and feeding into others work that currently being 
bles customers yourself diy self sufficiency model and 
conducted humans the easiest way think about excel 
bring processes back house the business case always based 
macro steroids cognitive takes rpa further learning from 
fte savings but the benefits also include freeing employee time 
human worker when there are discrepancies and then applying the 
for more value added functions addition there are obvious quality 
observed judgement complete process 
gains which can improve business outcomes for companies and even 
real world examples rpa many will have had cancel 
customer service levels early adopters are the insurance and banks 
lost stolen credit card the process seems relatively straightfor 
industries but rpa end market application across multiple proc 
ward call our credit card hotline and speak operator 
esses numerous industries 
cancel the card however the process for the bank will often 
see automation driving major changes bpo companies 
much more complex has multiple back end systems that are not 
insource and share shifts from vendors back house delivery 
integrated our example the bank employee who takes the call 
business process outsourcing takes complete business process 
needs collect the data and then input that data into number 
collecting receivable managing customer service centre 
back end systems one cancel the card one order new card for 
and hands over third party believe that the main driver 
the customer and third check what spending has taken place since 
bpo was cost reduction especially the process was often also off 
the card was lost stolen with rpa this entire process can auto 
shored low cost location 
mated and the bank staff reallocated more value added work 
automation will major force leveling the playing field 
real life example software robots were deployed take the initial 
the services market automation further reduces the advan 
information from the customer and then place that into the three 
tage offshore players enjoyed not see any one vendor 
back end systems minute process previously became almost 
having significant advantage the automation world and believe 
instant and the bank saw productivity improvement well 
that the willingness invest and deploy these technologies will 
lower card fraud rates reported cards were cancelled more quickly 
key the company that can drive automation the most quickly and 
and cognitive enhanced rpa when add cognitive rpa 
scale will win the most market share our view the only advan 
rather than following simple instructions move data from 
tage would see the outset that companies already operating 
the software robot will trained over time and learn from its mis 
larger scale could have advantage their returns automa 
takes can complete more complex tasks example would 
tion investment could higher and course they will likely have 
train company that used cognitive rpa refund customers auto 
more resources invest 
matically when trains were delayed the software robot was used 
work through emails from customers and after training was able 
exhibit 
recognise the key meaning and sentiment the mails could also 
mapping exposure automation across our coverage 
recognise customer information and activate the refund this auto

the trend towards offshoring services work has been the domi

while there are clearly repetitive elements and some data 
the cost advantage the indian heritage vendors has nar 
entry services believe much less clear today how 
rowed their western competitors built out their own sub

stantial offshore delivery centres 
determinant that will how well more basic rpa techniques 
believe offshore penetration the and the two 
most mature markets for offshore has reached peak 
evolve with machine learning cognitive and eventually full techniques 
believe cultural and language barriers make more chal 
lenging for work delivered directly from offshore 
also not expect the same level business and contract disrup 
continental europe which likely means vendors need have 
tion services that could happen the bpo markets believe 
more significant front end interface with their clients this 
business process outsourcing has been heavily driven the labour 
problem becomes more significant move from 
cost arbitrage model for example have people involved 
northern europe southern europe and think helps 
process whether collecting receivables from customers cancel 
explain the reason offshore penetration has been much 
ling credit card for customer company comfortable with 
higher northern europe 
that process and understand but provider has offered perform 
that process for lower price they will offshore that process 
industrialisation and automation could dominate the 
discussion over the next years 
the shift automation could well change that equation for company rather than keeping that process outsourced they may well 
decide bring that process back house and automate

assumptions drive these impacts and these are based the team 
best estimates today ultimately the inputs are forecasts and will 
automation impacts likely global more quickly

automation not just about cost drives quality

opportunity for onshore vendors level the playing 
broad and global impact could drive significant

field gain advantage the period labour cost 
arbitrage clearly favoured the indian heritage vendors 
they had access large supply lower cost labour 
given the breadth the potential impacts automation could have 
services vendors that were delivering onshore were forced 
services and the more global potential think automation will 
build offshore delivery centres focus efficiency and 
key differentiator for services vendors future expect the 
quality and move the value chain order protect 
vendors who successfully adopt and implement these technologies 
their revenue base and margins would argue that 
will have significant advantage peers 
onshore european vendors have been the most insulated 
from the trend offshore continental europe has been 
slower move not see that particular group 
vendors has clear advantage the initial phases

technologies however believe that scale matters 
growth inhibitor companies maintain legacy

players have more gain from automation their 
that they are not well integrated with each other and

companies may running processes today that require
