about the carrying values assets and liabilities 
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used the preparation our consolidated financial 
statements our management has discussed the development and selection these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee our 
board directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating our critical accounting policies and estimates this annual report form 
revenue recognition 
product revenue 
recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price fixed 
determinable and collection the related receivable reasonably assured 
for sales certain distributors with rights return for which the level returns cannot reasonably estimated our policy defer recognition revenue 
and related cost revenue until the distributors resell the product and some cases when customer return rights lapse 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed serve sales incentives resellers our products various target markets 
account for rebates reduction revenue and accrue for the potential rebates and not apply breakage factor while have long history 
rebate arrangements with oems believe are unable apply our historical experience reliably estimate the amount rebates that will eventually 
claimed individual oems such cases the oems may not our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix demand they place their 
cems odms may shift introduce new generations and iterations products and experience changes new competitor offerings addition 
typically find that approximately the rebates accrue each year are eventually claimed which substantially close and that this percentage 
varies program and customer recognize liability for these rebates the later the date which record the related revenue the date which 
offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date the original sale unless reasonably believe that the customer intends claim the rebate 
unclaimed rebates are reversed revenue the amount which typically represents less than total revenue 
table contents 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds mdfs mdfs represent monies paid retailers system builders oems distributors 
add card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed support our 
partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending market conditions may take actions increase amounts offered under customer 
programs possibly resulting incremental reduction revenue the time such programs are offered account for mdfs reduction revenue and 
apply breakage factor certain types mdf program accruals for which believe can make reasonable and reliable estimate the amount that will 
ultimately unclaimed 
also record reduction revenue establishing sales return allowance for estimated product returns the time revenue recognized based primarily 
historical return rates however product returns for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates may determine that additional sales return 
allowances are required properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
license and development revenue 
for license arrangements that require significant customization our intellectual property components generally recognize the related revenue over the 
period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements determine progress completion based actual cost incurred date 
percentage the estimated total cost required complete the project periodically evaluate the actual status each project ensure that the estimates 
complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized any period dependent our progress toward completion projects progress significant 
management judgment and discretion are used estimate total cost any changes deviations from these estimates could have material effect the amount 
revenue recognize any period 
for license arrangements that not require significant customization but where are obligated provide further deliverables over the term the license 
agreement record revenue over the life the license term with consideration received advance the performance period classified deferred revenue

inventories 
inventory cost computed adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost average first first out basis charge cost sales for 
inventory provisions write down our inventory the lower cost estimated market value completely write off obsolete excess inventory most 
our inventory provisions relate the write off excess quantities products based our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared 
assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
situations that may result excess obsolete inventory include changes business and economic conditions changes market conditions sudden and 
significant decreases demand for our products inventory obsolescence because changing technology and customer requirements failure estimate customer 
demand properly unexpected competitive pricing actions our competition addition cancellation deferral customer purchase orders could result 
our holding excess inventory also may not able reduce our inventory purchase commitments timely manner response customer cancellations 
deferrals 
the overall net effect our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales items previously written down was unfavorable impact 
and fiscal years and respectively the charges took cost sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily 
related the write off excess quantities products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts future demand for those products 
fabless semiconductor company must make commitments purchase inventory based forecasts future customer demand doing must account 
for our third party manufacturers lead times and constraints also adjust other market factors such product offerings and pricing actions our 
competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all which may impact demand for our products

goodwill 
goodwill subject our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter our fiscal year earlier indicators potential impairment exist using either 
qualitative quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value the reporting unit which the goodwill resides its carrying 
value have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned the gpu and 
tegra processor reporting units january was million and million respectively determining the fair value reporting unit requires 
make judgments and involves the use significant estimates and assumptions also make judgments and assumptions allocating assets and liabilities 
each our reporting units base our fair value estimates assumptions believe reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
during the fourth quarter fiscal year elected use the quantitative assessment test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit applying 
the fair value based test each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approaches 
consider number factors that include but are not limited prospective financial information growth rates terminal residual values discount rates and 
comparable multiples from publicly traded companies our industry and require make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic 
factors and the future profitability our business 
when performing income approach valuation incorporate the use projected financial information and discount rate that are developed using market 
participant based assumptions our discounted cash flow model our estimates discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions 
about our expected future operating performance such revenue growth rates operating margins risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market 
conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due among other things economic conditions changes our business model changes 
operating performance additionally certain estimates discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models 
which increases the risk differences between the projected and actual performance the long term financial forecasts that utilize represent the best estimate 
that have this time and believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could 
materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates the fair value our reporting units 
table contents 
during the fourth quarter fiscal year concluded that there was impairment our goodwill the fair values our gpu and tegra processor 
reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values such even the application hypothetical decrease the fair value each 
reporting unit would not have resulted the fair value either reporting unit being less than its carrying value overall test the reasonableness 
estimated fair values our reporting units reconciled the combined fair value estimates our reporting units our market capitalization the valuation 
date the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative the market views when applying reasonable control premium the market 
capitalization however any significant reductions the actual amount future cash flows realized our reporting units reductions the value market 
comparables reductions our market capitalization could impact future estimates the fair values our reporting units such events could ultimately result 
charge our earnings future periods due the potential for write down the goodwill associated with our reporting units

for sales certain distributors with rights return for which the level returns cannot reasonably estimated our policy defer recognition revenue 
and related cost revenue until the distributors resell the product and some cases when customer return rights lapse 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed serve sales incentives resellers our products various target markets 
account for rebates reduction revenue and accrue for the potential rebates and not apply breakage factor while have long history 
rebate arrangements with original equipment manufacturers oems believe are unable apply our historical experience reliably estimate the amount 
rebates that will eventually claimed individual oems such cases the oems may not our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix 
demand they place their contract equipment manufacturers cems and original device manufacturers odms may shift introduce new generations 
and iterations products and experience changes new competitor offerings addition typically find that approximately the rebates 
accrue each year are eventually claimed which substantially close and that this percentage varies program and customer recognize liability 
for these rebates the later the date which record the related revenue the date which offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the 
date the original sale unless reasonably believe that the customer intends claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed revenue the amount 
which typically represents less than total revenue 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds mdfs mdfs represent monies paid retailers system builders oems distributors 
add card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed support our 
partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending market conditions may take actions increase amounts offered under customer 
programs possibly resulting incremental reduction revenue the time such programs are offered account for mdfs reduction revenue and 
apply breakage factor certain types mdf program accruals for which believe can make reasonable and reliable estimate the amount that will 
ultimately unclaimed 
also record reduction revenue establishing sales return allowance for estimated product returns the time revenue recognized based primarily 
historical return rates however product returns for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates may determine that additional sales return 
allowances are required properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns

becomes probable and can reasonably estimated costs incurred advance revenue recognized are recorded deferred costs uncompleted contracts
