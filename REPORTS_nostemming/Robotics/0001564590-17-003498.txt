market overview 
over the past two decades laparoscopic surgery has emerged minimally invasive alternative open surgery laparoscopic surgery multiple incisions 
are necessary provide surgical access ports carbon dioxide gas insufflation then used create room the body cavity and long rigid instruments are 
introduced through ports placed the incisions perform surgical tasks millions laparoscopic surgical procedures across broad range clinical 
applications are now performed each year worldwide though many surgeries are still performed open fashion 
while laparoscopy has improved the invasive nature many previously open procedures still has many limitations traditional rigid laparoscopy still 
requires multiple incisions achieve the visualization and instrument triangulation required perform successful surgery rigid laparoscopy also creates 
physical challenges forcing the surgeon hands and arms into awkward angles requiring the surgeon hold instruments fixed positions for long 
periods time and requiring assistant stabilize and move laparoscopic camera another challenge associated with rigid laparoscopic surgery the 
creation cumbersome and potentially tissue damaging fulcrum the patient abdominal wall where instruments are manipulated nearly all 
laparoscopic instruments are rigid instruments that lack the internal articulation required enhance dexterity complex tasks most laparoscopic surgeries 
are performed with two dimensional visualization the operative field making depth perception difficult 
despite such limitations traditional laparoscopy remains the prevalent technique minimally invasive surgery believe that robotic devices that 
replicate laparoscopic motion are more comfortable for surgeons adopt thereby increasing the opportunity enhance traditional surgical methods with 
robotics our senhance system mimics laparoscopic surgery 
robotic and computer controlled assistance have developed technologies that offer the potential improve upon many aspects the laparoscopic 
surgical experience hundreds thousands robotic assisted surgical procedures are now performed each year worldwide but they still represent small 
fraction the total laparoscopic procedures performed while initial widespread adoption robotic assisted surgery was focused urologic and 
gynecologic procedures that were primarily performed open fashion prior robotics recently developed robotic approaches have been applied 
many other clinical applications particularly general surgery despite recent advances believe there remain many limitations associated with current 
robotic assisted surgery systems used connection with laparoscopic surgeries 
product overview 
are addressing the challenges laparoscopy and robotic assisted surgery with innovative products and product candidates that leverage the best features 
both approaches minimally invasive surgery 
current product offering 
senhance system 
the senhance system multi port robotic surgery system which allows four arms control robotic instruments and camera the system builds 
the success laparoscopy enhancing the traditional features that surgeons have come expect from existing products and addressing some the 
limitations associated with robotic surgery systems for laparoscopic procedures the senhance system also offers responsible economics hospitals 
offering robotic technology with reusable instruments with minimal additional costs per surgery when compared laparoscopy the senhance system has 
been granted mark europe for use abdominal and pelvic surgery but not available for sale the 
key features the senhance system are 
haptic feedback the senhance system haptic feedback feature provides the surgeon with the ability feel the tactile response the body 
during procedure 
enhanced vision the senhance system features vision technology and gives the surgeon the ability move the camera via eye 
movement that the camera centered the surgeon field vision 
laparoscopic motion the senhance system utilizes laparoscopic motion that similar the motion used during traditional laparoscopic 
surgeries 
view the sterile field the senhance system offers the user open view the operating room and sterile field from the console 
enables use standard trocars the senhance system allows for standard laparoscopic trocars used and does not require that robotic 
arms docked directly the patient 
the senhance system manufactured for under contract third party manufacturer our manufacturer acquire raw materials and components 
the senhance system from vendors some which are sole suppliers believe our relationships with our vendors and manufacturing contractor are good 
further believe that have the manufacturing and inventory reserves meet our anticipated senhance system sales for the foreseeable future are 
currently taking steps develop redundant manufacturing and supply alternatives 
products development 
surgibot system robotic platform 
the surgibot system designed utilize flexible instruments through articulating channels controlled directly the surgeon with robotic assistance 
while the surgeon remains patient side within the sterile field june the company submitted application the fda for the surgibot 
system april the fda notified the company that the surgibot system did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalence based the data 
and information submitted transenterix the submission after interactions with the fda the company determined that new 
application would need submitted order obtain clearance for the surgibot system based this fact have evaluated the operational and 
financial feasibility pursuing two applications parallel and have elected primarily focus our near term regulatory efforts the 
submission for the senhance system and our current strategy focus our resources the commercialization and regulatory clearance for the senhance 
system 
key features the surgibot system are 
patient side the surgibot system positioned next the operating table thereby allowing the surgeon operator control the system 
from within the sterile field next the patient 
precision with scaling the surgibot system allows the user adjust the level mechanized movement using scaled ratios 
strength the surgibot system features powered motion driven motors controlled the surgeon 
ergonomics the surgibot system stabilizes multiple instruments and laparoscope and allows the surgeon reposition his her hands 
ergonomic fashion 
internal triangulation the surgibot system utilizes deployment mechanism achieve triangulation multiple instruments inside the 
body contrasted with other single port robotic systems that rely crossing instruments the patient abdominal wall the surgibot 
system allows for triangulation that can adjusted the surgical field during procedure and maintained positions throughout body 
cavity 
direct surgeon connection the instruments the surgibot system allows the surgeon operator maintain human tactile feedback along 
several degrees motion existing robotic systems lack any such tactile feedback 
other products 
spider surgical system 
prior transenterix surgical developed and commercialized the spider surgical system the spider system manual laparoscopic system 
the united states europe and the middle east the spider system utilized flexible instruments and articulating channels that were controlled directly 
the surgeon allowing for multiple instruments introduced via single site the spider system was cleared the fda and marked 
august the company also manufactured multiple instruments that could deployed using the disposable spider system december 
ceased all commercialization efforts with respect the spider system order fully focus our efforts our other products 
surgical instruments 
the company has developed and manufactures flexible and rigid laparoscopic surgical instruments that are used abdominal surgery such scissors 
graspers clip appliers and suction and irrigation instruments such instruments were sold limited volumes connection with the spider system and 
have been adapted for use with the surgibot system 
the year ended december had one european customer humanitas hospital milan italy who accounted for our revenue our 
senhance system products february the company announced that made its second sale the senhance system customer germany 
the year ended december the company had revenue focused our efforts the surgibot system development and the senhance 
acquisition the year ended december had one customer who accounted for our revenue for products that included the spider 
system the company not dependent 
current customers please see the disclosure note summary significant accounting policies segments the notes our consolidated financial 
statements item this annual report regarding the geographic locations our revenues and assets the and elsewhere 
business strategy 
our current strategy focus our resources the commercialization and regulatory clearance for the senhance system after interactions with the 
fda determined that new application would need submitted order obtain clearance for the surgibot system based this fact 
have evaluated the operational and financial feasibility pursuing two applications parallel and have elected primarily focus our near term 
efforts the submission for the senhance system 
believe that 
there are number hospitals and increasing number ambulatory surgery centers the and internationally that could benefit from 
the addition robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery and with the senhance system lower operational costs 
with the senhance system surgeons can benefit from the haptic feedback enhanced vision and open architecture consistent with current 
laparoscopic surgery procedures and 
patients will continue seek minimally invasive option for many common general abdominal and gynecologic surgeries which are 
addressed the senhance system 
sales and marketing 
have recruited initial sales and marketing team and have initiated initial commercialization the marked senhance system europe the middle 
east and africa and limited countries asia utilize distributors and sales agents number jurisdictions where not sell directly our 
distribution agreements typically provide exclusivity specific territory jurisdiction date have agreements with ten distributors sales agents 
for the senhance system 
have initiated clinical leadership program with leading surgical centers europe utilize the senhance system believe the program helps 
improve our visibility europe and provides more widespread opportunity for observation robotic surgery with the senhance system opened three 
such clinical leadership program sites and anticipate adding fourth early addition december opened new european 
training and research and development center milan italy 
research and development 
during the fiscal years ended december and incurred research and development expenses approximately 
million 
million and million respectively such expenses primarily related the surgibot system development and the senhance system 
development including the preparation and submission regulatory filings and such expenses primarily related the surgibot system 
development including the preparation and submission regulatory filings fund our research and development expenses primarily from proceeds raised 
from equity and debt financing transactions expect continue use equity and debt financing transactions fund our research and development 
activities customers are obligated pay any material portion such research and development expenses 
intellectual property 
believe that our intellectual property and expertise important competitive resource our experienced research and development team has created 
substantial portfolio intellectual property including patents patent applications trade secrets and proprietary know how maintain active program 
intellectual property protection both assure that the proprietary technology developed appropriately protected and where necessary assure 
that there infringement our proprietary technology competitive technologies 
the following summarizes our current patent and patent application portfolio 
patents and patent applications owned the company the company holds nine united states patents three italian patents one russian patent 
european patent two japanese patents two australian patents and chinese patent and has more than forty patent applications filed the united states 
and abroad each instance own all right title and interest and licenses security interests other encumbrances have been granted such patents 
and patent applications 
several our issued patents resulted from filings related the senhance system these include one the united states patents and the italian russian 
and chinese patents the earliest expire patents within this part our portfolio will remain force until two our united states patents resulted 
from filings relating the surgibot system developed the company and will remain force until three our united states patents and the 
european japanese and australian patents resulted from filings relating the spider system which the company stopped selling december

the license agreement with the european union has term which runs until the final licensed patent expires unless the agreement terminated earlier 
mutual consent the parties for breach the company currently compliance with the terms this license agreement 
competition 
our industry highly competitive subject change and significantly affected new product introductions and other activities industry participants 
many our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than and have established reputations with our target customers 
well worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours 
there are many competitive offerings the field minimally invasive surgery several companies have launched devices that enable reduced incision 
single incision laparoscopic surgery with without robotic assistance our surgical competitors include but are not limited applied medical medtronic 
plc intuitive surgical titan medical and verb surgical 
addition surgical device manufacturer competitors there are many products and therapies that are designed reduce the need for attractiveness 
surgical intervention these products and therapies may impact the overall volume surgical procedures and negatively impact our business 
our ability compete may affected the failure fully educate physicians the use our products and products development the level 
physician expertise this may have the effect making our products less attractive among currently available surgical robotic systems expect the 
senhance system differentiate the basis its use standard trocars and lower per procedure costs and expect the senhance system differentiate 
most cases its ability provide the surgeon with tactile feedback several medical device companies are actively engaged research and development 
robotic systems other medical devices and tools used minimally invasive surgery procedures cannot predict the basis upon which will compete 
with new products marketed others 
government regulation our product development activities 
the government and foreign governments regulate the medical device industry through various agencies including but not limited the fda 
which administers the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fdca the design testing manufacturing storage labeling distribution advertising 
and marketing medical devices are subject extensive regulation federal state and local governmental authorities the united states including the 
fda and similar agencies other countries including the european union any device product that develop must receive all requisite regulatory 
approvals clearances the case may before may marketed particular country 
device development marketing clearance and approval 
medical devices are subject varying levels pre market regulatory requirements the fda classifies medical devices into one three classes class 
devices are relatively simple and can manufactured and distributed with general controls class devices are somewhat more complex and receive 
greater scrutiny from the fda and have heightened regulatory requirements and iii class iii devices are new high risk devices and frequently are 
permanently implantable help sustain life and generally require pre market approval pma the fda 
the united states company generally can obtain permission distribute new medical device one two ways the first applies any device that 
substantially equivalent device first marketed prior may another device marketed after that date but which was substantially equivalent 
pre may device these devices are either class class devices obtain fda clearance distribute the medical device company generally 
must submit section notification and receive fda order finding substantial equivalence predicate device pre may device postmay device that was substantially equivalent pre may device and permitting commercial distribution that medical device for its intended 
use notification must provide information supporting claim substantial equivalence single medical device the predicate device clinical 
data from human experience are required support the notification these data must gathered compliance with investigational device 
exemption ide regulations for investigations performed the united states the process normally used for products the type that are 
developing and propose market and sell the fda review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant section takes pursuant 
statutory requirements days but can take substantially longer the fda has questions regarding the regulatory submission possible for 
section clearance procedures take from six twenty four months depending the concerns raised the fda and the complexity the device 
there guarantee that the fda will clear medical device for marketing which case the device cannot distributed the united states there 
also guarantee that the fda will deem the applicable device subject the process opposed the more time consuming resource intensive and 
problematic pma process described below the fda issued series draft guidance documents designed reform the clearance process 
similarly the medical device user fee amendments authorized the fda collect user fees for the review certain pre market submissions 
received after october including notifications 
the second more comprehensive approval process applies new device that not substantially equivalent pre product that used 
supporting sustaining life preventing impairment these devices are normally class iii devices for example most implantable devices are subject the 
approval process class iii device two steps fda approval are generally required before company can market product the united states that 
subject approval opposed clearance class iii device first company must comply with ide regulations connection with any human clinical 
investigation the device these regulations permit company undertake clinical study non significant risk device without formal fda 
approval prior express fda approval required the device significant risk device second the fda must approve the company pma application 
which contains among other things clinical information acquired under the ide additionally devices subject pma approval may subject panel 
review obtain marketing approval and are required pass factory inspection accordance with the current good manufacturing practices standards 
order obtain approval the fda will approve the pma application finds there reasonable assurance that the device safe and effective for its 
intended use the pma process takes substantially longer than the process approximately one two years more however some instances the 
fda may find that device new and not substantially equivalent predicate device but also not high risk device generally the case with class 
iii pma devices these instances fda may allow device down classified from class iii class the novo classification option 
alternate pathway classify novel devices low moderate risk that had automatically been placed class iii after receiving not substantially 
equivalent nse determination response notification the regulations have also been amended allow sponsor submit novo 
classification request the fda for novel low moderate risk devices without first being required submit application these types 
applications are referred evaluation automatic class iii designation novo instances where device deemed not substantially 
equivalent class predicate device the candidate device may filed novo application which may lead delays regulatory decisions the 
fda fda review novo application may lead the fda identify the device either class device and worthy either exempt 
regulatory pathway 
believe that the senhance system and related products are class devices and are the process pursuing section clearance for the 
senhance system the fda might find that the submission does not provide the evidence required prove that the senhance system substantially 
equivalent marketed class devices that were occur would required undertake the more complex and costly pma process perhaps 
considered for novo reclassification for either the novo the pma process the fda could require conduct clinical trials which would 
take more time cost more money and pose other risks and uncertainties 
clinical studies conducted the used any application unapproved medical device require approval from the fda prior initiation 
even when clinical study has been approved the fda deemed approved the study subject factors beyond manufacturer control including 
but not limited the fact that the institutional review board irb specified clinical site might not approve the study might decline renew approval 
might suspend terminate the study before its completion there assurance that clinical study any given site will progress anticipated 
addition there can assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence assure the fda that the product safe and effective 
prerequisite for fda approval pma substantially equivalent terms safety and effectiveness predicate device prerequisite for clearance 
under section even the fda approves clears device may limit its intended uses such way that manufacturing and distribution the 
device may not commercially feasible 
after clearance approval market given the fda and foreign regulatory agencies upon the occurrence certain serious adverse events are authorized 
under various circumstances withdraw the clearance approval the device require changes device its manufacturing process its labeling 
require additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met 
manufacturer device approved through the pma process not permitted make changes the device which affect its safety effectiveness without 
first submitting supplement application its pma and obtaining fda approval for that supplement prior marketing the modified device some 
instances the fda may require clinical trials support supplement application manufacturer device cleared through the process must submit 
additional premarket notification intends make change modification the device that could significantly affect the safety effectiveness 
the device such significant change modification design material chemical composition energy source labeling manufacturing process any 
change the intended uses pma device device requires approval supplement new cleared premarket notification exported devices are 
subject the regulatory requirements each country which the device exported well certain fda export requirements 
continuing fda regulation 
after device placed the market numerous fda and other regulatory requirements continue apply these include 
establishment registration and device listing with the fda 
quality system regulations which require manufacturers follow stringent design testing 
process control documentation and other quality assurance procedures 
labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion products for unapproved off label uses and impose other restrictions labeling 
medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report the fda their device may have caused contributed 
death serious injury malfunctioned way that would likely cause contribute death serious injury were recur 
corrections and removal reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report the fda field corrections and product recalls 
removals undertaken reduce risk health posed the device remedy violation the fdca that may present risk health 
and 
requirements conduct postmarket surveillance studies establish continued safety data 
are required and have registered with the fda and the international organization for standardization iso medical device manufacturers and 
must obtain all necessary permits and licenses operate our business manufacturers and our suppliers are subject announced and unannounced 
inspections the fda determine our compliance with the quality system regulation qsr and other regulations 
europe need comply with the requirements the medical devices directive mdd and appropriately affix the mark our products attest 
such compliance achieve compliance our products must meet the essential requirements the mdd relating safety and performance and 
must successfully undergo verification our regulatory compliance conformity assessment notified body selected the level scrutiny 
such assessment depends the regulatory class the product are subject continued surveillance our notified body and will required report 
any serious adverse incidents the appropriate authorities also must comply with additional requirements individual countries which our products

implement similar governmental controls 
therefore cannot assure you that any our products will considered cost effective that following any commercialization our products coverage 
and reimbursement will available sufficient allow manufacture and sell them competitively and profitably 
health care regulation 
our business activities are subject additional healthcare regulation and enforcement the federal government and authorities the states and foreign 
jurisdictions which conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal anti kickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy

penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment restructuring our operations exclusion from 
participation federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any which could adversely affect our ability operate our business and our 
financial results 
the united states there have been and expect there continue number legislative and regulatory initiatives both the federal and state 
government levels change the healthcare system ways that approved could affect our ability sell our products profitably the current time our 
products are not defined durable medical equipment dme non dme devices used surgical procedures are normally paid directly the hospital 
health care provider and not reimbursed separately third party payors instead the hospital health care provider reimbursed based the procedure 
performed and the inpatient outpatient stay result these types devices are subject intense price competition that can place small manufacturer 
competitive disadvantage hospitals ambulatory surgery centers and health care providers attempt negotiate lower prices for products such the 
ones develop and sell 
march president obama signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act and the reconciliation law 
known health care and education reconciliation act the reconciliation act and with the affordable care act the health care reform 
legislation the constitutionality the health care reform legislation was confirmed twice the supreme court the united states both 
congressional leaders and newly elected president trump have announced plans repeal modify the health care reform legislation this time 
the company not certain the impact federal health care legislation its business 
the health care reform legislation subjects manufacturers medical devices excise tax certain sales medical devices 
beginning january this excise tax was suspended december for two years and anticipate that this may repealed eventually 
implemented this excise tax will likely increase our expenses the future 
further the health care reform legislation includes the open payments act formerly referred the physician payments sunshine act which 
conjunction with its implementing regulations requires certain manufacturers certain drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed medicare 
medicaid and the children health insurance program report annually certain payments transfers value provided physicians and teaching 
hospitals and report annually ownership and investment interests held physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar 
year have provided reports under the open payments act the centers for medicare medicaid services since the failure report appropriate 
data accurately timely and completely could subject significant financial penalties other countries and several states currently have similar laws and 
more may enact similar legislation 
international regulation and potential impact 
through the senhance acquisition the company has expanded into international markets and intends pursue continued expansion some these markets 
maintain unique regulatory requirements outside addition those the fda and the european union the senhance system marked 
which allows offer the product for sale number jurisdictions including select countries europe the middle east and asia due the 
variations regulatory requirements within territories the company may 
required perform additional safety clinical testing fulfill additional agency requirements for specific territories the company may also required 
apply for registration using third parties within those territories and may dependent upon the third parties successful regulatory processes file 
register and list the product applications and associated labeling which could lead significant investments and resource use these additional 
requirements may result delays international registrations and commercialization our products certain countries 
addition are utilizing distributors and sales agents various territories throughout europe the middle east and africa and need ensure that our 
activities and the activities our distributors and sales agents are compliant with local law and laws governing the sales medical devices the laws 
governing the registration approval clearance and sales medical devices such the senhance system multiple jurisdictions are complex and the

are currently highly dependent the commercial success the senhance system which currently marked but not fda cleared began our 
selling efforts for the senhance system the fourth quarter and have had limited commercial success date cannot assure you that will 
able successfully commercialize the senhance system that the fda will grant regulatory clearance for the senhance system for number reasons 
including without limitation failure our sales and marketing efforts the potential introduction our competitors more clinically effective costeffective alternatives our ability obtain regulatory clearance timely manner all failure successfully commercialize the senhance system 
would have material and adverse effect our business regulatory authorities may change requirements for the clearance product regardless 
previous discussions with these regulatory authorities may also clear product for fewer more limited uses than request addition the fda 
other non regulatory authorities may not approve clear the labeling claims necessary desirable for the successful commercialization our products 
expect that our sales cycle for the senhance system will lengthy and unpredictable which will make difficult for forecast revenue and 
increase the magnitude quarterly fluctuations our operating results 
purchase surgical robotic system such the senhance system represents capital purchase hospitals and other potential customers the capital 
purchase nature the transaction the complexity our product the relative newness surgical robotics and the competitive landscape requires spend 
substantial time and effort assist potential customers evaluating our robotic systems must communicate with multiple surgeons administrative staff 
and executives within each potential customer order receive all approvals behalf such organizations may face difficulty identifying and 
establishing contact with such decision makers even after initial acceptance the negotiation and documentation processes can lengthy additionally our 
customers may have strict limitations spending given the current economic climate expect our sales cycle typically range between six and twelve 
months but may longer any delay completing sales particular quarter could cause our operating results fall below expectations also 
expect such lengthy sales cycle makes more difficult for accurately forecast revenue future periods and may cause revenues and operating results 
vary significantly future periods 
although have recently expanded our commercial organization currently have limited marketing sales and distribution capabilities intend 
distribute our products through direct sales and independent contractor and distribution agreements with companies possessing established sales and 
marketing operations the medical device industry but there can assurance that will successful building our sales capabilities the extent 
that enter into distribution promotion other arrangements our product revenue likely lower than directly market sell our products 
addition any revenue receive will depend whole part upon the efforts such third parties which may not successful and are generally not 
within our control are unable enter into such arrangements acceptable terms all may not able successfully commercialize our 
products are not successful commercializing our existing and future products either our own through collaborations with one more third 
parties our future product revenue will suffer and may incur significant additional losses 
will need ensure that have procedures place require our distributors and sales agents comply with applicable laws and regulations 
governing the sales medical devices the jurisdictions where they operate failure meet such requirements could subject financial penalties 
the suspension termination the ability sell our products such jurisdiction 
have history operating losses and may not able achieve sustain profitability addition may unable continue going 
concern 
have limited operating history are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception substantial doubt exists about our ability 
continue going concern result anticipated capital needs well past recurring losses and accumulated deficit our net loss for the year 
ended december was million and our accumulated deficit december was million believe that our existing cash 
and cash equivalents together with cash received from sales our products will not sufficient meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
expect continue incur losses for the foreseeable future and these losses will likely increase continue develop and commercialize our 
products and product candidates will continue incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related our operations and 
expect increase our sales and marketing expenses increase our sales and marketing activities for the senhance system europe and other 
jurisdictions where marking provides authorization for commercial activities and pursue our regulatory strategy the our products fail 
development not gain regulatory clearance approval our products not achieve market acceptance may never become profitable even 
achieve profitability the future may not able sustain profitability subsequent periods 
will require substantial additional funding which may not available acceptable terms all 
the net proceeds recent equity financings including our the market offering and the ongoing equity financing with lincoln park capital fund 
llc commenced december will not sufficient support development our products and product candidates and provide with the necessary 
resources commercialize these products and product candidates while are currently focused seeking regulatory approval for and 
commercialization our senhance system intend advance multiple additional products through clinical and pre clinical development the future 
will need raise substantial additional capital order continue our operations and achieve our business objectives 
have filed two shelf registration statements which have been declared effective the sec december had million available for 
future financings such capacity will expire november cannot assure you that will successful obtaining such additional financing 
terms acceptable the company all 
our future funding requirements will depend many factors including but not limited 
the costs our senhance system commercialization and development activities 
the costs and timing seeking and obtaining fda and other non regulatory clearances and approvals for the senhance system 
the costs associated with establishing sales force and commercialization capabilities

the surgical robotics industry increasingly competitive which can negatively impact our commercial opportunities 
the life sciences industry highly competitive and face significant competition from many medical device companies that are researching and 
marketing products designed address minimally invasive and robotic assisted surgery including new entrants the competitive market are currently 
commercializing the senhance system europe which accepts mark the middle east and selected countries asia and face significant competition 
such markets many our competitors including intuitive surgical have significantly greater financial manufacturing marketing and product 
development resources than some the medical device companies compete with expect compete with include intuitive surgical applied 
medical titan medical medtronic plc verb surgical and number minimally invasive surgical device and robotic surgical device manufacturers and 
providers products and therapies that are designed reduce the need for attractiveness surgical intervention addition many other universities and 
private and public research institutions are may become active research involving surgical devices for minimally invasive and robotic assisted surgery 
believe that our ability successfully compete will depend among other things 
the efficacy safety and reliability our products 
the speed which develop our products 
our ability commercialize and market any our products that may receive regulatory clearance approval 
the cost our products relation alternative devices 
the timing and scope regulatory clearances approvals 
whether our competitors substantially reduce the cost ownership alternative device

sooner than our products may not achieve commercial success addition the medical device industry characterized rapid technological change 
may difficult for stay abreast the rapid changes each technology fail stay the forefront technological change may unable 
compete effectively technological advances products developed our competitors may render our technologies products obsolete less 
competitive 
anticipate that the highly competitive surgical robotics environment can lead our competitors attempt slow derail our commercial progress 
are using our best efforts enter the commercial markets effectively and efficiently while maintaining compliance with all regulatory and legal 
requirements responding the actions our competitors will require the attention our management and may distract the management team from its

june the company submitted application the fda for the surgibot system and worked with the fda provide additional information 
requested april the fda informed the company that the surgibot system did not meet the substantial equivalence test based the 
application after interactions with the fda the company determined that new application would need submitted order obtain clearance 
for the surgibot system based this fact have evaluated the operational and financial feasibility pursuing two applications parallel and 
have elected primarily focus our near term regulatory efforts the submission for the senhance system expect file submission for 
the senhance system the second quarter the product development and design testing manufacturing labeling approval clearance selling 
marketing and distribution medical devices are subject extensive regulation the fda and other non regulatory authorities which regulations 
differ from country country are not permitted market our products the united states until receive clearance letter under the process 
approval pma from the fda depending the nature the device obtaining approval any pma can lengthy expensive and uncertain process 
can provide assurance even our products are reviewed under the premarket notification process that the fda will review our application 
expeditiously determine that the device substantially equivalent lawfully marketed non pma device the fda asks questions during 
process the time required answer the questions can extend the time market additional six months cannot sufficiently answer the 
questions for variety other reasons the fda does not provide clearance for product candidate such the senhance system the surgibot system 
cannot market the device 
regulatory approval pma pma supplement clearance pursuant premarket notification not guaranteed and the approval clearance 
process the case may expensive uncertain and may especially the case the pma application take several years the fda also has substantial 
discretion the medical device clearance process approval process despite the time and expense exerted failure can occur any stage and could 
encounter problems that cause repeat perform additional development standardized testing pre clinical studies and clinical trials the number 
pre clinical studies and clinical trials that will required for fda clearance approval varies depending the medical device candidate the disease 
condition that the medical device candidate designed address and the regulations applicable any particular medical device candidate the fda 
other non regulatory authorities can delay limit deny clearance approval medical device candidate for many reasons including 
medical device candidate may not deemed safe effective the case pma application 
medical device candidate may not deemed substantially equivalent device lawfully marketed either grandfathered device 
one that was cleared through the premarket notification process 
medical device candidate may not deemed conformance with applicable standards and regulations 
fda other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient 
the fda might not approve our processes facilities those any our third party manufacturers for class iii pma device 
other non regulatory authorities may not approve our processes facilities those any our third party manufacturers thereby 
restricting export 
the fda other non regulatory authorities may change clearance approval policies adopt new regulations 
the laws governing the regulatory approval clearance pathways jurisdictions outside the united states are complex need ensure that our 
activities and the activities our distributors and agents comply with such laws not comply with such laws may not able sell our 
products including the senhance system all jurisdictions have targeted which could have adverse effect our business operations and financial 
condition 
the second quarter recorded significant charge earnings related our evaluation the recoverability identifiable intangibles other

once our products are cleared approved modifications our products may require new clearances premarket approvals new amended 
certificates conformity and may require cease marketing recall the modified products until clearances approvals the relevant 
certificates conformity are obtained 
any modification cleared device that could significantly affect its safety effectiveness that would constitute major change its intended 
use design manufacture requires new clearance possibly pma the fda requires every manufacturer make this determination the first 
instance but the fda may review such determinations the fda may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances approvals are 
necessary the fda disagrees with our determinations for any future changes prior changes previously marketed products the case may may 
required cease marketing recall the modified products until obtain clearance approval and may subject significant regulatory fines 
penalties 
furthermore the fda ongoing review the program may make more difficult for make modifications our products either imposing 
more strict requirements when new for modification previously cleared product must submitted applying more onerous review criteria 
such submissions july and december respectively the fda issued draft guidance documents addressing when submit new due 
modifications cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence the july draft guidance document was ultimately 
withdrawn the result the fdasia and result the fda original guidance document regarding modifications which dates back 
remains place uncertain when the fda will seek issue new guidance product modifications any efforts could result more rigorous 
review process and make more difficult obtain clearance for device modifications 
even after clearance approval for our products obtained are subject extensive post market regulation the fda our failure meet strict 
regulatory requirements could require pay fines incur other costs even close our facilities 
even after have obtained the proper regulatory clearance approval market product the fda has the power require conduct post market 
studies these studies can very expensive and time consuming conduct failure complete such studies timely manner could result the 
revocation clearance approval and the recall withdrawal the product which could prevent from generating sales from that product the united 
states the fda has broad enforcement powers and any regulatory enforcement actions inquiries other increased scrutiny could dissuade some

current legislation and future legislative regulatory reform the health care system may affect our ability sell our products profitably 
the united states there have been and expect there continue number legislative and regulatory initiatives both the federal and state 
government levels change the healthcare system ways that approved could affect our ability sell our products profitably while many the 
proposed policy changes require congressional approval implement cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private 
third party payor programs health care providers will remain levels comparable present levels will sufficient cover the costs allocable 
patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs any changes that lower reimbursement rates under medicare medicaid private payor programs 
could negatively affect our business 
the extent that any our products are deemed durable medical equipment dme they may subject distribution under medicare 
competitive acquisition regulations which could adversely affect the amount that can seek from payors non dme devices used surgical procedures 
are normally paid directly the hospital health care provider and not reimbursed separately third party payors result these types devices are 
subject intense price competition that can place small manufacturer competitive disadvantage hospitals and health care providers attempt 
negotiate lower prices for products such the ones develop and sell 
most significantly march president obama signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act and the 
reconciliation law known health care and education reconciliation act the reconciliation act and with the affordable care act the health 
care reform legislation both congressional leaders and president trump have announced plans repeal modify the health care reform 
litigation this time the company not certain the impact federal health care legislation its business 
the health care reform legislation subjects manufacturers medical devices excise tax certain sales medical devices 
beginning january this excise tax was suspended december for two years however eventually implemented this excise tax will likely 
increase our expenses the future 
further the health care reform legislation includes the open payments act formerly referred the physician payments sunshine act which 
conjunction with its implementing regulations requires certain manufacturers certain drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed medicare 
medicaid and the children health insurance program report annually certain payments transfers value provided physicians and teaching 
hospitals and report annually ownership and investment interests held physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar 
year provided reports under the open payments act the centers for medicare medicaid services cms the failure report appropriate data 
accurately timely and completely could subject significant financial penalties other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more 
may enact similar legislation 
are unable predict what additional legislation regulation relating the health care industry third party coverage and reimbursement may 
enacted the future what effect such legislation regulation would have our business any cost containment measures other health care system 
reforms that are adopted could have material and adverse effect our ability commercialize our existing and future products successfully 
because our design development and manufacturing capabilities are limited may rely third parties design develop manufacture supply some 
our products inability find additional alternate sources for these services and products could materially and adversely affect our financial 
condition and results operations 
have used third party design and development sources assist the design and development our medical device products the future may 
choose use additional third party sources for the design and development our products these design and development partners are unable provide 
their services the timeframe the performance level that require may not able establish contract and obtain sufficient alternative supply 
from another supplier timely basis and the manner that require 
our products require precise high quality manufacturing and our contract manufacturers will subject ongoing periodic unannounced inspection 
the fda and non regulatory authorities ensure strict compliance with the quality systems regulations current good manufacturing practices and 
other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards our contract manufacturers fail achieve and maintain high manufacturing 
standards compliance with qsr may experience manufacturing errors resulting patient injury death product recalls withdrawals delays 
interruptions production failures product testing delivery delay prevention filing approval marketing applications for our products cost 
overruns other problems that could seriously harm our business 
any performance failure the part our design and development partners contract manufacturers could delay product development 
regulatory clearance approval our products commercialization our products and future products depriving potential product revenue and 
resulting additional losses addition our dependence any third party for design development manufacturing could adversely affect our future 
profit margins our ability replace any then existing manufacturer may difficult because the number potential manufacturers limited and the 
case class iii devices the fda must approve any replacement manufacturer before manufacturing can begin may difficult impossible for 
identify and engage replacement manufacturer acceptable terms timely manner all 
may become subject potential product liability claims and may required pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes potential product liability claims that are inherent the design testing manufacture sale and distribution our products and 
each our product candidates that are seeking introduce the market surgical medical devices involve significant risks serious complications 
including bleeding nerve injury paralysis infection and even death any product liability claim brought against with without merit could result 
the increase our product liability insurance rates our inability secure coverage the future commercially reasonable terms all addition 
our product liability insurance proves inadequate pay damage award may have pay the excess this award out our cash reserves which 
could significantly harm our financial condition longer term patient results and experience indicate that our products any component product 
causes tissue damage motor impairment other adverse effects could subject significant liability product liability claim even one without 
merit could harm our reputation the industry lead significant legal fees and result the diversion management attention from managing our 
business 
are unable obtain and enforce patent protection for our products our business could materially harmed 
our success depends part our ability protect proprietary methods and technologies that develop license under the patent and other intellectual 
property laws the united states and other countries that can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information 
however may not hold proprietary rights some patents required for commercialize our proposed products hold nine united states patents 
three italian patents one russian patent european patent two japanese patents two australian patents and chinese patent and have more than forty 
patent applications filed the united states and abroad because certain patent applications are confidential until patents issue such applications 
filed prior november applications filed after such date which will not filed foreign countries third parties may have filed patent 
applications for technology covered our pending patent applications without our being aware those applications and our patent applications may not 
have priority over those applications for this and other reasons our third party collaborators may unable secure desired patent rights thereby 
losing desired exclusivity licenses are not available acceptable terms will not able market the affected products conduct the desired 
activities unless challenge the validity enforceability infringement the third party patent otherwise circumvent the third party patent 
our strategy depends our ability promptly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries addition will rely third party collaborators 
file patent applications relating proprietary technology that develop jointly during certain collaborations the process obtaining patent 
protection expensive and time consuming our present future collaborators fail file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications 
reasonable cost and timely manner our business will adversely affected despite our efforts and the efforts our collaborators protect our

predictably uniformly and can change there also uniform worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope claims granted allowable 
medical device patents accordingly not know the degree future protection for our proprietary rights the breadth claims that will allowed 
any patents issued others the legal systems certain countries not favor the aggressive enforcement patents and the laws foreign 
countries may not protect our rights the same extent the laws the united states therefore the enforceability scope our owned licensed patents 
the united states foreign countries cannot predicted with certainty and result any patents that own license may not provide sufficient

result the loss our rights under the license agreement our inability rely these patents and patent applications which are the basis certain 
aspects our senhance system technology would have adverse effect our business 
further our success will depend part the ability the european union and other third party licensors obtain maintain and enforce patent 
protection for our licensed intellectual property and particular those patents which have secured exclusive rights the european union other

our commercial success depends significantly our ability operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights third parties 
other entities may have obtain patents proprietary rights that could limit our ability manufacture use sell offer for sale import products impair

able sustain the costs complex patent litigation more effectively than can because they have substantially greater resources uncertainties resulting 
from the initiation and continuation any litigation could limit our ability continue our operations 
any parties successfully claim that our creation use proprietary technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights might forced 
pay damages potentially including treble damages are found have willfully infringed such parties patent rights addition any damages 
might have pay court could require stop the infringing activity obtain license any license required under any patent may not made

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations set forth above under the headings results operations and liquidity 
and capital resources have been prepared accordance with gaap and should read conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
appearing item this annual report the preparation these financial statements requires make estimates and judgments that affect the reported 
amounts assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure contingent assets and liabilities going basis evaluate our critical 
accounting policies and estimates including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill business combinations process research and development 
contingent consideration stock based compensation inventory and revenue recognition base our estimates historical experience and various 
other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
values assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources more detailed discussion the application these and other accounting 
policies can found note the notes the financial statements set forth our financial statements for the years ended december 
and which are included item this annual report actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
while all accounting policies impact the financial statements certain policies may viewed critical critical accounting policies are those that are both 
most important the portrayal financial condition and results operations and that require management most subjective complex judgments and 
estimates our management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies accounting for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
business acquisitions process research and development contingent consideration stock based compensation inventory and revenue recognition 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets consist purchased patent rights recorded cost and developed technology acquired part business acquisition recorded 
estimated fair value intangible assets are amortized over years periodically evaluate identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever 
events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not recoverable 
indefinite lived intangible assets such goodwill are not amortized test the carrying amounts goodwill for recoverability annual basis when 
events changes circumstances indicate evidence potential impairment exists performing either qualitative evaluation two step quantitative 
test the qualitative evaluation assessment factors including industry market and general economic conditions market value and future projections 
determine whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than it carrying amount including goodwill may elect 
bypass this qualitative assessment and perform two step quantitative test the quantitative goodwill impairment test performed using two step 
approach the first step the fair value the reporting unit determined and compared the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill the fair 
value the reporting unit less than its carrying value the second step the goodwill impairment test performed measure the amount impairment 
any the second step the fair value the reporting unit allocated the assets and liabilities the reporting unit had been acquired 
business combination and the purchase price was equivalent the fair value the reporting unit the excess the fair value the reporting unit over the 
amounts assigned its assets and liabilities referred the implied fair value goodwill the implied fair value the reporting unit goodwill then 
compared the actual carrying value goodwill the implied fair value goodwill less than the carrying value goodwill impairment loss 
recognized for the difference performed qualitative assessment during the annual impairment review for fiscal december and 
concluded that not more likely than not that the fair value our single reporting unit less than its carrying amount therefore the two step goodwill 
impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary fiscal during the second quarter the fda notified the company that the surgibot 
system did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalency negatively impacting the company market capitalization and warranting interim two step 
quantitative impairment test determined the fair value our reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis derived from our long term plans the 
fair value the reporting unit was corroborated using market prices for transenterix inc the inputs used determine the fair values were classified 
level the fair value hierarchy based the impairment test recorded goodwill impairment million during the second quarter 
performed qualitative assessment during the annual impairment review for fiscal december and concluded that not more likely 
than not that the fair value our single reporting unit less than its carrying amount therefore the two step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit 
was not necessary december 
business acquisitions 
business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method accounting accordance with accounting standards codification asc 
business combinations asc requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized their fair values determined 
accordance with asc fair value measurements the acquisition date for certain assets and liabilities book value approximates fair value 
addition asc establishes that consideration transferred measured the closing date the acquisition the then current market price under asc 
acquisition related costs advisory legal valuation and other professional fees and certain acquisition related restructuring charges impacting the 
target company are expensed the period which the costs are incurred the application the acquisition method accounting requires the company 
make estimates and assumptions related the estimated fair values net assets acquired 
significant judgments are used during this process particularly with respect intangible assets generally intangible assets are amortized over their 
estimated useful lives goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized but are annually assessed for impairment therefore the purchase 
price allocation intangible assets and goodwill has significant impact future operating results 
process research and development 
process research and development ipr assets are considered indefinite lived until the completion abandonment the associated research 
and development projects ipr assets represent the fair value assigned technologies that acquire which the time acquisition have not reached 
technological feasibility and have alternative future use during the period that the assets are considered indefinite lived they are tested for impairment 
annual basis more frequently become aware any events occurring changes circumstances that indicate that the fair value the ipr 
assets are less than their carrying amounts and when development complete which generally occurs when have regulatory approval and are able 
commercialize products associated with the ipr assets these assets are then deemed definite lived and are amortized based their estimated useful lives 
that point time development terminated abandoned may have full partial impairment charge related the ipr assets calculated 
the excess carrying value the ipr assets over fair value 
contingent consideration 
contingent consideration recorded liability and measured fair value using discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs 
including the probability achieving each the potential milestones and estimated discount rate associated with the risks the expected cash flows 
attributable the various milestones significant increases decreases any the probabilities success changes expected timelines for 
achievement any these milestones would result significantly higher lower fair value these milestones respectively and commensurate changes 
the associated liability the fair value the contingent consideration each reporting date will updated reflecting the changes fair value our 
statement operations 
stock based compensation 
recognize expense the grant date fair value stock options and other stock based compensation issued employees and non employee directors 
over the requisite service periods which are typically the vesting periods use the black scholes merton model estimate the fair value our stockbased payments the volatility assumption used the black scholes merton model based the calculated historical volatility based analysis 
reported data for peer group companies the expected term options granted has been determined based upon the simplified method because 
not have sufficient historical information regarding our options derive the expected term under this approach the expected term the mid point 
between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term the risk free interest rate based treasury rates whose term consistent 
with the expected life the stock options have not paid and not anticipate paying cash dividends our shares common stock therefore the 
expected dividend yield assumed zero estimate forfeitures based our historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeiture rate based upon 
actual experience 
inventory 
inventory which includes material labor and overhead costs stated cost and determined first first out basis not excess market value 
record reserves when necessary reduce the carrying value inventory its net realizable value the point loss recognition new lower cost basis 
for that inventory established and any subsequent improvements facts and circumstances not result the restoration increase that newly 
established cost basis 
revenue recognition 
our revenue consists product revenue resulting from the sales systems instruments and accessories and service revenue recognize revenue when 
persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery has occurred service has been rendered the price fixed determinable and collectability 
reasonably assured revenue presented net taxes collected from customers that are remitted government authorities generally recognize revenue 
the following points time 
system sales for systems sold directly end customers revenue recognized when acceptance occurs which deemed have occurred 
upon customer acknowledgment delivery installation depending the terms the arrangement the senhance systems are delivered 
with software component however because the software and non software elements function together deliver the system essential 
functionality our arrangements are excluded from being accounted for under software revenue recognition guidance 
instruments and accessories revenue from sales instruments and accessories generally recognized the time shipment 
service service revenue recognized ratably over the term the service period revenue related services performed time andmaterials basis recognized when earned and billable 
our system sale arrangements contain multiple elements including system instruments accessories and system service generally deliver all the 
elements other than service within days entering into the system sale arrangement each these elements separate unit accounting system 
accessories instruments accessories and service are also sold stand alone basis 
for multiple element arrangements revenue allocated each unit accounting based their relative selling prices relative selling prices are based first 
vendor specific objective evidence fair value vsoe then third party evidence selling price tpe when vsoe does not exist and then 
management best estimate the selling price besp when vsoe and tpe not exist 
our system sale arrangements generally include one year period free service and the right for the customer purchase service annually thereafter the 
revenue allocated the free service period deferred and recognized ratably over the free service period deferred revenue was primarily comprised 
deferred revenue related service contracts for the periods presented 
because have neither vsoe nor tpe for our systems the allocation revenue based besp for the systems sold the objective besp 
determine the price which would transact sale had the product been sold stand alone basis determine besp for our systems considering 
multiple factors including but not limited features and functionality the system geographies type customer and market conditions regularly

intellectual property consists purchased patent rights and developed research and development acquired part business acquisition amortization 
the patent rights recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful life the patents years amortization the developed research 
and development recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful life years this method approximates the period over which the 
company expects receive the benefit from these assets see note for additional information related the write off purchased patents connection

have not reached technological feasibility and have alternative future use ipr assets are considered indefinite lived until the completion 
abandonment the associated research and development projects during the period that 
the ipr assets are considered indefinite lived they are tested for impairment annual basis more frequently the company becomes aware any 
events occurring changes circumstances that indicate that the fair value the ipr assets are less than their carrying amounts and when 
development complete which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and the company able commercialize products associated with the ipr 
assets these assets are then deemed definite lived and are amortized based their estimated useful lives that point time development terminated 
abandoned the company may have full partial impairment charge related the ipr assets calculated the excess carrying value the ipr 
assets over fair value the ipr was acquired september impairment existed december and

long lived assets could reduced the future resulting reduction the carrying amount long lived assets 
contingent consideration 
contingent consideration recorded liability and the estimate the fair value potential milestone payments related business acquisitions 
contingent consideration measured fair value using discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the probability 
achieving each the potential milestones and estimated discount rate associated with the risks the expected cash flows attributable the various 
milestones significant increases decreases any the probabilities success changes expected timelines for achievement any these 
milestones would result significantly higher lower fair value these milestones respectively and commensurate changes the associated liability

for assets and liabilities recorded fair value the company policy maximize the use observable inputs and minimize the use unobservable 
inputs when developing fair value measurements accordance with the fair value hierarchy fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there 
exists limited observable market data and therefore are based primarily upon estimates are often calculated based the economic and competitive 
environment the characteristics the asset liability and other factors therefore the results cannot determined with precision and may not realized 
actual sale immediate settlement the asset liability additionally there may inherent weaknesses any calculation technique and changes 
the underlying assumptions used including discount rates and estimates future cash flows could significantly affect the results current future 
values the company utilizes fair value measurements record fair value adjustments certain assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures 
prescribed gaap the company groups assets and liabilities fair value three levels based the markets which the assets and liabilities are 
traded and the reliability the assumptions used determine fair value adjustment the pricing method used within either level level inputs 
could generate fair value measurement that effectively falls lower level the hierarchy 
the determination where asset liability falls the hierarchy requires significant judgment the company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures and 
based various factors possible that asset liability may classified differently from period period however the company expects changes 
classifications between levels will rare
