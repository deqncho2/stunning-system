goodwill 
goodwill reflects the excess the consideration transferred plus the fair value any non controlling interest 
the acquiree the acquisition date over the fair values the identifiable net assets acquired goodwill not 
amortized but rather tested for impairment annually whenever events circumstances present indication 
impairment goodwill asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired 
business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized the primary items that 
generate goodwill include the value the synergies between the acquired companies and and the acquired 
assembled workforce neither which qualifies for recognition identifiable intangible asset 
the annual impairment testing required asc intangibles goodwill and other requires use 
judgment and could require write down the carrying value our goodwill future periods allocate 
goodwill our identifiable geographic reporting units the americas emea and apac regions which are 
tested for impairment using two step process the first step requires 
page 
comparing the fair value each reporting unit with the carrying amount including goodwill that fair value 
exceeds the carrying amount the second step the process not required performed and impairment 
charge required recorded that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount must perform the 
second step which requires allocation the fair value the reporting unit all assets and liabilities that 
unit the reporting unit had been acquired purchase business combination and the fair value the 
reporting unit was the purchase price the goodwill resulting from that purchase price allocation then 
compared the carrying amount with any excess recorded impairment charge 
the evaluation goodwill impairment requires make assumptions about future cash flows the reporting 
unit being evaluated that include among others growth revenues margins realized level operating 
expenses and cost capital these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from 
assumed and estimated amounts 
goodwill set forth the consolidated balance sheet december arose from acquisitions carried 
out from and years prior december goodwill arising from acquisitions prior 
was allocated geographic reporting units based the percentage sls printers then installed geographic 
area goodwill arising from acquisitions was allocated geographic reporting units based 
geographic dispersion the acquired companies sales capitalization the time their acquisition 
conducted our annual impairment testing for the years ended december and the fourth 
quarters and respectively there was goodwill impairment for the years ended december 
and 
conducted our annual impairment testing for the year ended december the fourth quarter 
the results the first step our annual impairment testing indicated the carrying amount goodwill assigned 
the americas and emea reporting units exceeded fair value and that the carrying amount goodwill assigned 
apac did not exceed fair value based these results management completed the second step annual 
impairment testing for the americas and emea reporting units management determined that the fair value 
associated with goodwill assigned the americas was zero resulting non cash non tax deductible 
impairment charge million for the year ended december management determined that the 
carrying amount the goodwill assigned the emea reporting unit exceeded fair value approximately 
resulting non cash non tax deductible impairment charge million for the year ended december 
see notes and our consolidated financial statements 
will monitor our reporting units effort determine whether events and circumstances warrant further 
interim impairment testing could required write off write down additional amounts the future 
the event deterioration our future performance sustained slower growth other circumstances 
other intangible assets 
intangible assets other than goodwill primarily represent acquired intangible assets including licenses patent 
costs acquired technology internally developed technology customer relationships non compete agreements 
trade names and trademarks intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over 
their estimated useful life which determined identifying the period over which most the cash flows are 
expected generated 
for intangibles with finite lives review the carrying amounts for potential impairment when events 
changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount asset may not recoverable examples such 
change circumstances include significant decrease selling price significant adverse change the 
extent manner which asset being used significant adverse change the legal business climate 
evaluating recoverability group assets and liabilities the lowest level such that the identifiable cash 
flows relating the group are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities then 
compare the carrying amounts the assets asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash 
flows the event impairment exists impairment charge recorded the amount which the carrying 
amount the asset asset group exceeds the fair value fair value determined reference estimated 
selling values assets similar condition using discounted cash flow model addition the remaining 
amortization period for the impaired asset would reassessed and necessary revised 
impairment charges for intangible assets with finite lives were recorded for the years ended december
