industry overview 
historically prototype development and customized manufacturing have been performed traditional methods using metal extrusion computercontrolled machining and manual modeling techniques which blocks material are carved milled into specific objects these subtractive 
manufacturing methodologies have numerous limitations they often require specialist technicians and can time and labor intensive the time intensity 
traditional modeling can leave little room for design error subsequent redesign without meaningfully impacting product time market and 
development cost result prototypes have traditionally been created only selected milestones late the design process which prevents designers 
from truly visualizing and verifying the design object the preliminary design stage the inability iterate design rapidly hinders collaboration 
among design team members and other stakeholders and reduces the ability optimize design time market and optimization become necessary tradeoffs the design process 
printing addresses the inherent limitations traditional modeling technologies through its combination functionality quality ease use speed 
and cost printing can significantly more efficient and effective than traditional model making techniques for use across the design process from 
concept modeling and design review and validation fit and function prototyping pattern making and tooling direct manufacturing repeatable costeffective parts short run parts and customized end products introducing modeling earlier the design process evaluate fit form and function can 
result faster time market and lower product development costs 
for customized manufacturing printers eliminate the need for complex manufacturing set ups and reduce the cost and lead time associated with 
conventional tooling ddm involves the use production systems for the direct manufacture parts that are subsequently incorporated into the user 
end product manufacturing process ddm particularly attractive applications that require short run low volume parts rapid turn around and for 
which tooling would not appropriate due small volumes ddm also enables the production objects that have been topologically designed 
designed the basis computerized determination where place the key components the object and how connect them process that 
generally unavailable using conventional subtractive manufacturing methodologies 
the first commercial printers were introduced the early and since the early printing technology has evolved significantly terms 
price variety and quality materials accuracy ability create complex objects ease use and suitability for office environments printing 
already replacing traditional prototype development methodologies across various industries such architecture automotive aerospace and defense

key measures our performance 
revenues 
our consolidated revenues result primarily from sales our products which include both our systems and related consumable materials 
provision related services and iii our direct manufacturing service generate revenues and deliver services principally through the following channels 
sales resellers who purchase and resell our products and who provide support services for our printing systems 
sales systems that are marketed independent sales agents pursuant which sell directly end users pay commissions such agents and 
directly handle the sale consumables and provision support services and 
sales systems and all related products and services well our direct manufacturing solutions service that effect and provide our 
customers directly 
there overlap among the channels some independent sales agents for our higher end products also serve resellers our other products 
product revenues 
product revenues are influenced number factors including among other things the adoption rate our products end user product design 
application and manufacturing activity and iii the capital expenditure budgets end users and potential end users all which may significantly 
influenced macroeconomic factors product revenues are also impacted the mix printers that sell purchases our printing and production 
systems especially our higher end higher priced systems typically involve longer sales cycles 
product revenues also depend upon the volume consumables that sell sales our consumable materials are linked the number systems 
that are installed and active worldwide sales consumables are also driven system usage which generally function the size the particular 
system and the level design and manufacturing activity and budget the particular end user larger systems generally use greater amounts 
consumables due their greater capacity and the higher levels design and production 
services revenues 
services revenues derive from maintenance and warranty direct manufacturing paid parts services and iii other professional service contracts 
addition connection with direct sales generally charge separately for installation and training additional services revenues are generated from 
services contracts most often entered into directly with end users subsequent the expiration the initial warranty period 
costs revenues 
our costs revenues consist costs products and costs services costs products consist primarily components and subassemblies purchased 
for the manufacture our systems and raw materials such thermoplastic and photopolymer materials for the manufacture our consumables well

accounted for approximately our total direct cost sales additional significant item our cost revenues the amortization expense that 
primarily incur connection with developed technology assets acquired part our business combinations these amortization expenses vary based 
the timing and type acquisitions and estimated useful lives the respective intangible assets these amortization expenses were million million 
and million for the years ended december and respectively 
for the year ended december hypothetical rise commodity prices for raw materials would have caused approximate million 
increase cost revenues our consolidated statement income and comprehensive income wages and related benefits increase wages 
due wage inflation would cause approximate million increase cost revenues our consolidated statement operations and comprehensive 
loss during did not notice particular trends that changed were expected change the near future the absolute relative significance the

the gross profit and gross margin for our products are influenced number factors the most important these the mix our products sold 
specifically the gross margins our higher end systems well our consumables are typically higher than the gross margins our entry level 
products makerbot desktop printers and certain models our design series accordingly increase the share revenues our entry level products out 
total revenues could cause our profit margins decrease furthermore believe that our worldwide installed base systems increases 
subsequent sales our proprietary consumables will also increase also seek reduce our costs revenues improving our ability use less costly 
components and increasing manufacturing efficiencies the production our systems addition will also seek achieve lower material costs and 
leverage our overall capabilities our direct manufacturing service business 
products gross margins are also impacted the mix revenues generated from sales resellers based different geographical areas opposed sales 
that are facilitated independent sales agents directly
