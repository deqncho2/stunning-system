this discussion highlights some the risks which may affect future operating results these are the risks and uncertainties 
believe are most important for you consider additional risks and uncertainties not presently known which currently 
deem immaterial which are similar those faced other companies our industry business general may also impair 
our business operations any the following risks uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition and 
operating results would likely suffer 
operate emerging market which makes difficult evaluate our business and future prospects 
robots represent new and emerging market accordingly our business and future prospects are difficult evaluate 
cannot accurately predict the extent which demand for consumer robots will increase all you should consider the 
challenges risks and uncertainties frequently encountered companies using new and unproven business models rapidly 
evolving markets these challenges include our ability 
generate sufficient revenue and gross margin maintain profitability 
acquire and maintain market share our consumer market 
attract and retain customers our consumer robots 
attract and retain additional engineers and other highly qualified personnel and 
expand our product offerings beyond our existing robots 
fail successfully address these and other challenges risks and uncertainties our business results operations 
and financial condition would materially harmed 
our financial results often vary significantly from quarter quarter due number factors which may lead 
volatility our stock price 
our quarterly revenue and other operating results have varied the past and are likely continue vary significantly 
from quarter quarter the future these fluctuations may due numerous factors including 
the size timing and mix orders from retail stores and distributors for our consumer robots 
the mix products that sell the period 
disruption supply our products from our manufacturers

quarter even every fiscal year base our current and future expense levels our internal operating plans and sales 
forecasts including forecasts holiday sales for our consumer products significant portion our operating expenses such 
research and development expenses certain marketing and promotional expenses and employee wages and salaries not 
vary directly with sales and are difficult adjust the short term result sales for quarter are below our expectations 
might not able reduce operating expenses for that quarter accordingly sales shortfall during fiscal quarter and 
particular the fourth quarter fiscal year could have disproportionate effect our operating results for that quarter that 
year because quarterly fluctuations believe that quarter quarter comparisons our operating results are not 
necessarily meaningful moreover our operating results may not meet expectations equity research analysts investors 
this occurs the trading price our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly over time 
global economic conditions and any associated impact consumer spending could have material adverse effect 
our business results operations and financial condition 
continued economic uncertainty and reductions consumer spending particularly certain international markets such 
the european union china and japan may result reductions sales our consumer robots additionally disruptions 
credit markets may materially limit consumer credit availability and restrict credit availability our retail customers which 
would also impact purchases our consumer robots any reduction sales our consumer robots resulting from reductions 
consumer spending continued disruption the availability credit retailers consumers could materially and 
adversely affect our business results operations and financial condition

success depends upon our ability further penetrate the consumer home care market enhance our current consumer 
products and develop and introduce new consumer products offering enhanced performance and functionality competitive 
prices the development and application new technologies involve time substantial costs and risks our inability achieve 
significant sales our newly introduced robots enhance develop and introduce other products timely manner 
all would materially harm our sales growth and operating results 
even consumer robots gain wide market acceptance our robots may not adequately address market requirements and 
may not continue gain market acceptance robots generally our robots specifically not gain wide market acceptance 
may not able achieve our anticipated level growth and our revenue and results operations would suffer
