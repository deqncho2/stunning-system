customers for the innovative design solutions that enable our customers have valued wafer process advantage and 
improved cost ownership the fab our global network technical specialists provides extensive support our 
customers all regions including the key semiconductor markets korea taiwan japan and china 
the production advanced semiconductor chips requires many complex and logistically challenging manufacturing 
activities silicon wafers must through hundreds process steps order create billions microscopic transistors and 
connect them both horizontal and vertical layers produce functioning integrated circuit these steps which 
comprise the initial fabrication the and referred the industry front end processes are repeated many times 
single wafer create the desired pattern the silicon wafer these processes are performed tools that 
operate under vacuum conditions such removing depositing measuring materials wafer surfaces the complexity 
semiconductors has increased the number process steps that occur vacuum environment have also increased 
resulting greater need for both automation and vacuum technology solutions 
the increase packing density components mobile devices has led the industry devise new techniques for chip 
interconnectivity using what called wafer level packaging wlp this advanced packaging technology process 
combining multiple wafers together prior cutting them into pieces and then forming them onto packaging substrate 
where they are ultimately divided into the multitude chips the recent increased adoption wlp has increased the need 
for contaminant free and high purity manufacturing environment which providing new demand across our 
semiconductor offerings which are tailored handle full wafer forms expanding our opportunity with existing and new 
customers for example throughout the fabrication and packaging processes noted above the demand for clean processing 
extends increased demand for wafer carrier devices which are used for the safe and clean transport wafers between tools 
during the manufacturing process large scale semiconductor fabs may use thousands these carriers there also growing 
demand for wafer carrier cleaning and conditioning tools used remove microscopic particles organic compounds and 
water that are attracted the inside surface the carrier automated cleaning and conditioning the carrier devices are also 
demand customers looking improve yields 
adjacent capital equipment markets 
addition the semiconductor manufacturing industry there are variety adjacent and industrial manufacturing 
operations that use similar manufacturing processes frequently these markets have common customers and similar 
technology applications few the adjacent markets which serve include light emitting diodes led which are 
manufactured using vacuum systems and handling processes similar those used semiconductor manufacturing organic 
light emitting diode oled applications are also gaining traction the mobile computing and telecommunications 
device markets because their high quality display and low power consumption touch screen technology found mobile 
devices requires either vacuum significant cooling for effective deposition films coatings during the production 
process 
believe the desire for efficient higher throughput and extremely clean manufacturing for semiconductor wafer fabs 
the chip packaging process and other industrial high performance electronic based products and processes have created 
substantial market for the following offerings substrate handling automation which related moving the wafers

prior fiscal year had three operating and reportable segments that consisted brooks product solutions 
brooks global services and brooks life science systems and six reporting units including five reporting units that had 
goodwill four reporting units were part the brooks product solutions operating segment and each the brooks global 
services segment and brooks life science systems segment represented reporting unit during fiscal year 
reorganized our previous reporting structure into two operating and reportable segments consisting brooks semiconductor 
solutions group and brooks life science systems additionally realigned our reporting units into five reporting units 
including four reporting units within the brooks semiconductor solutions group operating segment and one reporting unit 
which the brooks life science systems operating segment reflect the revised reporting structure tested goodwill for

completed the annual goodwill impairment test for our five reporting units april and determined that 
adjustment goodwill was necessary since the fair value each reporting unit was significantly excess the carrying 
value each reporting unit conducted qualitative assessment for three reporting units within the brooks 
semiconductor solutions group segment and determined that was not likely that their fair values were less than their 
carrying values result the analysis did not perform the quantitative assessment for these reporting units and 
did not recognize impairment losses also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the fourth reporting
