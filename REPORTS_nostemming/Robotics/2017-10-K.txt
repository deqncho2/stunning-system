competition 
our businesses operate highly competitive industry segments 
oilfield 
are one several companies that provide underwater services and specialty subsea hardware worldwide basis 
compete for contracts with companies that have worldwide operations well numerous others operating locally various 
areas believe that our ability provide wide range underwater services and products worldwide basis enables 
compete effectively all phases the offshore oilfield life cycle some cases involving projects that require less sophisticated 
equipment small companies have been able bid for contracts prices uneconomical additionally some jurisdictions 
are subject foreign governmental regulations favoring requiring the awarding contracts local contractors 
requiring foreign contractors employ citizens purchase supplies from particular jurisdiction these regulations may 
adversely affect our ability compete 
rovs believe are the world largest owner operator work class rovs employed oil and gas related operations 
december owned work class rovs and estimate that this represented approximately the workclass rovs utilized the oilfield service industry compete with several major companies worldwide basis and with 
numerous others operating locally various areas 
competition for rov services historically has been based equipment availability location ability deploy the equipment 
quality service and price the relative importance these factors can vary over time based market conditions the ability 
develop improved equipment and techniques and train and retain skilled personnel also important competitive factor 
our markets demand for rovs has been decreasing since mid due the oil price environment and our margins have 
decreased recent periods due lower utilization and pricing pressure price has become more important factor the 
current oil price environment 
subsea products there are many competitors offering specialized products are one several companies that compete 
worldwide basis for the provision thermoplastic and steel tube subsea control umbilicals and compared current and 
forecasted market demand are faced with overcapacity the umbilical manufacturing market 
subsea projects perform subsea intervention and hardware installation services principally the gulf mexico and 
offshore angola and india from multiservice deepwater vessels are one many companies that offer these services 
general our competitors can move their vessels where operate from other locations with relative ease also have many 
competitors that supply commercial diving services the oil and gas industry the gulf mexico our survey and

addition our oilfield business primarily depends the demand for our services and products from the oil and gas industry 
and therefore affected changing taxes price controls and other laws and regulations relating the oil and gas industry 
generally the adoption laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for 
economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations limiting demand for our services cannot

million decrease income tax expense for the year ended december and corresponding million 
decrease net deferred tax liabilities december however our accounting for deferred taxes 
based estimates which could change and potentially affect the measurement these balances potentially give rise 
new deferred tax amounts and 
transition tax foreign earnings the tax act imposes one time transition tax applicable unremitted earnings and 
profits the foreign subsidiaries our subsidiaries prior enactment the tax act recognized deferred tax 
liability for certain foreign earnings that were considered repatriated and did not recognize deferred tax liability 
related the unremitted earnings certain our foreign subsidiaries that considered indefinitely reinvested 
the final determination the transition tax requires further analysis regarding the amount and composition our 
historical foreign earnings and tax pools due estimates related certain yet filed current foreign tax returns
