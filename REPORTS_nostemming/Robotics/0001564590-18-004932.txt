market overview 
over the past two decades laparoscopic surgery has emerged minimally invasive alternative open surgery laparoscopic surgery multiple incisions 
are necessary provide surgical access ports carbon dioxide gas insufflation then used create room the body cavity and long rigid instruments are 
introduced through ports placed the incisions perform surgical tasks millions laparoscopic surgical procedures across broad range clinical 
applications are now performed each year worldwide though many surgeries are still performed open fashion 
while laparoscopy has improved the invasive nature many previously open procedures still has many limitations traditional rigid laparoscopy still 
requires multiple incisions achieve the visualization and instrument triangulation required perform successful surgery rigid laparoscopy also creates 
physical challenges forcing the surgeon hands and arms into awkward angles requiring the surgeon hold instruments fixed positions for long 
periods time and requiring assistant stabilize and move laparoscopic camera another challenge associated with rigid laparoscopic surgery the 
creation cumbersome and potentially tissue damaging fulcrum the patient abdominal wall where instruments are manipulated nearly all 
laparoscopic instruments are rigid instruments that lack internal articulation enhance dexterity complex tasks most laparoscopic surgeries are 
performed with two dimensional visualization the operative field making depth perception difficult 
despite such limitations traditional laparoscopy remains the prevalent technique minimally invasive surgery believe that robotic devices that 
replicate laparoscopic motion are more comfortable for surgeons adopt thereby increasing the opportunity enhance traditional surgical methods with 
robotics our senhance system mimics laparoscopic surgery 
robotic and computer controlled assistance have developed technologies that offer the potential improve upon many aspects the laparoscopic 
surgical experience hundreds thousands robotic assisted surgical procedures are now performed each year worldwide but they still represent small 
fraction the total laparoscopic procedures performed while initial widespread adoption robotic assisted surgery was focused urologic and 
gynecologic procedures that were primarily performed open fashion prior robotics recently developed robotic approaches have been applied 
many other clinical applications particularly general surgery despite recent advances believe there remain many limitations associated with current 
robotic assisted surgery systems used connection with laparoscopic surgeries 
product overview 
are addressing the challenges laparoscopy and robotic assisted surgery with innovative products and product candidates that leverage the best features 
both approaches minimally invasive surgery

license agreement 
competition 
our industry highly competitive subject change and significantly affected new product introductions and other activities industry participants 
many our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than and have established reputations with our target customers 
well worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours 
there are many competitive offerings the field minimally invasive surgery several companies have launched devices that enable reduced incision 
single incision laparoscopic surgery with without robotic assistance our surgical competitors include but are not limited johnson johnson 
medtronic plc applied medical and intuitive surgical 
addition surgical device manufacturer competitors there are many products and therapies that are designed reduce the need for attractiveness 
surgical intervention these products and therapies may impact the overall volume surgical procedures and negatively impact our business 
our ability compete may affected the failure fully educate physicians the use our products and products development the level 
physician expertise this may have the effect making our products less attractive among currently available surgical robotic systems expect the 
senhance system differentiate the basis overall attractiveness laparoscopic surgeons due its ability provide robotic benefits while leveraging 
their laparoscopic training and experience lower per procedure costs when compared other robotic systems the market today and expect the 
senhance system differentiate most cases its ability provide the surgeon with tactile feedback several medical device companies are actively 
engaged research and development robotic systems other medical devices and tools used minimally invasive surgery procedures cannot 
predict the basis upon which will compete with new products marketed others 
government regulation our product development activities 
the government and foreign governments regulate the medical device industry through various agencies including but not limited the fda 
which administers the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fdca the design testing manufacturing storage labeling distribution advertising 
and marketing medical devices are subject extensive regulation federal state and local governmental authorities the united states including the 
fda and similar agencies other countries including the european union any device product that develop must receive all requisite regulatory 
approvals clearances the case may before may marketed particular country 
device development marketing clearance and approval 
medical devices are subject varying levels pre market regulatory requirements the fda classifies medical devices into one three classes class 
devices are relatively simple and can manufactured and distributed with general controls class devices are somewhat more complex and receive 
greater scrutiny from the fda and have heightened regulatory requirements and iii class iii devices are new high risk devices and frequently are 
permanently implantable help sustain life and generally require pre market approval pma the fda 
the united states company generally can obtain permission distribute new medical device one two ways the first applies any device that 
substantially equivalent device first marketed prior may another device marketed after that date but which was substantially equivalent 
pre may device these devices are either class class devices obtain fda clearance distribute the medical device company generally 
must submit notification and receive fda order finding substantial equivalence predicate device pre may device post may 
device that was substantially equivalent pre may device and permitting commercial distribution that medical device for its intended use 
notification must provide information supporting claim substantial equivalence single medical device the predicate device clinical data 
from human experience are required support the notification these data must gathered compliance with investigational device exemption 
ide regulations for investigations performed the united states the process normally used for products the type that are developing and 
propose market and sell the fda review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant section the fdca takes pursuant statutory 
requirements days but can take substantially longer the fda has questions regarding the regulatory submission possible for clearance 
procedures take from six eighteen months depending the concerns raised the fda and the complexity the device there guarantee that 
the fda will clear medical device for marketing which case the device cannot distributed the united states there also guarantee that the 
fda will deem the applicable device subject the process opposed the more time consuming resource intensive and problematic pma process 
described below 
the second more comprehensive approval process applies new device that not substantially equivalent pre product that used 
supporting sustaining life preventing impairment these devices are normally class iii devices for example most implantable devices are subject the 
approval process class iii device two steps fda approval are generally required before company can market product the united states that 
subject approval opposed clearance class iii device first company must comply with ide regulations connection with any human clinical 
investigation the device these regulations permit company undertake clinical study non significant risk device without formal fda 
approval prior express fda approval required the device significant risk device second the fda must approve the company pma application 
which contains among other things clinical information acquired under the ide additionally devices subject pma approval may subject panel 
review obtain marketing approval and are required pass factory inspection accordance with the current good manufacturing practices standards 
order obtain approval the fda will approve the pma application finds there reasonable assurance that the device safe and effective for its 
intended use the pma process takes substantially longer than the process approximately one two years more 
however some instances the fda may find that device new and not substantially equivalent predicate device but also not high risk device 
generally the case with class iii pma devices these instances fda may allow device down classified from class iii class the novo 
classification option alternate pathway classify novel devices low moderate risk that had automatically been placed class iii after receiving 
not substantially equivalent nse determination response notification the regulations have also been amended allow sponsor 
submit novo classification request the fda for novel low moderate risk devices without first being required submit application these 
types applications are referred evaluation automatic class iii designation novo instances where device deemed not substantially 
equivalent class predicate device the candidate device may filed novo application which may lead delays regulatory decisions the 
fda fda review novo application may lead the fda identify the device either class device and worthy either exempt 
regulatory pathway 
the company believes the senhance system and many related products are class devices evidenced the company recently cleared 
premarket notification the company intends further develop the product line adding additional instrumentation 
and accessories for use with the senhance system this time the company believes that the items under development are class devices subject 
premarket notification the fda might find that the submission does not provide the evidence required prove that the additional instruments 
accessories for use with the senhance system are substantially equivalent marketed class devices that were occur the company would required 
undertake the more complex and costly pma process perhaps considered for novo reclassification for either the novo the pma 
process the fda could require the company conduct clinical trials which would take more time cost more money and pose other risks and uncertainties 
clinical studies conducted the used any application unapproved medical device require approval from the fda prior initiation 
even when clinical study has been approved the fda deemed approved the study subject factors beyond manufacturer control including 
but not limited the fact that the institutional review board irb specified clinical site might not approve the study might decline renew 
approval might suspend terminate the study before its completion there assurance that clinical study any given site will progress 
anticipated addition there can assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence assure the fda that the product safe and 
effective prerequisite for fda approval pma substantially equivalent terms safety and effectiveness predicate device prerequisite for 
clearance under section even the fda approves clears device may limit its intended uses such way that manufacturing and distribution 
the device may not commercially feasible 
after clearance approval market given the fda and foreign regulatory agencies upon the occurrence certain serious adverse events are authorized 
under various circumstances withdraw the clearance approval the device require changes device its manufacturing process its labeling 
require additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met 
manufacturer device approved through the pma process not permitted make changes the device which affect its safety effectiveness without 
first submitting supplement application its pma and obtaining fda approval for that supplement prior marketing the modified device some 
instances the fda may require clinical trials support supplement application manufacturer device cleared through the process must submit 
additional premarket notification intends make change modification the device that could significantly affect the safety effectiveness 
the device such significant change modification design material chemical composition energy source labeling manufacturing process any 
change the intended uses pma device device requires approval supplement new cleared premarket notification exported devices are 
subject the regulatory requirements each country which the device exported well certain fda export requirements 
continuing fda regulation 
after device placed the market numerous fda and other regulatory requirements continue apply these include 
establishment registration and device listing with the fda 
quality system regulations which require manufacturers follow stringent design testing process control documentation and other quality 
assurance procedures 
labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion products for unapproved off label uses and impose other restrictions labeling 
medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report the fda their device may have caused contributed

penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment restructuring our operations exclusion from 
participation federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any which could adversely affect our ability operate our business and our 
financial results 
the united states there have been and expect there continue number legislative and regulatory initiatives both the federal and state 
government levels change the healthcare system ways that approved could affect our ability sell our products profitably the current time our 
products are not defined durable medical equipment non dme devices used surgical procedures are normally paid directly the hospital health 
care provider and not reimbursed separately third party payors instead the hospital health care provider reimbursed based the procedure 
performed and the inpatient outpatient stay result these types devices are subject intense price competition that can place small manufacturer 
competitive disadvantage hospitals ambulatory surgery centers and health care providers attempt negotiate lower prices for products such the 
ones develop and sell 
march the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act and the reconciliation law known health care and education 
reconciliation act the reconciliation act and with the affordable care act the health care reform legislation were enacted into law the 
constitutionality the health care reform legislation was confirmed twice the supreme court the united states both congressional leaders 
and president trump have announced plans repeal modify the health care reform legislation this time the company not certain the 
impact federal health care legislation its business 
the health care reform legislation subjects manufacturers medical devices excise tax certain sales medical devices 
beginning january this excise tax was suspended december for two years and again january for additional two years 
eventually implemented this excise tax will likely increase our expenses the future 
further the health care reform legislation includes the open payments act formerly referred the physician payments sunshine act which 
conjunction with its implementing regulations requires certain manufacturers certain drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed medicare 
medicaid and the children health insurance program report annually certain payments transfers value provided physicians and teaching 
hospitals and report annually ownership and investment interests held physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar 
year have provided reports under the open payments act the centers for medicare medicaid services since the failure report appropriate 
data accurately timely and completely could subject significant financial penalties other countries and several states currently have similar laws and 
more may enact similar legislation 
international regulation and potential impact 
through the senhance acquisition the company has expanded into international markets and intends pursue continued expansion some these markets 
maintain unique regulatory requirements outside addition those the fda and the european union the senhance system marked 
which allows offer the product for sale number jurisdictions including select countries europe the middle east and asia due the 
variations regulatory requirements within territories the company may required perform additional safety clinical testing fulfill additional 
agency requirements for specific territories the company may also required apply for registration using third parties within those territories and may 
dependent upon the third parties successful regulatory processes file register and list the product applications and associated labeling which could lead 
significant investments and resource use these additional requirements may result delays international registrations and commercialization our 
products certain countries 
addition are utilizing distributors and sales agents various territories throughout europe the middle east and africa and need ensure that our 
activities and the activities our distributors and sales agents are compliant with local law and laws governing the sales medical devices the laws 
governing the registration approval clearance and sales medical devices such the senhance system multiple jurisdictions are complex and the

are also expanding the potential market for robotic surgical systems with our focus laparoscopic surgery such expansion requires different sales and 
marketing approach than focus open procedures expect our sales cycle range between four six quarters per sale each sale could take longer 
any delay completing sales particular quarter could cause our operating results fall below expectations also expect such lengthy sales cycle 
makes more difficult for accurately forecast revenue future periods and may cause revenues and operating results vary significantly future 
periods 
although have expanded our commercial organization currently have limited marketing sales and distribution capabilities are distributing our 
products through direct sales the and select countries europe and elsewhere through the use independent contractor and distribution agreements 
with companies possessing established sales and marketing operations the medical device industry there can assurance that will successful 
building our sales capabilities the extent that enter into distribution promotion other arrangements our product revenue likely lower 
than directly market sell our products addition any revenue receive will depend whole part upon the efforts such third parties which 
may not successful and are generally not within our control are unable enter into such arrangements acceptable terms all may not 
able successfully commercialize our products are not successful commercializing our existing and future products either our own through 
collaborations with one more third parties our future product revenue will suffer and may incur significant additional losses 
have procedures place require our distributors and sales agents comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the sales medical 
devices the jurisdictions where they operate failure meet such requirements could subject financial penalties the suspension termination 
the ability sell our products such jurisdiction 
the surgical robotics industry increasingly competitive which can negatively impact our commercial opportunities 
the life sciences industry highly competitive and face significant competition from many medical device companies that are researching and 
marketing products designed address minimally invasive and robotic assisted surgery including new entrants the competitive market are currently 
commercializing the senhance system the with fda clearance europe which accepts mark the middle east and selected countries 
asia and face significant competition such markets many our competitors including intuitive surgical have significantly greater financial 
manufacturing marketing and product development resources than some the medical device companies compete with expect compete with 
include johnson johnson medtronic plc applied medical intuitive surgical verb surgical titan medical and number minimally invasive surgical 
device and robotic surgical device manufacturers and providers products and therapies that are designed reduce the need for attractiveness surgical 
intervention addition many other universities and private and public research institutions are may become active research involving surgical 
devices for minimally invasive and robotic assisted surgery 
are also expanding the potential market for robotic surgical systems with our focus laparoscopic surgery such expansion may lead additional 
competition with companies with sufficiently higher resources than ours 
believe that our ability successfully compete will depend among other things 
the efficacy safety and reliability our products 
our ability commercialize and market our cleared approved products 
the completion our development efforts and receipt regulatory clearance approval for instruments and accessories support the use 
the senhance system 
the cost ownership and use our products relation alternative devices

the effectiveness our sales and marketing efforts and 
acceptance future products physicians and other health care providers 
our competitors market products that are more effective safer easier use less expensive than our products future products that reach the market 
sooner than our products may not achieve commercial success addition the medical device industry characterized rapid technological change 
may difficult for stay abreast the rapid changes each technology fail stay the forefront technological change may unable 
compete effectively technological advances products developed our competitors may render our technologies products obsolete less 
competitive 
anticipate that the highly competitive surgical robotics environment can lead our competitors attempt slow derail our commercial progress 
are using our best efforts enter the commercial markets effectively and efficiently while maintaining compliance with all regulatory and legal 
requirements responding the actions our competitors will require the attention our management and may distract the management team from its

our products 
the senhance system manufactured for under contract third party manufacturer our manufacturer acquire raw materials and components 
the senhance system from vendors some which are sole suppliers although believe that have the manufacturing and inventory reserves meet our 
anticipated senhance system sales for the foreseeable future are currently taking steps develop redundant manufacturing and supply alternatives 
cannot assure you that will successful developing these redundant supply and manufacturing capabilities are not successful our business 
operations could suffer 
because our design development and manufacturing capabilities are limited may rely third parties design develop manufacture supply some 
our products inability find additional alternate sources for these services and products could materially and adversely affect our financial 
condition and results operations 
have used third party design and development sources assist the design and development our medical device products the future may 
choose use additional third party sources for the design and development our products these design and development partners are unable provide 
their services the timeframe the performance level that require may not able establish contract and obtain sufficient alternative supply 
from another supplier timely basis and the manner that require 
our products require precise high quality manufacturing and our contract manufacturers will subject ongoing periodic unannounced inspection 
the fda and non regulatory authorities ensure strict compliance with the quality systems regulations current good manufacturing practices and 
other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards our contract manufacturers fail achieve and maintain high manufacturing 
standards compliance with qsr may experience manufacturing errors resulting patient injury death product recalls withdrawals delays

any performance failure the part our design and development partners contract manufacturers could delay product development 
regulatory clearance approval our products commercialization our products and future products depriving potential product revenue and 
resulting additional losses addition our dependence any third party for design development manufacturing could adversely affect our future

our commercial success depends significantly our ability operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights third parties 
other entities may have obtain patents proprietary rights that could limit our ability manufacture use sell offer for sale import products impair 
our competitive position addition the extent that third party develops new technology that covers our products may required obtain 
licenses that technology which licenses may not available may not available commercially reasonable terms all licenses are not 
available acceptable terms will not able market the affected products conduct the desired activities unless challenge the validity 
enforceability infringement the third party patent circumvent the third party patent which would costly and would require significant time and 
attention our management third parties may have obtain valid and enforceable patents proprietary rights that could block from developing 
products using our technology our failure obtain license any technology that require may materially harm our business financial condition and 
results operations 
become involved patent litigation other proceedings related determination rights could incur substantial costs and expenses substantial 
liability for damages required stop our product development and commercialization efforts any which could materially adversely affect our 
liquidity business prospects and results operations 
third parties may sue for infringing their patent rights likewise may need resort litigation enforce patent issued licensed 
determine the scope and validity proprietary rights others addition third party may claim that have improperly obtained used its confidential 
proprietary information furthermore connection with our third party license agreements generally have agreed indemnify the licensor for costs 
incurred connection with litigation relating intellectual property rights the cost any litigation other proceeding relating intellectual 
property rights even resolved our favor could substantial and the litigation would divert our management efforts some our competitors may 
able sustain the costs complex patent litigation more effectively than can because they have substantially greater resources uncertainties resulting 
from the initiation and continuation any litigation could limit our ability continue our operations 
any parties successfully claim that our creation use proprietary technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights might forced 
pay damages potentially including treble damages are found have willfully infringed such parties patent rights addition any damages 
might have pay court could require stop the infringing activity obtain license any license required under any patent may not made 
available commercially acceptable terms all addition such licenses are likely non exclusive and therefore our competitors may have access 
the same technology licensed fail obtain required license and are unable design around patent may unable effectively market 
some our technology and products which could limit our ability generate revenues achieve profitability and possibly prevent from generating 
revenue sufficient sustain our operations 
for our senhance system rely our license from the european union and any loss our rights under such license agreement failure properly 
prosecute maintain enforce the patent applications underlying such license agreement could materially adversely affect our business prospects for the 
senhance system 
some the patents and patent applications our patent portfolio related the senhance system are licensed transenterix italia under license 
agreement with the european union presently rely such licensed technology for our senhance system products and may license additional 
technology from the european union other third parties the future the license agreement gives rights for the commercial exploitation the 
licensed patents patent applications and know how subject certain provisions the license agreement failure comply with these provisions could 
result the loss our rights under the license agreement our inability rely these patents and patent applications which are the basis certain 
aspects our senhance system technology would have adverse effect our business 
further our success will depend part the ability the european union and other third party licensors obtain maintain and enforce patent 
protection for our licensed intellectual property and particular those patents which have secured exclusive rights the european union other 
third party licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which are licensed may fail maintain these patents and may determine 
not pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents may pursue such litigation less aggressively than necessary obtain 
acceptable outcome from any such litigation without protection for the intellectual property have licensed other companies might able offer 
substantially identical products for sale which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position business prospects and results 
operations 
our licensors are unable protect the confidentiality our proprietary information and know how the value our technology and products 
could adversely affected 
addition patent protection also rely other proprietary rights including protection trade secrets know how and confidential and proprietary 
information maintain the confidentiality trade secrets and proprietary information will seek 
enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborators upon the commencement their relationships with these 
agreements generally require that all confidential information developed the individual made known the individual during the course the 
individual relationship with kept confidential and not disclosed third parties our agreements with employees also generally provide and will 
generally provide that any inventions conceived the individual the course rendering services shall our exclusive property however may 
not obtain these agreements all circumstances and individuals with whom have these agreements may not comply with their terms the event 
unauthorized use disclosure our trade secrets proprietary information these agreements even obtained may not provide meaningful protection 
particularly for our trade secrets other confidential information the extent that our employees consultants contractors use technology know how 
owned third parties their work for disputes may arise between and those third parties the rights related inventions adequate remedies may 
not exist the event unauthorized use disclosure our confidential information the disclosure our trade secrets would impair our competitive 
position and may materially harm our business financial condition and results operations 
are unable obtain and enforce patent protection for our products our business could materially harmed 
our success depends part our ability protect proprietary methods and technologies that develop license under the patent and other intellectual 
property laws the united states and other countries that can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information 
however may not hold proprietary rights some patents required for commercialize our proposed products because certain patent 
applications are confidential until patents issue such applications filed prior november applications filed after such date which will not 
filed foreign countries third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered our pending patent applications without our being 
aware those applications and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications for this and other reasons our third party 
collaborators may unable secure desired patent rights thereby losing desired exclusivity licenses are not available acceptable terms will 
not able market the affected products conduct the desired activities unless challenge the validity enforceability infringement the third party 
patent otherwise circumvent the third party patent 
our strategy depends our ability promptly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries addition may rely third party collaborators 
file patent applications relating proprietary technology that develop jointly during certain collaborations the process obtaining patent 
protection expensive and time consuming our present future collaborators fail file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications 
reasonable cost and timely manner our business will adversely affected despite our efforts and the efforts our collaborators protect our 
proprietary rights unauthorized parties may able develop and use information that regard proprietary 
the issuance patent provides presumption but does not guarantee that valid any patents have obtained obtain the future may 
challenged potentially circumvented moreover the united states patent and trademark office the uspto may commence interference proceedings 
involving our patents patent applications any such challenge our patents patent applications would costly would require significant time and 
attention our management and could have material adverse effect our business addition future court decisions may introduce uncertainty the 
enforceability scope any patent including those owned medical device companies 
our pending patent applications may not result issued patents the patent position medical device companies including ours generally uncertain 
and involves complex legal and factual considerations the standards that the uspto and its foreign counterparts use grant patents are not always applied 
predictably uniformly and can change there also uniform worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope claims granted allowable 
medical device patents accordingly not know the degree future protection for our proprietary rights the breadth claims that will allowed 
any patents issued others the legal systems certain countries not favor the aggressive enforcement patents and the laws foreign 
countries may not protect our rights the same extent the laws the united states therefore the enforceability scope our owned licensed patents 
the united states foreign countries cannot predicted with certainty and result any patents that own license may not provide sufficient 
protection against competitors may not able obtain maintain patent protection for our pending patent applications those may file the 
future those may license from third parties 
cannot assure you that any patents that will issue that may issue that may licensed will enforceable valid will not expire prior the 
commercialization our products thus allowing others more effectively compete with therefore any patents that own license may not 
adequately protect our future products 
even obtain regulatory clearances approvals for our products the terms thereof and ongoing regulation our products may limit how 
manufacture and market our products which could materially impair our ability generate anticipated revenues 
once regulatory clearance approval has been granted the cleared approved product and its manufacturer are subject continual review any cleared 
approved product may promoted only for its indicated uses addition the fda other non regulatory authorities clear approve any our 
products the labeling packaging adverse event reporting storage advertising and promotion for the product will subject extensive regulatory 
requirements and any outsourced manufacturers our products are also required comply with the fda quality system regulation similar 
requirements non regulatory authorities which includes requirements relating quality control and quality assurance well the corresponding 
maintenance records and documentation well other quality system requirements and regulations from non regulatory authorities further 
regulatory agencies must approve our manufacturing facilities for class iii devices before they can used manufacture our products and all 
manufacturing facilities are subject ongoing regulatory inspection fail comply with the regulatory requirements the fda either before after 
clearance approval other non regulatory authorities previously unknown problems with our products manufacturers manufacturing 
processes are discovered could subject administrative judicially imposed sanctions including

any these sanctions could have material adverse effect our reputation business results operations and financial condition furthermore our key 
component suppliers may not currently may not continue compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result our 
failure produce our products timely basis and the required quantities all 
addition the fda and other non regulatory authorities may change their policies and additional regulations may enacted that could prevent 
delay regulatory clearance approval our products cannot predict the likelihood nature extent government regulation that may arise from 
future legislation administrative action either the united states abroad are not able maintain regulatory compliance would likely not 
permitted market our future products and may not achieve sustain profitability 
the regulatory approval and clearance processes are expensive time consuming and uncertain and may prevent from obtaining approvals 
clearances the case may for the commercialization some all our products 
regulatory approval pma pma supplement clearance pursuant premarket notification not guaranteed and the approval clearance 
process the case may expensive uncertain and may especially the case the pma application take several years the fda also has substantial 
discretion the medical device clearance process approval process despite the time and expense exerted failure can occur any stage and could 
encounter problems that cause repeat perform additional development standardized testing pre clinical studies and clinical trials the number 
pre clinical studies and clinical trials that will required for fda clearance approval varies depending the medical device candidate the disease 
condition that the medical device candidate designed address and the regulations applicable any particular medical device candidate the fda 
other non regulatory authorities can delay limit deny clearance approval medical device candidate for many reasons including 
medical device candidate may not deemed safe effective the case pma application 
medical device candidate may not deemed substantially equivalent device lawfully marketed either grandfathered device 
one that was cleared through the premarket notification process 
medical device candidate may not deemed conformance with applicable standards and regulations 
fda other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient 
the fda might not approve our processes facilities those any our third party manufacturers for class iii pma device 
other non regulatory authorities may not approve our processes facilities those any our third party manufacturers thereby 
restricting export 
the fda other non regulatory authorities may change clearance approval policies adopt new regulations 
the laws governing the regulatory approval clearance pathways jurisdictions outside the united states are complex need ensure that our 
activities and the activities our distributors and agents comply with such laws not comply with such laws may not able sell our 
products including the senhance system all jurisdictions have targeted which could have adverse effect our business operations and financial 
condition 
once our products are cleared approved modifications our products may require new clearances premarket approvals new amended 
certificates conformity and may require cease marketing recall the modified products until clearances approvals the relevant 
certificates conformity are obtained 
any modification cleared device that could significantly affect its safety effectiveness that would constitute major change its intended 
use design manufacture requires new clearance possibly pma the fda requires every manufacturer make this determination the first 
instance but the fda may review such determinations the fda may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances approvals are 
necessary the fda disagrees with our determinations for any future changes prior changes previously marketed products the case may may 
required cease marketing recall the modified products until obtain clearance approval and may subject significant regulatory fines 
penalties 
furthermore the fda ongoing review the program may make more difficult for make modifications our products either imposing 
more strict requirements when new for modification previously cleared product must submitted applying more onerous review criteria 
such submissions october the fda issued guidance documents addressing when submit new due modifications cleared 
products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence the interpretation the guidance document the fda staff could lead instances where 
the fda disagrees with the company decision regarding change and could result warning letters and other enforcement actions 
even after clearance approval for our products obtained are subject extensive post market regulation the fda our failure meet strict 
regulatory requirements could require pay fines incur other costs even close our facilities 
even after have obtained the proper regulatory clearance approval market product the fda has the power require conduct post market 
studies these studies can very expensive and time consuming conduct failure complete such studies timely manner could result the 
revocation clearance approval and the recall withdrawal the product which could prevent from generating sales from that product the united 
states the fda has broad enforcement powers and any regulatory enforcement actions inquiries other increased scrutiny could dissuade some 
surgeons from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy our products 
are also required comply with the fda qsr which covers the methods used and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture 
quality assurance labeling packaging sterilization storage shipping installation and servicing our marketed products the fda enforces the qsr 
through periodic announced and unannounced inspections manufacturing facilities addition the future regulatory authorities and customers may

they will not occur the future any corrective action whether voluntary involuntary will require the dedication our time and capital distract 
management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results 
recall our products either voluntarily the direction the fda another governmental authority the discovery serious safety issues with

generate profits 
legislative fda regulatory reforms may make more difficult and costly for obtain regulatory approval our product candidates and 
manufacture market and distribute our products after approval obtained 
legislative changes could significantly alter the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval manufacture and marketing regulated products 
addition fda regulations and guidance could revised reinterpreted the fda ways that could significantly affect our business and our products 
any new regulations revisions reinterpretations existing regulations may impose additional costs lengthen review times future products 
impossible predict whether legislative changes will enacted fda regulations guidance interpretations changed and what the impact such

proposed policy changes require congressional approval implement cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private 
third party payor programs health care providers will remain levels comparable present levels will sufficient cover the costs allocable 
patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs any changes that lower reimbursement rates under medicare medicaid private payor programs 
could negatively affect our business 
the extent that any our products are deemed durable medical equipment dme they may subject distribution under medicare 
competitive acquisition regulations which could adversely affect the amount that can seek from payors non dme devices used surgical procedures 
are normally paid directly the hospital health care provider and not reimbursed separately third party payors result these types devices are 
subject intense price competition that can place small manufacturer competitive disadvantage hospitals and health care providers attempt 
negotiate lower prices for products such the ones develop and sell 
with the continued uncertainty regarding the status the health care reform legislation this time the company not certain the impact 
federal health care legislation its business 
the health care reform legislation subjects manufacturers medical devices excise tax certain sales medical devices 
beginning january this excise tax was suspended december for two additional years however eventually implemented this excise tax 
will likely increase our expenses the future 
further the health care reform legislation includes the open payments act formerly referred the physician payments sunshine act which 
conjunction with its implementing regulations requires certain manufacturers certain drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed medicare 
medicaid and the children health insurance program report annually certain payments transfers value provided physicians and teaching 
hospitals and report annually ownership and investment interests held physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar 
year provided reports under the open payments act the centers for medicare medicaid services cms the failure report appropriate data

may enact similar legislation 
are unable predict what additional legislation regulation relating the health care industry third party coverage and reimbursement may 
enacted the future what effect such legislation regulation would have our business any cost containment measures other health care system 
reforms that are adopted could have material and adverse effect our ability commercialize our existing and future products successfully

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations set forth above under the headings results operations and liquidity 
and capital resources have been prepared accordance with gaap and should read conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
appearing item this annual report the preparation these financial statements requires make estimates and judgments that affect the reported 
amounts assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure contingent assets and liabilities going basis evaluate our critical 
accounting policies and estimates including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill process research and development contingent consideration 
warrant liabilities stock based compensation inventory and revenue recognition base our estimates historical experience and various other 
assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources more detailed discussion the application these and other accounting policies 
can found note the notes the financial statements set forth our financial statements for the years ended december and 
which are included item this annual report actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
while all accounting policies impact the financial statements certain policies may viewed critical critical accounting policies are those that are both 
most important the portrayal financial condition and results operations and that require management most subjective complex judgments and 
estimates our management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies accounting for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
process research and development contingent consideration warrants liabilities stock based compensation inventory and revenue recognition 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets consist purchased patent rights recorded cost and developed technology acquired part business acquisition recorded 
estimated fair value intangible assets are amortized over years periodically evaluate identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever 
events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not recoverable 
indefinite lived intangible assets such goodwill are not amortized test the carrying amounts goodwill for recoverability annual basis when 
events changes circumstances indicate evidence potential impairment exists performing either qualitative evaluation two step quantitative 
test the qualitative evaluation assessment factors including industry market and general economic conditions market value and future projections 
determine whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than it carrying amount including goodwill prior the 
adoption accounting standards update asu simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu the beginning fiscal 
year certain instances elected bypass this qualitative assessment and perform two step quantitative test the quantitative goodwill 
impairment test was performed using two step approach the first step the fair value the reporting unit was determined and compared the reporting 
unit carrying value including goodwill the fair value the reporting unit was less than its carrying value the second step the goodwill impairment 
test was performed measure the amount impairment any the second step the fair value the reporting unit was allocated the assets and 
liabilities the reporting unit had been acquired business combination and the purchase price was equivalent the fair value the reporting 
unit the excess the fair value the reporting unit over the amounts assigned its assets and liabilities was referred the implied fair value 
goodwill the implied fair value the reporting unit goodwill was then compared the actual carrying value goodwill the implied fair value 
goodwill was less than the carrying value goodwill impairment loss was recognized for the difference asu removes step the goodwill 
impairment test 
during the second quarter the fda notified the company that the surgibot system did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalency negatively 
impacting the company market capitalization and warranting interim two step quantitative impairment test determined the fair value our 
reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis derived from our long term plans the fair value the reporting unit was corroborated using market 
prices for transenterix inc the inputs used determine the fair values were classified level the fair value hierarchy based the impairment test 
recorded goodwill impairment million during the second quarter performed qualitative assessment during the annual impairment 
review for fiscal december and concluded that not more likely than not that the fair value our single reporting unit was less than 
its carrying amount therefore the two step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary december 
during the second quarter our stock price experienced significant decline and june performed step goodwill impairment test 
the second quarter our analysis included utilizing our market capitalization with control premium determine the appropriate control premium 
considered recent merger and acquisition transaction activity comparable public healthcare equipment companies based this analysis determined 
control premium range approximately and selected the mid range approximately after applying control premium our 
market value exceeded our carrying value based this analysis determined that charge goodwill for impairment was required during the 
second quarter december elected bypass the qualitative assessment and calculated the fair value our reporting unit which 
exceeded the carrying amount accordingly charge for goodwill impairment was required december 
significant amount judgment involved determining indicator goodwill impairment has occurred such indicators may include among 
others significant decline expected future cash flows sustained significant decline the company stock price and market capitalization 
significant adverse change legal factors the business climate adverse assessment action regulator and unanticipated competition key 
assumptions used the annual goodwill impairment test are highly judgmental and include selection comparable companies and amount control 
premium any change these indicators key assumptions could have significant negative impact the company financial condition impact the 
goodwill impairment analysis cause the company perform goodwill impairment analysis more frequently than once per year 
process research and development 
process research and development ipr assets are considered indefinite lived until the completion abandonment the associated research 
and development projects ipr assets represent the fair value assigned technologies that acquire which the time acquisition have not reached 
technological feasibility and have alternative future use during the period that the assets are considered indefinite lived they are tested for impairment 
annual basis more frequently become aware any events occurring changes circumstances that indicate that the fair value the ipr 
assets are less than their carrying amounts and when development complete which generally occurs when have regulatory approval and are able 
commercialize products associated with the ipr assets these assets are then deemed definite lived and are amortized based their estimated useful lives 
that point time development terminated abandoned may have full partial impairment charge related the ipr assets calculated 
the excess carrying value the ipr assets over fair value 
contingent consideration 
contingent consideration recorded liability and measured fair value using discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs 
including the probability achieving each the potential milestones and estimated discount rate associated with the risks the expected cash flows 
attributable the various milestones significant increases decreases any the probabilities success changes expected timelines for 
achievement any these milestones would result significantly higher lower fair value these milestones respectively and commensurate changes 
the associated liability the fair value the contingent consideration each reporting date will updated reflecting the changes fair value our 
statements operations and comprehensive loss 
warrant liabilities 
for the series warrants and series warrants the warrants are recorded liabilities and are revalued each reporting period the change fair value 
recognized the consolidated statements operations and comprehensive loss the selection the appropriate valuation model and the inputs and 
assumptions that are required determine the valuation requires significant judgment and requires management make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amount the related liability and reported amounts the change fair value actual results could differ from those estimates and 
changes these estimates are recorded when known the warrant liability required measured fair value each reporting date reasonably 
possible that these estimates and assumptions could change the near term 
stock based compensation 
recognize expense the grant date fair value stock options and other stock based compensation issued employees and non employee directors 
over the requisite service periods which are typically the vesting periods use the black scholes merton model estimate the fair value our stockbased payments the volatility assumption used the black scholes merton model based the calculated historical volatility based analysis 
reported data for peer group companies well the company historical volatility the expected term options granted has been determined 
based upon the simplified method because not have sufficient historical information regarding our options derive the expected term under this 
approach the expected term the mid point between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term the risk free interest rate based 
treasury rates whose term consistent with the expected life the stock options have not paid and not anticipate paying cash dividends our 
shares common stock therefore the expected dividend yield assumed zero estimate forfeitures based our historical experience and adjust 
the estimated forfeiture rate based upon actual experience adopted asu compensation stock compensation topic improvements 
employee share based payment accounting the beginning fiscal year and did not elect account for forfeitures when they occur but will 
continue estimate the number awards that are expected vest the adoption this asu did not have material impact the consolidated financial 
statements 
inventory 
inventory which includes material labor and overhead costs stated the lower cost determined first first out basis net realizable value 
record reserves when necessary reduce the carrying value inventory its net realizable value the point loss recognition new lower cost basis 
for that inventory established and any subsequent improvements facts and circumstances not result the restoration increase that newly 
established cost basis 
revenue recognition 
our revenue consists product revenue resulting from the sales systems instruments and accessories and service revenue recognize revenue when 
persuasive evidence arrangement exists delivery has occurred service has been rendered the price fixed determinable and collectability 
reasonably assured revenue presented net taxes collected from customers that are remitted government authorities generally recognize revenue

instruments and accessories revenue from sales instruments and accessories generally recognized the time shipment revenue from 
services related the supply and management instruments and accessories recognized the services are rendered 
service service revenue recognized ratably over the term the service period revenue related services performed time andmaterials basis recognized when earned and billable

elements other than service within days entering into the system sale arrangement each these elements separate unit accounting system 
instruments accessories and service are also sold stand alone basis 
for multiple element arrangements revenue allocated each unit accounting based their relative selling prices relative selling prices are based first 
vendor specific objective evidence fair value vsoe then third party evidence selling price tpe when vsoe does not exist and then 
management best estimate the selling price besp when vsoe and tpe not exist 
our system sale arrangements generally include one year period free service and the right for the customer purchase service annually thereafter the 
revenue allocated the free service period deferred and recognized ratably over the free service period deferred revenue was primarily comprised 
deferred revenue related service contracts for the periods presented 
because have neither vsoe nor tpe for our systems the allocation revenue based besp for the systems sold the objective besp

abandonment the associated research and development projects during the period that the ipr assets are considered indefinite lived they are tested for 
impairment annual basis more frequently the company becomes aware any events occurring changes circumstances that indicate that the 
fair value the ipr assets are less than their carrying amounts and when development complete which generally occurs upon regulatory approval 
and the company able commercialize products associated with the ipr assets these assets are then deemed definite lived and are amortized based 
their estimated useful lives that point time development terminated abandoned the company may have full partial impairment charge

impairment existed december and 
october upon regulatory approval and the ability commercialize the products associated with the ipr assets the assets were deemed 
definite lived reclassified intellectual property and are now amortized based their estimated useful lives 
property and equipment

using three tiered approach which requires that fair value measurements classified and disclosed one three tiers these tiers are level defined 
quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities level defined valuations based observable inputs other than those included level 
such quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities active markets other inputs that are observable can corroborated observable input data 
and level defined valuations based unobservable inputs reflecting the company own assumptions consistent with reasonably available 
assumptions made other market participants the company did not have any transfers assets and liabilities between level level and level the 
fair value hierarchy during the years ended december and 
for assets and liabilities recorded fair value the company policy maximize the use observable inputs and minimize the use unobservable 
inputs when developing fair value measurements accordance with the fair value hierarchy fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there 
exists limited observable market data and therefore are based primarily upon estimates are often calculated based the economic and competitive 
environment the characteristics the asset liability and other factors therefore the results cannot determined with precision and may not realized 
actual sale immediate settlement the asset liability additionally there may inherent weaknesses any calculation technique and changes 
the underlying assumptions used including discount rates and estimates future cash flows could significantly affect the results current future 
values the company utilizes fair value measurements record fair value adjustments certain assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures 
prescribed gaap the company groups assets and liabilities fair value three levels based the markets which the assets and liabilities are 
traded and the reliability the assumptions used determine fair value adjustment the pricing method used within either level level inputs 
could generate fair value measurement that effectively falls lower level the hierarchy 
the determination where asset liability falls the hierarchy requires significant judgment the company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures and 
based various factors possible that asset liability may classified differently from period period however the company expects changes 
classifications between levels will rare
