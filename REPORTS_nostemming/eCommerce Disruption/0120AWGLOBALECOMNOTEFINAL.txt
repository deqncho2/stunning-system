our view the lags other markets for grocery primarily 
for two reasons grocery may take off faster markets 
that have dense urban populations such the and 
japan both identified last months above for both 
fresh and packaged groceries because more people rely 
public transit making transportation groceries more 
difficult the where consumers have access cars 
and developed brick and mortar infrastructure and 
grocery may take off faster emerging markets where there 
lack established brick and mortar infrastructure 
believe that higher online ordering for packaged 
groceries could act catalyst accelerate fresh 
groceries and therefore overall grocery customer 
perceptions may more transferable than other unrelated 
categories what more our survey suggests similar levels 
intent buy packaged and fresh groceries the next 
months even though currently packaged groceries are 
higher penetrated than fresh groceries 
the same time see grocery potentially growing 
faster than other categories particularly the where 
the delta between current and planned increase fresh 
online purchasing was higher than any other country 
surveyed our view accelerating ecommerce growth 
combined with new expanding grocery offerings such 
amazon fresh instacart could help grocery catch

higher ratio than other countries consumers who have tried 
purchasing foodstuffs through the internet think this 
because consumers japan can use logistics which has 
developed sophisticated level providing for next day

who used line shopping again within one month their 
previous line shopping was thus est that the 
line shopping usage rate consumers with experience 
purchasing through the internet high compared with other 
countries 
japan line shopping users have pleasant shopping 
experiences result much wider product choices with 
logistics compared with shopping traditional real stores 
thus their repeat rate tends relatively high and 
expansion the user base tends easily lead continued 
expansion the gmv gross merchandising volume owing 
the trend for decline real wage income consumers 
degree price sensitivity towards goods and services
