telecom services striving capitalize network 
maturity operators are seeking drive growth from the 
billions connected devices prospect their wired and 
wireless networks penetration smartphones tablets and 
home broadband reaches maturity while connected cars are 
currently one the most promising segments for telecom 
carriers and the number potential devices large many 
these devices will not even connect existing carrier 
networks and even they may use very little capacity 
hard see clearly who benefits this stage the dollars 
and cents are still fairly small nonetheless the tower 
companies american tower crown castle and sba 
communications are perhaps the most obvious potential 
beneficiaries the iot new devices and applications 
should only accelerate the need for broader and deeper 
wireless coverage around the world 
big data analytics lots data but predictability the 
ultimate goal the internet things see significant 
opportunities for software companies around iot the most 
obvious area data management iot creates new 
varieties data well greater data volume however 
believe the opportunities much further than data

the internet things now 
our attempt quantify the potential lmpacts internet things economy 
tech telecom perspective the previous wave computing 
smartphone mobile internet was driven vertical integration apple and 
move from hardware software applications google android the 
consumer space contrast the internet things our view the 
pervasive penetration and integration semiconductors 
networking connectivity and big data analytics into the real economy 
find that the key drivers for the internet things are 
standardization and follow cost reductions increasing 
standardization software and hardware combination with the 
progress moore law printing smaller transistors and further 
integration more chips combined into one can drive device prices 
down and penetration 
the exploitation big data the increasingly pervasive 
penetration sensors throughout the industrial economy will 
generate lots data which will have digested and analyzed 
order become useful for non technology companies 
eventually mathematics and algorithms should identify trends 
which create value terms cost savings efficiencies and 
increased revenues the real economy 
after surveying all sectors covered morgan stanley globally 
found that the internet things potentially disrupts the following 
industries 
factory automation could drive enhanced efficiency with process 
monitoring and supervision remote management and optimization 
optimal energy management assuming the global cost base 
manufacturing today cost savings from iot 
result penetration iot could see cost 
savings mining for instance early adopter the internet 
things with rio tinto currently generating over cost 
savings from the autonomous mining concept 
precision agriculture real time analysis weather data 
could provide increased revenues for companies such 
agrium dupont and monsanto also expect farmers 
increase productivity and revenues even larger amount 
utilities smart water could generate revenues 
europe potentially reducing leakage which 
today the smart grid could drive material changes the 
electric power business model through the development 
distributed power requirements for more energy storage and 
changes consumer behavior 
healthcare real time monitoring reduces the need for 
specialized human capital and could result cost 
savings which would represent ebitda 
savings for the four for profit hospital companies covered 
morgan stanley research lpnt htc hca and cyh 
retail the use radio frequency identification rfid chips 
and precision analytics that improve inventory management 
could lower the cost goods sold for non food retail 
the that would represent potential savings 
insurance the internet things could drive major changes 
business models and profit pools result the growing 
adoption telematics automotive insurance the life 
insurance side biometrics could become intrinsic riskassessment insurers 
environmental social and governance consideration many 
cases the financial benefits are clear and the internet things should 
provide means improve efficiencies and minimize waste such 
through the use smart grid smart meters increased agricultural yields 
reduced health and safety risks some industries such mining and 
reduced healthcare costs however the internet things also could 
reduce the need for some blue collar jobs 
medical devices patient monitoring and predictive

enterprise software billion market based 
tools built for the industrial era this number will dwarfed 
the information era aaron levy founder box 
the internet things presents significant opportunities for 
software companies the most obvious area data management 
iot creates new varieties data well greater data volume 
there are many new technologies addressing this however 
believe the opportunities much further than mere data management 
beyond simply collecting more data companies must analyse 
interpret and apply which believe will drive spend real time 
and predictive analytics conclusion any optimisation suggested 
the analysis would have presented end users for them take 
action automatically initiate new process conclusion 
result also see the potential for surge the growth 
new software applications that will require new development 
platforms conclusion some these will support new business 
models believe moving from pure manufacturing offering 
services will common one 
finally iot applications need integrated into existing 
business processes and landscapes this could drive new 
wave spending integration middleware refresh 
existing core applications make them iot friendly conclusion 
information technology spending the past years has 
focused primarily the digitization and automation 
existing business processes consumer activities and work 
flows whether that adding digital controllers industrial 
machines moving from sending customer contracts via mail 
emailing with digital signature service the shift 
window shopping from physically walking through mall 
browsing amazon our view the next years will 
focus optimizing those activities workflows and business 
processes this optimization will driven confluence 
increasing digitization the declining costs and size 
sensors controllers and transmitters will allow their 
integration into the physical world all around 
the combination these four elements constitutes the 
internet things which essentially layer optimization 
that reaches beyond enterprise data center and extends 
control across broad swaths the physical world around 
big data and beyond one the most immediate impacts 
the iot dramatic increase the volume data that 
companies look collect store and manage however 
equally important consider the greater velocity real time 
batch and variety data unstructured structured 
that iot likely generate the most obvious technology 
spending impact may the database data storage market 
where large number new technologies have emerged 
over the last few years help companies deal with the 
increasing volume velocity and variety data the big data 
challenge 
however foresee other large technology spending 
impacts other areas software the collection and 
storage data have little value their own the 
analysis turning data into information and subsequent 
application that information that will drive incremental value 
for companies the technologies enabling the analysis 
presentation and integration into existing architectures 
should also see increasing demand around the iot 
morgan stanley research 
april 
the internet things now 
today many enterprise architectures are not optimized 
either ingest this volume type data make effective use 
the resulting information such expect see 
enterprises investing the following software categories 
garner benefit from iot 
new data store technologies new databases and data 
stores optimized for particular data sets created iot 
while the more established database vendors will likely 
play role the new technologies see lot room 
for newer entrants benefit from the change 
technology and expect the market share 
divided across more companies 
integration middleware integration middleware 
technologies integrate the new iot data and 
applications into existing business processes and 
workflows 
these analytics will standalone others will built into 
the database layer and still others will built into the 
application layer 
new iot applications and application development 
platforms expect brand new applications built 
deal with the information flow today this happening 
custom basis with many things integration 
protocols being replicated each time application 
developed have seen the past software 
expect the industry move development platforms 
either built for least optimized for iot these 
platforms will automate much the development legwork 
enabling developers focus business value rather 
than the infrastructure required integrate the iot 
real time and predictive analytics companies will use 
analytical software gather intelligence from the vast 
trove data collected from the physical world some 
enterprise application refresh existing enterprise 
application platforms are likely refreshed take 
advantage iot have seen this happen industries 
where large investments have already been made iot 
type technologies for example utilities with elements 
like smart metering and smart grid

the internet things and software 
see five main layers the internet things 
hardware 
devices that collect data 
devices that transmit data 
software 
data storage 
analytics 
and the end user level 
integrated applications 
the iot stack 
build the iot stack from its base layer which pure 
hardware sensors embedded devices cameras meters 
and above this base layer network layer needed 
for the sensors communicate and for the data that they 
collect transferred and then stored and analysed then 
move into the software layers 
application analytics important big data 
common view might that the most important software 
implication from the iot the database data store layer 
true that the iot creates very significant data volumes that 
will only increase dramatically over time these data 
volumes create series challenges enterprises 
not believe traditional data storage architectures are wellsuited accommodate the volume velocity and variety 
this iot data 
there have been significant changes the technologies 
can bring bear help enterprises deal with these data 
problems over the last years and these improvements 
are likely major driver adoption iot technologies 
however the collected stored data only gains value once 
analysed and acted upon the enterprise data its own 
little value result believe that the 
application analytical layer the stack equal not 
more importance the software sector impact from 
the iot enterprises will need think through how they 
adapt their existing analytical and application infrastructure 
which was not all designed for the inflows data the iot 
implies deal with the information flow and make best use 
this point have very significant amounts data being 
collected sensors data which can transferred and 
which needs stored will look this more detail 
later but given that this data already being collected 
outside existing enterprise systems these data stores 
could also located outside traditional enterprise 
systems most likely cloud storage amazon web 
services microsoft azure google etc rather than just 
existing enterprise storage 
expect companies make use new analytical 
technologies help them handle the new volumes data 
but new platforms will also necessary monitor data 
streams order help companies automate decisions 
closer real time these technologies will also help 
companies combine the two monitoring flow live data 
and comparing large historical data set order 
support decisions 
finally need analytics and applications take that data 
and link into existing workflows and business processes 
without that link the data will not make difference how 
enterprises operate 
this software section will consider the software layers 
the stack the data stores and complex event processing 
cep systems the analytical systems required and the 
applications needed make best use the data that has 
been collected 
have made clear splits between the technologies our 
view the stack however acknowledge there will 
some overlap between the layers identify some the 
data stores will have analytics built will some the 
application layers

conclusion spending real time and 
predictive data analysis will increase 
iot implies dramatic increase the volume and variety data 
companies have manage order benefit fortunately have 
seen wave innovation this area over the last years and 
move from one size fits all model the relational database model 
where different data stores can used depending the use case 
expect see strong spending these new technologies 
companies have been struggling with increasing data 
volumes for several years top this they are also 
struggling with wider variety data structured semi 
structured and unstructured that needs managed the 
emergence iot exacerbates this problem iot 
introduces yet more data volume and data variety 
companies 
the past companies would try fit these data sets into 
the dominant data management technology which for many 
years was the relational database such provided 
oracle microsoft and ibm the data did not fit the store 
was uneconomical process the company would either 
change the question drop the analysis altogether 
facebook available all the time that your latest 
facebook update different depending where you are 
located that highlights the trade off between managing the 
data volume keeping the site running and perfect database 
integrity 
some these technologies emerged from internet 
companies that were generating unprecedented data 
volumes they wanted analyse had business models 
based the management extremely large data sets 
these companies often shared their research with the open 
source community and today still see lot new data 
management technologies either being generated the 
open source community based technology that was 
created there 
the following exhibit shows the different degrees structure 
within database databases relax the degree 
structure and the reliability with which transactions are 
recorded improves the flexibility increases allowing for 
different use cases 
exhibit 
nosql evolving new databases for specific use 
cases 
over the last years however have seen wide 
range new data management technologies emerge these 
technologies have tended target specific data 
management problems rather than attempt one size fits all 
approach saw the past 
the traditional relational databases were widely adopted 
manage and record company transactions and the 
integrity the database these situations key some 
examples this would ensuring transaction all 
nothing any part the transaction fails all fails socalled atomicity consistency anything happens 
that breaks the database rules the database reverts its 
state before the event 
however was very difficult not impossible combine 
that database integrity with the very large increases 
companies have seen data volumes and variety this was 
especially true for companies managing internet traffic and 
data 
relatively common theme among the newer database 
technologies that some the rules for database integrity 
are relaxed that the data volume variety can 
managed more easily for example more important that

the most notable example this would hadoop open 
source project which emerged from google hadoop able 
process large amounts volume different data sets

workload over multiple commodity servers the use

hardware appliances also makes cost effective solution 
another example more recent technology would 
splunk splunk offers platform that collects and indexes 
machine data but major differentiator the proprietary 
search interface that makes easier for users analyse and 
monitor the machine data intuitive way 
the company started the operations area aiming 
help companies reduce eliminate downtime 
systems rather than printing out log files from various 
systems the machine data splunk allowed the 
department look that data via the search interface 
which enables problems found and resolved far more 
quickly course not big step move from reactive 
analysis data when something has gone wrong setting 
data monitoring order predict when there might 
problem order avoid 
companies were left with trade off between query 
response times and query flexibility the ability ask 
another question the data that you had not specifically 
structured the data for 
the following exhibit shows various methods managing 
the increase volume velocity and variety data 
databases the volume side shows companies must 
improve first their storage capabilities terabytes and then 
how the data transactions are stored tables files records 
etc because dealing with the variety kinds data can 
challenging expect companies will have adopt 
mixture structured and unstructured databases the 
velocity data and technological advancements data 
management memory etc allow companies analyze 
events real time however old technologies such batch 
processing will still relevant for certain situations 
exhibit 
big data technologies managing the 
splunk has found that machine data has been underanalysed area for companies and its customers and partners 
have been quick find many use cases both inside and 
outside operations moving into security and more 
general analytics for example 
the fact that splunk was set manage machine data 
positions very well for the iot our view the iot 
course all about the storage and analysis this type data 
will look application development platforms more 
detail below but would highlight that splunk has also 
moved into this area with splunkbase development 
platform for applications built the splunk data store 
technology 
see one further challenge for companies looking 
manage iot data velocity think about this two 
different ways 
how analyse the data timely fashion this 
has been major bottleneck for traditional relational 
databases which the past often had heavily 
structured order provide even adequate response 
times large data sets unfortunately the more you 
structure database the less flexibility you have and 
source http blogs perficient multi shoring blog big data big deal 
how manage very fast flows data coming 
into the organization such financial trading data 
number database technologies columnar memory 
have emerged try address the first issue with sap 
hana product perhaps the best known sap claims hana 
can improve query response times very dramatic factors 
hana customers talk performance 
improvements and more and does without the need 
structure the data this means that hoc queries can 
asked the fly

exhibit 
memory technology primary advantage 
because speed and ease use 
see the middleware vendors producing solutions this 
space software for instance believes its technology 
platform offers significant advantage for companies looking 
manage data flows high speed 
sap also has technology this area which came with the 
acquired sybase business sybase event stream processor 
has been widely used financial services help 
companies deal with the fast flow financial market data 
however sap has been broadening the use cases for the 
technology and classic iot use case has collaborated 
with ntt data monitor bridges data from tens 
thousands sensors and analyzing this against historic 
libraries data 
source qlik technologies morgan stanley research 
conclusion optimisation could lead 
new processes 
believe the second challenge increasing data 
velocity effective analysis how will companies take 
very fast data flow and then some analysis often 
against static historical database example might 
financial services where company needs authorize 
incoming internet payment transactions but needs 
compare them against historic data sets order identify 
potentially fraudulent transactions consumers making 
internet payments don want wait more than few 
seconds for the payment complete while the payments 
company wants make many fraud checks possible 
that timeframe the faster the checks can made the 
happier both parties will here move into what has 
termed complex event processing 
last but not least highlight the companies that are 
focused building complex analytical algorithms top 
the existing and new data store technologies these include 
companies like palantir and mapr who have been building 
hadoop among other technologies and sas institute 
one the leading providers complex analytical algorithms 
there are also the incumbent business intelligence 
companies business objects cognos hyperion now parts 
sap ibm and oracle respectively that provide analytical 
tools 
summary companies have already faced major data 
management challenges from increasing data volumes 
variety and velocity there has been significant innovation 
over the last years this area expect the data 
collected from iot sensors create further challenges for 
companies this data management area and this likely 
drive increased investment these technologies 
while the incumbent database vendors oracle ibm 
microsoft will likely see some benefit from this they have 
also invested new technology see the companies that 
are primarily exposed the new developments the main 
beneficiaries from this potential spending increase 
morgan stanley research 
april 
the internet things now 
conclusion there will surge 
growth new software applications 
once the data collected need something with 
see companies spending analytics product actionable 
intelligence the past expect new iot data and intelligence 
result explosion new software applications these apps will 
present actionable intelligence end users automatically initiate 
new actions optimise the business expect new iot software 
development platforms enable this finally companies have made 
huge investments their existing expect investments 
integrate the new iot apps into that existing refresh existing 
making iot friendly 
once the data has been collected stored and analyzed the 
enterprise needs system either 
present that information person agent who makes 
use that intelligence change existing systems 
make better optimized business decision 
automate response with automated workflow that 
does not require human intervention 
have seen the past that the availability new data 
sets and new techniques for gathering and making use 
that data leads rapid growth new applications for that 
data the challenge for enterprises today that their 
systems are not set cope with the influx data from 
iot believe two major changes wall take place enable 
enterprises make better use iot data 
new applications will developed leading iot 
application development platforms 
these applications are already being created but 
usually the case technology the development being 
done custom basis this means that lot work 
being repeated each time application written 
integration points the data stores integration the 
existing enterprise application infrastructure and over 
time expect this custom development work migrate 
onto software development platforms have seen this 
happen the past software where software 
development platform already incorporates number key 
elements and this leaves the developer free focus the 
business value the application rather than the 
infrastructure needed enable the application work 
see companies diverse sap oracle 
salesforce splunk and ptc providing development 
platforms for the iot some these have been acquired 
ptc thingworx some them are adaptations existing 
platforms sap has hana platform for the iot these 
platforms will make easier and quicker for these companies 
and their enterprise customers develop iot applications 
however also expect some these companies not 
all open their platforms other developers and 
independent software vendors isvs smaller groups can 
benefit from the platform that has already been created and 
focus specific applications 
conclusion new iot apps will need 
integrated into existing processes 
second believe enterprises will have modify their 
existing infrastructures take advantage the iot 
intelligence and integrate the new iot applications that are 
being created see two different approaches this 
new lease life for middleware 
the one side see the iot giving the leading 
middleware vendors new and significant opportunity the 
leading companies this space are ibm oracle tibco and 
software expect these companies provide 
enterprises with software that enables them integrate 
many different sources data and different applications 
coherent way the iot means that companies will have more 
data stores relational hadoop object memory and 
many more applications expect companies like software 
mediator all these elements can accessed 
the right time and for the right use case this approach 
likely more attractive the more varied heterogeneous 
enterprise landscape 
refreshing existing platforms 
the second approach likely come from the leading 
enterprise application vendors most notably sap and 
oracle many companies already have landscapes that 
are dominated one these two vendors especially sap 
and expect these companies push their customers 
standardize further their platforms which will 
increasingly architected integrate iot applications 
sap for example already has flavour its hana platform 
that dedicated the iot while expect sap and oracle 
would like their platforms used the exclusion all 
others the reality that very few companies have 
landscape that would make this feasible approach rather 
expect these two push for their platforms become 
the dominant one while they will also provide their own 
middleware technologies enable integration with others

company use cases and examples 
sap much more than just cloud and hana 
sap sees technology stack for iot do with 
sensor device layer network and carrier layer and then 
platform top this this platform will encompass 
connectivity into the devices and data but also enable 
developers whether that within sap within customer 
third party partner develop applications 
however sap believes that critical for large enterprises 
tie these new applications into their existing infrastructure 
this the key difference between machine machine 
and iot it one thing assemble the data from 
many sources but the key thing what you then with that 
data while alert may useful for small company 
larger enterprises have spent billions existing processes 
and workflows and not realistic expect this rebuilt 
just for the iot 
sap tagline for iot monitor analyse automate 
sap has the sybase event stream processor monitor real 
time data feeds which already commonly used wall 
financial applications monitor large amounts data flow 
hana data store for analytics and then the hana 
platform for iot application development the platform 
version hana which has specific features customize 
for iot has two main layers device connectivity and 
management and application enablement 
the key for sap that the platform will integrate with 
your existing sap erp system 
sap expects help enterprises two main ways for 
industries that have already invested sensors and device 
integration for example oil gas and mining were able 
justify heavy investments these areas due the high 
value the assets these industries expect sap 
focus the application development layer other 
industries that have not invested materially iot 
yet expect sap offer the whole platform 
today sap believes are just starting see iot adoption 
companies but aside from the industries that have been 
able invest some extent already highlighted above 
the market really greenfield 
they expect see more concrete use cases industries 
over the next months 
sap has already built iot proof concept poc with the 
port hamburg with cisco hardware and systems 
integration the challenge for hamburg increase the 
efficiency the port order improve the container 
throughput today the port handles around containers 
per annum but expects that this will need increase 
containers will impossible achieve this 
increase just almost tripling the size the port and 
the solution lies optimizing throughput sensors can put 
containers lorries etc and then applications with complex 
algorithms can calculate the optimum scheduling for the port 
another example iot vending machines this shows 
many sap applications customer engagement supply 
chain management and analytics among others however 
the value these applications increased significantly 
connecting the vending machines platform this way 
the supply chain could optimized further predicting when 
machines will run stock and the time the machines 
could improved monitoring them for potential signs

ptc providing the hammer nail the iot 
ptc believes that with the dramatic increase data there 
will also dramatic increase the number 
applications and use cases aimed gathering new insights 
from this data given the large disparities between 
companies and industries ptc argues each business will 
need develop custom applications get the most out 
the data they generate this implies costly undertaking for 
most companies especially those that not already have 
large software development teams 
through the acquisition thingworx the company believes 
can accelerate the adoption iot initiatives giving 
customers platform that significantly simplifies the 
development iot specific applications additionally 
integrating data streams generated from physical sensors 
with their existing plm software the company argues that 
can give customers the ability true lifecycle 
management the sensor data can provide the view about 
how the customers are using the products and how they can 
improve usage this turn gives the seller more informed 
understanding the customer which can improve selling 
new products 
example how ptc hopes integrate both sides

the company recently highlighted the ability get service

systems the machine data used the splunk system 
the same type much the data being generated the 
sensors and controllers iot scenarios result 
think that splunk ability manage and analyse the socalled digital exhaust coming off systems today will 
position very well handle similar types data sets 
expect see from iot systems 
beyond just having platform which customer can 
collect and store this machine data splunk has been 
developing analytical and development capabilities that allow 
the creation new analytical applications top their 
platform the company now has software development kits 
sdks supporting six major development frameworks 
python java javascript php ruby along with 
broadening set additional tools for application developers 
additionally splunk maintains its splunkbase application 
marketplace where partners customers splunk itself can 
distribute applications based the splunk platform 
good example iot application built the splunk 
platform comes from customer that had both elevator 
maintenance business and building leasing arm the 
leasing business would use the elevator maintenance 
services its parent company whenever possible the 
company began collecting elevator usage data using the 
splunk data gathering information how and how often 
elevators were being used their leased buildings 
matching the elevator usage data with leasing data sets the 
company was able discover patterns elevator usage 
that predicted when tenant was likely not renew their 
lease finding these patterns allows the leasing business 
engage with the tenant earlier either engaging the 
renewal process earlier getting replacement tenants 
place faster 
dassault syst mes optimizing design and 
manufacturing 
see five main areas where dassault syst mes has 
products that could benefit from iot adoption 
collecting and searching data first the company has the 
ability search and index information from multiple sources 
sensors web and social networks via its acquisition 
exalead this plays the data store and indexing part the 
iot market 
presenting data second believe that the presentation 
data increasingly important ds acquisition netvibes 
enables present visual dashboards end users 
incorporating data from wide variety sources 
product customisation third result iot designers 
will have far more information able design products 
for specific end markets and their individual needs 
expect this lead much greater level product 
variance and diversity and believe design software 
platforms will have deal with this increased product 
variance and complexity sees its enovia product the 
heart the platform key tool for managing greater 
product variance and complexity 
integrating physical design and software systems 
fourth believe iot will mean that software and systems 
need much more tightly integrated into mechanical 
products see design software companies incorporating 
functionality incorporate this into their mechanical design 
tools companies can test and integrate software during 
the design phase the physical product 
factory optimisation finally expect see much 
larger number sensors factories that should help 
companies optimize their manufacturing operations 
offers delmia operations intelligence delmia help 
companies collect live manufacturing data analyse what 
working and what not and then generate best practices 
and rules from the data delmia should help companies 
reduce the need modify the specifications products 
match manufacturing capabilities and invest new 
equipment 
design challenges iot could further 
software driver 
iot can also drive software design spend believe iot creates 
two major problems opportunities for companies designing 
products first iot creates large amount new data which 
designers could find useful their product design whether they come 
from sensors products from social network interactions think 
that design platforms will have find ways assemble that data for 
designers future second many companies are struggling with the 
integration software and systems into mechanical design iot 
suggests that companies will have improve the way they integrate 
software and systems into physical products would highlight 
automotive where increasing proportion engineers are already 
focused software systems mechanical design least 
already many companies and increasing 
morgan stanley research 
april 
the internet things now 
while iot can produce large amount new operational 
data that companies can use optimize and improve their 
workflows and processes also brings large amount 
data that designers could use optimize and improve their 
product designs this information could come from the 
sensors millions cars fridges that consumers are 
using from interactions social platforms however all 
poses number challenges for companies that are 
designing products chiefly how can the information 
collected stored and then indexed appears 
useable form for the actual designers company 
believe that design platforms will have take more 
account this data future 
over the last five years more product life cycle 
management plm software systems have helped product 
designers move out their information vacuum and work 
more collaboratively this could tandem with 
manufacturing and suppliers but also with sales marketing 
and purchasing departments think that the information 
collected iot sensors can take this new level but 
the design platforms need able integrate this data 
highlighted previously the variety data will also 
increase customer feedback product could come 
from social network interaction information about part 
that fails regularly could come from iot sensors 
result believe that successful design platforms 
future will have deal with this variability information and 
store and index way that useful for the product 
developers 
see two further challenges that are linked for 
product development iot age 
products will have much larger software 
component them and this software has 
integrated into the physical asset already see 
that cars have very large amounts software code 
them and this software has interact with the 
mechanical part the car believe that iot will 
increase the software component assets 
there debate about whether the end point 
sensors iot will dumb just there transmit 
data back central repository that can make 
decisions intelligent with some ability make 
decisions based the information receives 
currently hardware costs suggest the end points 
iot will dumb and simply relay information back 
central repository however expect the cost 
hardware continue fall and think 
possible that these end points will have more 
intelligence over time again this raises the issue 
mechanical design and software integration 
these end points will have incorporate both 
unlocking new business models shifting value 
from products services 
being able access information generated connected 
devices remotely and real time can enable fundamental 
shift how companies operate and how they can sell their 
products being constantly connected companies can 
offer their customers products utility service shifting 
the value from the actual product the service this product 
provides believe this shift towards providing services 
could impact multiple industries however review the 
example hexagon which has openly spoken about the 
potential this business model change 
hexagon deals both hardware and software for 
manufacturing surveying construction and oil gas 
the hardware side the company provides sensory and 
measurement equipment while the software side 
provides computer aided design cad tools for plant marine 
design connecting the sensors the internet the 
company could sell customers access the data generated 
rather than the actual sensors 
why this beneficial 
for the customer 
instead having large outlays capital expenditure for 
hardware equipment which depreciates over time the 
company can just pay weekly monthly annual 
subscription for the utility that equipment 
paying for service you remove the need have 
worry about maintenance repair and replacement costs 
which tend fluctuate often the most inopportune 
time 
just receiving the utility ensures the product being 
used the right way shifting the liability fault 
the seller 
for the vendor 
shifting recurring business model 
monthly annual payments from customers reducing the 
cyclicality hardware refresh cycles 
morgan stanley research 
april 
the internet things now 
being able see what customers are doing intensifies 
the relationship and gives the vendor more information 
improve the offering 
frequent payment interactions with the customer 
recurring payments increase the amount interaction 
between vendor and customer aiding with crossselling new products 
can difficult for customers differentiate between 
certain types products other than price therefore 
being constant dialogue with the customer gives 
companies the opportunity differentiate themselves 
based the service 
definitions some key software terms 
database and database management systems dbms 
database structured collection data list 
contacts managed software called dmbs dmbs 
enable users access create modify the data 
entering new retrieving existing contacts the database 
business intelligence data within organization 
often contained several heterogeneous application 
databases which may not communicate together contain 
inconsistent data not suited run analysis queries business 
intelligence solutions aim removing these obstacles 
middleware organization applications often come from 
different software vendors differ their programming 
language data structure which can make direct interaction 
between them difficult impossible middleware the piece 
software that sits between applications for them able 
communicate with each other even they were not 
initially designed work together 
data integration involves combining data from different 
sources repositories provide users with unified view 
the data that sense close extract transform and 
load tools used build data warehouse therefore 
database players amount the market 
also used for data migration conversion when two 
companies merge for instance when replacing legacy 
application synchronization data between applications

the iot progresses will particularly focused 
those products and applications that are mobile and

role with their wireless networks while satellite companies 
can also benefit areas beyond the reach the wireless 
network even outdoor applications such smart cities 
smart grids one can use mesh technologies and small cells 
and limit the need use the telecom networks 
however worth noting that having access 
networks only part the solution all know from 
experience networks suffer from significant drawbacks 
around security reliability propagation congestion 
interference and overall quality service for this reason 
carrier managed networks may offer appealing alternative

conclusion bluetooth smart the standard 
choice for wearables 
bluetooth smart was introduced wibree nokia 
nokia already had the vision that any object could 
connected smartphone unfortunately for nokia the 
concept smartphone and apps was taken new and higher 
levels apple and google wibree was merged into the 
bluetooth standard and has been known bluetooth 
smart since bluetooth smart smaller simpler and 
cheaper chip than full bluetooth chip and can small 
process can run small battery 
for year two 
while other wireless connectivity standards are equally 
power efficient like ant for instance which has been used 
for mice and keyboards they require dongle 
installed 
the beauty bluetooth smart the compatibility with any 
smartphone tablet from the start and lower cost lower 
power usage than wifi 
bluetooth smart expanding beyond wearables with mesh 
topology option that similar zigbee every bluetooth 
smart node becomes new node for the network and 
extends the range the network consequently bluetooth 
smart could also used for connected light bulbs instead 
for zigbee and without need hub any smartphone could 
used take control light bulbs 
companies involved bluetooth smart are csr dialog 
semiconductor nordic semiconductor stmicroelectronics 
and texas instruments amongst the companies cover 
our top pick csr 
microcontrollers perform array functions and are commonly used 
wide range markets such automotive industrial consumer 
compute and communications with the introduction the internet

the battery could outlast the expected lifetime the 
product also means that zigbee could used device

bluetooth 
zigbee mesh network significant advantage over 
bluetooth and wifi this means that any new node the 
network such light bulb can used network 
extender the zigbee mesh network also allows many 
nodes connected whereas bluetooth limited 
eight and wifi 
zigbee potentially interesting for industrial applications because 
its potential mesh tree topology can communicate over 
greater distances meters which better for factories 
zigbee also self organizing and thus very easy deploy 
wifi can integrated with zigbee extend connectivity 
the internet and considered best for industrial control and 
automation given its easy deployment wifi covered areas 
bluetooth mesh has just been introduced and its early 
days designed compete more directly with zigbee

similarly large number potentially connected devices for 
all these devices total believe the market size was

while very well suited for such mobile broadband 
activities web browsing video streaming and photo 
uploading from smartphone not the optimal solution for 
the internet things which requires connection many 
more nodes with less data traffic per node but more data

weightless silicon that can integrated with any 
other chip with mems gps any other sensor and 
microcontrollers integration and price decline key lower 
system cost and allowing strong unit growth the internet 
things 
what could look like believe that the 
manufacturers equipment have realized that the 
current cellular standards are limited mobile broadband 
and are not suitable for the internet things essence 
perfect for sending large amount data smartphone 
tablet the but the internet things more 
likely send small amounts data from and many more 
devices potentially tens billions units that why 
will have more flexible than and include more 
capacity and connections for least billion devices 
implement very large number nodes satisfy 
increasing needs for data 
support diverse set services applications and 
users all with diverging requirements some internet 
things activities will require lots nodes with small 
amounts data but high levels reliability and very low 
levels latency this very different from smartphone 
user the same network 
use all available non contiguous spectrum for different 
network deployment scenarios 
conclusion enabling low latency high reliability 
computing for big data analytics with servers 
the moment the internet things dominated the

denso 
stmicroelectronics 
analog devices 
believe that the mems market will evolve towards 
more types sensing devices for instance through the 
downsizing analytical instruments such mass 
spectrometers equivalent electronic nose which can 
detect molecules 
greater ability interact with the outside world 
honeywell has introduced mems based vacuum pump 
and stmicroelectronics working piezo based 
actuators 
energy harvesting the ability run chips without 
battery the mems device transforms the energy 
finger switch for instance into enough electricity 
power zigbee chip private company greenpeak has 
launched such product 
what are mems 
micro electro mechanical systems mems are systems 
miniaturized mechanical and electro mechanical elements such 
microsensors and microactuators which convert energy from one form 
another for instance microsensor converts mechanical signal into 
electrical one 
accelerometers measure linear acceleration and tilt angle single and 
multi axis accelerometers detect the combined magnitude and direction 
linear rotational and gravitational acceleration common application 
for accelerometer changing mobile devices screen from portrait 
landscape orientation 
gyroscopes measure the angular rate rotational movement about one 
more axes gyroscopes can measure complex motion accurately 
free space tracking the position and rotation moving object unlike 
accelerometers and compasses gyroscopes not suffer from errors 
due external environmental factors like gravitational and magnetic 
fields this fact makes gyroscopes ideal for advanced motion sensing 
applications consumer devices such full gesture recognition 
movement detection and motion simulation video gaming applications

today electricity market whose structure was designed 
over century ago undergoing significant fundamental 
changes these include the rapid development 
renewable power new consumption patterns and 
government mandated energy policy goals related the 
european union targets 
the answers these challenges will come from rethink

potential opportunity disruption from the iot 
distributed power managing increasingly intermittent 
portfolio spurred generous incentives related wide 
environmental targets the scale renewable energy sources 
europe primarily wind solar and geothermal excluding 
hydro has developed rapidly over the past years from 
twh today the iot may offer solutions the 
future smart grid technology gains scale system 
operators will better able forecast and monitor wind 
resources for instance and then more efficiently dispatch 
the power from them overall distributed power units will 
become part the balancing solution and not just 
mandatory component the production mix the 
development large scale storage capacity that 
communicates effectively with the rest the value chain 
could game changer for the industry although questions 
about the economics such storage technologies remain 
adapting the low voltage grid first decentralization 
the low voltage grid historically has been built and 
operated one way system distribute power end 
customers was not designed collect power from 
decentralized micro units smart grids will aim 
transforming into two way communication network 
allowing better and faster understanding the generation 
flow while high voltage networks have for some time been 
equipped with communications technology means 
ensuring the security electric power supply the challenge 
the industry faces today similarly equip the grids with 
its very large scale and high number customer points 
then new consumption patterns end users are changing 
they way they consume power with better home insulation 
and more focus energy efficiency the one hand and the 
development power based devices and the dawn electric 
cars the other smart meters subset the smart grid 
universe will provide better real time information system

smart grids are happening various speeds and scales 
depending the geography however some obstacles 
need overcome before adoption widespread 
regional variations while initiatives are being taken 
the country level there lack european coordination 
beyond the main principles this limits the scale 
benefits this stage 
unclear economics some countries such france

business models 
interactivity with consumers consumers should better 
understand the cost relationship result improved 
awareness around consumption levels consumers will 
control and saving money which ultimately should improve 
the relationship between supplier and consumer customers

rollouts customers are using about less 
energy heating and proving very popular 
product also about the interactions happen between 
consumers hive and their heating when they are their 
homes these are early statistics but they are clearly 
materially reducing energy wastage and therefore household 
bills 
long term reduction profits energy supply 
domestic energy suppliers could see boosts profits from 
selling the smart consumer product the first instance 
there may some ability increase margins and reduce 
churn from value adding services but there will also 
potentially some reductions long term profitability 
volumes decrease 
smart grid applied 
new business opportunities 
what inefficiency could iot address 
the domestic consumers are currently wasting 
their heating and cooling bills due inefficient 
scheduling according nest substantial savings are also 
likely achieved with other devices such lighting 
household appliances etc the smart consumer concept 
refers better equipping consumers control these areas 
the best examples present are various technologies that 
allow consumers remotely control the temperature their 
homes using their mobile phones tablets laptop

what inefficiency could iot address 
telematics will drive major changes for insurers 
believe the internet things could drive major changes 
the business models and profit pools insurers 
perhaps the most obvious example the growing adoption 
telematics motor insurance although think the future 
influence embedded monitoring devices could spread 
other non life risks for example crop and fire insurance and 
also human biometric risks for life insurance 
autonomous vehicles discussed the morgan stanley 
blue paper autonomous cars self driving the new auto 
industry paradigm november could also have 
material impact the motor insurance market the long 
term 
while the potential benefits the industry are significant 
more accurate risk pricing there are also significant 
threats late adopters these include shrinking risk and 
therefore profit pools 
the major impediment telematics adoption rates the 
concern about personal privacy with the most enthusiastic 
customers typically being younger drivers who may struggle 
obtain cost effective insurance cover any other basis 
what telematics 
telematics involves attaching small monitoring device 
vehicle that tracks the position the vehicle and also driving 
behaviour such time trip speed rates acceleration 
and deceleration etc 
the data allows more precise price calculated for the 
insurance and also crucially allows the insurer influence 
future driver behaviour 
the pricing model that date had gained the most traction 
with those young drivers who may otherwise struggle 
obtain cost effective cover elsewhere for example some 
insurers have billed the insurance monthly with the monthly 
statement highlighting where different behaviour could have 
resulted lower premium such taking fewer late night 
trips and accelerating decelerating more smoothly 
our australia insurance analysts dan toohey and andrei 
stadnik have studied the emerging telematics business 
their part the world and found that telematics customers 
far tend good risks 
what restricting the adoption rate 
date the major factor limiting broader adoption 
telematics has been privacy concerns many individuals 
especially the older demographic not like what they see 
the big brother aspect constant monitoring driving 
behaviour the perceived hassle and cost connecting the 
monitoring device also issue 
note that the cost telematics devices has been falling 
rapidly below for gps module however some 
insurers such aviva have been experimenting with 
smartphone applications that not require extensive 
plumbing into the vehicle only the cost the design the 
application has borne the insurer 
autonomous vehicles 
time seems likely that new cars will equipped 
with telematic devices our property casualty insurance 
analysts kai pan and team last year that the widespread 
adoption autonomous vehicles could result lower 
insurance prices accident frequency falls faster than 
historically the past years 
the same time the severity accidents and therefore the 
cost per accident could increase the complexity cars 
increases they note increase accident severity over 
the past years 
overall believe that the changes the insurance industry 
from the advent autonomous vehicles will take longer 
evolve than the potential shift from telematics 
remote monitoring and risk other industries 
cheap remote internet connected sensors could potentially 
have material impact underwriting for other types 
insurance risk for example sensors could monitor the 
irrigation levels crops offshore oil and gas installations 
allowing weather and other product damage risks priced

could envisage insurers being able monitor remotely the

coverage not otherwise obtainable such after major 
health scare like heart attack 
overall internet things has the potential allow insurers

mining 
menno sanderse 
what inefficiency could iot address 
today connected applications mining are already 
enhancing predictability operations and improving degree 
safety with significant positive impacts costs and 
efficiency from here expect the internet things 
drive even better utilisation infrastructure leading 
higher production levels 
two buckets opportunities 
while many see mining slow moving industry the 
internet things already driving substantial efficiency 
gains several individual mines our view will 
fundamentally change the future operations and predictability 
all mining operations two ways 
real time monitoring equipment such conveyor 
belts concentrators and mobile machinery mainly 
excavators and trucks 
operation autonomous mines where autonomously 
operating trucks and excavators remove and transport 
waste rock and ore without human involvement and 
eventually transport via autonomously operating trains 
the port for shipping 
unfortunately for the mining companies themselves least 
first see the majority the benefits being passed 
clients the form lower commodity prices but eventually 
better predictability operations and higher safety with fewer 
fatalities should also benefit the industry large 
three areas value creation 
the internet things creating value for the mining industry 
three areas 
productivity increases are seeing more ore mined 
and processed existing infrastructure driven fewer 
maintenance related outages and continuous operation 
equipment trucks and other equipment optimal levels 
lower costs result reductions outages and 
maintenance costs facilitated real time monitoring 
equipment 
increased safety more equipment operated 
autonomously should reduce fatalities and other injuries 
increasing autonomous and teleremote operated 
equipment should also remove mine workers from the 
underground environment which could also reduce the 
cost for ventilation 
real time example rio tinto autonomous trucks 
the best example mining that know rio tinto 
autonomous truck fleet rio tinto operates over 
autonomously operating dump trucks out total fleet 
over its australian iron ore operations the trucks 
operate three mines with the world first fully autonomous 
mine pit the yandicoogina mine australia rio tinto 
controls the fleet from remote operating center perth 
kilometers away the trucks carry metric tons 
ore rock with every trip 
these trucks are not remote operated controller with 
joystick these are fully autonomous trucks that are 
connected via the internet each other the control 
system and other machines the mines such 
excavators the trucks react the motion other pieces 
equipment truck and adjust the constantly changing layout 
the mine ore and waste gets removed 
currently the trucks are retrofitted komatsu models 
the future new internet things technology should allow the 
trucks designed and the driver cabin removed 
this will trigger another step forward productivity today 
the trucks can only dump cargo one direction away from 
the driver cabin the future trucks without driver cabins 
will able dumb both directions reducing the need 
turn and reverse these machines which move very slowly 
date the interaction between the trucks and the komatsu 
excavators semi connected with the excavators still under 
manual control the excavators buckets which hold 
tons rock ore have sensors that communicate with the 
trucks excavator operators manoeuvre the buckets above the 
locations where the trucks need stationed the sensors 
the buckets communicate with the and the trucks position 
themselves under the excavators eventually the excavators 
are likely become autonomous too

rio tinto operates remote monitoring center brisbane 
australia process excellence center that has real time 
connections mines mongolia and the united states 
addition australia this center allows rio tinto remotely 
monitor processes its copper and thermal coal mines 
experts can provide real time feedback and suggestions for 
improvements which can implemented real time the 
teams the mine site enabling the mining equipment 
coordinate the mine management through the remote 
monitoring center has been done with existing suppliers such 
schneider electric and metso and consultants like igate 
the benefits rio tinto 
the first benefit lower truck operating costs both terms 
lower fuel consumption less tyre wear and longer gaps 
between maintenance these benefits are driven more 
consistent driving patterns including more measured braking 
and acceleration resulting from the algorithms embedded 
the system and the benefit being able put together 
genuine best class trip the latter allows the algorithms 
put together ideal trip for each truck golden run the 
rail that combines the knowledge and experience all 
previous trips this very difficult replicate for human 
beings human driver cannot expected deliver 
best class trip every section each trip and for every 
trip they execute 
trucks are just the beginning 
the next big step rio tinto automation plan the 
introduction autonomous driverless trains these trains 
will operate manner similar the autonomous trucks 
algorithms controlled from the operating center perth 
rio tinto transported the entirety its australia 
operation million metric tons iron ore based 
equity ownership train the port each train rake 
around kilometers long and has rail cars each 
loaded with tons ore the trains carry payload 
metric tons iron ore average 
kilometers the rail track has level crossings and passes 
quite few smaller villages the moment each train 
operated crew this requires substantial amount 
coordination and cost reposition crews match working 
hours with train times and other delivery variables 
the financials involved are large 
mentioned above rio tinto sold million 
metric tons iron ore from australia equity basis 
operated over truck moves just for ore and not the 
waste rock and train journeys get the ore 
the port the total cash opex amounted usd 
billion per ton ore this includes royalties and 
some overhead etc and generated per ton 
ebitda 
our calculations each million metric tons ore 
worth million ebitda 
rio tinto has not made public the net benefits hopes see 
when adds autonomous haul trucks autohaul trains 
our view the savings should considerable both 
terms avoided costs and virtue generating additional 
volumes with the same infrastructure 
rio tinto indicated that the use big data generated 
facilities such its processing excellence center brisbane 
has resulted million improved cash flow just from 
analysing the performance the copper operations after tax 
and discounted rio tinto cost capital

what inefficiency could iot address 
see the internet things contributing directly the 
advance precision agriculture 
precision agriculture role reduce the variability yield 
per acre production across the farm corn 
farming for example yields can vary within very short 
distances farmers typically make near uniform decisions 
acres that typically could benefit from more specialized 
approach that existing technology does not allow for 
precision agriculture can identify the causes yield variation 
and allow farmers proactively minimize this variation 
optimizing seed choices fertilizer application rates 
planting harvesting decisions etc more specifically 
individual plots land 
data analytics and algorithms based farmers historical 
plot plot yield performance combined with highly localized 
historical temperature and precipitation data should give 
famers better information with which make their planning 
decisions farmers will share their historical farm 
performance data with service providers who will turn 
amalgamate and analyze larger local data set called 
prescriptions for precision agriculture will delivered 
electronically farmers who some cases will utilize ipad 
applications and others feed the prescription directly into 
farm equipment machinery 
how does impact current operators established 
business models 
optimization hybrid seed choice and plant population 
farmers typically choose different hybrid seed types 
plant their farm hopes that the genetic diversity these 
hybrids will protect them against whatever growing conditions 
come that year drought too much rain heavy insect 
pressure farmers will typically plant standard 
amount seed each acre hoping that they have found 
optimal amount for that acre precision agriculture seeks 
find the optimal intersection hybrid type and plant 
population for each plot land 
optimization fertilizer application rates yield 
maximized having the right level soil fertility advanced 
field soil mapping technology allows farmers apply the right 
mix nitrogen phosphate and potash each acre 
revenue should increase from increased yield while costs 
may decline fertilizer application rates become less uniform 
each acre reducing the risk over application 
minimizing the impact adverse weather events 
precision agriculture should help farmers more proactive 
than reactive which turn can reduce yield variability this 
would happen not predicting the weather but rather 
helping farmers understand how prior year weather 
impacted the farm analyze the current weather season 
assign probabilities whether certain past negative events 
might reoccur specific parts the farm and thus iii gain 
opportunities proactively address potential issues that could 
lead more less use inputs such crop chemicals 
new business opportunities 
according monsanto precision agriculture over 
billion revenue opportunity industry wide while industry wide 
revenue modest present believe growth could 
substantial coming years companies will likely seek use 
precision agriculture add their existing value 
proposition some cases means gain market 
share while primary target markets today are corn and 
soybean farmers diversification across crops and 
geographies will likely follow for concepts that prove 
successful 
enabling technology regulation 
regulation farming technology should minimal 
most this contrast most other products agriculture 
that are designed increase yield for example seed 
biotechnology and crop chemicals must through rigorous 
and multi year regulatory process prior being submitted for 
export approval key grain importers 
standardization present most companies across the 
agriculture value chain have some precision agriculture 
offering although industry wide standards have been set 
yet and player has offering that covers the entire 
precision agriculture opportunity set some companies have 
begun partnerships joint ventures performance 
precision agriculture extremely measureable either

have take more integrated approach care delivery 
order reduce costs and improve profitability the internet 
things will assist hospitals reducing the cost burden care 
through two key mechanisms 
enhance clinical outcomes this would reduce 
frequency treatment and the onset higher acuity 
conditions which are costlier the system additionally 
providers exposure legal recourse would mitigated 
reduce resource requirements greater 
interconnectivity between providers addition remote 
monitoring and real time communication technologies 
would reduce the need for specialized human capital 
where wages and benefits average account for 
hospitals cost structure 
real world examples 
proteus digital health proteus has created smart pill 
system that transmits information about the type pill being 
taken including when was ingested and patient 
physiological data nearby smartphone the aim 
support increased physician collaboration reduce variability 
treatment allow more efficient allocation medical 
resources and improve clinical outcomes this would 
effectively reduce inappropriate hospital utilization and curb 
readmissions 
ibm hospitals employ significant amount operating 
leverage where one the largest cost pools operating 
emergency room which must adequately staffed all 
times telemedicine what the internet things coming 
called the medical field area that may reduce 
hospital staffing needs providing care remotely 
providers are leveraging ibm project blue spruce 
technology which provides secure patient provider videoconferencing including collaborative workspace access 
patient electronic medical records and automatically 
charge for the appointment through integrated session 
timer connecting remote sites via telemedicine hospitals 
can more cost effectively deliver care communities while 
concurrently broadening their access new patient 
populations this clearly far less resource intensive 
process than the alternative building new hospitals 
barriers adoption 
cultural and societal factors adoption would require 
significant changes the behavior both patients and 
physicians physicians would have trained and patients 
would have accept less personal forms care delivery 
the patient physician relationship personal and private 
where treatment and consultations are traditionally conducted 
person disruption this relationship subject 
considerable controversy evidenced consumer 
responses provider exclusions healthcare gov 
hipaa compliance transmission health data across 
remote platform would require significant oversight 
telemedicine may jeopardize patient privacy and risks the 
exchange inappropriate inadequate medical data 
financial cost and reimbursement uncertainty enhanced 
patient outcomes and cost efficiency must validated for 
payors begin reimbursing for these services 
financial implications 
with healthcare costs magnifying current fiscal pressures the 
system will forced our view explore alternative forms 
care delivery that not only bend the cost curve downward

enable physicians and health authorities rapidly and more 
accurately detect safety issues during clinical trials and 
pharma companies could then take faster decisions 
terminate continue trials

with poor treatment adherence exclude them from 
the statistical analysis the results which usually difficult 
perform and potential source trial failure 
easing and coordinating the logistics clinical trials

opportunity for pharmaceutical companies and believe 
this could materially lower the costs and accelerate clinical 
trials which represent around part the total drug

could accelerate patient recruitment and increase the 
power statistical calculations 
estimate that cost reduction clinical trial costs 
could represent the equivalent budget three new drugs

data capture and transmission healthcare have been slow 
evolve due the highly localized and fragmented nature 
hospital systems insurers and independent physicians 
these applications have been limited basic payment and 
insurance processing and providing online access 
consumer medical information unlike the broader consumer

healthcare have not embraced connectivity via new

have shown six day decrease average patient hospital 
stay days savings per patient 
annually this compares average annual cost 
making for attractive efficiency measure for 
hospitals indeed think this cost may understated

data collection well the opportunity cost avoiding 
expensive acute treatments 
exhibit 
toumaz sensiumvitals monitoring solution 
solid opportunity for the iot hospitals 
see two key avenues opportunity for reduced hospital 
costs from iot patient monitoring and anonymous data 
collection 
patient monitoring general ward patients are 
typically checked manually nurses every six eight 
hours the corollary this that deterioration patient 
conditions may undetected for hours leading readmittance intensive care units and longer average 
stay times through digital solutions key biometrics 
patients general wards may monitored freeing 
nursing time and allowing faster responses thereby 
reducing average stay length and improving patient 
outcomes 
anonymous data the collection anonymous patient 
data from monitoring devices should also allow for form 
predictive medicine the dataset patient 
outcomes grows hospitals and doctors will have hard 
probabilistic data determine the likelihood patients 
developing certain complications given their current 
condition for example knowing that patient has 
material probability myocardial infarction heart attack 
given certain set biometrics conditions hospital staff 
may act supply medication earlier this anonymous

healthcare costs should also benefit from shorter patient

becoming tangible over the next years 
working example implications for hospitals 
illustration highlight below the potential cost 
savings the hospital system from the basic introduction 
patient digital monitoring according the american

indeed the savings from monitoring could larger than this

savings from the increased predictive medicine driven 
patient data well the opportunity costs savings 
from acute procedures that have been avoided while 
calculating the impact beyond the basic number patient

ben uglow 
what inefficiency could iot address 
beyond efficiency improvements within manufacturing 
processes the internet things could make factory 
automation even more efficient two other ways 
loss useful data production lines generate large 
amounts data but much this kept proprietary 
networks and many plants have production lines 
producing information separately this reduces the ability 
users manage and analyze the data iot 
approach with open based cloud solution could 
allow users access and aggregate the information from 
the entire production line and supply chain make 
better faster decisions optimize production 
lack fully integrated processes currently tend 
see islands automation within production lines with 
widespread machine machine communications 
within single processes the internet things could 
allow communication along the entire production line 
data could transmitted and analyzed faster allowing 
the automated components more flexible and 
responsive this can also beyond the production line 
itself connecting all the electronic components the 
facility security cameras card reader gates etc 
potential opportunity disruption from the iot 
process monitoring and prevention enabling all 
relevant employees access the data users could monitor 
the production line and use modeling software predict faults 
bottlenecks before they happen allowing fixes time 
before shutdowns have occur 
remote management and optimization having the 
entire production line providing and responding 
aggregated data improvements could implemented 
experts remotely reducing the need have highly skilled 
people the ground 
optimal energy management with the real time data 
coming from machines and devices firms can monitor their 
energy consumption real time and manage processes 
directly maximize efficiency and minimize costs combined 
with smart grid and flexible pricing manufacturers could 
manage their production lines perform the most energy 
intensive tasks the cheapest times this would allow heavy 
industries make energy controllable variable input rather 
than disconnected cost 
integration production line components industrial 
cloud computing network would allow all devices the 
production process communicate directly replacing the 
current master slave network this would remove the need 
for the current plc networks processes would able 
adapt much more flexibly situations around them even 
allowing systems self configure and suggest efficiency 
improvements the amount data increases 
assuming the global cost base manufacturing 
trillion today cost savings from iot and 
penetration iot get potential cost 
savings cisco systems estimated that with the 
internet things supply chain logistics could see savings 
trillion through improved process efficiencies and 
less waste believe the cisco estimate higher because 
encompasses more elements the supply chain such 
logistics which describe the freight transport section 
enabling technology regulation 
most the required technology already exists this area 
while the hardware would not new the cloud based data 
opportunities are and would require new equipments and 
adjustments such 
mobile systems linking employees data the cloud 
unified connectivity and manufacturing platforms

about twh are used residential lighting the 
every year and the currently uses twh all lighting 
applications increased awareness energy efficiency has 
shown that besides using more environmentally friendly light 
bulbs more efficient usage and control lighting could 
reduce these numbers additionally the amount wire used 
property also comes additional cost when building 
and maintaining housing 
leaving lights when not needed introducing 
wireless lights and remotes would remove the problem 
lights being left not only would user able 
check remotely lights were but already philips hue 
bulbs use consumer smartphone gps and 
geofencing system detect when the homeowner not 
and turn the lights off automatically advances 
indoor location tracking area which google with its 
indoor maps rollout and apple after its acquisition 
wifislam and the launch ibeacons seem 
actively involved could even allow this automatic turning 
off the user walks around their house keeping 
electricity usage absolute minimum 
large amount wiring support user needs 
number lighting points currently large amounts 
wiring housing into lighting especially there are 
several rooms with multiway switching can remove 
the need for these additional circuits and lengths wire 
then the cost building wiring house can 
reduced 
hue bulbs are designed work together create any colour 
range ambiance within room they can also used 
gradually wake the user from sleep recreating the effect 
dawn the bulbs can also programmed come 
different times when the user away security benefit 
alternative leaving light the entire time the 
homeowner out the bulbs can also interact with certain 
philips televisions create appropriate lighting for viewing 
minimizing wiring perhaps most obviously wireless bulbs 
and switches would minimize the amount wiring needed 
buildings removing the need for built switches with 
wireless bulbs multiway switching with wireless switches 
cost savings led bulbs use less power than 
traditional light bulbs and that before consider the 
savings better managing their use the cost having 
three bedroom house rewired the range several 
thousand pounds the and wireless technology would 
not only reduce this but also reduce the need for rewiring 
enabling technology regulation 
light becomes part the housing experience embracing 
the internet things benefits for local connectivity philips 
the only requirement have compatible smartphone 
tablet with hue currently supporting ios android and 
windows mobile 
barriers adoption 
potential opportunity disruption from the iot 
controlling the light remotely aside from the security and 
efficiency advantages remote control lighting there are also 
benefits product development and energy management 
being able monitor how people use lighting and collecting 
that data bulb manufacturers can make bulbs more suited 
how people use them bulbs more suited being turned 
off regularly against those that are left for long periods 
philips has used the wireless technology for over two 
years already and wireless switches are also widely 
available there need for any special installation 
retrofitting work home office though some light 
fittings may require small adaptor for the hue 
cost the units currently the hue starter pack sells 
for this includes three bulbs and the wireless 
bridge wireless switches also sell premium their 
traditional rivals legrand wireless master switch sells 
for per unit opposed for the closest 
non wireless version 
uncertain retrofit advantage installing either wireless 
bulbs switches existing wired house does not 
currently offer revolutionary outcome the benefit

changing how retailers market consumers 
descending order importance see these three 
distinct ways which the internet things likely impact 
the retail industry 
are relatively sanguine about the impact that iot will have 
marketing theory the implications here seem profound 
with advertisers able push information consumers 
their smartphones whenever the device specified 
location whilst this may sound attractive advertisers 
enabling them better target their messaging question 
whether consumers will actually find such services appealing 
believe consumers will more interested pulling from 
the internet additional information things they are 
interested rather than being bombarded with unsolicited 
messages the internet things may make such information 
easier access believe the smartphone not the 
internet things per that really empowering consumers 
near the point purchase 
geoff ruddell 
transformation operating processes 
improved marketing 
selling connected products 
transforming supply chain and inventory 
management 
this will far believe the biggest impact the internet 
things will have the retail industry seems likely that 
sensors will become cheap that all products can effectively 
tagged that retailers will able know real time 
basis exactly where each unit stock located 
this has the potential transform both retailers supply 
chains and their store operations for example would 
allow retailers fully automate the picking operations their 
warehouses and the flow product stores retailers stock 
files should become accurate which likely 
significantly improve availability whilst should also 
possible for check out services become instantaneous 
there would need for cashiers scan individual 
products with check out services typically accounting for 
around all staff hours supermarket today this 
innovation alone could reduce cost sales ratios the 
industry about sales very significant savings 
selling connected products 
view this the least significant potential impact 
discussed elsewhere this report the iot expected 
have number applications consumers homes 
consumers wishing take advantage these applications 
are likely have buy new internet enabled products likely 
from retail stores they physical online until becomes 
clearer exactly what applications gain traction with consumers 
difficult predict which retailers will benefit most 
however suspect that the biggest beneficiaries are likely

the internet things will likely have two major 
positive impacts food retailers 
given similarities between food retail and general retail the 
three impacts iot retailers detailed previously broadly 
apply food retailers well however note two major 
differences 
first not expect the selling iot enabled products 
anywhere close material enough change the 
structural trends affecting food retailers non food business 
second see clear advantage food retail from the 
adoption radio frequency identification rfid technology 
given makes possible the reading all the tags group 
simultaneously the more goods store offers and the more 
complex the upstream supply chain the more makes 
sense switch item level rfid tagging opposed bar 
codes 
for instance indoor positioning systems allow retailers 
push notifications nearby mobile devices can point 
here the low cost low powered ibeacon developed 
apple for ios devices and today available for little 
each including analytics software thanks these

ads offers soon their phones are located nearby 
partner stores similar targeted marketing could easily 
make sense too the world grocery stores 
believe 
exhibit 
example ibeacon notification equipped 
apple store 
with this mind believe the likely impact iot food 
retailers will twofold 
from the customers standpoint improved shopping 
experience and better food traceability 
the retailers side iot creates opportunity 
significantly increase operating efficiency 
first iot should help improve customers store 
experience 
traditional food retailers will have increasingly cope with 
the structural channel shift favour online believe iot 
could help their effort revive stores and improve 
customers shopping experience would sort benefits 
consumers two categories 
improved shopping experience physical stores 
first benefit consumers our view the improved 
store experience that iot enables remains 
seen what exact applications iot could have but already 
some companies give good examples potential new 
shopping experiences 
source apple morgan stanley research 
adding this item level tags could also enable real time 
availability checking shopping lists that automatically 
update themselves etc yet perhaps the most striking 
advantage moving item level rfid tags lies the 
ability scan all items once all stock items carried 
unique identifying sensor iot enabled scanner 
located the store exit could replace the majority 
not all check out counters store customer 
basket trolley could scanned she exits the store

grocery skus stock keeping units all which 
bear rfid tags according the store management 
some consumers have already tweaked their shopping 
habits move from their usual items not yet available 
the rfid test shop for similar items that can scanned 
simultaneously the checkout also note that with 
less staff required the checkouts more human 
presence likely the aisle where likely brings more

increased food traceability safety 
see item level rfid apt answer today 
increased customer sensitivity around food traceability 
and safety issues compared traditional code bars this 
iot related innovation can enable individual items 
carry much more information information about 
processes could written each stage the supply 
chain and much more complete and reliable way 
than with current paper based systems 
also see another major source benefits for the 
customer iot could open world opportunities 
you keep the rfid tag alive after the checkout scan for 
example then becomes possible interact with smart 
refrigerators which would scan the tags the groceries 
contains and inform the consumer expiring dates 
low stock levels potential recipes etc 
significant reduction shrinkage the loss due 
shoplifting employee theft paperwork mistakes 
supplier fraud 
extreme simplification the checkout process with 
virtually staff required fully item tagged stores 
typically rood retail business generates operating 
ebit margin labour costs represent the second 
largest cost item food retailer business model after 
cost goods sold sales assuming 
gross margin staff costs could account for sales 
fuel these would assume are employed 
stores accounting for about sales food retailers 
eventually move item level rfid believe faster and 
more accurate inventory management and the 
disappearance checkouts could reduce about the 
staff level required store representing potential 
margin gain course most this gain would reinvested 
prices wise decision believe but the size the 
opportunity makes compelling for food retailers ahead 
the game this topic 
second significant cost for food retailers shrink 
sales this line item captures the value goods lost 
perishing damage and theft with rfid the item level 
shoplifting should brought down minimal levels while 
supplier fraud will likely significantly curtailed think 
iot progressively introduced through the supply chain 
under the incentive one two major retailers forcing the 
move first shrink could decrease about sales 
second retailers adopting iot will likely enjoy more 
efficient supply chains and inventory management 
believe iot could prove paramount significantly 
decreasing key components food retailer cost base instore labour shrink and supply chain costs 
for working capital improvement the potential upside from 
iot difficult quantify but believe the significant 
improvement inventory management could easily help the 
average retailer improve its inventory turn about two days 
rfid technology today already widespread the grocery 
sector but only the level cartons and returnable transport 
items rtis such trolleys and pallets the use rfid 
the item level should allow retailers much further 
leading 
food retailers have been exploring rfid technology for more 
than decade now and already employ their distribution 
centres however barriers the generalization rfid the 
single item level have long resulted from two main factors 
the cost per unit rfid chips long excess cents per 
unit made not economically viable extend the technology 
single items store given some items sell for pennies and 
cents and the technology vulnerable liquids cold 
products and metal shelves 
meaningful efficiency gains inventory management 
better monitoring product expiry dates live 
knowledge the location and the number items 
why only now 
morgan stanley research 
april 
the internet things now 
recently though both barriers entry might breaking 
down 
organ stanley blue paper 
firstly likely further reduction the cost per sensor could 
indeed dramatically transform the economics when the first 
plans for the store the future were launched tag 
prices were about cents the time opened prices 
had already fallen cents last december sports goods 
retailer decathlon was talking about paper surface tags 
cheap five cents each obviously lot depends the 
stage when the tag fixed the type used and the quantities 
required but see the equation getting more and more 
favourable food retailers increasingly trial the system and 
convince their trade partners follow believe the cost 
per sensor needs fall less than one cent per unit 
become profitable from food retailer standpoint 
secondly recent innovations now can overcome issues linked 
liquids cold products and metal shelves good example 
this the medical industry push item level tagging 
they too deal with these three issues 
see early adopters the key beneficiaries with 
big box operators only marginally benefiting 
often food retail the majority any cost reduction 
which potential extent shown the partial quantification 
exercise above will likely reinvested into lower prices for 
those leading the game iot could hence become strong 
pricing advantage and indirectly powerful driver market 
share then the well known virtuous circle grocery retailers 
would kick market share gains enhance purchasing power 
with suppliers this turn allows retailer offer better 
value its customers 
the other side iot could lead narrowing 
discounters competitive edge traditional retailers the 
latter typically relies large part the lower staff levels 
discounter needs operate its stores for instance 
discounter bim operates with full time equivalent 
employees for average tesco the 
new environment where iot allows meaningful 
improvements labour productivity suspect discounters 
edge will somehow fade besides discounters today generally 
lack loyalty cards with the notable exception dia with 
competition soon linking iot led interactions with clients 
store their loyalty cards these discounters might lacking 
there appealing service for customers 
how might work the worked example 
the the big listed three supermarket companies wage 
costs were our calculations the internet 
things could reduce this and reduce shrink 
broadly the combination could reduce direct costs 
assuming cost integration this could increase ebit 
reduce average prices reinvested

see big box operators marginally benefiting from the 
iot opportunity should help them revive the store 
shopping experience and somehow slowdown the ongoing 
channel shift out large stores and towards online and 
convenience 
gross profit 
checkout staff costs 
most likely retailers will probably start with tagging those 
high value items items prone theft then think will 
ultimately come down one big grocery industry leader 
taking the first step and involve its trade partners the rest 
the industry will then likely follow promptly

what inefficiency could iot address 
the global airline industry poised generate record 
profits fragile margins its most recent forecast the 
international air transport association iata projects 
industry wide net post tax profits rising from billion 
billion for context iata 
forecast would the most profitable year the industry has 
experienced over the last years with the second highest 
year being such some this may appear 
sizeable profit but for revenue industry and 
one which notoriously cyclical represents profit margin 
only what iata describes fragile margin amid 
still risky business environment managements look 
through their cost structures pennies literally matter fact 
translating the aforementioned numbers per passenger 
figures shows that average airlines globally generate 
revenue passenger incur 
costs passenger and produce profits per passenger 
when consider these characteristics total enormous 
revenue lines created frequent asset turns generating huge 
amounts data which managers then use reduce costs 
pennies bolster thin margins often finding fuel and 
maintenance efficiencies it easy see how airlines are 
well positioned benefit from the internet things 
small changes cost structure can major needle 
movers when near record profits are built the back 
profit margins doesn take much move the needle 
meaningful way furthermore the fact that most airlines 
globally have large degree fixed labor expense result 
unionization means that the companies need turn 
other cost buckets for the majority productivity 
improvements therefore fuel and maintenance efficiencies 
regularly top lists drivers various cost improvement 
programs and between the two fuel the larger opportunity 
far for example fuel expense percentage total 
costs ranges from across the world see 
exhibit with average expense the total 
costs range though maintenance costs are not 
consistently disclosed across airlines globally for context 
maintenance expenses average costs across large 
airlines therefore even slight changes either these 
cost buckets through efficiency gains can long way 
toward multiplying the global industry margins

how much impact might the iot have airline 
fuel maintenance efficiency anecdotes from engine 
manufacturers and airlines alike suggest that the industrial 
internet having real impact specifically with respect 
maintenance benefits engine manufacturers can work 
together with airlines placing sensors its machines 
harvest vast quantities data that can then analyzed 
prevent unnecessary downtime spotting potential faults

this could binary event for many players some could 
see existential threat from autonomous cars some could 
reinvent themselves leaders and others could enter the 
industry for the first time 
there are implications for oems and suppliers the traditional 
oems need lead the space reinvent themselves 
manufacturing specialists the secular suppliers who provide 
autonomous vehicle systems and other growing parts the 
car will get stronger while suppliers who are exposed static 
longer essential parts the car will challenged

the next steps 
while the industry works perfect autonomous vehicle 
technology there are steps that need taken outside the 
industry ensure that the rollout will smooth and 
successful while these actions not necessarily have 
completed before the first autonomous car hits the road they 
will necessity achieve full penetration autonomous 
vehicles 
step building consumer awareness going take 
lot coaxing get people give control the steering 
wheel even the use cruise control viewed with 
skepticism many drivers today getting them give 
complete control not going easy that said 
probably have epidemic too many people driving 
while impaired whether texting some other distraction 
may easier get people embrace autonomous cars 
than give their smartphone the car 
believe the oems need begin familiarizing 
consumers with autonomous car technology and retraining 
their car related behaviors our view the best way this 
conducting road shows which people are driven 
around small tracks autonomous cars low speeds get 
them used the feeling oems can also set simulators 
dealers that customers can try out the autonomous 
experience safe environment 
step getting regulatory support the government 
going have get board with autonomous cars some 
point during the ramp phase believe the government 
can have large role the process including 
accommodating autonomous cars legislation issuing 
special licenses autonomous vehicles the early stage

infrastructure and ultimately speeding adoption through

step resolving the liability issue this the most 
frequently cited impediment autonomous vehicle 
penetration believe the liability issue needs 
comprehensively addressed soon this actually critical

morgan stanley blue paper 
jessica alsford 
have amply elsewhere this blue paper the internet 
things likely disrupt number large industries 
globally many cases the financial benefits are clear but 
here outline the potential environmental and social risks 
overall see the environmental risks iot 
positive 
consumption scarce resources one the key long 
term sustainability threats the world population 
expected rise billion thus increasing the demand for 
energy water and food the internet things could provide 
means improve efficiency and minimize waste 
renewable energy sources become more integrated 
part the power network iot could help facilitate 
greater usage renewable energy sources the intermittent 
nature renewables such wind and solar historically has 
presented significant challenges for system operators 
however smart grids may enable the operators better 
forecast and monitor variations the resources order 
more efficiently distribute the power generated from them 
this could game changer for the renewable energy 
industry the future 
energy and fuel consumption may fall smart grids and 
smart meters will increase the amount real time information 
provided system operators and end users alike this can 
help increase energy efficiency and spread consumption more 
evenly through the day for example our electric and water 
utilities analysts estimate that the domestic customers 
currently waste their heating and cooling bills 
due inefficient scheduling new technology allows for 
consumers remotely control the temperature their homes 
using mobile phones tablets laptop for example this can 
have significant impact consumers expenditure and 
also energy consumption with one degree drop 
temperature cutting energy usage 
alternatively wireless lights and remotes could result lights 
automatically being turned off the user walks around 
their house thus keeping electricity usage absolute 
minimum 
introducing iot technology into transport could significantly 
reduce fuel consumption electronic board recorders 
eobrs the trucking industry already help improve 
driving behaviour which turn improves fuel efficiency 
however truly autonomous vehicles could have much 
bigger impact with the morgan stanley transport analysts 
conservatively estimating savings fuel costs 
alone for the global freight transportation industry 
similarly iot may help reduce water leakage average 
around water injected water distribution networks 
lost through leakage before reaching the end customer 
fitting sensors into the system may possible detect 
leaks earlier and therefore reduce water waste and production 
costs 
food production could increase recent study the 
oecd and fao estimates that agricultural production will 
need increase over the next years order 
meet rising food demand available arable land only 
expected increase driven greater levels 
irrigation and one the keys ensure sufficient food 
through better productivity 
the advancement precision agriculture could 
accelerated the internet things data analytics and 
algorithms based famers historical plot byplot yield 
performance combined with highly localized historical 
temperature and precipitation data should give farmers better 
information with which make their planning decisions 
see three ways which this could help improve yields thus 
increasing food production optimization hybrid seed 
choice and plant population optimization fertilizer 
application rates and minimization the impact adverse 
weather events 
but what are the potential social costs 
potential social consequence the rise the internet 
things the loss certain jobs explained the 
beginning this report the internet things essentially 
army tens billions tiny robots making our lives easier 
but these robots will doing jobs formerly done people 
for example retail cashiers and warehouse staff both 
could potentially replaced robots the leisure industry 
will ultimately have virtual concierges hotels and guides 
museums and automatic check the airport whilst 
there positive cost impact for the companies that are able 
reduce staff costs there also the threat higher 
unemployment rates will sufficient new industries and types 
morgan stanley research 
april 
the internet things now 
jobs develop absorb some the newly idled labour 
supply 
organ stanley blue paper 
could this happening helpful point time 
turning its head the internet things with its widening 
use robots may welcome solution one the 
consequences global ageing over the next years the 
number people aged years will decline countries 
such china japan germany and russia increasing 
the use technology companies can optimize productivity 
thus helping offset some the headwinds lower labour 
supply and higher wage inflation that are likely emerge over 
the next years 
iot could reduce health and safety risks certain 
industries the mining industry key example one 
which the internet things could provide such social 
benefit autonomously run mines could see the use 
autonomously operating trucks and excavators removing and 
transporting waste rock and ore without any human 
involvement this should help reduce fatalities and other 
injuries the best example this far rio tinto 
autonomous truck fleet its australian iron ore operations 
these fully autonomous trucks are connected via the internet 
each other the control system and other machines 
the mines such excavators the trucks react the motion 
other pieces equipment and adjust the constantly 
changing layout the mine ore and waste gets removed 
uses iot could improve patient outcomes and reduce 
average length stay telemedicine could also reduce the 
need for hospitalization providing medical care remotely 
through secure patient provider video conferencing for 
example 
greater adoption connected devices may also help with the 
development drugs during clinical trials for example 
physicians can use tablets identify patients who are 
developing side effects not adhering the treatment 
guidelines this could help lower the cost clinical trials with 
estimated cost reduction representing the equivalent 
budget three new drugs for the industry whole every 
year 
early adopters iot may benefit from higher customer 
satisfaction companies already mine online data 
understand consumer trends and interests however 
extending this level communication could help drive 
customer loyalty and satisfaction for example entering 
retail store leisure facility the customer could sent 
relevant coupons and promotions his her mobile device 
depending previous shopping activity automatic payment 
through mobile app would reduce eliminate the need 
queue pay finally data gathered from sensors could 
improve real time inventory checking and thus reduce the risk 
lost sales due product unavailability 
could also help improve healthcare for the general 
population healthcare costs already account for some gdp most developed economies with the 
population getting older there going increasing 
pressure provide more healthcare services without costs 
escalating 
however what point does data collection become 
unwanted the consumer telematics already gaining 
traction the motor insurance industry way more 
precisely calculate price for the motor insurance iot could 
result embedded monitoring devices being used other 
areas insurance such crop and fire and even life 
insurance via human biometric risks 
there are number ways which iot could help improve 
the management healthcare cost effectively hospitals 
key biometrics patients could monitored real time whilst 
the collection autonomous data from monitoring devices 
could enable form predictive medicine both these 
however this detailed and constant monitoring behaviour 
does raise concerns over privacy even using telematics 
can result lower insurance premiums for the customer 
this material enough saving for people willingly sign
