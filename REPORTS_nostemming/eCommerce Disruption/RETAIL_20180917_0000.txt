european retail reits have had tough time recently with stocks trading down 
materially they have been rating for more than years but the recent selloff was more severe and sharper than what have witnessed recent years 
contrast mall reit sentiment has improved even more nuanced 
than headlines suggest mall reits have performed well absolute terms 
recently total returns over the past months market cap weighted 
basis however this driven large part simon property group with total 
returns compared average return across the five names the 
subsector see are large cap reits leading the charge 
read across for europe this has prompted debate among investors whether 
some these european names could due bounce back and what could 
trigger such rally 
europe comparing and contrasting make the following three 
observations 
retail fundamentals while occupancy has been stable declining the 
same store noi growth has decelerated and cap rates have expanded europe 
the underlying fundamental picture very different with occupancy all time 
highs like for like rental growth still above trend and yields close alltime lows other words european retail reits have rated anticipation 
weakening fundamental picture which materially different from the 
where the fundamentals have been weakening 
inflection point european yields cap rates european reits also those 
continental europe have started reporting yield expansion giving more 
justification the recent rating such would argue that these stocks 
valuation discount more perception than reality 
gdp growth and tax reform also highlight gdp growth and 
consumer strength key factor for the bounce this year indeed retailers have 
significantly outperformed class mall reits over the past several years while 
remain cautious think the market pricing potential for reacceleration 
growth for class mall reits which different than europe

what our position european retail reits 
retail property stocks have all rated similar way the main stocks nav 
valuation has been eroded similar way during the last three years exhibit and 
recent weeks this has accelerated 
yet reported rental growth remains strong investor sentiment towards retail reits has 
deteriorated materially recent years yet like for like rental growth reported most 
these reits remains line with longer term averages france sweden has 
been improving spain italy netherlands see exhibit 
and dividend yields are high retail landlords are offering high and continental 
europe also rising earnings and dividend yields many the highest dividend 
yielders our coverage universe are shopping centre reits see exhibit 
what new property valuation yields have started expanding values have started 
falling the intu shopping centre yields moved out much basis points 
during but this not just intu specific issue also for other property companies 
have seen evidence sharp moves yields bluewater shopping centre 
managed landsec being revalued down the six months march 
valuers moving initial yield approach intu chairman commented during its that 
the valuers have started moving initial rather than equivalent yields other words 
the valuers are effectively starting ignore the perceived upside potential from leasing 
vacant space and capturing reversionary potential think intu more risk 
this given the wider equivalent yield spread over initial yields exhibit but this 
risk for all retail exposed names and comes top the likely widening initial yields 
typically continental yields follow the history suggests that and continental 
european shopping centres valuation yields move more often than not similar 
directions see exhibit acknowledge that most continental europe facing 
retail pressures that are less severe than those the experiencing and reflect 
this the extent which assume yields move out but think would unlikely 
continental european valuation yields can remain flat this environment anecdotal 
evidence and management commentary points material deterioration shopping 
centre liquidity france the nordics and cee 
could earnings yields provide support triangulating earnings total return and likely 
stock valuation show that based our assumptions for total return growth 
nav plus cash dps portion nav these stocks justifiably trade wide nav 
discounts exhibit admittedly such total return picture predicated flat todown navs are assuming yields drifting higher other words yields hold firm 
these stocks could should trade tighter 
remain cautious not cover the entire retail property landlord spectrum but 
have overweight rated retail property focused stock our coverage are

what our position mall reits 
bottom line sentiment mall reits has improved but our dcf analysis reveals 
cash generation weaker than headline metrics suggest remain cautious the 
subsector wait further confirmation that the worst store closure are behind 
and inflection growth sustainable rank our preferences 
wild ride for malls reits year ago published mall jenga and companion 
report the devil the free cash flow details moving tco stocks rallied 
couple months later headlines emerged see malls gone and big 
debates but faltered early investor conviction was tested see what next 
for mall reits valuations have recently increased retail sentiment improved and 
treasury rates declined 
the devil the details ytd performance mall reits have posted total returns 
ytd market cap weighted basis and have rebounded from being one the 
worst performing reit sectors this year total returns over the past months are 
however the performance not bullish may seem the surface given 
that driven primarily simon property group spg market cap stock that 
has posted total returns over the past months and ytd indeed average 
total returns for malls are over the past months and ytd basis 
are they rich cheap vol increases there growing debate the stocks are rich 
cheap there are variety valuation metrics and don dismiss the macro factors 
quant funds become more involved see more reits than rates introducing reit 
quant model but focus discounted cash flow analysis provides 
transparency reits that are best positioned our mark market our prior 
analysis offers the following insights and rankings 
simon property group spg beat our expectations aided cash received 
from the klepierre dividend and the aventura mall refinancing expect the most 
predictable future fcf growth even lower our future projections debate 
centers around what the price the stock with implied terminal growth rising 
capex key input that model operating 
cash flow 
macerich mac exceeded expectations but not bullish seems 
leverage increased and div payout ratio rose reduce our forward projections 
and remains the most expensive stock our coverage with implied terminal 
growth 
taubman tco missed expectations even operating metrics showed 
signs inflection lower our future growth assumptions and the stock still 
screens fundamentally expensive with implied terminal growth however 
the election activist investor the board and the board seats for 
renewal may the focus and primer driver the recent 
outperformance 
cbl associates cbl met our conservative expectations but lower 
future projections given continued headwinds implied terminal growth stands following fall the stock price since the primary debate how 
much div cut necessary order have adequate cash invest assets 
expect dividend cut
