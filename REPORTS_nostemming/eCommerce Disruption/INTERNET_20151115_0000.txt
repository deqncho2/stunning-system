airbnb traveler penetration already headed our 
alphawise survey suggests that leisure and business travelers have 
used airbnb least once with penetration expected rise for both groups 
next year for leisure and for business while this could suggest 
most airbnb impact has already been felt see room for more gains for 
both because users are satisfied and because only our survey 
sample currently aware the service among our sample group that 
aware airbnb them have tried 
surprisingly airbnb users skew wealthier though price matters most 
surprisingly our survey also shows that airbnb users skew wealthier than 
non airbnb travelers with airbnb users earning over 
year this our view contradicts the popular belief that airbnb users 
are largely college students millennials and individuals with lower incomes 
that said our survey shows price the primary reason for using airbnb 
these data suggest that the service could have broader appeal 
less than half airbnb demand coming the expense traditional 
hotels our survey shows that only airbnb users are substituting away 
from traditional hotels switch from bed breakfasts are using 
airbnb rather than staying with friends and family and are using airbnb 
over vacation rentals this combined with the fact that only airbnb users 
stay night for traditional hotels speaks how airbnb for now 
primarily focused non hotel leisure longer duration stays rather 
than corporate single night stays believe corporate travel will continue 
more difficult for airbnb penetrate given safety and privacy concerns 
holding back adoption and the higher importance corporate travelers place 
amenities loyalty programs business centers restaurants etc 
remain bullish the hotel group heavy corporate travel mix 
insulates airbnb cannibalization risk the differences between leisure and 
corporate travelers matter given the major hotel groups corporate heavy 
bookings mix business from corporate demand our survey shows 
how airbnb leisure use growing faster ntm increase than

airbnb and its disruptive model have become top mind for investors both the lodging hotel and online 
travel sectors yet our view current consensus investor sentiment that airbnb material threat the

key debate how big airbnb and who using 
market view 
airbnb small but growing platform for booking leisure accommodations online mainly used 
college students millennials and lower income travelers while corporate travel remains opportunity 
for airbnb 
our view 
our alphawise survey data indicates airbnb has already been used both leisure and corporate 
travelers this may seem high now but airbnb awareness still low less than survey 
respondents had heard airbnb which speaks its potential forward growth opportunity awareness 
safety and privacy are concerns the long term pace adoption while the majority respondents 
booked airbnb for its lower prices airbnb users skewed wealthier the and germany 
where could wrong 
our user penetration data not take into account share wallet those indicating they used airbnb 
may have only used the platform one time this penetration could just speak experimentation 
rather than recurring use 
airbnb travel penetration already expected rise over the next year 
our alphawise survey data suggest that airbnb has already been used least once double digit 
percentage leisure and business travelers all leisure and business travelers have used airbnb 
least once over the past months use expected rise further with leisure user adoption expected 
increase over the next months and business user adoption expected rise 
these data speak current and rising airbnb experimentation across both traveler cohorts but 
important remember that these metrics not represent share wallet travelers responding 
yes may have only used airbnb one time going forward user adoption and trends around frequency use 
will particularly important monitor travelers expect use airbnb the next 
months and already this could suggest meaningful share airbnb impact 
has already been fel however expect see continued traveler experimentation and adoption such that 
these levels increase 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
exhibit according our alphawise survey leisure and corporate travelers have used airbnb 
the last months with both expected rise over the next months 
question please indicate which the following channels you have used plan use for booking your trip 
when traveling for leisure business the following periods 
rce alp ise rgan stan ley research 
but respondent awareness still under speaking adoption opportunity 
low double digit penetration rate may seem high but important note that only overall survey 
respondents had heard airbnb see exhibit shown the awareness ranged from with 
germany the lowest and france the highest this our view speaks airbnb growth opportunity 
awareness continues rising user penetration with only brand awareness implies that 
travelers who know about airbnb have tried the service least once would argue this relatively 
high given this physical product with emotional attachment where the user renting someone else 
property home usually for least several days stepping back user penetration probably never going 
high for airbnb for short taxi rides with uber for other lower touch services like using social media

rce alp ise rgan stan ley research 
and user satis faction over 
airbnb users our survey were satisfied too with airbnb users responding that they were satisfied 
with the experience and over half were very satisfied only airbnb users were not satisfied 
are admittedly bit surprised this high satisfaction given various negative press reports about airbnb user 
stories and even the emergence websites like airbnbhell also seems little inconsistent with 
surprisingly low repeat rate from our survey with only existing airbnb leisure users expecting use 
the next months that said satisfaction stays this high believe will likely lead repeat use 
which our view speaks the opportunity for airbnb continue grow share travelers 
wallets with its growing user base

experience 
question please rate your experience with using airbnb 
rce alp ise rgan stan ley research 
that said increasing awareness and overcoming privacy and safety concerns will critical 
driving forward growth and adoption 
the top reasons why people our survey are not using airbnb are lack awareness privacy concerns 
and safety concerns said another way people who have not used airbnb our survey had 
never heard the site awareness can grow over time with increased advertising and availability etc but 
our view the privacy and safety concerns may bigger challenges long term growth given airbnb 
social sharing model this particularly important for corporate users whose travel managers need 
have safety and regulations mind this matches the results our recent corporate travel survey where 
corporate travel managers claimed have already used airbnb business travel those who had 
not used were very unlikely use were somewhat likely and none very likely 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
exhibit awareness privacy and safety were the main reasons why respondents did not use airbnb 
question you stated you have not used airbnb and not plan please indicate the main reasons below

price the most important factor driving airbnb use 
price was the most important factor for consumers when deciding use airbnb all respondents who 
either used plan use airbnb said that price was one the most important factors that led them use

internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
exhibit price the most important factor leading airbnb use 
question what are the most important factors that led you use airbnb 
rce alp ise rgan stan ley 
this not surprising given that our estimates airbnb global average daily rate adr anywhere from 
lower than the regional hotel adrs see exhibit note too that airbnb large amount lowercost inventory large cities where hotel adrs are even higher likely make this price differential even 
more pronounced

not just college kids airbnb users skew wealthier the germany and the

key debate where airbnb demand coming from 
market view 
airbnb mainly taking demand from traditional hotels rather than creating new demand and growing 
the total traveler pie 
our view 
less than half airbnb demand coming the expense traditional hotels airbnb also 
replacing other non traditional accommodations like bed breakfasts vacation rentals and stays with 
friends family the last segments make around overnight accommodation and are thus 
bigger than hotels moreover airbnb under indexes single night stays and the average length stay 
for airbnb user much longer than that hotel user only airbnb users stay for night 
which compares with hotel users which indicates airbnb for now primarily focused 
the non hotel leisure longer duration stay segments than the traditional hotel and corporate singlenight stay segment 
true that airbnb incremental demand creation appears limited this time our alphawise data 
indicates only respondents would not have traveled not for airbnb though substitution away 
from stays with friend and family debateable 
where could wrong 
airbnb adoption increases and the product becomes more mainstream especially the corporate 
travel side airbnb cannibalization traditional hotels could materially higher long term 
less than half airbnb demand coming from hotels although this may growing 
are often asked investors whether airbnb cannibalizing traditional hotel demand whether 
growing the total traveler pie the market view seems that mainly taking share from hotels 
however our survey respondents said that usage replaced bed breakfasts replaced staying with 
friends family and replaced staying traditional hotel these are not mutually exclusive answers hence 
hotel replacement actually seems under see exhibit acknowledge that airbnb hotel 
cannibalization expected rise based our alphawise survey which something worth 
monitoring but this our view still less than general market perception 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
exhibit airbnb users replace variety other accommodations with less than half coming from hotels 
question you stated that you have used airbnb the past months which the following 
accommodation alternatives did replace select all that apply 
rce alp ise rgan stan ley research 
this makes sense there little evidence recent hotel data earnings results alternative 
accommodation channels having impa revpar revenue per available room revpar 
grew september and str preliminary data suggests october and europe and 
the september see exhibit moreover analyzed our recent report lodging airbnb 
impact hotels being overstated sep there have been twice many compression nights 
occupancy nights year date top lodging markets than all before airbnb 
was founded and more than annualized when was smaller company with the average 
rate premium still addition show exhibit that hotels make average only

further only airbnb users stay for night which compares with hotel users see exhibit 
this matches other data from eurostat see exhibit suggesting only overnight stays are for less 
than nights this area that hotels play but less airbnb seems hence airbnb seems more 
focused the non hotel leisure longer duration stay segments than the traditional hotel and 
corporate single night stay segment this not say the mix airbnb average length stays won and 
can evolve over time but for now don see majority their demand cannibalizing traditional hotels 
exhibit airbnb less focused single night stays which where hoteliers are focused with their 
corporate demand 
question when you booked airbnb stayed traditional hotel how many nights did you stay 
rce alp ise rgan stan ley research 
notable that the branded hotel cannibalization was higher the than europe with over 
airbnb users expected use airbnb rather than traditional hotel over the next months see 
exhibit that said airbnb cannibalization bed and breakfast demand was higher europe with 
european airbnb users saying they intend use airbnb rather than staying bed and breakfast over the next 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
months see exhibit this not surprising given the differences hotel room supply characteristics 
between the continents with hotel inventory from chain hotels compared only

frequently but not mostly nor exclusively coming the expense traditional accommodations providers

internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
exhibit while airbnb cannibalization europe having larger impact bed and breakfasts

airbnb doesn seem creating significant new travel demand 
our alphawise data see exhibit also show that the fully incremental airbnb travel demand limited 
with only users saying they would not have taken the trip without airbnb that said one could 
argue that paying airbnb travelers who are choosing stay airbnb unit rather than with friends family 
presumably free charge one way airbnb growing the travel expenditure pie

note too that the cannibalization away from vacation rentals and homeaway for now only 
this marks distinction between homeaway and airbnb current offerings type inventory travelers are 
looking for average length stay etc our view this positive data point for homeaway will 
important monitor this over time airbnb believe looks grow into more locations outside the 
major cities and homeaway works increase its urban offerings which cited one the factors behind 
its pending sale expedia 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
key debate how big competitive threat airbnb hotels 
market view 
airbnb material threat airbnb will gain most its market share the expense traditional hotels 
further since airbnb mainly used college students and millennials airbnb future impact could 
materially larger these users may stay with the sharing economy and therefore not book traditional 
hotel rooms frequently their current user base 
our view 
our survey data show that less than airbnb demand coming the expense traditional hotel 
demand this combined with the fact that only airbnb users stay night for traditional 
hotels speaks how airbnb for now primarily focused non hotel leisure longer duration stays 
rather than corporate single night stay segments the large hotels also over index toward corporate 
demand bookings which our alphawise data suggests will continue slower for airbnb 
penetrate given users safety and privacy concerns well the high importance corporate travelers 
place amenities business centers restaurants loyalty programs etc such expect airbnb

sizing airbnb addressable and european markets

what airbnb strategy china 
airbnb officially entered the chinese market august the company has created localized 
platform and focused china growing outbound travel demand according the company 
outbound travel from chinese guests through airbnb has grown the past year making 
airbnb fastest growing outbound market addition its focus chinese tourists traveling abroad 
people china are also starting sign host international tourists and domestic travelers 
believe airbnb impact hotels china will limited the near term luxury hotel operators 
talked china believe airbnb will not threat high end hotels they target different customer 
segments this substantiated survey data from penguin intelligence operated tencent 
which indicates that only people are willing pay more than per night for short term 
vacation rentals versus the average adr star hotels china economy hotel operators 
also believe that airbnb will have limited impact their businesses the near term believing that 
chinese people are less likely rent strangers creating further barrier for accommodation sharing 
models like airbnb addition the survey data from penguin intelligence show that over chinese 
users will use short term rentals for stays least days and only them will consider shortterm rentals for stays under days suggesting the short term rental model targeting different 
demand than traditional hotels this consistent with our alphawise findings the and europe 
also believe safety and credit will barriers airbnb ability grow china unlike the and 
europe china does not have personal credit system place yet which likely hinder the 
willingness from both property owners and users use airbnb sharing model believe airbnb 
likely face high regulatory hurdles china too similar what uber facing now 
airbnb also faces unique competitors china 
note too that china short term rental companies like tujia and xiao zhu duan have different 
business models than airbnb these companies are adopting asset heavy strategies collaborating with 
property developers and agents and hiring people offline perform sanitation work and cleaning 
believe the companies are doing this meet the unique cultural differences and traveler demands 
china speaking the commonalities across the regions though notable that only tujia 
users are leisure travelers again highlighting that these models over index toward leisure demand and 
the higher hurdles corporate travel 
but how many users could airbnb grow and how many room nights would that mean 
but that only and the bigger question for the hotel group and online travel agency earnings power and 
appropriate multiple what happens over the next years airbnb awareness and adoption potentially 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
grow airbnb ability grow its awareness and overcome safety and privacy concerns will 
important driving user adoption user adoption will drive room night growth will airbnb ability 
grow share travelers wallets from the current nights per user per year 
one way analyze airbnb user opportunity look the adoption other major travel sites shown 
exhibit our alphawise survey shows that people that travel use online travel agencies and 
hotels website this more than the that are currently using airbnb don see airbnb reaching 
this level adoption given the privacy concerns safety issues and differences core product discussed 
above that said see adoption rising over time looking the data further also notable that 
homeaway and other vacation rental sites even after years homeaway existence only have 
user penetration this our view speaks the potential niche ness the non hotel accommodation 
space that could hold back airbnb user adoption

some airbnb bulls may argue that airbnb social nature could make into platform story like facebook 
twitter with and internet user penetration respectively but argue that travel sites and their 
user bases are more apples apples comparisons based airbnb business airbnb also physical 
offering with emotional attachment where the user renting someone else property home usually for

exhibit airbnb average annual bull bear base scenario analysis 
rce data rgan stan ley research 
getting into the details our current forecasts call for blended occupancy the and europe 
rising and see occupancy peaking the and 
europe combined peak assuming room rate growth gives revpar growth 
and thereafter 
our base case for airbnb penetration increase per our survey this would imply 
higher penetration usage doubled assume the penetration growth decelerates 
every year but still grows this implies room nights from level 
this would mean hotel industry occupancy continues grow but slower rate and peaks rather 
than year less lodging stock outperformance but still ways away our airbnb base case 
average annualized impact off occupancy growth and off revpar growth this not 
immaterial but would certainly much better outcome than many investors seem expect our 
airbnb base case would yield cumulative negative occupancy impact with slower 
revpar growth total the impact would smaller still adjusted for airbnb lower corporate mix 
our airbnb bull case penetration would have modestly larger impact the hotel industry with 
average annualized occupancy growth lower and annual revpar growth slower this would likely 
more bearish outcome for the hotel group whole note that our analysis looks only the impact 
airbnb have not assumed any changes the hotel cycle beyond order isolate the airbnb effect 
more simplistic back the envelope way thinking about airbnb expected grow from 
estimated room nights estimated this year let say doubles again adding another 
room nights and that those come from hotels additional hotel stock equivalent room 
nights there are around hotel rooms globally which occupancy around room 
nights hence this suggests airbnb would take total hotel demand away doubles over two years 
from here off annual hotel occupancy which close our bear case scenario

the hotel groups corporate business shields them from airbnb extent 
the hotel cannibalization admittedly important factor this model and such important bear 
mind that the traditional hotels our view have business mix that relatively more shielded 
from airbnb that the traditional hotels over index toward corporate travel roughly the groups 
business from corporate travel and while business travelers our survey have tried airbnb still 
question the pace which airbnb will able ramp its corporate business given believe the importance 
corporate travelers place convenience amenities business centers loyalty programs etc hotel pricing may 
impacted airbnb material incremental supply creation detailed below but general don 
believe airbnb will direct material headwind long term hotel group demand unless the 
company can overcome its privacy and safety concerns and drive faster user adoption share 
wallet growth and airbnb able materially penetrate the corporate travel business 
increased airbnb user frequency will important monitor 
while the scenarios above assume room nights per user per year remain steady notable that airbnb 
can increase its user adoption while also materially growing its share wallet more room nights per user per 
year its disruptive impact would likely larger indeed shown the sensitivity table below see exhibit 
airbnb could grow anywhere from room nights the and europe over time 
frequency picks assuming base case airbnb penetration given airbnb user satisfaction this 
indeed trend worth monitoring

when should the hotels get worried about incremental supply from airbnb 
supply owth over trigger point for hotels our charts show the relationship between supply

correlates with positive trend occupancy and revpar growth similarly the fall supply growth

occupancy growth key for hotel share price 
performance demand and occupancy are indeed the 
critical factor for hotel stocks hotel stocks have 
outperformed the the last 
years tending trade peak multiples peak 
earnings and tending outperform while 
rce str mkg data rgan stan ley 
research 
occupancy rising have looked hotel 
performance relative the and found that 
the cycle lodging stocks peaked months after occupancy had peaked and the cycle this was 
months this trailing month basis meaning there are additional months between when 
actually start seeing occupancy declines the monthly data have not seen any occupancy declines yet 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
once start seeing them the earliest months away think then could still 
year until start see stocks underperform therefore think hotel stocks have least another 
two years outperformance come have also found that stocks tend outperform when revpar 
accelerates which happened occupancy has just reached above the peaks the last two 
hotel cycles however think historical occupancy peaks are not necessarily caps today environment 
supply growth still very low historical standards ltm versus when occupancy peaked 
previous cycles demand also growing well above supply growth and occupancy rates are 
much lower than other developed markets therefore think occupancy can continue grow for two more 
years suggesting hotel stocks can still perform 
exhibit hotel stocks tend outperform when occupancy rising and underperform around months 
after occupancy peaks this cycle occupancy above the last two cycles but continues grow

could airbnb actually benefit for hotels 
while most investors speak with view airbnb competitive threat hotels argue that there 
are scenarios which airbnb could actually benefit the hotel industry can see three possible gains 
that could offset some all the headwinds detailed above 
airbnb could allow hotels list its site which could bring down hotel distribution ota 
commission rates currently the large listed hotel operators sell their inventory through otas for 
commission rates that estimate are the range airbnb sold hotels its site would arguably 
have superior consumer platform than the otas offering both its unique non hotel inventory well 
standard hotel inventory see other commerce businesses like priceline and amazon among others 
more selection often leads higher traffic conversion this could theoretically increase airbnb user 
monetization well for the hotels airbnb standard host fee would represent material savings traffic 
and customer acquisition costs and give the hotels more bargaining leverage over the online travel agencies 
internet lodging leisure and hotels november 
airbnb highlighting many the services that hotels offer but are perhaps taken for granted 
travelers hotels have abide health and safety regulations covering everything from fire protection 
sprinkler systems fire exits extinguishers fire resistant furnishings etc security cctv electronic door 
locks they also tend offer trained hospitality staff have strict cleaning requirements for the bedrooms and 
many offer lobbies bars restaurants and health facilities many offer loyalty schemes while staying 
someone home may have the advantage more authentic local experience hotels offer many 
amenities that airbnb hosts may find hard replicate 
airbnb could increasing the overall travel market while only our alphawise survey users said 
they would not have taken the trip without airbnb one could argue that paying airbnb travelers who are 
choosing stay airbnb unit rather than with the who said they would have stayed with friends and 
family presumably free charge one way airbnb growing the travel expenditure pie indeed response 
recent report airbnb impact new york city hotels airbnb spokesman said was based the 
false assumption that its guests would have otherwise stayed hotel room fact without airbnb many 
these travelers wouldn able visit new york city all would have cut their trip short bloomberg

key debate how big competitive threat airbnb otas 
market view 
airbnb not going negatively impact the otas airbnb largely creating incremental travel demand 
and expanding the online travel addressable market anything airbnb will larger competitive 
threat the traditional hotels than the otas this could lead weaker hotel industry which would 
positive for the otas hotels would become more reliant otas fill their room nights 
our view 
arbnb competitive threat the otas larger than that faced hotels first the more hotel demand 
airbnb cannibalizes impacting occupancy and revpar the harder will the otas second the 
fact that the otas over index toward leisure expedia priceline bookings from leisure demand 
puts them more direct competition with airbnb airbnb cannibalization non hotel categories like 
bed and breakfasts and vacation rentals further impacts ota demand 
the otas have posted strong room night growth even airbnb has ramped but longer term 
see these players competing more directly for online travelers wallets indeed even only 
airbnb long term room nights come the expense otas would lead downward 
revision our long term ota room night forecasts 
see further long term ota risk airbnb ever decides allow the traditional hotels list its site 
where could wrong 
the overall online travel pie could grow faster over the long term and the otas may not compete with 
airbnb addition both priceline and expedia have been building out their inventory non hotel 
accommodations bed breakfasts chalets apartments etc priceline has been adding non hotel 
inventory its booking site and has created stand alone site villas for booking non hotel 
accommodations expedia has recently announced its intention purchase homeaway one the 
largest global platforms for finding and booking vacation rental properties this greater diversification 
makes the otas stronger competitors against airbnb 
see airbnb bigger competitive threat the otas than the hotels 
airbnb competitive threat the otas multifaceted first with the hotels airbnb competitive threat 
the online travel agencies will dependent airbnb user penetration and frequency use 
see exhibit the more hotel demand airbnb cannibalizes impacting occupancy and revpar the harder 
will the otas given their dependency strong hotel market for growth see exhibit and exhibit

ota bulls may counter that weaker hotel industry because airbnb would positive for the 
otas hotels would become more reliant otas and have seen other cyclical downturns give 
them more rooms lower commission rates don necessarily believe this would the case this 
assumes the otas are able give the hotels the demand they need that they are not being cannibalized 
airbnb and that airbnb does not allow the hotels list their properties the site 
addition believe that airbnb demand cannibalization risk otas likely higher than that the 
traditional hotels given the otas have heavier mix leisure business estimate expedia and 
priceline total bookings are leisure and the otas serve multiple categories accommodations hotels 
bed and breakfasts vacation rentals etc that airbnb cannibalizing see exhibit this particularly true 
for priceline and its core booking business especially europe

looking things another way exhibit assume that our base case airbnb room 
nights come the expense otas would shave off our estimated long term total ota leisure

what airbnb allows the hotels its platform 
addition believe that airbnb ever begins allowing hotels list their inventory its site will 
incremental negative for otas airbnb would offer lower cost rapidly growing distribution 
alternative shown exhibit airbnb current host commission rate less than expedia and 
priceline this means that even airbnb tripled its commission rate for hotels going from would 
create new channel that less expensive than the otas addition airbnb charged the hotels 
higher fee than does other properties would give the company more flexibility reduce its current 
consumer booking fees ranging from which our view would likely required the company 
hopes encourage consumers book standard hotels available book without consumer fee elsewhere 
for airbnb adding hotels its platform would positive would lead increased selection 
across multiple types inventory make airbnb into more full service online travel 
platform and likely lead higher user conversion and user monetization see with other 
industry players like priceline expedia and amazon the online travel pie only large and just are 
seeing expedia and priceline diversify into new accommodation categories like vacation rentals over time 
expect see airbnb offer hotels and other unique offerings like the recently announced airbnb experiences 
that will bring them into more direct competition with the otas
