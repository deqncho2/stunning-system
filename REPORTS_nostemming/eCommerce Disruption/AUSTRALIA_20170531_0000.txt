amazon impact australian retailers 
amazon entry australia will have profound impact the 
australian retailing industry our view has had most 
markets the details its further expansion are unclear 
how assess the impact amazon will 
have the australian retail market 
category rollout pricing strategy prime offer distribution centre 
network etc but because investors grant very long investment 
assessing the impact amazon the australian retailers little 
time horizon can offer attractive customer proposition the 
fraught this early stage that because pricing ranging and the 
australian retail market should attractive amazon given high 
prime offer all significant drivers its success offshore markets 
disposable income high internet smartphone penetration 
aren yet known but given the success amazon has had other 
population concentration three cities have the 
markets think fair assume that when arrives australia 
population and relatively underdeveloped online retail market 
the offer will very competitive believe that amazon won 
that said the cost distribution likely far higher than many 
rebase prices australia based our analysis australian retail 
international markets given relatively low population densities and 
prices aren all that much higher than those other developed 
high labour costs also amazon has few existing distribution assets 
markets exhibit the impact retailers will more share 
that can leverage 
loss and ensuing operating deleverage consumers prefer the ease 
ordering amazon with one two day delivery offered for free 
have found the initial reaction amazon entry which think 
under amazon prime 
was well before the april announcement fascinating since 
october two weeks before the now infamous australian

retailers significant portion what food retailers sell

three product categories electrical general merchandise

perishable greater health awareness and focus product 
quality are leading consumers purchase more fresh food 
the expense dry grocery products fresh food products are 
perishable and often require chilled distribution which 
see number reasons that food retailers face little impact from

forecast that amazon can attain the australian non food

this would equate sales per sqm sqm should

higher international markets

amazon share across european markets far lower than 
department stores have signed long leases department 
the why because europeans tend buy less apparel 
stores australia have the past been seen blue chip 
department stores and more specialists hence when 
tenant for landlords effectively anchoring the mall they 
learned that australians purchase higher share apparel 
guarantee customer traffic for this reason they have been 
from department stores than americans gave cause for 
offered very attractive rents sign long term leases for 
concern 
instance have sighted big leases that expire late 
department store chains even though two are currently 
generating losses can close stores because the australian 
exhibit 
australians purchase higher share apparel sales from department 
stores than people other developed countries 
chains lease almost their store network operate 
with must trade clauses and have sound balance sheets 
very difficult for them close stores elsewhere retailers 
own their own real estate and individual store becomes 
unprofitable marginal then the retailer can close the store 
and divest the property thereby improving profitability for 
the rest the network because australian retailers 
generally lease stores this option unavailable them

think kmart has the most lose from 
amazon arrival why 
has very low average sale value the average purchase 
sells commodity products kmart has been very clear its 
made kmart far lower than other retailers 
strategy delist brands and promote own sourced private 
estimate that would this means that 
label product this generates very high margins but also 
uneconomic for physical retailer ship these goods 
means that the products aren unique and are highly 
profitably when amazon launches prime australia 
commoditised part kmart success our view that 
think that consumers will purchase these products online 
buys far more per sku basis its domestic peers 
rather than going into stores given the ease purchase 
amazon along with its marketplace business would buy 
free delivery and one two day delivery 
multiple the volume that kmart buys our view 
generates very high overall profitability kmart 
kmart has relatively narrow range another strategy that 
profitable the rest the department store segment 
kmart has employed with great success reducing its range 
combined see exhibit and easily the most profitable 
pushing more volume through narrower range has 
non food retailer that cover its margins are high 
improved its buying terms improve value the customer 
virtually any basis compared with domestic and international 
the drawback that customers like range especially when 
retailers 
the range significantly higher than the status quo amazon 
offers very little service retailers that offer high service 
levels high end fashion home improvement have faced 
range likely far exceed that any physical department 
store 
limited impact from amazon because customers don 
exactly know what they are buying when they walk into the 
store that they rely the sales staff help them 
discover which handbag works best with which outfit how 
solve problem the backyard kmart staff don 
actually sell rather they show where products are sold and 
take orders 
morgan stanley research 
the outlook for department store 
profitability kmart australia 
arguably execution improves because the retailer can focus fewer 
there notable difference between the retail market australia 
however when retailers lease all their stores the australian 
and that other developed markets like the and the because 
department stores there are store closures because the 
the success malls stores are virtually all leased see this 
department stores have entered into very long leases years 
potentially huge problem for the department store segment 
plus most cases the retailers need wait long time close 
australia when retailers own stores that are marginal 
stores are also aware that because the department stores are 
loss making the remedy fairly straightforward close the stores 
anchor tenants the landlords force the retailer agree must 
this has two impacts 
trade clause which basically means the retailer must have the 
stores likely that few competitors are the same boat 
everyone closes stores which supports the industry profitability 
doors open 
subject the amount overhead cost the store was 
supporting the retail network whole makes more money 
hence think very unlikely that much needed capacity will 
portion the sales from the closed store shifts existing 
withdrawn from the department store category because 
stores making those stores more profitable 
stores can closed and bankruptcy isn option since the 
owners the department stores are well capitalised think

and jbh offer specialised product with far more range than 
the department stores the department stores continue 
focus more apparel and move away from specialised 
categories like auto electronics and sports equipment 
think share will continue shift the specialists 
category specialists are more likely receive exclusive 
products not sold amazon commoditised products tend 
sell better online while suppliers are likely offer this 
amazon believe that when suppliers are looking 
distribute market leading innovative products they are 
likely partner with specialist given the service and 
positioning that category specialist can provide they are 
more likely receive high end products that provide 
differentiated offer 
some products don ship easily not all non food products 
ship easily for instance flat panel tvs oils auto parts 
further think products that have high monetary value 
require advice before buying are more likely 
purchased store opposed online

categories which our retailers operate assume 
launch its marketplace business which expect take share 
amazon takes the department store category 
predominantly from ebay rather than existing retailers see the 
the existing market share that our retailers generate big 
inevitable launch party where amazon sells and distributes its 
has the department store market 
own products and then prime over the coming five years having 
market share movements outside amazon coles
