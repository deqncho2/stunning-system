what are walmart and target doing online grocery 
two companies within the hardline broadline retail space have significant exposure the grocery category 
walmart and target food represents wmt sales and tgt sales these retailers are 
approaching the category from different perspectives walmart focused the commerce delivery 
aspect groceries while target aiming improve its store offering 
walmart trying figure out ways make the supermarket experience more convenient the company has 
the footprint distribution capabilities supply chain and appears willing make investments win the 
grocery delivery space walmart aggressively pursuing stay ahead the curve grocery delivery 
wmt recent october analyst meeting the company announced further roll out online grocery 
shopping with free pickup additional markets bringing the total markets significant 
portion increased investments are geared towards supporting this initiative importantly the company has 
seen early success the denver market the last six months grocery pickup customers are new 
walmart estimate walmart share the food market important note don believe 
there high overlap between the amazon prime customer and the walmart shopper therefore think the 
threat from delivery relatively minor think the more immediate challenge for walmart the growth 
smaller formats food retail which offer greater convenience and low prices 
target food offering the other hand not complete robust walmart grocery 
represents sales and target has market share target operates super target stores with 
full supermarket offering and discount stores with enhanced food offerings through its fresh 
initiative target the planning phases rolling out changes its food business it unclear how much will 
change but know the company focused their natural organic assortment given target lower mix 
grocery which also implies smaller group loyal supermarket shoppers don think target prepared 
make the same commerce delivery investments that walmart pursuing that said think target 
overlap with amazon prime higher than walmart given target slightly higher income consumer therefore 
while also see minor risk target would characterize slightly greater than walmart exposure

online grocery europe 
the online segment becoming mainstream grocery from penetration has already 
risen close see exhibit according market research firm mintel but backed the encouraging 
results from our alphawise survey forecast the category grow cagr over the next decade 
average for the overall grocery industry far the grocery category remains anomaly when 
comes online despite accounting for roughly half all retail sales the only accounts for 
online retail sales 
today the all the national players offer online proposition unique feature online 
grocery that more than the market home delivery grocers typically offer variable delivery charges 
depending the time the day varying from depending the grocer with minimum basket size 
typically and most offer annual delivery passes allowing unlimited deliveries for typical annual 
charge with minimum basket size for each order 
but now that virtually all the major players have its own online offer online sales have become zero sum game 
for the incumbents whole situation very different from when tesco was the only player offering 
products online and hence sales generated online were incremental the business the issue that this zero 
sum game the industry level entails higher costs for the operators which now offer the picking and delivery 
services for low fee have little doubt that the incumbents are heavily subsidizing their online businesses 
the today but interestingly paradoxically rather they have done even more over the past two years 
via vouchering and slashing the average delivery fee even when the profitability their offline business has 
global ecommerce january 
come under severe pressure 
the only other european market where online grocery mass market france where kantar data 
suggests has accounted for the market its current form online grocery france started 
june when private player auchan sales introduced drive through service allowing 
customers order online and pick the collated orders generally less than two hours after much 
faster than what home delivery typically offers the service proved remarkably popular and was subsequently 
copied other french grocery retailers including leclerc carrefour and casino and september 
there were drive outlets france more than the rest the world combined some these units 
generate annual sales exceeding more than standalone typical supermarket 
exhibit online grocery should continue 
gain significant share both the and france

rce kan tar rldp rrester rgan stan ley research 
exhibit the hypermarket format the most 
structurally challenged the channel shift 
source company data morgan stanley research 
note hypermarkets are defined stores exceeding 
selling space and where non food accounts for more than 
sales 
other european markets online grocery remains 
marginal market share however note 
signs acceleration markets such sweden 
belgium and germany see exhibit these 
immature markets home delivery and click collect 
models coexist combined sometimes with menu 
subscription models such sweden 
who could the winners and losers this 
channel shift among european grocers 
would argue that determining the potential 
vulnerability each business channel shift primarily comes down one thing store format the 
hypermarket format which has been the preferred growth vehicle for some the largest food retailers 
europe over the past years such tesco carrefour see exhibit seems the most vulnerable this 
channel shift this due four reasons online penetration non food has already resulted significant 
decline the profitability the category and the pressure set continue for instance the despite 
penetration already being the highest the world non food sales online continue grow the high single 
digits hypermarkets poor location typically the outskirts cities far away from shoppers home which 
reinforces the convenience shopping online iii the typical hypermarket shopper larger households and 
higher average basket the most prone move online online shopping significantly reduces impulse 
buying thanks which lot hypermarket gross margin generated 
global ecommerce january 
most vulnerable grocery online picking are tesco and carrefour and somehow 
lesser extent casino all three these players have expanded online course for example tesco the 
market leader the close market share the channel and online sales account for approx 
its total sales fuel although this helps generates economies scale and provides exposure 
segment growing double digits think the retailer faces bit catch situation online grocery proves 
superior business model retail grocery then tesco significant invested capital base retail 
grocery could see its value erode materially offline retail becomes suboptimal model but the 
contrary tesco does not cover its cost capital online with incumbents continuing subsidize this growing 
channel then tesco exposure the channel also indicates scope for value destruction 
best positioned benefit from this channel shift are leading online grocery pureplayer ocado 
well hard soft discounters jeronimo martins and dia the former the leading online 
grocery pure player and most efficient operator the segment also capable licensing its proprietary online 
fulfillment solution third party grocers internationally the latter jeronimo martins dia have minimal nonfood sales their total sales and virtue the fact that they have discount positioning they are 
largely insulated from the threat online grocery 
the middle players that are not overly affected the expansion online grocery would include 
companies such ahold and colruyt 
online grocery japan 
grocery ecommerce japan takes various forms those closely tied local communities offered offline 
stores the gms format rakuten grocery ecommerce service rakuten mart and independent ecommerce 
services specializing goods such vegetables that are still low the consumer radar despite expectations 
multidirectional move into japan amazon fresh the official launch has yet come government meti 
data also put the ratio ecommerce usage the lowest for the food beverages alcohol category 
penetration rate most though the low penetration rate implies room for growth given the 
small number providers and structural obstacles japanese society not anticipate very 
rapid expansion 
terms business models community based ecommerce pioneered gms format offline stores basically 
relates sales offline store inventory and positioned niche service partly reflecting issues with 
delivery capacity the rakuten mart grocery ecommerce service meanwhile only became available nationwide 
the end october the start phase business and independent ecommerce providers 
specializing vegetables and the like operate more than subscription business model delivering goods 
scheduled intervals 
terms delivery costs rakuten mart charges for purchases for next day deliveries 
the case community based ecommerce offered gms format offline stores delivery charges are about half 
those rakuten mart but free delivery only kicks like rakuten mart for purchases and above 
there are also restrictions delivery times such the need for advance reservations 
see combination factors that explain why japanese grocery ecommerce market penetration 
rate low one the differing social structure japan from that other developed economies social 
structure and its constituent elements wide ranging topic but one example the low ratio payments 
credit card which makes difficult establish codify commerce platforms for the broad range food items 
which make the largest single slice consumption and the relatively low ratio female participation the 
labor force offline commerce usage therefore high 
our view the key challenge and opportunity for ecommerce players will overcoming these local barriers 
and changing consumer behavior accelerate online grocery penetration 
online grocery china 
chinese consumers are shopping online for their groceries tmall and taobao over and 
global ecommerce january 
respectively amazon the third largest player online groceries china but losing share tmall and 
lesser extent taobao 
online penetration grocery and food category very low less than china and believe 
that ecommerce only minor disruptive force the grocery especially the fresh food category 
near term one the major reasons the slow development cold chain delivery infrastructure and shipping 
standards according national development and reform commission ndrc data from delivery 
fresh food via cold chain logistics for vegetable meat and aquatic products was and the total 
which the government targets increase and respectively even china achieves 
the target china would still lag developed countries such the and europe which are above 
will likely take number years before china infrastructure can ramp that the developed 
countries 
slow cold chain development china makes offline stores more valuable ecommerce and players 
seeking leverage these stores inventories our view offline stores are able leverage their offline store 
network storage and fulfillment platform for these internal and external services the future offline 
stores with competitively priced and differentiated offerings will asset the mobile commerce landscape 
however have noticed increasing investments online grocery and food category since from big 
players like alibaba tmall supermarket daojia and collaboration with yonghui supermarket offline 
retailers like sun art and online verticals like dmall yiguo received funding from alibaba and fruitday 
received funding from with relatively low penetration rate and fragmented concentration believe this 
category should see great growth potential well margin upside
