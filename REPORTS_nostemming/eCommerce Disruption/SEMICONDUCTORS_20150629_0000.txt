semiconductors china and 
global 
disruption will take several years but 
could end being significant 
beijing announced its intent support domestic semi 
industry not china first attempt breaking into this market 
but this time could different look top down china 
efforts bottom each segment where success may lie and how 
non chinese companies may benefit 
what different now 
the scope larger according local press reports china plans 
dedicate over the next five years developing semi industry 
put this perspective when china first started investing 
semiconductors the mid estimate that total 
investment was less than 
china not spreading its investments broadly but instead pushing 
for national champions the segments semis these include one 
national manufacturing champion smic one assembly subcontractor 
jcet likely local dram nand production and one semi equipment 
company and few fabless companies spreadtrum hisilicon

greater china technology semiconductors 
the goal large but simple china semiconductor ambitions are targeted 
towards areas where already dominates manufacturing and where national 
security involved 
will take several years for china disrupt new semiconductor 
markets the technology entry barriers are high most areas the 
intellectual property portfolio needs developed and the ecosystem 
incomplete today 
but disruptions notably margin risk could end being significant 
for established players and for the global chip market overall china 
previous entry into other tech markets baseband ics telecom equipment

semiconductors china and global june 
questions seek answer this report 
china making major push into semiconductors june china ministry industry and 
information technology miit announced the national integrated circuit industry promotion outline 
promote the development domestic industry since then there been slew activity china 
various acquisitions and privatizations chinese and non chinese semiconductor 
companies 
significant subsidies for and investment the domestic semiconductor industry and 
partnerships and cross licensing agreements between chinese and non chinese 
semiconductor companies 
this has prompted ask and seek answer the following questions this report 
what are china intentions and what the likelihood success this report looks the economics 
china entry into semiconductors but also the security implications what areas china most likely find 
success point 
tech products where china dominates consumption addition production 
mobile phones tvs pcs 
areas where china can dictate the standards drive domestic content lte 
wireless embedded memory for smart cards 
areas where labor cost important security concerns are immediate and entry barriers 
lower 
what are the opportunities for non chinese firms 
partnerships believe some the current challengers could tempted partner with 
china gain market share already have been doing note intel partnership with 
spreadtrum rockchip the product side and qualcomm partnership with smic 
foundry others could follow 
providers also see opportunities for companies such arm find new customers 
but down the road china takes market share will put further downside pressure 
chip asp and royalties 
equipment companies also see opportunities for semiconductor production equipment 
makers find new customers however capacity expansion could lead overcapacity 
sector that looks more robust than has ever looked terms supply demand control 
lastly several deals have been announced and think more are likely the 
way exhibit 
how can investors make money see few different ways 
picking the top players china see key difference how china invests semis 
its previous efforts led and solar now wants create national champions picking the 
top players china and sticking with them safer strategy than supporting all the 
second tier our view 
selling shovels and picks and know how believe the providers and semi 
semiconductors china and global june 
equipment vendors will benefit enabling their chinese customers eventually this may lead 
overcapacity and commoditization but that likely several years away 
china ramps its semi industry likely need engineers hardware technology 
and mentioned earlier know how and wireless likely are attractive also the 
section list global semiconductor companies with revenue contribution from china 
and also employee bases china 
semiconductors china and global june 
summary outlook for china semi industry 
china semiconductor industry has grown from billion around billion cagr 
terms revenue significantly faster than the global industry growth billion 
billion cagr but still only the total china growth has been fueled mostly chips related 
low end smartphones and tablets with companies such rockchip all winner and spreadtrum hisilicon 
subsidiary huawei has emerged very capable house supplier for apps processors custom asics and 
modems also smic took share from tsmc and umc over the past two years 
china likely continue outperforming the next few years but from small base our base case 
assumption that china can still outgrow the broader industry over the next three years this based 
existing opportunities where upside should continue 
feature phones china market share today around likely can move the 
range 
smartphones china market share for apps processors the range believe can 
move around 
driver ics china market share today less than see going the range with 
more chinese produced tvs and smartphones 
tablet processors china market share today already that likely can the 
range 
smartcards believe china will aim supply its own chips today china worldwide market 
share minuscule but see moving the range china can fill half its domestic 
demand 
foundry expect smic move into and establish market share that similar what 
has today 
power semis nxp recently announced china and expected lead more chinamanufactured power discretes with around market share 
added together this would imply incremental opportunity billion the next three years these 
initiatives are positive for the china and for the chinese companies involved but not necessarily have 
significant impact the global semi landscape because the starting base quite small and china share gains 
only represent around the total semiconductor industry 
what could spur china grow faster and thus have more dramatic impact the global industry 
our base case assumption could prove conservative the scenarios below play out 
dram see the lack key issue one the memory leaders micron samsung 
hynix decides partner with china that could speed china development significantly and 
could see china taking share dram the next years billion 
nand flash there are more alternatives for than dram for example toshiba sandisk and 
intel all have significant nand but not dram though the issues are easier resolve 
than dram there could more production challenges believe china likely start with 
the more mature planar nand technology since nand not established even for existing 
players also advantages are relatively small for consumer products overall similar 
dram the upside see china taking global nand market share billion 
value 
mobile processors government initiatives drive more domestic content and security 
semiconductors china and global june 
concerns could partially offset the technology gap and china could also become more 
acquisitive note that several companies have exited the baseband business and thus 
there are likely assets and available for sale the chinese vendors take share china 
similar what has today feature phones versus today roughly billion 
revenues lost for qualcomm and mediatek 
internet things iot new market for semiconductors this means there are established 
market leaders today fairly small market but the killer app found china very well 
could become player here the semi technologies needed for iot are typically not leadingedge mcu connectivity cost important and the ecosystem key 
network switches this area with high technology barriers but huawei establishing itself 
key consumer network ics such its subsidiary hisilicon very well could gain share 
the same way that samsung exynos processor apple apps processors have gained share 
smartphones the likelihood this happening would increase activities pick 
osat this labor intensive business and historically china has found success the back end 
industries such solar and led not see immediate threa china leader 
jcet the process acquiring stats chippac and integration could take time but this 
certainly worth watching over the longer term 
semiconductors china and global june 
company implications region 
below lay out the key company implications our base case assumption for china and also the more 
aggressive case 
greater china 
the near term impact likely limited second tier foundries and fabless companies smic china 
leading foundry only ramping tsmc already getting ready for jcet china largest osat 
player also lagging its global peers and believe the integration with stats chippac will take some time 
smic has also recently struck agreement develop with qualcomm huawei and belgian but ramp 
still years off similarly spreadtrum likely will ramp chipsets early two years after mediatek 
see some impact the trailing edge where china based smic could take share from the likes umc 
are also positive ase usi taking share with its proprietary sip offerings 
upside scenario for china success likely come first the consumer related segments 
which would affect mediatek and novatek osat the most labor intensive part the supply chain and 
our studies china entry into other market solar led suggests that china typically finds success 
assembly test before the front end this likely implies risk ase and spil addition china finds success 
dram see negative impact nanya tech inotera and winbond 
technology wise leading edge foundry and thus tsmc the most defensive note that tsmc 
previously has said that isn interested additional investments china beyond the current fab but 
management changed its tone late saying that will build fab because china 
requiring more local content the question taiwan regulations will change currently taiwanese 
companies are only allowed bring trailing edge technologies into china this remains unchanged does 
give the local competitors more opportunity catch 
korea 
forecast limited near term earnings impact from china entry into the semiconductor industry 
korea two semiconductor giants samsung electronics and hynix chinese share gains the nonmemory semiconductor segments pose minimal risks both companies our view since they contributed 
less than samsung semiconductor and hynix total though chinese dram competition 
may pose significant risks the long run meaningful impact the industry requires china ability access 
compete mainstream products entry barriers are significant 
what about scenario where china finds success penetrating the memory segment via access 
here both samsung and hynix would most likely face dram pricing falling near cash costs new chinese 
entrants three five year time the dram oligopoly breaks down causing severe downturn similar 
the cycle 
korean dram companies maintain significant production cost advantages estimate the impact 
operating margins could decline the mid teens from current levels see greater impact 
hynix than samsung view its relatively high exposure china and lack captive demand which benefits 
samsung 
the other hand the memory supply chain korea equipment makers materials should benefit from 
increased chinese capex the medium term creating cheaper supply chain alternative china would take 
least decade develop these include wonik ips not covered chemical vapor deposition 
dnf not covered dram materials and psk not covered etching systems 
semiconductors china and global june 
the long term however china scales and develops its own dram capabilities korean supply chain 
companies would eventually face significant margin pressure from cheaper alternatives china previously 
experienced industries such solar led and tft lcd 
japan 
see only modest impact japanese semiconductor and semi cap equipment companies the near term 
assembly and test equipment orders from chinese osats have already been the rise since but this 
has been mostly offset weak orders from taiwanese osats 
upside scenario for china see higher risk that japanese semiconductor makers would face intensified 
competition from chinese makers discretes and general purpose mcus equipment makers are likely 
benefit from expanding capex chinese customers however the semiconductor market remains driven 
supply and demand irrational capex could create bubble and eventually the bubble could burst saw 
the led and solar cell industries 
however believe more design activity among chinese companies would increase mask demand without 
risk oversupply consider this positive for hoya mask blanks market leader and nuflare 
technology mask writing systems market leader 
europe 
see suppliers one the key beneficiaries when china broadens its semiconductor exposure are 
positive arm and lesser extent imagination they sell key for microprocessors microcontrollers 
graphics and connectivity arm already selling spreadtrum mstar rockchip arm would benefit from 
increased licensing revenues china fabless companies design new chips and from royalty revenues when 
they start shipping significant volume that said should china take significant market share that would 
detrimental for chip pricing globally and thus the long term revenue opportunity for arm might reduced 
asml holding also beneficiary the potential increase chinese capex although that could lead supply 
issues longer term should china gain significant traction there 
the other hand stmicro and less extent infineon could face margin pressure believe that european 
companies with fabs factories the old continent could face pressure from cheaper alternatives china 
both companies have significant revenue exposure china directly for stmicro and more indirectly for 
infineon whereby chips are sold into german made assets sold china believe stmicroelectronics 
more risk because its direct revenue exposure china and greater exposure than infineon commodities 
microcontrollers and distributors for infineon believe the greater risk lies the low end mid range 
the power semiconductor market where several chinese companies including sanan are making push 
several companies have emerged acquisition targets and think there are likely more 
sovereign china strategy could help upstarts overtake incumbents but could also lock out 
suppliers completely 
general sense believe that china push for local content hurts dominant incumbents that export into 
china and helps second tier challengers those incumbents partnering with local content suppliers 
create local content solutions 
for example have seen intel partner with spreadtrum the baseband market where consider intel 
challenger qualcomm this part gives intel technology local content from government perspective 
that becomes important criterion because spreadtrum contribution 
see similar possibilities for the smaller contenders amd baseband marvell servers networking 
marvell cavium partner with local providers and integrate with local silicon through custom products 
semiconductors china and global june 
monetize those technology other ways 
the other hand the upside scenario for china sovereign development the drive for local content likely 
move away from such hybrid solutions and towards pure domestic suppliers this would occur each key 
segment replicated with chinese suppliers chinese consumption moves predominantly locally sourced 
products even the cost some initial impact hardware competitiveness global compatibility that 
would lock out suppliers entirely this scenario also see incremental risks semiconductor 
power discrete total sales and cmos image sensor businesses 
qualcomm the incumbent today has faced pressure from the likes mediatek however has hedged its 
risk with partnerships with the like xiaomi and smic which help its presence the chinese market most 
recently was announced that smic would partner with qualcomm develop chips following 
their collaboration chips last year 
impact global capital spending 
separately think increased investment china could drive surge global capital spending over time 
which could benefit equipment suppliers and hurt commodities particularly memory companies over 
sustained period time look the history sovereign motivations expand the semiconductor 
industry japan korea and taiwan those efforts each case resulted surge spending new entrants 
spent relatively indiscriminately barriers entry have become higher over time japan and korea were able 
create viable independent memory producers whereas taiwan the technology became more challenging 
companies tended partner with established memory vendors this creates the potential for both upside 
licensing and capital efficient output through partnerships and downside oversupply memory vendors 
semiconductors china and global june 
why china investing semiconductors 
the chinese government has set goals and guidelines for how will invest the semiconductor industry 
details the announcement are appendix but summary the key points are 
china expects its industry revenue reach which implies cagr 
through 
technology wise china aims par with first tier international players 
the national fund would managed operating company called huaxin 
investment management current fund size has reached initial target 
the president huaxin said the target invest the 
semiconductor industry 
the questions investors are asking are 
why china doing this look the economic and non economic factors 
how china going this consider what its strategies might what segments within 
semis china might invest and where might find success 
what different this time around 
the chinese government track record for building companies and promoting industries mixed best 
however think the chinese government will use previous cases lessons learned and thus looking its 
previous attempts investment likely shed light the current semi effort 
why china doing this 
first all note that this not the first time that china has tried promote local semiconductor industry 
its efforts date back the but more recently both smic and grace semiconductor now part 
huahong not covered were established that was the last serious effort enter the semiconductor 
manufacturing industry other efforts have followed such fabless companies assembly houses and 
semiconductor equipment companies but they were started mostly with venture capital funding not 
government funding 
now years after the last real effort the government beijing back for another try why 
semiconductors china and global june 
exhibit china government promotion the semiconductor industry 
rce mmarized rgan stan ley research 
see several reasons for beijing renewed interest the semiconductor industry 
china shifting away from labor intensive manufacturing model one that cleaner with 
higher value added and semiconductors fits the mold over the last years labor costs china have 
increased cagr versus real gdp increase while global labor costs have 
risen cagr over the same period southeast asia also fast becoming alternative for lower end 
manufacturing industries with vietnam average labor cost lower than china and thailand labor 
costs lower than china comparing downstream tech manufacturing which china dominates 
semiconductor manufacturing labor costs account for more significant portion hon hai cost structure 
than tsmc 
also note that china approved new environmental law april which was the first amendment since 
the revised article would entitle environmental departments fine polluting companies daily basis 
without setting upper limit the companies were found illegally discharging pollutants and refusing stop 
after being warned this likely also skews investment from hardware towards semiconductors 
china now large consumer semiconductors addition being producer tech products 
result china better positioned dictate what chips and components inside the technology 
products the consumption side china currently represents about the global consumption for 
various tech products this from manufacturing country china manufacturing around 
two thirds the world pcs and smartphones but supplying less than the semiconductors used 
within these devices going the extra step and venturing into semiconductors just makes sense our view 
china used make what others design and much what makes shipped internationally china 
portion consumption increases china can better dictate what goes inside the devices example 
china push for its own scdma and lte standards having the largest mobile user base 
the world china can influence global hardware specs note that the era apple never made tdscdma compatible iphone while samsung made china specific model that did support scdma but 
samsung phones sold everywhere else the world did not support scdma the era apple 
offering lte support the iphone not just china but many the iphone sold internationally also 
support lte 
the semiconductor industry highly profitable the semiconductor industry generated roughly 
revenue less than half the hardware manufacturing industry 
according gratner however the semiconductor industry has significantly higher margins semiconductor 
semiconductors china and global june 
margins are typically while hardware margins are typically less than this implies gross profit for 
chips roughly par with hardware while polluting significantly less and being less labor intensive 
exhibit china consumption devices percentage the worldwide total 
rce idc artn rgan stan ley research estimates 
exhibit china consumption production rate 
rce idc artn rgan stan ley research estimates 
security see security another key element china increasing focus semiconductors the last 
few years some the security leaks have brought light spying activities countries worldwide believe 
this could concern for the chinese government 
semiconductors china and global june 
today china cannot manufacture smartphone server without foreign content pcs intel and amd 
essentially own the market smartphones chinese chipset supplier spreadtrum has less than market 
share while network equipment hisilicon huawei subsidiary owns only the market 
semiconductor typically the brain inside the tech products bigger domestic semiconductor industry 
would lot bolster china efforts improve security 
speaking with chinese technology companies our expectation for mobile phone with chinese 
content and for state owned enterprises purchase more equipment from domestic vendors 
than they did 
semiconductors china and global june 
where within semiconductors makes the most sense for china 
areas where china dominates consumption and production using the framework outlined the 
previous section obvious place start where china dominates consumption addition production 
while production matters our view that consumption trumps production because area where china 
can better dictate specs chips exhibit looks the major categories consumer electronics market size 
globally china percentage consumption and product and lastly market leaders for the key semiconductor 
components inside devices 
for example all apple iphones are made china but would difficult for the chinese government 
dictate design and chip specifications the iphone based the manufacturing base however china 
consumption the iphone increases percentage the total china influence design specs will also 
increase 
areas where china has technology edge china may not state the art all areas semiconductor 
technology but see areas where has advantages 
wireless air interface the worldwide standard fdd lte but lte being rolled out 
many parts the world fdd lte far the more mature technology but lte has 
advantages densely populated areas asynchronous meaning more bandwidth can 
allocated download versus upload also lte uses the frequencies more efficiently 
especially higher frequencies with the direct involvement china mobile and datang the 
development the flavor lte china well positioned lever the high likelihood that 
china mobile will far the largest carrier operating lte network anywhere the world 
and that turn should help chinese equipment oems garner incremental share lte 
rolled out wide range carriers according gsa the global mobile suppliers 
association more than operations countries have launched lte networks which 
one eight lte operators and another operators are deploying planning networks the 
countries include china japan australia saudi arabia sweden and denmark 
ics related set top boxes and satellite tvs chips used set top boxes and satellite vary 
country and operator result china domestic chipmakers and taiwanese chipmakers tend 
dominate the local set top box and satellite industries 
power discretes overall china technology not strong analog but believe china 
ahead taiwan power discretes and perhaps competitive with the europe and japan 
specific areas many the end markets for power discretes igbt mosfet are industry and 
automotive applications where china consumption and production play large role discretes 
also not move with moore law that the number transistors integrated circuit 
doubles roughly every two years making the manufacturing different from typical ics discretes 
depend more their packaging characteristics and such are not too difficult reverseengineer lastly for reasons unknown taiwan did not develop large power discrete 
industry which presented opportunity for china believe that china has already gained 
traction low end power discretes and low voltage power modules for aircon inverters 
unique combinations existing technologies many the traditional semiconductor 
technologies china has shorter history than other countries and thus could take time 
catch however new areas semiconductor new combinations semiconductor 
technologies believe china could emerge winner note two examples first usi 
shanghai based module maker the company combines osat and ems technology and has 
become key supplier for apple china does not necessarily lead osat ems but usi 
clearly leader what calls sip system package the know how the combination 
semiconductors china and global june 
the two for more details please see our report sip advanced semi engineering asia insight 
sip size evolution published may and our initiation report usi universal 
scientific ind shanghai key play miniaturization but initiating equal weight 
valuation published june 
the second example iot the internet things this nascent product category that the 
focus many semiconductor companies worldwide but one company has significant volume 
now the technology needed for iot not very different from what available today 
low power processors and connectivity solutions but the combination the two the 
right cost structure that will differentiate china could well become leader here our view 
security believe china will want invest wireline communications today most the 
backbone china uses semiconductors that are from european firms this includes the government 
system banks brokers etc huawei and zte are gaining share hardware related wireline communications 
but their market share for the chips still quite low however this area where the and technology 
barriers are high chips used network equipment fpgas custom asics etc are high asp and high margin 
china does want increase its capabilities this area see the quickest path 
security consumer the consumer side security related chips have much lower entry barriers 
note that china the process rolling out bank cards and cards with chips embedded today this 
area dominated companies such nxp but believe china has the capability edge out foreign 
companies and will want for security reasons 
exhibit global market share secure ics payment cards 
rce ihs rgan stan ley research 
labor intensive areas for most the semiconductor industry labor cost not significant portion 
overall cost exhibit breaks down the labor costs for industry leaders the various parts semiconductors 
for memory are using inotera instead samsung because samsung not pure play note that labor 
cost highest for the osat industry also high for fabless but mostly opex which uses engineers not 
factory workers 
semiconductors china and global june 
exhibit labor cost comparison 
rce data rgan stan ley research 
foundries noted exhibit for foundries labor cost only total sales 
depreciation expenses typically make more than cogs and having strong 
technology operations typically more than offsets any differences labor cost 
for the fabless industry cogs typically the price paid foundries and osats 
engineering does account for large part operating expenses but it more about 
intellectual property and know how than the cost the engineers exhibits and plot cost 
per employee for taiwan and china based fabless companies and revenue per 
employee cost certainly cheaper asia but historically revenue per employee lower 
there well 
exhibit opex per employee 
source company data morgan stanley research 
exhibit revenue per employee 
source company data morgan stanley research 
osat where labor matters the osat industry employs significant amounts labor its factories for 
example tsmc has employees which are engineering while are its factories ase has 
employees which are engineering while are its factories technology does matter osat but 
note that jcet recently acquired stats chippac which closes the gap technology between industry 
leaders 
noted later this report when china entered solar and led manufacturing overall had more success 
downstream than did upstream which akin assembly and test within semiconductors 
using the criteria defined above look the specific types semiconductors that believe will face the 
most impact from china entry into the industry 
baseband aps for smartphones chinese players current market share aggregate the industry 
leader qualcomm qcom covered james faucette with over market share samsung also has 
indirect exposure china through its mobile business since believe the company will the major 
foundry supplier for apple upcoming new iphone chips well qualcomm next generation 
snapdragon chip samsung has approximately revenue exposure china through its smartphones its 
mid range high end phones such the galaxy comes with its own exynos chip that said samsung has 
increased the use its own internally developed exynos processor mid range high end smartphones 
particularly expanding its use with the samsung galaxy qualcomm still supplies across most models 
although its presence has been reduced minimum skus cdma the spreadtrum rda remains 
china top player the category while hisilicon huawei subsidiary has also been strengthening its 
chip design ability estimate the total market size for baseband aps 
respectively meaning potential market over for chinese players their market share increases 
semiconductors china and global june 
technology wise the application processor itself not significant challenge however the modem 
challenge given the variety standards frequencies and qualifications needed worldwide also compete 
effectively this segment the baseband and apps processor need integrated and the integration 
challenge 
our expectation for china huawei will increasingly use its own chips phones but given the conflict 
interest likely difficult for hisilicon gain significant share outside huawei spreadtrum rda today 
competitive the low end and likely take another few years for the company catch terms 
modem technology integration process technology and carrier qualifications 
the wild card here our view will new activity several non chinese fabless companies have 
smartphone related assets teams that are likely for sale they have not reached critical mass and thus are not 
profitable broadcom sold off its mobile division june nvidia announced may that exiting 
the mobile baseband market according unconfirmed reports digitimes february marvell said 
interested selling its wireless division also the company has not confirmed the news 
expect that qualcomm will look find points leverage the chinese market via its foundry partnership 
with smic point out throughout this report expect that china will tend favor single national 
champions and unclear smic foundry will afforded the same status full semiconductor 
company like spreadtrum nevertheless working with smic likely key strategic counter not only the 
competitive risk posed national champion but also the efforts companies like huawei integrate 
vertically 
additional factor that qualcomm may seek exploit sustain its competitive advantage against chinesesponsored competition its ability enable chinese oems expand presence outside china including into 
developed markets think that central qualcomm strategy and earnings power that the company 
enable new internationally strong competitor currently xiaomi looks have the best chance developing 
into the third player but believe that qualcomm will continually make the case that can help any one 
number chinese oems reach that stage 
though china poses risk what keeps the potentially negative impact relatively muted that competition 
date has largely been chinese produced chinese sold handsets market that has relatively low asp and 
profit contribution for example whereas qualcomm may have give pricing concessions compete with 
mediatek the china made sold market the estimated impact these concessions about 
including lost share the likes mediatek this market adds potentially another for details please 
see our report june insight mediatek likely not pressuring qualcomm margins much 
most think 
aps for tablets chinese players current market share mostly white box tablet the industry 
leader remains apple aapl covered katy huberty supplies its own ipads with market share 
the technical barriers for the apps processor not high since most tablets ship without capabilities the 
growth this market really depends whether the tablet market overall can continue grow and whether 
the non apple brands can take share those criteria are met would suspect the chinese chipset suppliers 
can take share current chinese market leaders are allwinner and rockchip with market share each 
note that rockchip has formed alliance with intel 
baseband for feature phones chinese players current market share the industry leader 
mediatek with market share upside limited because the feature phone market longer growing but 
the baseband market could look interesting communications protocol for internet things iot 
would not expect much upside the near term but iot takes off this area could see growth would also 
expect qualcomm aggressive competitor the market for cellular and wifi connected iot devices 
cmos chinese players current market share roughly around with galaxycore private being the top 
player the industry leader sony for the high end with market share and omnivision ovti for the 
mid range low end with market share note that april omnivision entered into definitive 
semiconductors china and global june 
agreement acquired chinese consortium led hua capital with omnivision and galaxycore now 
both being chinese the chinese control the total volume and around revenues the part that 
missing the very high end apple and its supplier sony and the captive markets samsung supplying 
sensors into its own phones but expect the chinese highly competitive the mid range low end 
both cost and performance samsung has lost global cmos share since position after sony and 
omnivision sony took share and replaced omnivision for the iphone cmos orders samsung mainly 
supplies high end cmos internally its mobile division increasing chinese presence poses limited risks 
the company hynix the other hand has share the global cmos market but more vulnerable view 
its exposure low end sensors 
semiconductor competes the cmos segment following the acquisition aptina 
august this segment now represents annual sales total company revenue on 
strategy grow within the more attractive end markets industrial and autos while emphasizing 
business the higher volume and price sensitive markets handsets consumer and computing today its 
business split roughly between autos industrial and high volume have voiced concerns about on 
ability navigate this transition mix which the company expects result roughly flattish sales and margin 
expansion anything china focus this market presents additional risks both the trajectory sales 
handsets computing consumer and the aspiration improving gms from the high the high recall 
omnivision only and possible under chinese ownership that the company may become even 
more aggressive price 
embedded memory for smart cards mentioned earlier china rapidly adopting smartcards for 
national cards and bank cards see this significant opportunity for domestic suppliers both the 
fabless side and also for foundries and osats currently smic and huahong are the only two companies that 
are manufacturing the chips for fabless there are six local companies and also nxp has significant share 
display driver ics controllers chinese players current market share only for display driver the 
industry leaders are renesas for small panels with market share and novatek for 
large panels with market share samsung accounts for the large size lcd driver market 
supplies internally samsung display much like with cmos the asp between the high end and low end varies 
significantly can anywhere from the total market size estimated 
today there are around six lcd driver vendors china including chip one beijing vsm and galaxycore 
shanghai new vision display shenzhen silan hanzhou and solomon systech hong kong most 
these companies focus mid range low end smartphone even feature phone driver ics since the 
barriers entry are lower chip one the only company that has design wins large panel driver ics from 
panel maker boe 
comparatively believe the chinese players can more competitive small panels given the lower entry 
barriers and fragmented market also local engineering support matters more compete large panel driver 
china design house would need build scale get better cost foundries and further improve 
driver reliability because the defect cost large panels much higher this could take few years our 
view long term believe china panel makers will want support some local vendors acquire better 
bargaining power 
currently there are three foundries china that can provide lcd driver process grace semi asmc and

merchant silicon for example switches they are largely reliant upon silicon from broadcom cisco leads the

asics the total market size estimated 
over time see chinese equipment manufacturers favoring local silicon from vendors such hisilicon 
huawei custom silicon group and centec switching this area has one the higher technical barriers both

and this year 
servers intel dominates the microprocessor used inside pcs and servers with market share 
globally having domestically produced chip would likely help terms security but difficult task 
given intel dominance several scenarios could change this intel has invested spreadtrum and believe 
spreadtrum can use some intel while the deal was likely struck for mobile devices one day could 
evolve include pcs servers though intel would careful protect its attractive economics those 
businesses 
there has been unconfirmed press speculation reuters june that amd might look sell its 
microprocessor businesses the right price according reuters amd spokesperson said such project

amd technology nonviable any deal involving amd via likely would complicated terms patents and

iot internet things nascent area within semiconductors and encompasses many different 
applications from industrial automotive consumers our view that china sees this good opportunity 
and china has several advantages iot the technology used iot not leading edge mostly involves 
low power communication devices and micro controllers most the processing done the cloud not 
the device end china also already leads some the technologies that could used iot such 
basebands for non consumer applications industrial medical and automotive the government can dictate 
national standards that raise the barriers entry for non chinese companies

have seen significant pickup the market but that has happened have seen shift 
towards more accretion value sensitive deals and fewer strategic deals money losing assets have not been 
popular for the most part chinese government funded entities private enterprises with government 
backing may more interested buying assets that are otherwise viewed trouble they bring key 
capabilities 
believe there will more announcements come both terms and cross border collaborations 
where does this make the most sense see the following areas being most interest china 
companies that get most their revenue china already could see revenue shifting 
china looking previous deals most fit this profile 
companies with chinese management teams large work force china besides the 
cultural synergies these companies can also help china elevate its overall semiconductor

china investing semis manufacturing that really good for semiconductor 
production equipment 
selling shovels the gold rush theory increased competition good for semiconductor production 
equipment and note that smic has raised its capex guidance for foundry business slightly from 
however the semiconductor industry remains driven supply and demand and the current 
consensus that has matured with irrational supply behaviour especially the memory front should 
irrational investment come back that might positive the short term for semiconductor production 
equipment but increase the volatility orders again the best proxy might previous efforts the chinese 
government for example china push for led manufacturing the created bubble for mocvd 
equipment aixtron veeco and solar cells but eventually the bubble burst 
semiconductors china and global june 
how china will invest semiconductors 
case studies china efforts auto solar led and lcd 
this not the first time that china has looked promote the domestic content various industries this 
section look china past efforts auto solar led and lcd industries reference also look other 
governments historical efforts invest memory 
china success has been mixed far oversupply hurt the solar led lcd industries while the auto 
industry still led foreign companies throughout past decades the chinese government has aimed 
increase domestic sufficiency several industries for the tech sector the government provided subsidies 
both the supply and demand side though the subsidies did reduce the amount international players the 
end the sector overall suffered from severe price competition due oversupply the government took 
different approach with the auto industry encouraging foreign companies form jvs when entering the 
chinese market result china car market still led foreign brands 
what the chinese government role the tech industries supply first demand later the chinese 
government started supporting the manufacturing side once saw the boom demand support has come 
mainly the form subsidies such funding preferential rates for land guarantees securing bank 
loans and soe investment for example the government has provided subsidies mocvd 
system purchase led makers which used manufacture led lights 
that said when the global economies weakened market demand could longer hold for example 
germany and spain both reduced their subsidies solar during the global financial crisis which reduced 
global demand significantly the chinese government then provided incentives boost demand including 
feed tariffs tax rebates subsidies winning bidders government projects and other government projects 
like golden sun for solar and lights cities for led street lights 
what does mean the market chinese players may still not competitive high end products usually 
upstream the supply chain mainly because the technology gap and yield problems yet has become the 
major market the world nonetheless for solar china accounts for and global supply and 
demand respectively for panels chinese makers have supplied global panel shipments and 
total global shipments for led china accounted for the global led chip market 
second only taiwan according ledinside 
international players suffered product prices plunged with government support chinese players can 
offer below cost pricing result some international players well smaller chinese players were forced 
exit the market meanwhile the remaining players have suffered from severe pricing competition because 
overcapacity which chinese companies weren immune for example the module price plunged from

how about the auto industry foreign car companies entered the china market the mid but only 
forms required the government the chinese government goal was develop the market quickly 
while eying technology transfer and maintaining control the industry the foreign brands agreed the 
regulation given the huge demand that said china surpassed the the largest auto market the world 
with million passenger cars sold however years later and the foreign brands still 
account for the majority the market 
the auto industry has been more successful than others while the foreign brands were favored the 
domestic brands still have stable market share china without severe pricing competition the 
domestic brands market share even rose thanks subsidies car purchases from 
after the global financial crisis which favored domestic brands with lower asp worth monitoring 
whether the oversupply issue could happen again the auto market since the government significant 
investment capacity expansion three years ago about line but the china auto market still 
relatively healthy compared with the solar led and lcd industries 
what the difference among the industries the foreign companies solar led and lcd have suffered 
from severe price erosion even exited the market this has not happened the auto industry think this 
largely reflects the nature the product 
brand image unlike tech components devices matter solar led lcd passenger 
vehicles are daily consumer products which brand image counts end customer one 
may care more the car audi byd but not necessarily the uses panels from auo 
boe 
pricing segmentation again easier for cars have pricing segmentation given the 
established brand images and therefore less chance for cutthroat pricing happen 
semiconductors china and global june 
technology transfer the engine represents the core technology car which the design 
and manufacturing remains the homeland countries addition safety standard 
requirements remain bar for domestic automakers overcome meanwhile the chinese 
government may help the technology side providing subsidies equipment 
purchase and hiring with better salaries indeed though chinese players may still not 
competitive the high end the pricing environment and downstream application demand 
may not necessarily support require china competitive high end products anyway

dram nand 
why china wants build its own presence dram nand 
there are similarities between dram nand and logic but believe there are also some key differences and 
look memory separately the key differences are 
the dram nandsegment more intensive and the patents are harder come 
there currently oligopoly dram which see classic prisoner that 
the market leaders not necessarily want help china this does not exist logic today 
conclusion believe the barriers entry commodity dram are quite high given substantial patent 
requirements see china entering via specialty dram first and commodity dram later dram the key 
component for almost all consumer electronics estimate that chinese smartphone and brands 
aggregate make global dram demand this because chinese brands have market share 
smartphones pcs mainly lenovo and tvs 
for flash product china local company gigadevice already capable nor flash design and placing 
wafer foundry orders with smic the barriers entry low density nand flash for code storage are 
not high and expect chinese companies will develop the product without licensing however for highdensity nand flash for data storage smartphones think china has acquire the related 
produce 
exhibit chinese brands aggregate dram consumption analysis 
rce rgan stan ley research 
the key issue for commodity dram nand production 
for commodity dram especially the most advanced nodes and entry barriers are quite 
high for china commodity dram requires broad set patents and the patents required are still evolving 
there are around essential dram patents the world spanning the entire dram process flow work 
front end back end packaging and testing unlike other parts semiconductors china cannot acquire just 
few critical patents but needs broad set patents lastly the technology still evolving any company that 
wants enter dram needs large team keep dram technology the leading edge without joint 
venture significant acquisition think may take more than five years for china build competitive 
commodity dram industry its own think the production for high density nand flash would face 
similar issue reviewing the patent distribution

talent equipment and capital should easier come 
the key elements building dram presence are talent equipment and capital 
talent may not big issue today industry consolidation over the past few years means 
there talent from defunct dram companies elpida promos the market 
also believe equipment vendors will keen support the competition our view 
large semi cap companies such amat and lam will keen participate and provide 
their know how secure market share 
last capital build new inch dram fab requires around capital 
spending not including the budget big investment but government support and 
the size the revenue opportunity likely can attract institutional investors 
exhibit past acquisitions the dram segment 
rce data rgan stan ley research 
recent developments chinese dram nand investment 
smic has been the only fab china that has done dram wafer foundry for elpida and qimonda but that was 
the company just got china semi fund investment according smic the company was 
queried the government whether could lead china dram effort however the company stated that 
given its previous history dram and the lack patents smic has plan build dram production for 
the time being 
semiconductors china and global june 
there have been some chinese private equity funds that received local government investment and are 
proactively looking for potential acquisition targets the dram nand industry for example summitview 
attempted acquire issi for specialty dram and nor flash design know how currently june was 
reported that another chinese fund uphill bidding war with cypress for issi the chinese fund 
could successfully acquire issi believe would assist its specialty dram nand product development but 
our view that enter commodity dram nand china still requires sourcing from leading global 
dram nand companies 
some chinese foundries such xmc have flash process however xmc scale too small and doesn 
really own the which owned spansion besides according recent news flow other cities such 
beijing hefei and shanghai could receive subsidies for dram production however without direct investment 
from the china semi fund which represents the central government cannot conclude that these projects 
would get strong policy support therefore see specialty dram more likely path for china the near 
intermediate term 
the sources dram nand patents today 
china wants build its own dram fabs has license patents from current players our view hard 
predict whether china might get the license believe the probability for incumbent players receive licensed 
very low given the mature state the dram market 
today micron and samsung own most the memory patents while hynix owns some patents infineon 
qimonda used large patent holder but its technology trench capacitors outdated and longer 
used remains seen whether samsung hynix micron would want cooperate with the chinese 
government historically foreign memory companies did license their patents taiwan even china exhibit 
hynix micron elpida and qimonda all licensed dram patents taiwanese companies 
for samsung and hynix the likelihood dram licensing low our view the dram market maturing 
and the need secure capacity scale limited korean dram makers remain focused long term price 
stability and replenishing incremental capacity loss due technology migration without drawing from 
external resources hynix previous licensing with promos technologies secure inch wafer 
capacity was unsuccessful and samsung has not had any licensing agreements the past 
for nand flash there are more alternatives for sources than dram for example china could also source 
from nand owners such toshiba sandisk and intel potential nand production think china would 
start from the more mature planar nand technology since nand not firmly established even for existing

what would the alternative solutions and likely consequences 
proves too difficult for china develop its own dram company and the incumbents not want license 
what are the alternatives 
china could encourage foreign dram companies build more dram fabs china and look for 
opportunities stated earlier this report believe the two key goals for china are improving its 
economics and security the security risks memory are minimal and could well better economic 
decision than starting from scratch agreement could reached believe would take years 
see stable production commodity dram estimate that china would need two inch fabs reach scale 
and self sufficient its global dram consumption and estimate capex would 
needed 
sum believe dram has high entry barriers china and see limited impact supply the next three 
years even china goes down the route would take time reach scale and this case estimate 
china could attain share dram billion value the next years the long term believe 
three player oligopoly will remain although there could some temporary oversupply when the new 
chinese capacity reaches mature production 
for specialty dram even china uses relatively trailing edge nodes commodity dram 
the entry barrier produce stable quality specialty dram remains high believe china would need 
acquire technology from foreign companies speed its specialty dram development overseas 
companies whose size and dram specialty would potentially fit include issi the market cap 
and winbond taiwan market cap however while chinese fund has announced that would 
acquire issi winbond management made public announcement may that not interested 
selling 
for nand flash china can form with foreign nand companies should able take global nand 
market share billion value thanks its local consumption nand
