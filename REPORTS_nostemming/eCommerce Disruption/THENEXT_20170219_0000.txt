market 
the indian millennial population technologically savvy has high ambitions aspirations highly mobile prefers convenience and digitally 
influenced but more importantly connected the world through the internet whereas the group parents were more insular terms 
culture consumption and global outreach and went through economic hardships 
some interesting insights from the survey 
indian millennials are spending average over hours the internet every week carrying our varied activities such social media 
searching entertainment music movies online banking and online transactions the level engagement encouraging but noted 
still below that china and the this provides further headroom grow 
mobile devices are the primary means access the internet this reinforces our earlier assumption that over internet users 
will access the internet via mobile device see our february report this mobile first generation critical for smartphone 
manufacturers app developers content creators digital advertisers and start ups 
millennials are interested convenience and instant gratification and are willing pay for this can corroborated the following 
factors penetration was across the surveyed population versus india whole and within internet users uptake 
premium subscriptions such amazon prime the likelihood taking one was usage app based taxi services was 
driven comfort and easy availability and low prices discounts did not figure among the top three reasons for buying online 
millennials are promoting internet usage among their parents elders only millennials surveyed said their parents were connected the internet but the real insight was layer below about these older internet users had been influenced millennials 
while another had adopted the internet the same time their kids had this portends well for internet usage among the gen and 
baby boomer population see exhibit 
negative surprise from the survey was that online penetration for hotel bookings was low and within that the online travel 
agency ota share was only the percentage hotel walk ins was extremely high believe otas will need bring larger 
number hotels their platform drive innovation the form last minute booking deals and continue incentivize customers 
what the market missing can look this from three perspectives 
know that investors are closely watching the start scene india however amid nascent market they could unsure evolving 
trends and how invest believe this millennial survey could provide significant insights into how online consumption trends are likely 
change the influence millennials increases 
investors have been concerned about the low online shopper adoption india this was just india over decade behind 
china this parameter but the survey results excite online shopping adoption within millennials was for key product groups 
such fashion electronics and personal health products this could accelerate overall online shopping adoption 
the slowdown venture capital private equity funding since august hurt industry growth somewhat however from the survey 
can conclude that the activity millennials across different city tiers and income groups healthy and points sustained increase 
engagement and spend this could generate interesting investible ideas the near future 
what could wrong weak domestic macroeconomic growth resulting lower growth per capita income and hence disposable 
incomes would stunt the growth the consumption economy which would have significant effect the internet market furthermore 
slowdown capital inflows from venture capital private equity and strategic investors could hold back start companies

primary device for internet usage among 
millennials 
smartphone proliferation has improved considerably all phone shipments india were smartphones the cost 
smartphones has been falling steadily and the cheapest lte enabled phone now available anecdotes suggest 
enabled feature phone half that price will soon available with significant infrastructure available the country 
this bodes well for significant growth data usage and the internet market 
the survey showed high dependence mobile phones smartphones for internet access and high adoption mobile broadband 
services millennials the following are some the possible effects these trends 
millennials access the internet anywhere anytime the dependence mobile phone versus tablets and laptop desktops noteworthy and has significant connotations for start ups smartphone manufacturers telecom providers content providers and advertisers 
mobile broadband adoption was high across city tiers and across income levels this reflects willingness spend experience 
and speed carry out variety activities 
with more and more activities being done mobile device companies spending customer acquisition incentives cash backs 
drive mobile website app adoption rather than traffic acquisition paid traffic especially emanating from google could benefit 
from better conversion and repeat rates leading higher lifetime value customers the medium long term this very 
different from developed markets where the bulk the users originate desktop and hence marketing google critical 
acquire traffic having the right mobile strategy will key for indian start ups this will have direct effect conversion 
rates repeat rates and app downloads 
suitable content and local language content were some the key asks improve the overall internet experience for millennials 
and their parents faster internet speed and better smartphones were the other stated suggestions but believe these are already 
available and matter time users upgrade interestingly lower data charges ranked low among key suggested improvements

theme millennials spending over hours 
the internet week 
the survey revealed genuine engagement the internet within the millennial group some the key takeaways from the survey 
are follows 
millennials are spending hours the internet every week that time spent emails social media online 
entertainment music videos etc and another searching for information see exhibit time spent online transactions 
including banking was the lowest believe maturity users less than five years most them have started using 
the internet the past few years our past surveys have showed that users mature over five years the internet their 
transactional activity increases sharply 
terms entertainment offline channels such television and radio were still dominant respondents preferred such 
channels while were equally offline and online terms consuming entertainment channels just the respondents were 
mostly online for this category this positive for traditional broadcasters and media distribution companies and allays fears that 
they will lose viewers the next few years but while people may not change much their entertainment viewing habits over the 
next months those spending equal time online and offline may graduate more online over the next months this could have 
meaningful effect advertising spend with digital advertising likely gain share total advertising expenditure from just 
the expense print and television this could alter revenue and profit pools the online entertainment 
industry significantly 
the survey showed consumption online entertainment content was mainly from home and not necessarily when mobile see 
exhibit although still too early start thinking disruption from over the top platforms india believe investors 
will need start thinking this their investment framework 
healthy the millennials surveyed already transact online rising incomes should key enabler for this online 
shopper penetration was among the higher family income millennials also there was plus increase online transactional activity for millennials the higher family income bucket versus those the lower family income bucket our hypothesis 
based analysis global internet companies that two thirds the growth the overall size the indian internet market 
will driven new users coming the internet for the very first time these survey results indicate that there maybe upside
