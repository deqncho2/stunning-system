producers that fading september the equipment market confusion was created

and hsic and the realization that any cadcam competition from ivoclar likely 
both limited importance and later timing freeing customers make 
equipment purchasing decisions

hsic has made strategic imperative sign dsos the dental space clients 
they have seen their outsized growth potential and the fact that clinics within dsos 
about double the patient volumes and revenues with almost revenue practice 
for unaffiliated small practices dsos are also more efficient charging 
more per avg procedure than private practitioners and seeking drive better price 
discovery through analytics our checks indicate they receive discounts 
consumables procurement from distributors hsic has set its client services into 
pyramid with government and institutional dso business the top where hsic 
dental has leading market share then mid market practices with practices 
under common management and then small private practices where hsic has 
share there opportunity near term deeper with these smaller practices 
offset headwinds from dso pricing though these practices are the ones most likely 
rolled dsos dsos often put out rfps for their suppliers every years but 
don always switch because there lack visibility fair market pricing which can 
change with more commerce providers 
hsic has noted that while dsos receive better pricing and hence provide lower gross 
margins for hsic they also use less hsic services and put less strain the 
salesforce they typically order electronically which can lead savings from 
perspective that the net ebit margin not lower significantly lower for dsos 
private practices fulfillment similar these dsos are made separate 
member practices that are commonly owned managed which suggests there isn much 
the way logistical efficiency gains from serving dsos dsos purchase off 
formulary from hsic which pushes them towards less expensive products but unlike 
medical there are not many chargebacks manufacturers based our checks with 
dsos hsic able offer the lowest prices practices through its formularies which 
may lower than pdco benco though pdco benco may offer more 
intensive service 
given that dsos see roughly double the patient volumes independent practices but 
receive price discounts reasonable expect hsic dso oriented 
dental business grow least fast the market however dso renewals 
typically happen every years there risk greater price discovery amzn 
ramps its offering leading dsos demanding sharper price cuts for non dsos 
there risk under growing the market rate volumes shift dsos that are

manufacturers flipping from full distributor sales agency sales method recently 
sign less services use historically pdco and hsic and have seen manufacturers 
that pulled back from full distributor sales favor more agency drop ship sales 
through distributors eventually move back towards using more distribution zts has 
with hsic companion over the past years however pdco saw 
manufacturer relationship the opposite direction towards more agency sales which 
impacted companion sales growth while pdco says this agency model better 
for margins the commission can mostly drop the bottom line generally see 
distributors prefer take the full sales model where they can take inventory risk 
and deploy their full suite value added services customers note the relative 
impact idxx pdco was small considering only make product

opex provides some offset pressure but cost cutting looks bit unsustainable

towards more commerce the likely follow the model seen veterinary 
which much more consolidated and almost entirely online sales result there 
substantially less need for field reps the with pdco using only reps cover

how meaningful the amzn threat 
key takeaways the emergence amazon business has become key investor concern 
while dental distributors with relatively high margins low regulation and commoditized 
consumables products are risk supplier and distribution industry concentration also 
limits the ability for amzn get branded products its platform without concerted 
push with animal health and medical distribution more regulated due 
pharmaceutical dispensing and dental equipment requiring service see near term risk 
for hsic and pdco concentrated north american core non specialty dental 
consumables while expect amzn make push into this space over the next 
years with more manufacturers granting amzn access their brands believe this 
may slower than investors believe and our understanding that there are 
negotiations underway that would tie amzn the critical manufacturers including 
xray dhr mmm estimate core north american dental consumables make 
hsic pdco total revenues and likely their ebit 
respectively which provides cap downside risk our view 
while dental distributors face longer term risk from online only competition 
see multiple factors mitigating this potential threat first their established market 
concentration with pdco and hsic holding the north american 
dental distribution market networks supplier and customer relationships have been 
built over year periods for both additionally they have considerably grown their 
own ecommerce operations provide multi channel relationship that online players 
cannot emulate with both suggesting total purchases and 
consumables are purchased electronically largely through practice management 
software this can increase customer retention through software platform stickiness 
and the ability provide value added services

what hsic and pdco think the amzn threat 
hsic cfo steven paladino competitor conference really good 
question because everything going digital technology every aspect everyone 
lives today area though that feel that keep doing what our strength has 
been which have moat around our business and that moat really very 
competitive pricing but even today without some these new entrants not 
the lowest the market every single price every single product but what 
have unbelievably good service levels and really strong offering value added 
products and services and what found the market really wants more than just the 
lowest price they want that combination very competitive pricing well all the 
other services long keep doing that think that won have worry 
about that pure online discount player and they already the market don worry 
about new people getting already represents the market today and 
really hasn been growing much faster rate than the overall market 
the online players are really just selling those consumable supplies online they 
generally don have equipment because equipment requires installation and repair 
services they generally don have software have practice management software 
they don have the field salesperson that really the medium that market 
with customers show them all the other value add that bringing 
analysis with the practice pricing analysis building analysis 
productivity analysis show them the benefits buying particular piece 
equipment and what could productivity there really different 
specific areas that providing value the customers more than just the 
consumable supplies 
however the important point that really doesn work you try cherrypick 
you can say well buy all volume through the online guys and come 
you for these other services because just doesn work can afford deliver 
those services unless you customer that providing more than more share 
your wallet and fact have lot programs that drive that home for 
example have our loyalty program that called privileges and basically privileges 
says exchange for the customer doing enough volume with giving you all 
these privileges which are things like guaranteed response time for equipment repair 
services discounts services other things can one without the other 
because just doesn economically work know that didn have lot time 
talk about that but there really huge array value added products and services 
that have

they sized these markets their other market opportunities remains too early tell 
what the impact amzn will but pundits have predicted their entry for long time 
with little progress show yet pdco view pdco believes its sales and service 
infrastructure provide moat against amzn dental practices using pdco depend 
their service fix equipment when breaks and keep their practice functional without 
this service dental customers would directly lose sales pdco expects this service need 
only increase digital technology becomes increasingly prevalent dental offices 
driving more complex needs pdco sees similar needs vet clinics driving customer 
stickiness

which may less than their dental vet customer overall spend from 
customer perspective pdco questions how important getting discounts from ecommerce players their spend considering pdco rapid service response 
equipment needs loyal customers additionally pdco delivers next day the 
majority its customers amzn has little delivery speed advantage however pdco 
intends keep tabs amzn and how they develop given their clout 
have seen pdco pursue similar strategy gww heading off amzn and other 
commerce players shrinking its footprint namely its field sales reps while this has 
improved productivity has impacted growth competitors such hsic were able

what experts believe 
conducted number expert interviews over the past months with dental and 
veterinary practitioners well other distributors gpos and other members the 
industry value chains experts were generally open the concept amzn but had 
seen limited uptake date 
dental experts 
one mid sized dso purchased through amzn and saw its spend towards them 
starting slowly grow products purchased spanned wide variety including lights for 
chairs handpieces statum making maybe spend this point but growing total spend another years they saw amzn sku expanding recently and 
pricing was more competitive even hsic the time but had nowhere near their 
product selection which could change over the next several years amzn seems 
getting more focused 
one level executive small dso loved the idea amzn and its cost 
differentiation but found troubling that they can provide any service the case 
error and intended stay mostly with pdco this executive believes that service 
component remains important but could replace staples with amzn for general office 
supplies 
one private practice dentist sees distributors getting squeezed dsos paying half 
what pays pdco and internet buying becoming more popular sees online peer 
reviews and suggestions limiting the need for the rep based sales model and driving 
distributors keep cutting field reps this practitioner relationship person and 
doesn want leave his pdco rep but amzn were save him then 
would hard for them say expects many remain loyal reps who can fix 
their equipment 
former distributor sales rep now dso sees different perspectives amzn the 
dental space though thinks they are very big deal having worked distributors 
amzn states and they moved slowly and methodically but they made 
appearance last year the greater new york dental meeting with all signs suggesting 
they are coming the expert dso currently uses hsic sees them having the 
best dso model and local coverage service which thinks would prevent his dso 
from moving amzn today though they continue reevaluate believes half 
supply spend could with amzn and the other half could kept with hsic keep 
service and local relationship ongoing though there are also regionalized service 
companies emerging which can fill that role technician believes the dental supply 
model started shifting towards online sales after the recession people started 
evaluating consumables costs which had never seen before then does not see 
this happening much equipment side because dentists want referrals and name 
brand back them and take care them after the sale 
one large dental gpo who had met with amzn discuss their plans dentistry 
believes they are trying cut through the bureaucracy infrastructure dentistry this 
expert expects amzn come and target consumables likely taking quite bit 
spend when they that though they can compete implants equipment yet this 
expert believes consumable goods are all patient spend and that recurring 
revenue they believe established distributors don compete heavily with one another 
today and have been able protect their margins from manufacturers consolidating 
share hsic for instance has agreements with manufacturers only sell regionally and 
they cannot resell another reseller only end users amzn having difficulty 
overcoming that because they cannot get access products that distributors have 
the indirect channel turns them away manufacturers may want sell amzn but are 
concerned about backlash from hsic pdco and other large distributors who might 
stop promoting their products this expert expects tier manufacturers 
amzn first before the tier players such xray dhr and mmm 
animal health experts 
one level executive national corporate veterinary company bought virtually 
everything online through mwi practice management software with only 
revenue spent repairs and maintenance far they had only used amzn for 
purchasing office supplies but continue look other product categories 
one executive corporate veterinary clinic was using mwi based its relationship 
and competitive pricing though saw each pdco and hsic similar well they

from manufacturers using distributors though they see benefits from distributors 
aggregating portfolios many products animal health are single source which can 
create complicated logistics for practices purchasing from multiple suppliers multiple 
practice management systems buying groups small clinics may receive 
pricing good better than distributors going direct though this 
administrative challenge often purchasing drugs margin leaving room for the 
distributor add value capture margin 
breaking down agency sales and what happens when manufacturers direct the 
vast majority distributor revenue booked from buying inventory from 
manufacturers then selling through their salesforce which produces gross revenue 
however some supplier relationships are based the agency model where 
distributors not take possession the products but rather take orders forward 
them suppliers and the manufacturers invoice the sale directly and fulfill providing 
commission the distributor that they then record net revenue rather than the 
full sale price this agency sales model primarily the vet market and typically 
produces similar slightly lower ebit margins for distributors the commission 
revenue mostly drops the bottom line though distributors generally prefer full sales 
where they hold inventory credit risk and can see more upside lately more 
manufacturers have been going back from agency sales models towards more 
traditional buy sell relationships such novartis and zoetis and revenue can 
grossed for distributors when these relationships flip from agency buy sell 
some cases where manufacturers have direct selling agreement with buying 
groups our checks indicate they may use distributors provide the logistics and 
delivery the product but not provide sales commission which lower margin 
business distributors seek avoid they still have support salesforce that going 
unused more manufacturers move towards this direct model and rely distributors 
only for fulfillment that would impact their margins

large distributors are particularly important the value chain concentrated medical 
products delivered through animal feeds mfas including antibacterials and

regulatory changes that reduce eliminate their use the europe already went 
through similar transition the time the commission passed rules ban 
medicated feed preventive measure growth promoter and the fda 
more recently proposed limit antibiotics used production animal feed water

the rationale behind reducing medicated feeds animal production relates concerns 
over the development antibiotic resistant infections humans that eat meat treated 
with antibiotics which has been ongoing debate for years note these regulations 
impact medically important antibacterials used for growth promotion that are important 
for therapeutic use humans such penicillin but does not directly impact therapies 
used treatment control prevention the pharmaceuticals team estimates 
only global antibacterials are the which are used for growth 
promotion driving risk total animal production revenues exposed this fda 
ruling expect manufacturers replace lost revenues this space with new 
product types that are not exposed these regulatory concerns supporting the 
distributors pdco has noted the past that only its revenues are feed 
additives though are antibiotics some sort
