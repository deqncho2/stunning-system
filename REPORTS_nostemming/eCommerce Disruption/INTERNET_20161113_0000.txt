global insight 
our survey shows the ota channel proving relatively more resilient with ota user penetration stable expected only fall 
over the next months this far better than users expectations around hotels websites penetration expected fall 
and hotel call walk demand expected fall 
these trends combined with growing airbnb substitution away 
from hotels may make the hotels even more dependent the 
otas for volume second the leading otas continue building out 
their non hotel inventory bed breakfasts apartments etc and 
think this growing product selection will make them stronger 
competitors against airbnb third see the otas search marketing expertise and sheer dollar spend annually being difficult barriers for airbnb surmount remain pcln because 
online travelers increasingly look shop across hotels and vacation rentals one site see pcln and growing alt

airbnb threat airbnb will gain most its market share the expense traditional hotels further since airbnb mainly 
used college students and millennials airbnb future impact could materially larger these users may stay with the 
sharing economy and therefore not book traditional hotel rooms frequently their current user base however there 
growing optimism that positive macro drivers will accelerate revpar growth irrespective airbnb 
our view 
had previously underappreciated the risk airbnb both hotels occupancy and pricing power our updated survey 
data show that airbnb users have shifted demand from traditional hotel stays and airbnb usage growing faster 
than thought this has supported weaker than expected revpar growth and that should continue into and 
beyond while only traditional hotel demand today expect airbnb grow the resulting 
impact the hotel industry annual occupancy drag per year and expect revpar will prove impacted 
rising and our compression night and demand multiplier analyses 
support our concerns around airbnb cannibalization 
where could wrong 
approximately room nights for the lodging industry are generated business stays versus for leisure
