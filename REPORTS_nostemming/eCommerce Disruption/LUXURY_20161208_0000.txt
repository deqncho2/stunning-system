luxury digital debates 
navigating the digital gap 
luxury brands look digitalisation boost top lines 
low growth world examine what this might look like how 
much could cost the risks and opportunities for those that 
get right also benchmark brands progress date 
luxury brands have been slow adopt digital the sector has largely held back 
from developing online presence given price transparency the medium and 
the associated challenges exclusivity and brand control particular online 
counterfeits however price and space growth slow luxury brands are 
focusing the omni channel opportunity capture consumer mind share and 
the potential for operational efficiencies from big data 
what does digitalisation entail drawing work from our capital goods 
colleagues identify building blocks underpinning digitalisation efforts 
hardware software collection and use data sensing and organisational setup the investment required not prohibitive but creating the organisational setup ensure strategy coordinated across divisions could more challenging 
investment levels are unlikely barrier with digitalisation efforts still 
nascent stage for most brands look the internet and capital goods 
sectors for indications how much luxury peers might need invest map 
out framework for beginner intermediate and advanced levels digital 
competence and consider the investments time and money needed each our 
analysis finds that luxury groups are likely see several years elevated 
investment estimate least capex across the sector 
achieve meaningful digital competence think this entails shift away from 
physical store investment the major brands 
who leading using this framework benchmark our stocks digital 
positioning today have been tracking brands commerce social media 
capabilities since end and note that gucci has shown the greatest 
improvement our latest benchmarking burberry gucci and louis vuitton are 
leaders brands that rank less well our analysis will need step digital 
investment they are close the gap with peers think however 
concede that not every brand may want pursue digitalisation the business 
indeed would view digital commerce enabler rather than 
fundamental driver strong product and effective marketing continue 
underpin brand success 
what are the risks cultural resistance digital could slow the development 
commerce capabilities while the online channel poses challenges preserving 
brand exclusivity well monitoring returns investment brands could also 
invest the wrong areas and not benefit from digitalisation the business 
improving efficiencies through big data

luxury why the focus digital now 
digital competence for luxury brands still early stage despite the growing 
importance digital the consumer luxury has been slow adopt luxury groups 
have typically emphasised the importance exclusivity and the store experience this arguably odds with the online channel which has few any barriers access 
historically luxury brands have prioritised investment towards improving distribution 
control brands may have found tension between the desire control branding 
maintain historical global pricing structures and develop strong online presence 
historically online sales channels luxury goods have also tended associated 
with counterfeit and grey market goods 
but the luxury sector has increasingly flagged digital priority after period 
price driven growth the sector brands are refocusing boosting store traffic and 
controlling costs the current slower growth environment brands like gucci have 
observed uplift traffic and sales following the launch revamped more userfriendly website support its new product launches and expect that omnichannel service burberry click collect return store supportive traffic sales 
densities physical stores digitalising operations can enable luxury peers make 
productivity and efficiency gains two ways incremental traffic stores and 
improved inventory supply chain and crm management with low penetration ecommerce and social media luxury peers there opportunity boost direct 
consumer engagement particularly younger consumers spend increasing amounts 
time online 
mckinsey survey found that brands 
that are not consumer initial 
short list have only chance 
being purchased eventually over 
luxury purchases come from brands 
present the consumer initial 
consideration 
and brands that develop the best competence can potentially gain share 
think that omni channel retail and digital engagement are key ways for brands 
boost physical store traffic our recent chinese internet commerce conference 
highlighted the fast growth commerce and social media among chinese 
nationals mckinsey digital inside get wired for the ultimate luxury experience july 
found that least luxury shoppers will exposed every piece 
brand content created either the brand consumers the survey also 
concluded that brands that are not consumer initial short list have only 
chance being purchased eventually over luxury purchases come 
from brands present the consumer initial consideration this highlights how 
brands can capture mind and wallet share being channel omnipresent 
particularly online 
view digital commerce enabler rather than fundamental driver 
brand success strong product and effective marketing the emotional aspirational 
connection between luxury and the consumer remain the key foundations 
successful brand further enabled its digital capabilities key challenge for luxury 
brands therefore when managing digital presence maintaining exclusivity medium 
with few any barriers access contrast food retailers ocado thirdparty retailers asos net porter building luxury brand digital competence not 
just about improving logistics and customer convenience there also degree risk 
brand image the use and sharing brand assets difficult control online 
where think digital competence does give brands edge through driving 
traffic stores through omni channel services click collect and 
improved personalised customer service omnipresence across networks which 
increase brand equity and closing the feedback loop between consumers and the 
brand 
this report focus commerce competence the centrepiece digitalisation 
outline three scenarios how brands might invest develop commerce 
competence and scale look progression from third party outsourcing solutions 
through brand managed executed solutions including localisation and 
personalisation services and advanced data capture use for each stage attempt 
gauge the time and investment required and use elements our digital strategy 
framework assess level overall brand digital competence then benchmark the 
luxury players the development their commerce capabilities date 
inside this report 
digital who ranks best far benchmark luxury peers across range 
metrics assess their commerce capabilities those brands that rank 
well are well placed gain share while those that rank poorly may require 
accelerated investments 
framing digital investments three scenarios look range internet 
companies gauge the potential capex and opex required for broad 
stages digital competence beginner intermediate advanced brands 
invest expect them progress through these stages and consider the 
risks they may face the process 
how can investors assess digital strategy propose point 
framework for investors gauge the effectiveness digital strategy 
the problem with digital the medium can open problems

management 
appendix benchmarking methodology 
appendix case studies 
digital who leading far 
benchmarking the peer group digital competence have aggregated the available 
information company assess how brands compare with peers terms their 
digital capabilities see appendix benchmarking methodology our view brands that 
have progressed furthest developing digital competence are better placed gain 
share all else equal those that rank less well could require accelerated investments 
develop competence and prevent share loss 
hard luxury has typically been behind soft luxury digital progress but changes could 
coming the hard luxury segment has typically been less focused digital progress 
largely owing much higher asps and greater reliance wholesale distribution 
however slower end demand driving the need engage consumers and think 
watch brands may need embrace digitalisation particular commerce starting 
point for example ynap recently announced that richemont owned iwc partnering 
with net porter sell iwc watches the platform including skus over 
richemont also commented its interim results that restructuring operations 
anticipation secular changes due the growing importance digital consumers 
soft luxury burberry louis vuitton and gucci look better positioned our 
analysis continue encouraged the changes made gucci brand beginning 
with new content driven website launched early which think will sustain 
consumer engagement given burberry leadership embracing technology are not 
surprised see ranks well our metrics have been positively surprised how 
well moncler and tod rank commerce and social media and expect the next stage 
the development true omnichannel competence and using data influence 
operational decisions 
framing digital investments three scenarios 
starting point for thinking about the investments that brands will need 
make digitalise focus investments related commerce think 
this basic element for digitalised company and consider three scenarios 
benchmarking capex opex spend against internet companies ynap asos 
covered andrea ferraz and ocado covered francois halconruy and 
capital goods companies focused warehouse automation kion covered 
ben uglow also draw luxury company comments where available 
see appendix case studies for our scenarios for examples 
building digital competence 
look investments that the luxury peers would need make they progress 
along digital competence scale limit our analysis investment for commerce 
competence think that central brand digital footprint the channel also 
obvious and important means providing data for crm which feeds into marketing 
product development and supply chain management assume that other expenses 
such hiring data analytics team expanding digital marketing require shift 
spending mix rather than meaningful step costs 
outline three broad scenarios where brands might the digital investment 
scale estimating the time and cost required for each stage see next page 
basic investment our first scenario where brand the early stages 
developing commerce and chooses outsource commerce functions think 
this could the choice for smaller niche brands that are unlikely want 
reach meaningful commerce scale 
intermediate investment our next scenario one that think applies most 
the brands basic competence online sales and moving towards true omnichannel single view inventory best class customer service and some datamining capability this also includes insourcing commerce capabilities that 
might run third party 
leading the sector our final scenario where brand already has meaningful 
commerce competence and moving towards sophistication content driven 
sites single crm view localisation commerce and utilisation data for supply 
chain management 
our analysis suggests many brands are moving towards the intermediate stage 
think brands are likely take one two strategies piecemeal investment 
focused mainly commerce digital marketing restructuring the business 
embed digital across divisions would expect those brands intent embracing 
digitalisation adopt the latter approach see how can investors assess digital 
strategy 
developing digital competence multi year process that requires organisational 
change our view adopting cross divisional company wide digital strategy can 
costly time and money and requires cultural openness doing business differently 
consolidating databases warehouses and delivery centres retraining store staff for 
omni channel and managing data collection and usage requires far reaching process and 
organisational shifts for example note the one off costs associated with the yoox 
and nap integration are between and the company own 
estimates note this for full consolidation two entirely separate online businesses 
the group also entered into long term partnership with ibm support the integration 
both businesses and develop capabilities the business evolves 
note however the risks around digital investment given ongoing technological 
developments and ever shorter product cycle and fulfillment times driven pure ecommerce players amazon net porter think that there risk that brands 
are drawn into perpetual investment cycle arms race where brands accelerate 
digital spend gain edge over peers digital capex could remain higher levels with 
limited incremental gains see the nordstrom case study below 
investments digital can involve high degree uncertainty 
nordstrom covered kimberly greenberger has been building its ecommerce business since the company was early adopter 
multichannel fulfillment pooling inventory systems beginning and 
implementing cross channel fulfillment this drove ecommerce 
penetration sales mse from nordstrom notes 
customers who shop multiple channels spend more and are more loyal 
and this has driven efficiency gains nordstrom implemented 
system that enabled first look for inventory where store might about 
take markdown the system could also fulfill from stores where item 
was turning slowly 
but commerce investment outpaced top line growth management 
guided for technology investment going forward this grew 
year guidance year plan and rose again 
commerce investments capex previous year 
which weighed margins slow top line environment light slowing 
commerce growth over the past few quarters and tougher operating 
environment management has guided flat spend technology and

how can investors assess digital strategy 
are beginning see range strategies adopted the luxury peers some 
brands are prioritising consumer engagement over commerce convenience lower 
commerce fulfilment service but strong customer service live chat mobile userfriendly website ability for consumer locate product store via website which 
could drive incremental traffic into stores louis vuitton falls into this category this 
approach has the advantage maintaining consumer store experience the 
brand and some measure exclusivity other brands especially those which have 
lagged peers commerce development have chosen focus third party 
wholesale prada chanel net porter this quicker way develop online 
presence and offer consumers commerce services however could restrict the 
brand control the consumer experience environment and additional data insights 
from the third party platform might limited costly 
once brand has embarked digital strategy how can investors assess whether the 
investments digital competence are relevant and effective initially least returns 
digital investment can difficult assess brands test different tools moreover 
the fragmented and anonymous nature digital can make tracking difficult brands 
focus developing digital competence drive share gains there could 
inefficient digital investment arms race prolonged ongoing developments digital 
technologies 
borrow the building blocks used our capital goods team analysis 
digitalisation their sector digital manufacturing the tipping point deep dive 
september for luxury company capitalise the digital opportunity will 
need have capabilities hardware flexible warehousing and supply chain 
software processing capability systems appropriate database management and 
sensing means data collection and analysis add fourth block organisation 
think that the organisational set and culture around digital are key driving 
progress although many luxury peers have capabilities some these blocks few 
have full competence across all the categories companies that ranked well our 
analysis have strong competence some the building blocks but have yet develop 
competence across all the blocks our view 
exhibit building blocks for digital competence would overlay organisation culture 
fourth block 
morgan stanley research 
suggest the following preliminary framework for assessing the extent which 
brands have adopted comprehensive and cohesive digital strategy 
hardware how nimble the supply chain and fulfillments infrastructure 
consumers become increasingly demanding around online shopping and customer 
experience the central proposition for luxury brands brands need have the 
infrastructure offer convenience the shopper every stage the purchasing 
journey they also need have the capability adjust the supply chain according 
data gathered within seasons 
software how flexible and robust the infrastructure that supports the brand 
omni channel processes for luxury peers operating globally the underlying 
software needs able talk across different regions warehouse systems and 
legacy databases the consumer landscape changes the luxury company also needs 
able update its capability simple way the more flexible the systems the 
less costly future investments will 
sensing how data collected and used the broader digital discussion for any 
company has progressed from omni channel how the digital channel can offer brands 
data drive supply chain and marketing efficiencies slower top line environment 
think this could important differentiator for brands and drive share gains 
executed well broad based digital competence the only channel that enables brands 
build granular picture each consumer why how when and what they consume 
social media content commerce see disruptions and productivity growth the next 
decade the digital revolution sept for details how digitalisation creates 
opportunities for businesses drive productivity 
organisational how cross divisional digital within the group for digital efforts 
agile and effective especially technology develops there should crossorganisational responsibility and accountability this because digital investment 
returns are better maximised when digital competence goes beyond just commerce 
digital marketing closing the consumer brand feedback loop this difficult point 
quantify but imagine organisation with teams silos engaging digital marketing 
commerce fulfillment and not dialogue with supply chain product design this 
could lead overlaps and useful data not being fully exploited even captured 
the problem with digital 
digital raises many questions answers for the brands the medium term 
number these are insoluble this stage but expect them among the issues 
that management teams will grappling with the next months and beyond 
how digital investment expected impact future growth 
how can luxury brand manage omnipresent yet exclusive 
what are the biggest hurdles digitising the business 
how does brand ensure that the digital strategy permeates the organisation 
how does management judge roi digital spend 
could brands get drawn into perpetual digital investment cycle technologies 
continue advance 
how easy difficult for brands recruit the right skills for example data 
analytics database managers builders software engineers 
how brands navigate the growing popularity multi brand platforms 
how does the brand view collaborations with bloggers influencers and should this 
become meaningful share marketing spend 
when too much focus digital bad thing 
appendix benchmarking methodology 
use our digital framework compare the soft luxury peers our coverage universe 
evaluate where brand its digital competence journey brands that are behind 
the peer group may have invest more for longer period based our scenario 
analysis digital investments brands that are leading should have competitive 
advantage which could drive share gains 
given variations the level disclosure and the different commerce strategies the 
brands are adopting would not view the numbers our scoring too definitively and 
would overlay these with our digital strategy building blocks for broader assessment

case studies 
warehouse automation case study hugo boss 
although not think that hugo boss the stage digitalisation are 
considering this advanced scenario localisation etc look its 
warehouse automisation efforts example investments required 
hugo boss expecting low double digit million increase capex for 
due the automation and upgrading its main warehouse the new 
warehouse will able process returns and exchanges addition order 
fulfilment think warehouse capex automation key prior boss 
upgrading and sourcing warehousing capabilities the brand was unable 
carry out season replenishment for online sales and returns were 
automatically directed off price channels now the brand able process 
returns and resell the returns full price boosting gross margin capture 
hugo boss invested distribution centre 
which can service various fulfilment channels not think many luxury 
peers would make similarly significant capex investment this more likely 
for brand such adidas that would need scale builds commerce 
capabilities 
note that boss multiyear period consolidation its crm databases 
the brand started but does not expect data consolidated and
