base case scenario assumptions 
for the base case assume the morgan stanley house 
official china gdp forecast for and for 
overall the base case scenario china would 
continue its long and bumpy path reform and deleveraging 
with overall eps growth for msci china running cagr 
versus consensus and with target 
forward these assumptions combined would 
generate our base case target 
would envisage the base case range bound shanghai 
share market within range the 
shanghai composite range bound gently higher 
share market would allow time for further connect program 
southbound flows into the hong kong markets allowing 
further closing the discount which currently stands for 
the dual listed stocks 
would also expect continued profound earnings and 
performance divergence between old economy sectors 
the one hand and new economy and the rest mainly 
financials and telecoms the other see the last section 
this report for our analysts bottom views their coverage 
universe well stock ideas 
bull case scenario assumptions 
the bull case scenario for the offshore china equity indices 
would involve range bound higher share market further 
aggressive policy stimulus and sharper than base case 
upturn economic activity and earnings into year end 
and beyond would anticipate generalized upswing 
earnings and eps cagr for msci china 
for well above consensus expectations this scenario 
would expect the market rate trade forward 
this would generate upside current 
levels with msci china target 
bear case scenario assumptions 
our bear case scenario would involve further worsening 
macro economic momentum with persistent deflation the 
old economy sectors arising from high leverage and excess 
capacity gradually weakening the overall economy growth 
trajectory policy stimulus might fail gain traction this 
scenario due inadequate credit demand and 
insufficiently rapid development the consumer and services 
sectors the situation could noticeably worsened the 
share market succumbs rapid sell off similar that seen 
given that the household sector now has 
relatively high margin balance risk around 
gdp this scenario would expect generalized 
downswing earnings with msci china earnings falling 
cagr this scenario the market 
currently trading forward but would 
expect rating due adverse earnings delivery and target 
forward this would generate downside 
from current levels for msci china with bear case target 
share market deterioration risk return poses 
threat shares 
the share market becomes more connected with the 
hong kong equity market presents both opportunities and 
threats msci china and shares performance overall 
view these finely balanced and consistent with our new

the opportunities are generated the shanghai hong kong 
stock connect program onshore liquidity now has 
official channel spill over hong kong and help rate the 
market saw some the power this factor with the 
strong market gains last month however risks are also

staples expect some earnings growth recovery for 
staples from margin improvement benefiting from raw material 
tailwinds however top line growth could diverge among subsectors believe pricing power and product innovation will 
become more important drivers for sales and market share 
gain continue prefer downstream dairy structural 
margin improvement with mix upgrade and operating 
leverage and liquor segment fundamental recovery and 
branding power within staples 
discretionary think the consumer discretionary sector 
will continue hurt commerce cannibalization and 
lackluster macro environment china this year department 
store sssg has been severely affected pre paid card 
slowdown from anti corruption impact luxury sales and ecommerce cannibalization and while the trough behind 
and the decline narrowing think these issues are 
structural and don expect meaningful recovery sssg

impending rate cuts may and headline inflation increased 
quarter quarter qoq and year year this was slightly above 
consensus and forecast qoq due higher fuel detraction 
against expectations the rba underlying measures are tracking 
both year ended and month annualized basis according our 
economist underlying inflation trends point weak pricing power across the 
retail sector tradeables inflation petrol confirmation our 
consumer team view price war supermarkets with inflation across food 
and beverage just softening rental market rents qoq and 
ann booming supply starts catch with the prior under build 
goldilocks private domestic inflation down slightly from average 
over softening labour market but not playing into the lowflation fears 
other regions and inflation regulated services remains high outside the 
carbon tax repeal with over inflation across education child care health 
services and council rates thus economist expects the inflation backdrop 
benign and thereby expects the rba cut the cash rate may further 
also expected that rba will cut rates for third time with the 
widening gap between resilient aud and falling commodity prices please note 
that the aud usd almost back the levels was trading before the surprise

brazil macro economic background 
growth adjustment painful for brazil recession this year and near 
growth next along with rising joblessness and some rates cuts 
the end which are function the severity the recession 
bit mixed blessing over the past four years our latam economist arthur 
carvalho has been highlighting how brazil growth struggles have resulted 
from combination external conditions and series policy mistakes 
only natural that shift policy choices can turn brazil growth outlook 
constructive until the record strong real effective exchange rate created 
enormous competitiveness challenge hitting output but the same time 
boosting consumption while arthur always argued that the structural solution 
boost growth brazil would tackle its human institutional and 
infrastructure bottlenecks arthur has also believed that the misguided policy 
mix the past few years was intensifying the problems creating further 
inflationary pressures and increasing the risk premium

policy response lead deep contraction and ongoing recession 
however our russia economists have revised their growth forecast 
marginally and for three reasons they 
include the earlier monetary easing from the cbr slightly higher oil price 
assumptions barrel and and somewhat 
better than expected incoming data barring strong rebound 
oil prices the lifting sanctions our russia economists see the 
recession persisting unlike the shaped rebound with ongoing 
risk further sanctions 
our russia economists expect inflation average driven 
the rub depreciation and food import ban our russia economists 
expect cuts end rather than the previously

thailand macro economic background 
domestic demand being dull policy responses would one area that 
could drive any upside growth surprise indeed the fiscal deficit 
planned smaller than the actual fiscal deficit 
however total new borrowing the government and soes expected 
mof for relatively similar the new borrowing 
fiscal disbursement has also not been faster than average year 
laying rest hopes that government expenditure could front loaded 
support growth before private sector domestic demand kicks feb 
disbursement budget expenditure stood what planned for

combination factors suggests that private sector domestic demand 
unlikely drive growth recovery domestic demand recovery postcoup environment before the return democratically elected fully 
functioning government tends more subdued than regular growth 
cycle this suggests that although coup oddly provides some semblance 
political stability the political shock exerts slow but lasting impact growth 
momentum this stage elections still not appear likely until highfrequency macro indicators such private consumption index and private 
investment index corroborate the view non vigorous recovery growth 
momentum has remained tepid private sector balance sheets remain 
overextended and digestion past excesses would hinder near term growth 
momentum surely fall oil price has positive terms trade impact for 
thailand relative some the other asean economies given its oil trade 
deficit however with its overextended balance sheet suspect the marginal 
propensity invest and the marginal propensity consume likely lower 
this cycle incremental savings are channeled toward debt repayment
