executive summary 
there increasing debate malls are expensive 
cheap mall reit valuations have declined from their 
peak july given combination rising interest 
rates and accelerating store closures they stand one 
the worst performing subsector over that period time 
and are currently trading near weeks lows currently

understandable why the severity the sell off may have 
caught the market off guard been bull market for reits 
generally and mall reits specifically for the vast majority the past 
years driven combination rising cre prices and declining 
year treasury yields the only two prior bumps the road came 
and 
source snl financial thomson reuters morgan stanley research 
but believe isn overdone for two primary reasons 
dcf shines spotlight growth 
total returns are normalizing indeed mall reits were the second 
best performing subsector trailing only storage from until 
easy blame pervasive negative sentiment with ffo multiples 
the end july producing compounded annual total returns 
standing their lowest levels years and discounts nav 
compounded annual total returns since now stand 
historically wide levels but think that too simplistic sharper 
the middle the pack 
focus future growth leads look beyond valuation 
anchoring bias the past years which the exception and not 
methodologies based net asset value nav and funds from 
the norm while current ffo multiples are below the year 
operations ffo multiples discounted cashflow dcf 
average they are more fairly valued compared longer term 
analysis 
averages fact prior the financial crisis mall reit multiples

affo may understate the level total capex adjusted only 
broader real estate cycle began its acceleration driven the 
for non revenue producing capex maintenance and tenant 
unprecedented availability debt 
improvements and excludes revenue producing capex including 
redevelopment vacant anchors but both may necessary 
the future preserve the value some malls 
morgan stanley research 
nav may backwards looking price discovery class malls 
longer term valuation the properties 
are limited since they rarely trade cap rates may therefore not 
increase leverage cbl could draw the 
capture changes noi and interest rates well capex 
availability its revolving credit facility however increasing 
requirements that party buyer may expect the future 
leverage may not positive for the multiple given the markets 
are more comfortable with cap rates class malls given 
focus stronger balance sheets this point the cycle 
increased transaction volumes 
sell more assets cbl generated net proceeds last 
dcf analysis consistent with the valuation cre alternatives 
year from dispositions that were used reduce leverage well 
investment real estate property and commercial mortgage 
fund capital expenditures while this was financing source for 
backed securities cmbs bonds most commonly use dcf 
them was significantly dilutive ffo and cash flow 
their valuation methodology 
cut the dividend our view this would not solve the underlying 
problems and reduces the attractiveness shares value 
two key but differing debates emerge 
after the sell off class malls price the 
death malls 
investors assume dividend cut with 
dividend payments reinvested into the portfolio yield 
then this would add incremental noi year 
offsetting the annual decline forecast over the 
next three years however note that the returns relative 
their cost capital not compelling especially consider 
our dcf analysis reveals that the stock prices spg mac and tco 
that there inherent execution risk with development projects 
are all pricing positive growth ranging from minimum for 
and occupancy rents both may lower than what has 
spg maximum for mac this suggests that class 
historically been underwritten 
multiples are under pressure not because malls are dying but 
rather because growth may slowing given the inherent cyclical 
what are the debt markets telling while cbls equity and the 
nature commercial real estate and the secular challenges facing 
cmbx market are pricing greater risk for lower quality malls the 
retail result believe investors should focused 
corporate bond market has been more complacent with spreads 
class mall reits ability deliver the growth that stock 
tightening ytd over the near term disconnects between equity and 
valuations are currently implying 
cmbx may create relval opportunities summarize our views 
below and see cbl debt equity disconnect for further analysis 
bottom line our view spg best positioned but not insulated 
from the broader retail trends are more cautious mac and 
corporate bond market for investors that want long cbl 
tco but remain given potential privatization risk are 
equity hedging with the company senior 
underweight wfd their aggressive development pipeline over the 
unsecured cash bonds these bonds are trading around 
next years means execution risk high will take long time 
price and have actually tightened since the company 
see meaningful free cash flow growth 
priced the offering december our view either the 
equity too bearish the debt isn bearish enough worth 
class mall valuations reflect slowing growth 
but they have enough cash maintain value 
nothing cds higher quality mall reits have widened while the 
cash bond market has been more resilient 
cmbx the price cbl stock has disconnected lower from the 
for cbl the bull versus bear debate centers around terminal 
price cmbx which the opposite what occurred last 
value either the stock buy offers extreme value given its 
september the difference between the dividend yield cbl 
dividend yield sell the challenges facing the 
and the spread bps now stands near all time 
company are accelerating 
wides bps this presents opportunity with four potential 
scenarios sell cbl you think the debt markets are right about 
remain underweight see four paths going forward for 
default risk buy cbl you think the retail story overblown 
the company all which have their own challenges 
buy cmbx you think malls are risk but the timing losses 
well the future and sell cmbx you believe the equity 
cutting capital expenditures the company could choose invest 
less money their malls but comes the expense the 
markets are sending message that losses will sooner than 
anticipated
