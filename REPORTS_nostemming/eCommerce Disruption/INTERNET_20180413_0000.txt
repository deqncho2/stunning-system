dominated three companies yamato holdings sagawa express and nippon express 
which together command about the market but industry leader yamato 
holdings expecting parcel delivery volumes decline and amid current 
volume controls under such conditions major online retailers are working 
strengthen house distribution capabilities specific examples include amazon 
creation distribution network using smaller delivery companies well askul 
stepped recruitment its house distribution department rakuten also renewing 
efforts bolster its distribution division and testing out new delivery matching 
system will following such efforts closely particularly those rakuten where

basic low end fashion several new platforms are starting owing the active

have positive view the fashion space fields with high barriers entry 
that firms need aware and deal with over the medium long term generally 
when apparel maker selects the sales channels for its products wants have 
control over brand promotion prices and channel strategy result imperative 
for the operator business establish relationships with fashion brands 
addition when there are many stock keeping units skus even for the same product 
possible differentiate them through the posted images and the way the products 
are presented and believe that this field category which can leveraged 
ways that beyond the maker own distribution network and buying power the

number malls have been started perhaps result start today 
success however think zozotown will retain its superiority for while after 
the start amazon fashion amazon september several large malls 
were launched short period time including mall mitsui fudosan service 
started november and stripe department stripe international and softbank 
service started february far mall and stripe department are concerned 
the malls look well stocked with more than brands being offered for sale 
directly after the launches the other hand the present time not think that 
either these malls will present immediate threat zozotown 
regarding mall purchasing can carried out seamlessly between the internet and 
real stores however the real stores where items can bought are limited those 
located commercial centers operated mitsui fudosan such lalaport 
qualify for free delivery customer needs make purchase one shop totalling 
least with some exceptions this because the distribution network the shop 
where the purchase made will used and possible that the characteristics 
these malls will not necessarily appeal all users furthermore considering that 
ilumine which operated east japan railway and has similar set posted 
turnover only not expect that mall will present very much 
threat zozotown the near future 
for stripe department this mall targeting customers the segment 
women from years old and the avg unit price its products thus 
believe that stripe department has embraced different strategic direction than 
zozotown which expanding its trade area from the segment also include the

household subscription rate amazon prime remains low japan just this 
backdrop acquiring prime members remains high the priority list for amazon japan

significant margin believe more likely strategy for absorbing higher costs the 
near term raise handling fees charges sellers fba handling fees are already being 
raised from apr and media reports have said nikkei march although

lohaco askul case the company entered the general consumables market 
with the goal beating amazon has sales approx may 
its logistics setup and own products offered through collaborations with various makers 
are receiving high reviews but our impression that with recent and gradual shift 
approach balancing earnings and growth lags somewhat price competitiveness 
when comes products shipped large quantities believe the key from the 
consumers perspective the marked price customers see rather than the actual price 
that reflects loyalty point rewards 
rakuten case rakuten has secured solid business footing through the acquisition 
kenkocom and sokai drug has sales the order dec while 
also has potential tie with walmart lined the line food supermarket 
business whether this initiative will successful remains seen the company also

japan market global comparison lower penetration than peers

reason for lower penetration and why has the move 
fmcg been slower than other goods categories short the 
convenience existing offline stores 
high level convenience existing network offline stores believe offline 
businesses japan offer high level service not just price but also areas such 
the range merchandise though partially subjective impression think the high 
level convenience from long opening hours offline players and price 
competitiveness beneficial users stemming from the presence multiple outlets 
including those competitors short distances from each other long way 
satisfying customers hence think that rub shoulders with offline players online 
operators will need ensure that they are price competitive

comparison leading service providers amazon the winner finely tuned 
service enabled its party focus rakuten and yahoo shopping seek raise 
overall marketplace appeal via enhanced points programs the main items 
importance users online shopping our survey were price low delivery 
charges and high data security and believe that all three these items 
amazon rated more highly users than rakuten yahoo shopping 
firstly with regard price and data security judge very likely that amazon 
scores highly with users who like its fluid approach setting prices competitively and 
perceive the basis its party focus that risk personal data being disseminated 
lower than the marketplace format further where low delivery charges are 
concerned too think amazon likely have the edge thanks amazon prime

therefore think the earnings impact would have been modest start today aiming 
for operating margin roughly par with current zozotown levels gmv
