wearable devices 
what exactly are wearables anyway 
morgan stanley blue paper 
wearables specifically are mobile electronic devices that are 
worn the body attached embedded clothes and 
accessories these mini computers and sensors can display 
process gather information and tend have wireless 
communication capabilities logical extension past 
computing cycles from desktop computers notebooks 
more recently tablets and smartphones each device 
becomes more personal and portable 
what will drive this next tech trend 
persistent identity the killer feature while the market 
sees wearables way shrink and mobilize computing 
beyond smartphones today see much more differentiated 
and disruptive use cases the lesser talked about feature 
apple watch something call persistent identity when 
user first puts apple watch asked for 
personal pin confirm their identity sensors the back 
the watch provide constant contact allowing apps know 
with high degree certainty who controlling the device 
why does this matter because users can now streamline 
many day day processes like making payments unlocking 
starting cars automating security and heat air hvac 
technologies home accessing office buildings and 
business value creation even greater the back sensor 
analytics examples which highlight below 
factory process and efficiency monitoring 
manufacturing companies can monitor employee 
efficiency and improve processes the factory floor 
credit card safety and efficiency credit card issuers 
can reduce fraud while also increasing usage and 
customer satisfaction and volumes 
payments become even more interesting wearables 
wearables can significantly reduce the time complete 
transaction limiting the need take wallet smartphone 
out user pocket and confirming purchase with pin 
signature see this even more convenient 
experience versus the same technology smartphone 
importantly ease use leads higher volumes which 
means merchants card networks card issuers and payment 
platforms like apple pay potentially all win 
what did 
conducted alphawise surveys device consumers 
seven countries germany france china japan and 
brazil 
spoke experts from many companies including start ups 
and private companies semiconductor and component suppliers 
consulting companies enterprise and government cios well 
leading consumer electronics vendors 
two killer apps sensor analytics and mobile 
payments 
sensor analytics extension the internet things 
iot computing cycle consider the following logical 
extension having iot depot your wrist 
benchmarked five popular fitness trackers over several weeks 
determine the strengths and weaknesses the products the 
market today 
analyzed past consumer electronics products particular 
initial product ramps combined this analysis with the data points 
above arrive our forecast the size and growth the 
wearables market 
personal data collection wearable device collects 
personal physical data activity health and location 
about specific individual which can influence behavior 
and used industries drive business value 
behavior based retail promotions retailer can 
better understand how customers spend time their 
stores and provide targeted coupons information 
about product 
customized auto insurance auto insurance 
companies can determine premiums based 
consumer behavior that influences their safety 
automobile 
drug monitoring pharmaceutical companies can 
improve prescription fill rates and doctors can better 
monitor pill intake 
note because appears the most advanced device

wearable devices 
current vendors and market share 
morgan stanley blue paper 
first size the existing market rank the brands and 
examine the current use cases estimate only 
wearables were shipped globally over pcs 
and over smartphones shipments should increase 
significantly mainly due samsung entering 
the market with its gear line september and quickly 
becoming the top vendor all the major brands focus health 
tracking though some offer other functions similar 
smartphones 
wearable ownership still very low today our proprietary 
alphawise survey indicates respondents own 
wearables surveyed consumers the 
germany france japan and brazil august 
surveyed another consumers china but the data 
only used for select analyses for emerging markets 
consider the responses reflect the most affluent 
the population the wearable ownership much higher 
think this partially because most wearable startups are based the 
interestingly traditional watch ownership quite high 
line with smartphones tablet ownership also high 
close notebooks and desktops already just over four 
years after the ipad launched contrast chromebook 
ownership still very low though the ownership

group our review into three categories price form 
and functionality every device has its strengths and 
weakness but overall see lot room for improvement 
which not surprising for such new market see chart 
below for summary the key metrics 
price most fitness trackers the market today are quite 
affordable with the exception the basis carbon steel 
and certain versions the nike fuelband all the 
fitness trackers tried cost between and for 
comparison apple smallest ipod today the shuffle costs 
the ipod nano and ipod touch starts 
major electronics vendors have recently launched 
smartwatches priced premium fitness trackers 
samsung products including the gear and gear 
live have been most popular followed lg 
watch which costs and google moto which costs 
apple watch starts but suspect average 
prices could higher once they are revealed 
form none the fitness trackers tested has 
perfected the balance between fashion and comfort 
wearable definition very personal device and 
expression the user style successful mass marketed 
product needs attractive enough for want wear 
regardless the functionality vendors have balance 
aesthetics comfort and functionality often see devices 
sacrifice one these criteria for the sake another and 
rarely can get the perfect mix interestingly the vast 
majority not all the fitness devices the market are 
androgynous design yet the opposite true for most 
fashion accessories 
source alphawise survey august morgan stanley research 
early adopters likely behave differently from the majority 
while the level usage and sustainable change behavior 
among early wearable adopters encouraging think 
wearables need expand their use cases and improve their 
hardware software and services order gain mainstream 
traction the following section analyze the strengths and 
weaknesses current wearables and then discuss what 
future devices need succeed 
interestingly are still dealing with the same 
challenges years later june the new york 
times interviewed swatch then president and current ceo 
nick hayek about the company upcoming swatch talk 
which watch with phone capabilities hayek said can 
expect people buy monsters first you must nicelooking watch and then can talk about the function 
back the present crowdfunding campaigns reveal that 
early adopters prefer wear their devices their wrists 
morgan stanley research 
november 
wearable devices 
out the most popular crowdfunded campaigns are for 
wrist based 
the 
rdevelopment 
devices 
ite 
surprise that 
all the fitness trackers tested are designed for the wrist 
though the fitbit has other devices that can clipped onto 
clothing all them have rubbery and some cases 
plastic texture 
some product specific observations form 
the jawbone had the best balance fashion and comfort out 
the five our opinion has sleek rubber body the ends taper 
little and have shiny metallic finish 
the fitbit flex initially bright smooth surface begins look worn 
after month daily use however users can take the tracker 
out the band and replace the latter with new one 
the garmin vivofit looks similar the flex except for the clear 
plastic display the tracker while the display allows users check 
their activities and progress against goals also makes the band 
much more obtrusive and the device lot more noticeable when 
worn 
the nike fuelband has simple rubber wristband with display 
made led lights built into the band comes bright neon 
colors addition black and metallic allowing for more 
differentiation among users 
the basis carbon steel clearly favors functionality over wearability 
the thickest and heaviest grams fitness tracker out the 
five the watch face could scratch easily and the black rubber straps 
encounter the same aging issues the other trackers 
while did not try this device note that adidas launched the 
micoach october has built gps heart rate monitor 
bluetooth music capabilities and color touchscreen initial 
feedback indicates that battery life has been disappointing for the 
price point 
functionality products need broaden use cases 
order gain mass adoption order have sustained 
engagement for mass adopters future wearables must 
increase the number use cases they continue interact 
with users and add insight and value their lives 
most products tested break the two second rule users 
will become frustrated and are likely give machine 
takes more than two seconds compute operation and 
return control the user according paper ibm 
psychologist robert miller today simply call 
ease use user experience ideally this means 
should not take more than two three steps for users find 
what they need device our view even more 
important for wearables since users are often trying access 
something the device while the and there very 
limited screen real estate and input methods maybe voice 
and some touch commands and very few buttons 
some product specific observations functionality 
both the basis carbon steel and nike fuelband violate the twosecond rule the basis usually takes few minutes sync with the 
smartphone and during this time users cannot close out the basis 
app the fuelband only has the led light display and can 
take while scroll through all the metrics steps calories battery 
life etc get what the user wants 
the fitbit flex jawbone garmin vivofit and nike fuelband 
cannot automatically detect the activities being performed for 
example the user has press button before going sleep and 
reawaken the band when wakes these bands cannot 
automatically detect and place the user body movement into 
activity category and requires the user classify the activities 
gym after synchronizing with smartphone computer some 
devices like the fitbit not have the option tag workouts its 
official app although there are third party apps that that 
the fuelband only provides the length time the user was asleep 
but does not offer details like length rem sleep how many 
times the user woke night 
while the basis has the largest form factor also has the best 
functionality the most automated out the five tested for 
example the display lights when the user flicks his wrist towards 
him herself the device knows whether the user walking 
running cycling when the user goes bed and wakes 
also gives detailed activity breakdowns without the need for tagging 
also note that adidas micoach and myfitnesspal calorie 
counting service have recently announced joint initiative which 
allows data automatically exported from the device 
consumers can compare calories consumed versus burned

alphawise survey implies total market units which 
line with idc estimates estimate shipments 
using similar methodology model shipment 
growth for the top brands but assume lower market shares

major variables that could change our forecasts 
forecast shipments using purchase intention 
from the survey and taking into account apple 
entrance estimate growth demand for 
existing wearable vendors based purchase intentions from 
our alphawise survey asked respondents whether they 
would purchase hypothetical apple device and definitely 
buy responses implied demand all countries

wearables adoption could limited smartphone

computing industry section below wearables have balance 
the tradeoff between adding more sensors and connectivity 
with limited space and battery power even more than 
smartphones and tablets the near term wearables likely 
will not have cellular connectivity alone likely not 
enough for such mobile device requiring pairing with

the case apple think our company and industry

for the company more detail 
just over months after the iphone launch shipments 
penetrated roughly the apple user base the ipad 
achieved penetration one year after launch since then 
the company user base has grown significantly due the 
iphone especially apple introduced lower price points 
recent years although the watch shipments forecast 
for the first months could the fastest product ramp for 
apple actually assume lower user base penetration than 
the ipad 
apple says the watch compatible with iphone newer 
generations and there was installed base over 
such devices the company made the statement early 
september but our estimate suggests likely june 
quarter end number estimate that number will grow 
the end this year therefore the watch 
shipments only account for the compatible installed 
base the over apple user base watch will only

conducted alphawise surveys ahead the iphone and ipad

were below our initial estimate however actual ipad 
shipments beat our estimate over 
see several reasons for the significant upside the ipad 
saw compared the iphone 
the addressable market was not limited carrier 
exclusivity contract break fees and monthly subscriber 
fees 
there was more robust ecosystem with the app store 
the use cases mobile computing and ios were clearer 
many users were already familiar with the iphone

enterprise adoption and subsidies drive our bull case forecast 
estimate wearable shipments and 
units the bull case assume growth 
next year from existing wearable brands this includes all 
respondents that said they definitely would purchase 
products and respondents that said they probably 
will purchase products conservative make the same 
adjustments for respondents who definitely probably 
would purchase apple watch and for the cannibalization

see two major drivers our bull case forecast 
enterprise adoption and subsidies 
enterprise adoption 
far most the attention has been drawn consumer 
applications but wearables also apply enterprise 
environments see the consumer wearables market 
taking off with fitness devices the last couple years and 
with the introduction more general purpose computing 
devices like the apple watch and samsung gear going 
forward shown the survey work the least popular 
wearables use case today however the benefits 
improving efficiencies enterprise could significant the 
long term users could have multiple wearables one for 
personal and one for work use one for fitness and one for 
every day wear companies may purchase subsidize 
wearables for the majority their employees which 
increases the likelihood multiple devices per person 
several the wearables companies and enterprise cios 
spoke point out the significant potential the 
enterprise market while consumers may fickle about 
fashion and social norms they not apply the enterprise 
market the same way for example doctors police officers 
mechanics etc may prefer function over fashion and choose 
wear large head mounted displays though there has been 
some consumer backlash for google glass see large 
long term opportunity change how workers perform their 
jobs but this market even more nascent than the consumer 
market there not ecosystem apps similar some 
the growing pains tablets are experiencing the enterprise 
today that said we already heard anecdotal evidence 
enterprise applications being developed partnership with 
apple 
augmented reality could key technology for the 
enterprise especially for head mounted devices

companies could subsidize wearables 
subsidies from employers and other companies that 
want consumer data could further accelerate adoption 
there are many existing corporate programs that reward 
employees for exercising and believe health insurers 
like car insurers could adopt the lower prices for data 
model see many subsidy models for example google 
and facebook monetize the data their users amazon 
charges more for its kindle reader kindle fire 
tablet consumers not want any advertisements 
health monitoring could see even higher adoption than 
auto insurance usage based auto insurance tends 
attract those who are lower risk drivers since only safe 
drivers benefit from discounted premiums however health 
insurance could potentially offer incentives all types 
customers since both healthy and ill customers could benefit 
for example wearables can remind users take their 
medication detect when they have higher risk heart 
attack

risks wearables adoption 
while believe the wearables market poised hit 
inflection point there are still many challenges 
addressed our discussions with industry experts 
found several key technological issues companies are 
working many have yet find the killer app build 
compelling ecosystem that would convince consumers that 
they need wear the devices consistently and interact with 
them frequently below address key gating factors that 
may limit wearables adoption 
accuracy and power are key technological hurdles that 
can limit consumer and enterprise adoption according 
our conversations with industry experts users will stop using 
the devices and enterprises will not adopt the technology 
data not accurate yet medical grade sensors are 
expensive usually take too much real estate and power 
mobile device and potentially are overkill for this 
purpose battery life even bigger limitation wearables 
compared smartphones tablets the accuracy sensors 
often trade off with battery life addition hassle 
users have take off their wearables often charge them 
just like how many people used and still bring their 
phone charger with them during the day charge their 
smartphones wearables can leverage many the sensors 
developed over the years for smartphones but some new 
sensors still need improve their accuracy and power usage 
see the semiconductors section for further discussion 
another commonly cited challenge with wearables today 
aesthetics and design when the device personal 
and often displayed the body becomes fashion 
statement this means the attractiveness the device very 
important probably more than any other computing device 
that came before and design has stand its own 
regardless the capabilities and usefulness the internal 
technology tory burch recently launched set bracelets 
and pendant that can hold the fitbit flex the nex band 
takes modular approach users can change the sensors 
they wear any time and they even commissioned jewelry 
designers improve the design their beta products 
believe this insight the main reason apple hired several key 
executives from the fashion industry including former 
burberry ceo angela ahrendts former yves saint laurent 
ceo paul deneve former lvmh tag heuer sales 
patrick pruniaux and two former nike designers

addition accuracy and design wearables must 
easy use see broad adoption given the portable form 
factor see screen real estate increasingly more 
valuable and scarce therefore requiring input paradigm 
evolution make devices easy use the early mainframe 
era compute jobs were entered into the system using punch 
cards minicomputers relied keyboard the primary 
input method while the mouse was popularized with the 
adoption the touch became the primary input 
paradigm smartphones which enabled the introduction 
virtual keyboard that effectively doubled the amount real 
estate available handset device see voice the 
logical input mechanism wearables given the small form 
factor which makes touch less user friendly but see need 
for improvements voice recognition technology note

wearable devices 
that apple introduced the digital crown input device for 
apple watch address the challenge the scarce screen 
real estate wearables must also context aware meaning 
they might know your location activity level whether you 
with friend family member etc order offer the right 
notifications interface the right moment this helps 
create sense that the device easy use relevant and 
important the user 
some devices require companion smartphone many 
smartwatches the market today including the forthcoming 
apple watch require pairing with compatible smartphone 
for full functionality while the category benefits from low 
price high potential volume one device per person pcs 
shared across households lack required carrier contract 
and new functionality the smartphone pairing requirement 
could hold back demand near term while not perfect 
parallels the original ipod required mac and demand 
increased the second year when became compatible 
with microsoft windows the original iphone required both 
carrier contract and syncing directly computer the latter 
which longer required due icloud apple has 
shipped more iphones date post the icloud launch 
late than the years before 
behavioral change hard insurance companies 
healthcare providers and even fitness clubs must adjust their 
business models learn analyze new datasets coming from 
fitness trackers and then offer incentives customers 
order drive long term behavior changes fitness tracking 
one several killer apps enabled wearables however 
without sustainable change demand and interest 
wearables could wane before the ecosystem has chance 
develop and enable even more functionality within health 
monitoring and outside 
willingness share personal data critical wearables 
ecosystem while apple has made clear does not plan 
store user data relating payments health etc that would 
not the case with all companies this space believe 
order for the ecosystem and many business models adbased subsidies etc work consumers have 
comfortable with sharing their personal data most consumerfacing online properties such google facebook already 
exchange services for personal data consumers may 
getting used this model fact our survey indicated that 
the majority respondents are willing share data for the 
right incentives 
wearables are causing big data problem companies 
the wearables market are figuring out how collect the data 
but have not yet figured out what with the data devices 
the market today not offer compelling and easy way 
for most consumers digest all the information for example 
should the user increase decrease calorie intake what 
the optimal time for the user exercise software and user 
interfaces are always important and often overlooked 
hardware companies there tremendous opportunity for 
software innovation present the data and partnerships with 
healthcare experts interpret the data through our 
conversations believe the healthcare industry especially 
insurance companies are already looking the potential 
wearables and they may play significant role driving the 
mass adoption these devices one the companies 
spoke numera believes there needs standardization 
data gathered different devices can analyzed 
together 
consumers may get device fatigue addition limited 
enterprise adoption believe another reason tablet 
adoption may slowing consumer fatigue before 
most consumers owned two screens tvs and pcs and 
they were often shared within household since 
consumers own four screens tvs pcs tablets and 
smartphones and they may soon own five more including 
wearables consumers may experience some technology

closed systems advantage vulnerability 
morgan stanley blue paper 
closed systems tend win the early stages new 
markets some the most successful technology 
innovations have occurred when single company had full 
control all aspects product development hardware 
software services and ecosystem the walled garden 
the closed approach often required the early stages 
new product category given the lack standards high risks 
and uncertainties around market adoption and the rapid rate 
innovation iteration 
apple the most well known example the closed 
approach apple favors closed systems which maintains 
control key technologies except for period the when licensed its operating system apple has 
designed developed and integrated much the hardware 
software and services all its devices during the and 
mobile internet computing cycles 
however markets mature standards are set and 
prices fall open systems gain traction some metrics 
linux and intel dominate the server market microsoft and 
intel dominate the market google and samsung have 
been very successful far the smartphone and tablet 
markets important note that past computing cycles 
open systems tended help participants gain unit share 
however not everyone participating open systems wins 
terms revenue and profitability for example estimate 
apple has double digit operating margins its mac business 
while dell and hp businesses have low single digit 
margins apple still makes the majority smartphone profits 
despite having mid teens unit share apple and samsung 
collect most the profits the smartphone market this 
suggests consumers still place premium high quality 
better design ease use strong security and better 
customer support though not all consumers can will pay 
that premium 
wearables will test the closed open systems theory 
first blush easy think history about repeat itself 
apple will disrupt the market with its watch and quickly 
become the market share leader before others catch and 
apple will content the premium brand with high profit 
margins but lower unit share however devices become 
extremely personal more consumers may willing pay for 
better experience comfort the top purchase criterion for 
wearables our survey ahead price even the 
smartphone market some android users are switching 
iphones despite the higher price our alphawise survey 
indicated apple would gain share from samsung and other 
android vendors with larger screen iphones 
ceo tim cook has said apple becoming more open 
some ways the company has worked with car companies 
integrate carplay and currently working with healthcare 
and smart home companies healthkit and homekit apple 
also announced partnership with ibm develop native ios 
applications and cloud services and sell and support the 
devices the enterprise believe both companies could 
extend the collaboration opportunities developing 
applications data analytics and device sales support the 
internet things cycle and wearables these partnerships 
could help apple create better third party ecosystems and 
give edge over less organized consortia open system 
players going forward 
the watch likely just the start portfolio wearable 
products ceo tim cook recently said the next chapter for

more personal than what had before and think the watch

further propel growth the bit space this market 
where bit mcus could still flourish despite the performance 
advantages and bit mcus the bit mcus are 
smaller cheaper and can meet the demands many 
designers addition the low power consumption bit 
offers advantage over higher bit mcus arm has 
introduced the cortex and bit processors 
compete this space low price points but arm not 
necessarily the cheapest solution despite its large ecosystem 
microcontrollers perform array functions and are commonly used 
wide range markets such automotive industrial consumer 
compute and communications with the introduction the internet

address giving the ability communicate with other devices these 
connected processors and microcontrollers perform one more the 
following functions sense measure control and communicate both 
ways furthermore adding connectivity capabilities enables easy access

how would wearables change consumer spending behavior 
with regard wristwatches 
consumers could shift from the traditional view that premium 
watch one off purchase for multiple years rolling spend 
mindset seen across high end consumables the new normal could 
also include the consumer expectation that all wrist worn devices are 
connected with functionality extending beyond time time related features 
while wearable devices could increase watch usage the definition 
exactly what watch might very different 
how might watch retailers and watchmakers respond 
some traditional watchmakers have indicated they will launching 
their own smartwatches whilst others have explored partnerships 
with tech companies our view watch brands most risk are low 
mid range price brands especially those with more masculine 
following and they must evolve keep with the new segment 
however believe that watch retailers will likely remain with the status 
quo and not carry smartwatch devices swiss watch retailers 
china hong kong are currently indifferent towards the smartwatch threat 
retailers not believe they are credible substitute for luxury swiss 
watches however our analysis this report suggests the threat the 
low mid range real and hengdeli most exposed that segment 
functionality touch and its younger predominantly 
male consumer base our research suggests that more 
males than females would buy wearable device 
however expect that apple decision have more 
than one collection will broaden appeal the apple watch 
comes three collections and two sizes and will address 
larger target audience than previously expected pre launch 
consensus expected one watch design and one price point 
addition the interchangeable watch straps that apple has 
designed are more fashionable than pre existing 
smartwatches which believe also poses risk watches 
that are designed jewelry pieces also widens the appeal 
smartwatches female wearers note that this 
apple first foray into the wearables market and expect 
further development both design and functionality this 
space similar the evolution the apple ipod from the 
original ipod the mini shuffle nano and touch

the very high end price brands retail value will 
remain largely unaffected believe whilst consumers 
who purchase timepieces that price range might 
tempted the functionality smartwatches more likely 
that they would purchase smartwatch addition 
traditional watch rather than substituting with smartwatch 
this because consumers tend purchase higher end 
watches for their emotional significance and craftsmanship 
value which believe are criteria largely non applicable 
smartwatches for now 
our view most risk are brands the entry midrange price points and those with strong 
male following these brands include tissot rado and

wearable devices 
wearables are invading the turf traditional watches 
points sale currently retail stores wearables are sold 
with other consumer electronics such smartphones while 
watches have their own separate sales area very few watch 
specialty stores are currently selling wearables however 
wearable brands are fully aware this situation for example 
apple set temporary display section colette paris 
during fashion week think this just the beginning and 
apple plans compete against traditional watches head 
the company made significant investments hiring senior 
retail and marketing experts from luxury brands apple invited 
many journalists covering fashion especially luxury brands 
and high end watches its watch event september 
since then the watch has been featured the cover 
vogue china and apple head designer jony ive has given 
interview vanity fair 
wearables build strong computing platforms 
ultimately think wearable companies plan aggregate all 
information related the user life into central depositories 
such apple health app the utility and convenience these 
ecosystems create may too hard for traditional 
watchmakers overcome users soon would likely not 
able conceive day day lives without these features 
this the future then existing watchmakers could sell 
wearables themselves even they could not realize the same 
level profitability and the risk appearing 
copycats this could become matter survival however 
note that has not yet been established that the wrist 
where wearables should placed non wrist based 
wearables become mainstream think the impact 
existing watchmakers should slight 
over time the watch industry will forced 
modernize and adapt new environment where 
technology companies are also competing for wrist real 
estate this could positive our view younger 
consumers especially those who not currently wear 
watches would introduced wrist worn timepieces and 
could trade over their lifetime higher end swiss watches 
however this still means that wearables could take share from 
low mid range watches the luxury consumer getting 
younger especially the increasingly important emerging 
markets believe the threat traditional watchmakers 
real the near term 
the new normal consumers expect more than 
time basic functions from watches technology and 
fitness companies roll out devices that widen the functionality 
wrist worn devices such activity monitoring interactivity 
connectivity etc consumers could come expect such 
functionality basic features division between the 
purposes devices according price could emerge luxury 
wristwatches could come seen art pieces and 
watches priced lower than that multi functional connected 
devices alternatively the consumer could expect that every 
wrist worn device able sync with other devices and 
ecosystems such wireless music players mobile phones 
home lighting heating personal finance etc such luxury 
watch brands will need enforce the brand positioning they 
offer overcome any potential perceived functionality gap 
exhibit 
consumers want more watch functionality than 
just telling time 
features that would increase consumer usage 
more sensors track other metrics 
more comfortable wear 
more powerful computing capabilities

culture prevents strong response 
swiss brands from across the price spectrum have 
discussed possibilities for their own smartwatch

previously made one off smart device for the oracle sailing 
team 
importantly swatch has also confirmed will launch 
smartwatch product within its swatch touch line

japanese brands focus younger male consumers and

watches have sporty heritage and use leading edge 
technologies such touch screens appeal younger

using athletes such landon donovan soccer and

however traditional watch brands have 
unique qualities 
there are some ways however for swiss and japanese 
brands differentiate themselves from smartwatches 
believe the traditional brands should focus their 
strengths and differentiate functionality and brand 
addition believe there are markets that smartwatches 
cannot currently address which opportunity for 
traditional watch brands 
traditional watches are more durable and have longer 
battery lives casio has several brands focused durability 
within the shock series the frogman has iso

far wearables have not had impact watch sales 
for japanese brands fact watch sales continue grow

impact watch retailers unclear 
swiss watch retailers china hong kong are currently 
indifferent towards the smartwatch threat based our 
understanding retailers such hengdeli emperor 
and oriental watch believe chinese consumers nowadays 
have multiple watches for different purposes business 
sports casualwear etc smartwatches will simply 
addition the collection perhaps more gimmick 
fad rather than credible substitute luxury swiss watches 
reasons cited include that the touch screen smartwatch 
will likely too small practical use and that affluent 
chinese watch buyers would likely want more individualization 
for personal taste rather than one size fits all model even 
smartwatches gain traction chinese swiss watch retailers 
view that modern electronic watches are not compatible 
with their traditional luxury swiss watch store image and 
therefore they likely will not carry them 
hengdeli would likely the most exposed entry

see several reasons for secular growth athletic 
wearables benefit athletic brands 
the rise wearable technology creates another avenue 
for brands connect with consumers and generate 
insights while multiple brands have already produced their 
own devices believe brands ultimately understand they 
are better served seeking partnership with hardware 
companies rather than competing against them 
commitment applications multiple established platforms 
would allow brands focus longer term top line benefits 
from consumer connections and insights 
believe athletic brands are the likely primary 
beneficiaries initially our survey respondents identified 
tracking health and fitness the primary use cases for 
potential wearable purchase while the type available 
applications and desired use may evolve over time expect 
this should benefit athletic brands mostly many which 
already have their own hardware and applications 
consumers choice more active should result more 
athletic apparel and footwear purchases all the brands 
understand their consumers desire track their activity 
and improve their health wearables add another 
dimension this 
consumers are focusing more now health and 
wellness than the past for example the number 
participants running events the has grown 
cagr since for women expect this trend 
continue 
the increased innovation from rising competition 
the space has driven consumer demand the athletic 
brands ability continue support premium pricing 
softer retail environment over the last few years suggests 
consumers willingness absorb price increases for the 
sake innovation 
consumers are choosing comfort the athletic leisure 
trend does have fashion element but expect the 
trend towards casualization and comfort continue this 
also favors athletic brands over the jeans category 
expect this become global trend think the 
rise the middle class emerging regions like china and

how will wearable adoption affect the payments industry 
wearables should increase card transaction volumes they can 
make payments even easier use than smartphones and tablets 
through persistent identity biometric sensors apple watch can 
confirm identity through continuous contact with the user this means 
transactions are more secure than cards and argues for lower merchant 
discount rates much like apple touch the iphone these 
cardholder present merchant discount rates should lower than fees for 
other mobile wallet solutions combined with reduced fraud higher data 
security and increased volumes this meaningfully reduces the friction for 
card usage assuming global adoption technology like touch 
tokenization secure element and near field communications nfc 
could reduce fraud costs over time allowing for investment 
other areas reduced costs for the consumer 
which companies are best positioned most challenged 
believe the constituents the existing value chain all stand 
benefit while trusted service managers tsms and alternative 
payment offerings could challenged higher transaction volumes 
benefit networks merchant acquirers issuers certain merchants 
addition apple believe google wallet and certain alternatives 
could adopt apple implementation past attempts have seen little 
success this again good news for all players the card industry

that pay already the leader contactless payments and 
bigger than all the competitors combined fact the service 
was popular enough cvs and rite aid that those retailers 
turned off nfc functionality their payment terminals 
prevent customers from using they are part mcx 
group retailers working build alternative the current 
credit card value chain 
new technologies the iphone and plus made apple 
pay possible the fingerprint sensor apple touch 
allows users confirm payments simply placing their 
finger the home button without even waking their phone 
first which much faster and easier use than mobile 
payment apps that take multiple taps access the new 
iphones include nfc connectivity and secure element the 
latter enables tokenization which improves security since 
generates code and does not send credit card numbers for 
each transaction 
apple watch will have even easier use 
implementation pay visa and mastercard said apple 
understands the security risks and would likely use biometric 
sensors identify the user according recode believe 
users have verify their identity entering password 
when they put the watch but for the duration they are 
wearing the watch can continuously confirm identity using 
its biometric sensors users not have verify again with 
fingerprint password for each transaction think this 
would just secure pay iphones but even easier

charge issuers monthly fee per digitized tokenized 
account per device visa has also introduced fee schedule

goes through apple pay according multiple reports 
including the financial times believe apple fee for debit 
card transactions would much lower potentially cents 
per transaction however higher electronic transaction 
volumes and potentially lower fraud due better security 
technologies could somewhat offset apple cut fraud costs 
issuers bps transaction volume long term similar 
networks and merchant acquirers any shift from cash card 
usage positive for issuers 
banks can also improve services with wearables note 
that several large banks are already testing apple watch 
use cases with consumers retail brokers for example 
routinely require clients sign documents approve 
transactions with the watch which clients wear all day and 
not put into their purses pockets brokers can facilitate 
quicker transactions and overall improve customer service 
merchants 
believe apple merchant partners for pay are happy 
with the launch mentioned above pay already accounts 
for roughly whole foods transactions after only two 
weeks regional grocer called meijer continues accept 
apple pay despite its being part the mcx coalition that 
working build alternative credit cards similarly 
target another mcx member going incorporate apple 
pay buttons its app though will not accept pay stores 
believe apple pay ease use and superior security 
could increase traffic and basket size and improve the 
branding merchants fact stratos start building 
connected credit card that aggregates users existing cards

apple pay and watch could increase merchant appetite

trusted service manager tsm 
apple pay does not use tsms until apple and google 
launched their payment products the classic nfc system 
used tsms deploy and manage nfc applications this 
separates the management payment credentials from 
mobile operating systems party can take 
responsibility for payment security telecoms have favored 
this model their offerings our conversations with industry 
participants suggest cost and user experience issues 
prevented the tsm model from taking off today visa 
mastercard american express and likely other networks 
the future provide tokenization services for apple pay which 
represents major challenge independent tsms such 
gemalto oberthur and giesecke devrient there may 
opportunity for tsms work with google and others that 
use host card emulation hce system that provisions

however believe certain android smartphones could also 
implement the physical secure element similar apple 
alternative payment methods

more through their devices ios only has browsing share 
proxy for usage and lower shipment share will take time 
for apple pay ramp internationally though the company 
plans expand fast can while believe apple will 
eventually provide solution using either apple pay and 
ibeacon enable loyalty cards for merchants which 
something merchants really want apple has not said anything 
about the matter publicly 
google and facebook are the most interesting players 
watch both are very interested payments because they 
could monetize transaction purchase intention data which 
apple not collecting however google wallet which uses 
the cloud based implementation for nfc called hce has not 
gained much traction far facebook recently hired former

will any but they may take inspiration from tencent 
wechat and other messaging products from payment 
perspective while google and facebook are interested the

order compete with default payment options paypal 
formidable competitor with over accounts but 
think has increase investments stand alone 
company improve its products launch new ones and 
invest marketing and branding order compete will 
not the default option wearables and other devices 
made apple paypal could try partner with other brands

most other alternatives not have clear value 
proposition carriers the and europe have tried

better technology adoption could help china department stores transition 
into higher margin consignment model that provides operators the 
ability better control products and pricing away from the landlord 
concession model the street believes the solution for china department 
stores the direct sales model like the operators incubate one 
own merchandise team and control the products disagree the 
insufficient scale these chains and the abundance lower priced 
alternatives online make the direct sales model high risk proposition 
china 
believe baidu eye and deng could drive the move the 
consignment model which staff costs are borne the department 
stores while brands bear all the inventory risks and away from the 
concession model which both staff and inventory risks are borne 
tenants the department stores should focus knowing and serving 
the local customers better and work with brands display price what 
would sell the cities regions brands should focus branding and 
product design the current concession model china does not allow

wearables our view 
opportunities see three distinct areas the healthcare 
market that are likely benefit from increased penetration 
wearable devices 
medical device integration and innovation 
employer sponsored health programs 
pharmaceutical compliance 
notably across all three sections chronic disease 
management highlighted low hanging fruit opportunity 
for disruption underscoring the inefficiencies healthcare 
and the potential for cutting costs from the system 
obstacles achievement while wearables represent key 
opportunity for technology innovation and disruption the 
healthcare market the following fundamental issues must 
addressed for the opportunity materialize 
patient privacy regulations hipaa the limit 
medical data sharing between various constituents the 
healthcare market data sharing individual health 
records need know basis and includes 
minimum amount detail unless preapproved the 
patient given these restrictions data sharing among 
various devices and players will require high levels 
security encryption and explicit approval from patients 
achieve mass adoption 
geographic data fragmentation remains key obstacle 
for the success wearables traditionally health 
systems have operated independently within geographic 
silos with limited data sharing outside regional provider 
network without standardized national data network 
will challenging for wearables overcome geographic 
barriers and gain significant traction 
data accuracy remains unknown wearable devices 
given the relative infancy the space similar fda 
regulations around drug efficacy and accuracy medical 
devices that connect with wearable devices will likely 
required achieve predetermined metrics this presents 
near term obstacle that could add cost lengthen the 
time achieve substantial data sharing between medical 
devices and wearables 
connectivity between different platforms has 
historically been industry pressure point spurred 
meaningful use incentive payments interoperability has 
made advances over the last few years but connectivity 
various players the industry requires further updates 
advancements and standardization 
medical devices 
see larger future opportunity for wearable 
technology the medical devices industry that said 
development still early stage the initial target 
markets for such devices will likely found variety 
diagnostic and monitoring applications while the path truly 
wearable therapeutic opposed diagnostic devices 
less clear information gathered from diagnostic devices could 
play significant role optimizing the administration 
existing therapies 
key opportunities could lie widespread chronic diseases 
such diabetes hypertension cardiac arrhythmias and 
heart failure particularly consumer health and preventative 
medicine become more important way reduce costs 
the moment difficult gain exposure wearable 
medical devices public equities most innovation 
this space either concentrated small private companies 
constitutes immaterial contribution the portfolio 
larger more established players the best opportunities 
morgan stanley research 
november 
wearable devices 
invest wearables likely lie diabetes with dexcom and 
insulet larger players with some programs wearable 
devices also include abbott and medtronic 
until now most doctors have had limited ability 
collect and monitor information patient health status 
once the patient leaves the hospital while some 
technologies have offered the requisite technical capabilities 
adoption has been limited the often burdensome practical 
requirements for using such devices which tend 
reserved only for cases where accurate monitoring critical 
diagnosis safety 
for example holter monitor device used record the 
heart electrical activity and detect heart arrhythmias 
requires the patient attach number electrodes and 
accompanying wires his her chest making 
impractical solution for monitoring periods longer than 
hours similarly today ambulatory blood pressure monitors 
can provide continuous blood pressure information throughout 
patient daily activities but require the patient wear 
bulky pressure cuff 
ease these constraints some companies have developed 
smaller devices that can implanted patient and are 
therefore unnoticeable externally these include medtronic 
reveal linq cardiac monitor and jude cardiomems 
blood pressure sensor however these devices require 
surgical procedure albeit usually simple one implant 
making them inappropriate cost prohibitive for many 
patients 
expect wearable medical devices become much 
more prominent the coming years following 
acceleration product development while few any 
products are yet wide commercial use number devices 
are the early stages launch and may offer some insight 
into future medical applications though existing consumer 
health and fitness devices could offer some useful templates 
for medical device features gaining additional accuracy and 
reliability critical developing the robust data needed 
inform health care decisions doctors and patients 
the near term see the best prospects for wearable 
devices clinical uses that already have established home 
diagnostic and monitoring protocols these capacities 
wearable devices would represent natural incremental 
improvements over conventional technology and could offer 
greater ease use reach broader patient population 
cardiac monitoring and diagnosis million 
americans have some type cardiac arrhythmia such 
tachycardia atrial fibrillation bradycardia according 
centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates 
over americans each year experience sudden 
cardiac death caused cardiac rhythm disorders 
cases these disorders have not been diagnosed 
the difficulty diagnosis typically stems from the 
unpredictable and intermittent nature such disorders most 
the time the heart will function normally but periodic 
disruptions cardiac rhythm can occur suddenly and have 
potentially deadly consequences detect arrhythmias 
patients are typically sent home with monitoring device for 
least several days mentioned above conventional 
devices include holter monitors and implantable sensors and 
suffer from limitations patient compliance due 
inconvenience holter and required surgical placement 
implantables 
september however medtronic brought wearable 
technology cardiac monitoring with the launch its seeq 
cardiac monitor seeq wire free adhesive heart monitor 
that worn the skin automatically captures cardiac 
data and transmits the appropriate physicians for review 
can provide data for days increasing the chance 
capturing cardiac rhythm event compared holter monitors 
that are typically tolerated only for several days number 
private companies have developed similar tools such 
preventice the bodyguardian and nuubo

key target market for wearable innovation given the large 
market size americans live with diabetes chronic but 
treatable nature and increasing patient emphasis quality

diabetes and drives daily treatment decisions including both 
insulin administration and dietary adjustments many patients 
use glucose test strip that requires them deposit drop 
blood the testing device via small needle several times 
daily contrast continuous glucose monitoring cgm 
devices offer patients real time information blood glucose 
levels through device that consists adhesive patch 
bearing small sensor inserted below the skin the devices

philips already expanding into the health software 
space philips already involved the healthcare 
smartphone app space for example offers the brush 
busters app for iphone aimed children encourage them 
brush their teeth and can record the activity when using 
compatible brush launching apps like this for smartwatches 
should allow philips aggregate data from even wider 
range sources including heart rate exercise sleep 
distance walked run blood pressure diet etc using single 
third party device seems unlikely that consumers would 
willing have different devices for different activities this 
could give healthcare specialists access much wider 
breadth patient data integrating this data into the existing 
healthcare systems area where philips could have 
strong competitive position already operates hospital

there are clear benefits from extended use wearables 
philips estimates that its current remote patient monitoring 
offering can reduce hospital visits and save 
per patient per year this includes the benefits telehealth

wearable devices 
where patients can speak healthcare workers from home 
but complete wearable solution would improve the quantity 
and quality data collected and could further improve the 
benefits remote healthcare 
however there competitive risk for philips our 
view the most meaningful risk from the growth wearables 
people choose not use philips products and instead just 
purchase smartwatches fitness trackers this would hurt 
philips hardware sales believe the telehealth and home 
treatment businesses are unlikely affected but aspects 
the monitoring certainly could more importantly philips 
could find itself under much more pressure should other 
companies enter the software space philips already has 
presence app stores and smartphones which should 
help mitigate the threat however wearables whole new 
user experience existing companies will likely need 
adapt their business models along with new entrants 
home healthcare and preventative medicine are 
segments that could see some the biggest changes 
due wearable technology the shift focus industrial 
companies like philips already clear and the real question 
whether they can coexist and team up with computing 
companies like apple samsung google they can then 
there still the question data ownership and usage 
overall see wearables opportunity for philips given 
already leader remote monitoring and healthcare 
managed care 
lower healthcare costs for consumers and employers 
could drive wearables adoption the managed care 
business according study conducted 
technologyadvice adults not track their 
weight diet exercise using fitness tracking device app 
fact the most commonly cited reason for not using 
wearable fitness device was lack interest followed cost 
the device itself however these non tracking 
adults said the possibility lower insurance premiums would 
make them more likely use fitness tracking wearable 
device 
given current underwriting restrictions the health 
insurance market insurer ability vary premiums 
based health status unlikely that insurers the riskbased market would able lower premiums for 
particular population that uses wearable devices while this 
could change over time with new regulation expect the

attempting tie data from wearables insurance premiums 
part broader wellness programs 
roughly individuals all insured lives have

offerings administrative services only aso where the

the affordable care act established new incentives for 
employers build existing wellness program policies and 
encourage healthier workplaces these participatory wellness 
programs are generally available regardless employee 
health status and can include rewards the cost

ways for wearable devices lower premiums offer 
other rewards for healthy behavior for example which 
self insures provided employees with fitbit zip 
they allowed the company monitor their steps over the 
course the year employees crossed million steps they 
were awarded wellness points that went towards 
financial reward addition the million step challenge 
other wellness offerings for bp employees included 
health advisor calls biometric health screenings and onsite 
campaigns targeting weight management and physical

according case study prepared staywell health 
management the party wellness organization that 
partnered with employees achieved their incentive

goal points additionally overall health risks declined 
and for employees who participated lifestyle 
management program risks declined finally 
reduced its overall healthcare spend broader 
healthcare spending which increased 
interestingly according kaiser employer health benefits 
survey large firms more workers reported 
providing financial incentive for employees complete 
health risk assessments hra and for those firms 
the financial incentive for completing hra was 
fact virtually all large employers and most small employers 
offer least one wellness program their employees which 
bodes well for the future wearables this space 
with fitbit and tracks personal nutrition exercise and lifestyle 
initiatives among others expect these types 
applications incorporated into new wearable devices 
insurers are also offering direct consumer applications 
humana humanavitality app for users its wellness 
rewards program the app integrates with several fitness 
devices and offers individuals incentives like movie tickets 
and fitness equipment eat better more active lose 
weight the consumer health app will also available

almost all large employers offer least one 
wellness program

source kaiser hret survey employer sponsored health benefits 
there are certain wellness initiatives that insurers will embed 
into their aso offerings employers but employers can also 
purchase additional features for example employer could 
purchase disease management lifestyle management 
program from the carrier for additional fee the insurers 
can help employers bend the healthcare cost curve still the 
benefits lower costs ultimately fall the employer not the 
insurer bottom line that said the goal any managed 
care company produce the lowest cost trend possible for 
clients which will likely lead happier clients better 
retention and the ability cross sell ancillary products 
many managed care companies have already launched 
consumer facing apps smartphones and other devices 
with the aim improving health and lowering overall costs 
for example unitedhealth subsidiary optum offers 
employers the optumizeme app which motivates and 
encourages individuals live healthier lives optumizeme

our view pharmaceutical benefit managers pbms and 
drug retailers are well positioned benefit from changes 
pharmaceutical utilization behavior driven greater 
penetration wearable devices looking the various costs 
associated with pharmaceutical utilization habits have 
identified medication adherence the greatest opportunity 
for wearables disrupt 
the cdc currently estimates that patients not fill all prescriptions written the addition 
patients complete only pharmaceutical treatments 
costs associated with medication adherence account for 
approximately half the estimated billion annual 
avoidable pharmacy costs the total 
healthcare spend near term think increased patient 
engagement healthcare consumption coupled with greater 
physician and pharmacist contact should lead 
improvements medication adherence

diabetes cholesterol and blood pressure monitoring 
represent low hanging fruit for disruption according 
studies from the new england health care institute every 
bps improvement medication possession ratio 
measure medication compliance translates 
fewer heart attacks fewer strokes and fewer 
deaths thus the implications improved pharmaceutical 
adherence reach beyond costs associated with nonadherence and into the broader industry for example the 
estimated billion wasted healthcare spend 
billion attributed missed prevention 
source centers for disease control cdc 
mobile app programs currently offered through pbms and 
pharmacies could have broader impact when used with 
wearable device apps today feature capabilities such 
refill scanners prescription management pill identifier 
prescription history immunization scheduler and pill 
reminder walgreens mobile app offers customers hour 
access pharmacist through its pharmacy chat feature 
that allows patients seek advice confidentially regarding 
their pharmaceutical treatments retail pharmacies can also 
leverage mobile apps bring more patients lower cost 
care settings through location capabilities for example 
patient can locate the closest retail clinics such cvs 
minuteclinic walgreens healthmart look specific 
services offered that location and verify insurance 
coverage 
exhibit 
wearables leverage features mobile apps today 
drive pharmaceutical compliance 
source cvs health 
wearables also present key opportunity chronic 
disease management specialty drugs require greater level 
attention given complex delivery methods and treatment 
schedules longer term the population continues 
age and more complex drugs enter the market the demand 
for continuous information sharing between patient and 
provider will also grow information sharing could include 
medication reminders delivery instructions nurse support 
and refill information from the provider and heart rate 
temperature and physical activity information from the 
patient wearable device 
for example complex week treatment plan such 
temodar requires high touch support the patient faces 
challenges such varying dosages alternating treatment 
and break phases and physician surveillance wearables 
provide unique opportunity for directional information 
sharing providers push medication reminders delivery 
instructions nurse support and refill information while 
wearables can detect changes heart rate temperature and 
physical activity 
net estimate pbms and drug retailers could see 
top line benefit wearables improve medication adherence 
our base case key beneficiaries medication 
adherence should cvs walgreens and express scripts 
esrx with cvs likely see outsized benefits among the 
group additionally the pharmaceutical distributors 
mckesson cardinal health and amerisourcebergen could 
see top line benefit from increase overall volume 
view cvs best positioned gain share from 
wearables given their pbm and retail pharmacy 
diversification addition their exposure the provider 
community through onsite retail clinics 
morgan stanley research

wearable devices 
pharma risk sharing could wild card opportunity for 
wearables large pharma companies look for new growth 
opportunities our conversations with industry experts suggest 
some companies have expressed interest expanding the 
direct relationship between pharmaceutical innovators and the 
patient population through this model pharma companies 
would assume the risk associated with entire patient 
population undergoing specific disease regimens this 
scenario contact between pharmaceutical developers and 
patients becomes critical treatment success and 
curtailing the risks associated with treatment failure

what are the industrial use cases for wearables 
see benefits wearables within home automation beyond those 
already afforded smartphone tablet however the addressable 
market unlikely the same scale other sectors such 
healthcare and fitness which covered the healthcare section and 
where see philips best positioned our view home automation 
opportunity for industrial companies the space and not cannibalistic 
existing businesses the unique characteristics wearables 
mobile devices can harnessed see legrand and assa abloy 
having been the most proactive that field far leveraging their core 
business leadership into increased connectivity and wearable 
technologies 
best positioned legrand assa abloy philips 
lagging the trend osram licht 
controlling lights temperature with wearables see 
additional benefits automation for example assa abloy 
plans install locks hotels and offices that can unlocked 
with smartphones removing the need for keys cards 
however see issue with rolling this out homes 
more efficient than regular keys the device would have 
capable unlocking the door without input from the user 
addition wearables can solve problem with security 
stolen phone could provide location and access the owner 
home however devices that incorporated persistent identity 
verification technology enabled through biometric sensors 
wearables discussed above would better for home 
automation than smartphones for example apple watch 
uses biometric sensors verify the user identity for apple 
pay the user has confirm his her identity through pin 
code when she first put the device once skin 
contact broken the user has enter the code enable 
the wearable believe this gives degree convenience 
and security not possible with smartphones other mobile 
devices this level interaction with the device increases the 
areas the home that can automated 
home automation 
industrial companies are building smart home products 
looked the impact home automation earlier 
blue paper the internet things now connecting the 
real economy and believe there are opportunities for 
industrial firms such philips hue lighting legrand 
connected wiring devices assa abloy connected locks 
see benefits from energy efficiency and convenience 
standpoint for example homes could detect owners 
movements and automatically turn the lights unlock the 
doors homes can detect when owners are waking they 
could automatically turn the lights activate the hot water 
for the shower removing waste simply having the system 
timer currently the controls these devices are built 
into smartphones and tablets but offering more personal 
connection technology and always being with the user 
wearables offer range new possibilities for home 
automation 
wearables could better than other mobile devices 
automating smart homes when looked the internet 
things iot benefits the home focused applications 
that change the atmosphere the home manually through 
wearables can further personalize home automation 
products assuming users not set down wearables 
they would phone tablet devices like philips hue 
lightbulbs could detect there are people the room not 
and turn the lights off users move around the house 
another possible application heating ventilating and air 
conditioning hvac technologies wearables could 
communicate changes room temperature the airconditioning system automatically adjusting the house 
temperature suit the users preferences 
legrand assa abloy and philips look well positioned 
they already have presence home automation and 
connected products the growth wearable tech our view 
simply increases the range products that can offered 
these companies the interest home automation 
consumers become more aware the devices available and 
the usefulness the internet things the legrand 
arteor system can already automate lighting temperature 
door entry and blinds adding wearable that could tell 
where the home you are could further improve this system 
and customize for each user

source company promotional materials 
however there are risks from new competitors the 
move more connected home new entrants the market 
like nest are emerging and could gain strong positions but 
philips legrand assa abloy can remain relevant their 
systems and apps are connected wearables that the 
there risk missing the market not moving fast 
enough for example just google acquired nest 
february dropcam june and revolv october nest 
offers wireless thermostats and smoke alarms with more 
products come dropcam offers wifi connected webcams 
and sensors that allow owners check their homes 
remotely through the internet revolv made smart home hubs 
and apps but will focus its software platform going 
forward the opportunity presented wearables quite 
specific and from that smartphones the home automation 
players would need move fast change their products 
accommodate the specific advantages offered wearables 
described above especially when competing against 
google whose android operating system runs the majority 
the smartphones and tablets the world 
security concerns will only increase move towards 
home automation our view control the temperature 
lighting door and window locks accessible over the 
internet the owners could also allow someone break 
into the virtual system check the owners are home 
worse take control the house virtual break ins over the 
internet occur then the very concept the automated home 
would our view threatened would become less 
likely that consumers would purchase the products
