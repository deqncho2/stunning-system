home equity lines credit value driven spending price quality value retailers deeply discounted 
covetable brands the recession changing consumers perception value the emergence the 
recessionista made bargain shopping badge pride suggesting combination fashionable and savvy

transparent shopping experience younger members this generation grew the heat the bargain 
hunting post recession era and believe they adopt value seeking behavior nature 
price consistency many the retailers cover still often offer different promotions online versus store 
which frustrates consumers also encourages already pervasive trend show rooming browsing store 
but buying online often lower price and web rooming browsing only buy store each time customer 
leaves channel without completing purchase diminishes the chances conversion later 
single inventory pool for consumers comes down two fundamental questions you have this 
product and where can find ten fifteen years ago customer couldn find the exact item she 
was looking for store they were forced drive another location see that store had stock drive 
home and dial into the internet see was available the retailer had website now customers expect 
store associates pull out ipads and order the item for them right then and there either shipped their home 
free charge from another store from along the same lines customers want able check their 
phone the nearest store has the item they want stock some might even prefer buy online and pick 
store 
single inventory pool should lead fewer out stock items increased inventory turns reduced markdowns 
and drive the virtuous cycle better sales higher margins healthier inventory and satisfied customers 
retailers cannot truly understand the depth demand for item every time they run out stock they take 
off their website being able fulfill online orders with store sometimes stranded inventory gives buyers 
window into the depth demand over time that data can utilized buy quantities more precisely for 
specialty retail dept stores march 
example certain stores are over inventoried and consistently fulfilling orders due weaker inventory turn 
over time inventory allocation those stores should reduce and become optimized while cost per unit 
processing lower than store ship from store capabilities better allow the company understand 
buy quantities location specific basis over time improving store and online profitability 
what have some retailers implemented already 
digital enhancements 
responsive design responsive design allows images from marketing emails and websites size and 
format any screen size improving the mobile and tablet browsing experience this could provide significant 
opportunity drive greater conversion and leverage incremental traffic emerging from tablets and 
smartphones given the powerful shift consumers are making mobile think enhanced mobile viewing 
likely drives incremental sales 
triggered mails triggered mails could include rewards expiration reminders abandoned cart items 
price reduction alerts low inventory reminders for items shoppers have indicated interest for this 
personalizes the shopping experience subtly informing consumers the retailer committed meeting her 
needs think triggered emails can personalize experience without feeling intrusive particularly 
consumers have become accustomed amazon like algorithms 
personalization several different email versions the same campaign are sent different shoppers 
depending their purchase and browsing history addition website homepages highlight consumers 
preferences and target shoppers interests gap inc gps noted personalized emails have resulted higher 
click through rates longer time spent the website and greater web conversion 
store drivers 
average store conversion but according gap inc gps the not converted wanted 
make purchase but did not find the desired item the correct size color building out the shopping 
experience retailer may able shrink the probability that shopper leaves empty handed 
reserve store this option allows customers select items from the website held store for them 
this removes doubt whether not product available when shopper makes trip which both traffic 
and conversion opportunity according gap inc reserve store has driven higher transactions conversion 
and units per transaction study the international council shopping centers icsc determined that 
siloed ecommerce shopping platform netted roughly the initial sale price after returns and additional 
purchases were factored contrast online sales for store pickup netted 
ship from store coupled with single inventory pool this feature allows retailers capture online sales 
for skus that may out stock the ecommerce improve delivery speeds fulfilling orders from 
nearby stores and minimize markdowns selling slower moving misallocated inventory online 
shoppers 
order store order store allows customers purchase items online from other store inventory 
while store often retailers ship the item the shopper home for free will offer pick nearby store 
this presents opportunity increase conversion 
store customer tracking consumers have turned mobile into catalyst for physical shopping 
retailers are turning beacons and other store proximity tools beacons can track shopper locations store 
within feet allowing retailer send targeted offers coupons shoppers mobile phones participate 
the program customers must have either branded retailer app party coupon app shopkick for 
example and must opt receive notifications since the technology available limited smartphones this

retail searches will continue important driving online eyeballs and commerce market share and 
google retail offerings continue evolving too the launch google product listing ads and google express

platforms providing seamless holistic online and store shopping experience both aesthetically and 
emotionally customers increasingly expect personalized experience that merges the richness stores with

make are failing recognize changing competitive landscape and insufficient investment omnichannel capabilities consumers demand more and more each year this likely just the start continuous 
invention and evolution 
ongoing investment systems and other technology required order create omnichannel experience retailers need back end systems integrate and manage all types data including 
inventory customer analytics and fulfillment and distribution share specialty retail capital expenditures

insufficient investment omni channel capabilities one the critical mistakes think retailers can make 
crucial capabilities such omni channel inventory management and omni channel crm cannot switched 
overnight unlike free shipping free returns and take year more fine tune those retailers that have 
underinvested thus far are unlikely catch over time given the sheer amounts capital and expertise

ecommerce enables retailers better utilize their store bases customers prefer shop multiple channels 
according survey jiwire mobile advertising and data platform firm out mobile users 
who performed retail shopping research smartphone only went make the purchase using that 
device and ended purchasing the item store therefore important that retailers not lose focus 
their store footprints the store still plays central role the connect phase the path purchase and

also important effectively manage customers omni channel transition from web store with the 
ultimate goal driving conversion higher are the items featured online marketing easy find store are 
products merchandised similarly online and store customer service also remains extremely important 
associates should knowledgeable about the entire assortment both store items well online

historically given them good customer service while abandoned purchase result poor

employee and management incentives must realigned encourage cross channel conversion 
previously was store online battle but now someone orders item online while store which 
channel receives credit when online item returned store which channel the sale deducted from

credit similarly online order returned store the refund should credited against the ecommerce 
channel store associates should not feel resentful about fulfilling order with ecommerce inventory 
accepting online returns 
organizational structures must realigned well the slowness data integration part result 
the way ecommerce was originally developed among retailers when ecommerce came onto the scene most 
retailers built their online initiatives independently from brick and mortar stores setting them separate 
businesses with separate technology sales goals and initiatives today closing the loop the silo effect 
requires merging technologies and figuring out how effectively execute fulfillment from stores many retailers

the financial resources and talent required macy places its investments into three buckets merchant 
strategy where place inventory making easier for customers shop and fulfillment 
during macy tested what they call single view inventory five departments this month 
will roll this initiative throughout the macy organization well bloomingdale this will allow merchants 
figure out exactly where place inventory maximize sales and increase inventory turnover cfo karen 
hoguet shared example critical mistakes that occur when organizations separate buying and planning 
departments channel there was one particular special occasion dress that sold out every single unit online 
and every one those units was then being returned stores the dot merchants were calling the vendor 
and buying more units while the store merchant was going the vendor and begging for markdown money 
essence they kept ordering more markdowns dresses was the first category which rolled out omnichannel inventory and result has noted significant sales increase 
the second big area investments macy making relates various technologies store associates can use 
help consumers shop any channel while store handheld point sale devices and tablets designed 
improve store shopping experiences enabling sales associates assist customers more effectively offer 
merchandise ideas and product information and speed transaction times one example placing tablets

one common sku buying marketing and planning departments are also fully integrated across stores and 
online much progress urbn has made over the past five years there are still many exciting potential 
initiatives come this year well 
urbn new distribution center located gap miles from philadelphia opens june 
and will allow rapid order fulfillment for east coast stores the can handle packages daily and 
places retail distribution adjacent ecommerce fulfillment allowing labor sharing across facilities 
combined inbound retail wholesale and ecomm inventory should create supply chain savings and 
eliminates retail backstock ecomm inventory can replenish retail stores 
urbn already offers click checkout option across desktop mobile and tablet this will shorten sometime this year which should help increase conversion and lower shopping cart 
abandonment rates 
consumers can already search online see inventory available store but urbn rolling out 
reserve online capabilities and testing bopus terrain the only brand with this 
functionality currently 
urbn also testing beacons and rfid tags handful stores management has tested rfid before 
but still may too expensive roll out fleet wide anthropologie removed its security tags few 
specialty retail dept stores march 
years ago because shrink very low adding rfid likely even more expensive today than was 
few years ago 
finally urbn and are the only two companies cover who have fully rolled out apple pay instores although still early innings urbn should have initial reads share 
nordstrom best class customer experience 
nordstrom has been building its ecommerce business since the company was early adopter multichannel fulfillment pooling inventory systems beginning and implementing cross channel fulfillment 
exhibit jwn ability keep pace with changing technology has established the company online 
retail leader and driven ecommerce penetration sales from jwn notes that 
customers who shop multiple channels spend more and demonstrate greater loyalty 
jwn kors and the bloomingdale division macy are the only two companies our coverage 
universe that offer unequivocally free shipping and free returns every day and without any thresholds jwn 
aims deliver packages within days but investing deliver faster the new fulfillment center 
pennsylvania track open this year one example having fulfillment centers closer the customer will 
enable jwn offer two day shipping for free more customers major competitive advantage our view 
jwn also provides return shipping label the original package which much more convenient for customers 
than having print their own label online 
jwn was the first department store adopt omni channel fulfillment the current system which 
utilizes one common sku across channels enables jwn first look for inventory where store might about 
take markdown the system can also fulfill from stores where item turning slowly this helps drive 
inventory turns thereby allowing jwn increase merchandise freshness and lift full price selling jwn omnichannel inventory system also allows consumers search online for given item availability their nearest 
store well buy online pick store bopus across desktop mobile and tablet the corporate buying 
and marketing teams are integrated between stores and online well 
nordstrom has also aligned its employee incentives encourage cross channel transactions customer 
purchases item fulfilled online while store the store would receive the same amount credit would 
for store purchase additionally online order returned store the return credited against 
where was originated where was originally given credit roughly online returns are made store 
which allows employees opportunity help convert the return into sale 
jwn also recently upgraded their mobile optimized site provide seamless and consistent experience with 
their desktop website they continue make enhancements the online experience and integrate with the 
stores for example jwn recently added the feature allowing customers shop directly from its instagram 
page nordstrom partners with site called that looks and acts like instagram but links photos directly 
product pages its web store and stores the photos that users like link jwn instagram profile 
which people follow connects shoppers the site will help stem the constant where can buy 
this you still carry this how much does this cost questions nordstrom instagram comments

rebecca minkoff stores the future 
rebecca minkoff accessible luxury handbag accessory footwear and apparel retailer not covered morgan 
stanley excellent example retailer taking the store shopping experience omni channel level 
rebecca minkoff has opened two connected stores one nyc and one san francisco that are chock full 
high tech services developed ebay inc retail innovation team and aims make the shopping experience 
easier 
upon entering the store customers are greeted with wall length touch screen which offers shoppers free 
drinks guests have the opportunity order free water tea coffee espresso they are asked for phone 
number where they will receive text soon their drink ready the same touch screen also allows 
shoppers browse the brand catalog and put together outfits while shoppers aren aware employees are 
plugged into mobile apps which keep them appraised who the store and what data being inputted 
all clothing and accessories are outfitted with rfid tags and dressing rooms are equipped with rfid shields 
which allow the store identify which items customers bring into each specific dressing room the dressing 
room also equipped with mirrors that double large touch screens kinect sensors within the mirror record 
customers motions and allow for adjustable lighting different sizes and colors the items customer brings 
are automatically brought onto the screen something does not fit they can order different size version 
added their online basket for future checkout customers not even have leave the fitting room 
make purchase employees will handle transactions with ipads they can pay through the fitting room with 
paypal traditional methods payment entering their phone number into the touch screen shoppers 
receive url link via text message connect their store loyalty account 
more important than what customers buy the rfid shields remember which items customers bring into the 
dressing room and don purchase this allows rebecca minkoff then send follow emails remind 
customers what they did not buy and other sizes and colors the merchandise may come 
while the technology for connected dressing rooms and smart stores here already it going long rollout before makes its way every mall new brands like minkoff have running start retrofitting inventory 
and infrastructure for rfid tags and commerce integration long and expensive process addition many 
customers may rightfully have questions about privacy and anonymity when faced with dressing rooms 
containing array cameras and kinect sensors

hardlines see wsm and home improvement best positioned 
our overall view that there will multiple brick and mortar winners within hardlines early movers such 
wsm are well positioned and will continue enjoy advantage while companies like wmt and low 
which underappreciated have come long way fast believe these businesses are omni channel ready 
today and have among the best prospects for future gains while believe select retailers can thrive the 
omni channel world there are couple challenges that cloud the near term 
williams sonoma been doing since 
first other than wsm there isn hardline retailer that can point that has economies scale its ecommerce omni channel efforts this lack scale brings uncertainty the ultimate profit picture 
wsm business anchored its commerce expertise after years significant investments its 
ecommerce platform wsm has become the quintessential example retailer that can operate and thrive 
omni channel business its success starts with management channel agnostic view the business and 
entails deep focus having the best website functionality and shop ability for customers 
the commerce platform first launched and has grown become the leading platform the industry 
not only does wsm have the highest level traffic also has the highest conversion rate among its peers 
what makes wsm platform stand above the rest the consumer friendliness its easy navigate website 
the uniqueness the products sells and web content that complements its store layout and strategy 
think what wsm has built more sustainable and will require less investment over time which should provide 
consistent ebit margin expansion 
home depot and lowe well protected and the offense 
view the home improvement segment well protected from online competitive pressure given the 
high level service and exclusivity though tailers have started gain traction the market over the last few 
years estimate online retailers have grown share from since while not significant 
portion tailers capture more the home improvement market than several nationally recognized brands 
similar other hardline retailers with industry leading infrastructure the success commerce platform 
ultimately lies within management attitude leadership knows physical retail its backbone but 
recognizes must learn embrace the omni channel former ceo frank blake said best the internet 
has evolved from being external threat being part and parcel our portfolio strategy 
believe has done solid job walking the walk investing heavily interconnected retail technology 
improve efficiency and offer multi channel experience the company takes experimental approach with 
its newer technologies like its skype like virtual services and appliance kiosks which better engages the 
customer and creates simpler shopping experience these technologies have elevated the interconnectedness 
between retail and commerce with online orders originating retail store for the buy online 
pickup store customers allocating space quickly fulfill customer orders streamline the fulfillment 
process 
one the largest investments has undertaken the addition three direct fulfillment centers the intent 
for these dcs enable same day shipping with the help new warehouse management systems and new 
material handling systems the dcs will stock skus beyond the current retail assortment and are capable 
holding skus versus skus store 
also look favorably low among the most omni channel ready businesses our coverage this 
specialty retail dept stores march 
reflects low leading mylowes platform store technology logistics capabilities mobile payments and 
its ability digitally interact with customers low also focused flexible fulfillment unleashes its store 
network distribution weapon with the heavy lifting and infrastructure labor investments largely behind 
flow through should start improve over the next few years
