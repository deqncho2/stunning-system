rising shipping costs 
ups for the first time will tack surcharge onto most online orders shipping around the 
black friday shopping weekend and during the week before christmas ups will add 
surcharge all ground shipments homes sent between november and 
december the week leading thanksgiving and the week after including cyber 
monday our estimated average shipping cost per package this implies 
cost increase peak surcharges will away for the next two weeks but return for the 
final holiday rush december from december ups will charge extra 
for each ground shipment for next day air and for day delivery 
competitive move fedex has said will not apply residential holiday season surcharges 
except the case packages that require additional handling are oversized 
with free shipping the most important factor for consumers when shopping online 
retailers will likely forced absorb these price increases given all the retailers 
cover secure pre negotiated shipping contracts shipping cost inflation may 
delayed until contract expiration and high volume shippers may not experience the full 
price surcharge although some cost inflation appears unavoidable

while lean incrementally more bullish goos than deck longer term due 
goos stronger growth prospects and superior product offering note that goos 
economics are currently characterized more demand than supply thus sales depend 
more ramping production capacity extending product lines and expanding 
distribution than they weather eventually goos will very weather sensitive 
but not yet our view meanwhile deck more mature highly weather sensitive ugg 
brand could benefit from cooler winter conservative guidance and easy compares 
also skew deck risk reward positively going into the holiday season our view 
also remain bullish deck cost cutting initiatives although believe much these 
cuts are already priced into the stock which trades premium the group 
see relatively cooler holiday season positive factor for branded apparel 
footwear boosting sales cold weather items especially november see 
weather forecast calendar improvements while the noaa forecast calls for 
another modestly warmer than average climate through january the relative 
comparison last year more important for apparel and footwear stocks this 
because consumers who may have delayed buying cold weather items last year due 
the unseasonably warm climate will more likely purchase this year the weather 
relatively colder even absolute temperatures are still warmer than historical 
averages 
thus are incrementally more bullish stocks with more exposure cold weather 
items including deck goos and vfc note that not think weather the 
primary driver the quarter footwear and apparel and will not particularly impact 
the majority our names with little weather sensitivity however believe the 
cooler than last year forecast for the holiday quarter could limit downside for the more 
weather dependent names our space 
see more relative risk for colm vfc given contributes colm ebit 
average vfc deck most exposed expect the company generate 
roughly annual ebit which puts deck holiday quarter pace for 
similar contribution last year these brands have generally highlighted modest 
expectations and conservative guidance suggesting particularly cold winter would 
create fair upside their forecasts 
the cooler start the holiday season also noteworthy because consumers indicate 
they plan start shopping earlier this year the number shoppers who plan start 
shopping november bps higher believe this trend could amplified 
cooler november exhibit while the data suggest november gain coming the 
expense december this likely means companies can enter december with inventories 
good shape thus they should avoid the panic driven promotions seen and
