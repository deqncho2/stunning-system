summary and conclusions 
conclude that conditions are ripe for global 
consolidation given structural forces continue place 
greater importance asset location and quality the 
unprecedented access capital mall operators have 
reshaped portfolios and declining development activity 
unprecedented conditions financial markets strong 
balance sheets and historically high security prices 
provide the ammunition for acquisitions 
exhibit 
and euro real estate 
however after period strong performance view the 
large mall operators globally being fully valued 
average downside price targets and the absence 
fear the group may underperform given stretched 
valuations and persistent growth headwinds this may result 
mall operators exploring achieve growth while still 
having the ability utilize high equity valuations that said 
remain skeptical cross border will create value given 
valuations appear representative cyclical highs and synergy 
benefits are more difficult achieve 
therefore believe the best course action for most 
mall operators side step the temptation and 
refocus portfolio optimization and redevelopment 
activity where possible and hence our preferred 
exposures are mall operators with strong organic growth 
prospects supported positive fundamentals 
our four key questions are 
are inflection point 
who has the most geographically attractive portfolio 
who has the highest quality portfolio 
what can happen and what think should happen 
are inflection point 
source company data morgan stanley research 
who has the most geographically attractive 
portfolio 
large global cities remain the preference for retailers they 
provide the benefits scale and have the fastest population 
growth however mall operator with truly global footprint 
one covering the major markets the europe and 
has yet emerge 
determining who believe has the most geographically 
attractive portfolio paid particular consideration large 
city exposure geographical concentration the more 
concentrated the more attractive and the economic outlook 
with this mind note 
hmso has the most attractive footprint 
wfd can execute non core asset sales and its 
development pipeline its portfolio likely the most 
geographically attractive within the next five years 
believe inflection point approaching given 
commerce will continue define the retail landscape 
and impact store numbers 
period portfolio optimization has now largely 
occurred the major global retail reits have divested 
non core assets 
development activity forecast remain below long run 
averages demand for new space largely limited 
the dominant assets

and the extent data available view 
unbp have the highest quality european portfolio

tco have the highest quality portfolio based 
measures including sales per foot 
also strongly believe that wfd has the highest 
quality portfolio london which remains the most 
attractive market europe and one the most attractive 
globally important factor when considering overall 
portfolio attractiveness 
what can happen and what should happen 
currently conditions remain conducive for activity 
continue given supportive capital markets strong balance 
sheets desire own the best assets and the potential for 
synergies 
that said see the following factors potential obstacles 
scrip based transactions which have recently been 
favored become more complex when used cross 
border transactions 
family ownership and company structures 
acquiring portfolio platform new geography may 
not result enough synergies given lack cost 
duplication 
overall while believe conditions are ripe for 
consolidation our preferred option for the mall operators 
remain focused portfolio optimization via 
continued asset recycling and where possible create 
value via redevelopment 
however the key question activity will shift cross 
border recent transactions have been local consolidations

question who has the most geographically attractive portfolio 
large global cities remain the preference for retailers they

consideration large city exposure and geographical 
concentration the more concentrated the more 
attractive with this mind note 
hmso has the most attractive footprint 
wfd can execute non core asset sales and its 
development pipeline its portfolio likely the most 
geographically attractive within the next five years 
where retailers malls follow most cases retailers 
are targeting the world largest cities they are more 
resilient the structural changes retail typically large 
cities have attributes critical successful retail including 
scale diversity heritage and greater connectivity that attract 
residents workers and tourists 
one million people move cities every week with cities 
populations globally expanding million per week 
should surprise that major retailers are targeting major 
cities new york london paris etc they have become 
more resilient the structural changes under way retail 
typically large cities have attributes critical the success 
retail places including market scale diversity heritage and 
greater connectivity that all combine attract residents 
workers and tourists 
mall operators are yet make material move into the region 
and believe this unlikely change the near future 
our view this likely driven combination the 
following political risk planning uncertainty 
currency risk difficulty obtaining scale and local 
player dominance therefore this only increases the demand 
from landlords perspective for london new york paris and 
madrid exposure 
london hot right now london home more 
international brands than any other city and continues 
attract retailers due its market size maturity and 
importantly its high degree market transparency hence 
often retailer first port call when considering entry 
into europe recent entrants include tom ford jcrew west 
elm and karl lagerfeld but note that other than

sales productivity important quality indicator but data

this closely watched metric for mall operators but 
metric that not published european mall operators
