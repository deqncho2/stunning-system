that closing stores may not the best option for retailers they move towards omni channel but retailers can

our calculator shows too early close stores the brick mortar channel represents total 
sales sales retention rates are not high enough our view offset fixed store expenses and make largescale store closure initiative profitable are not suggesting that all retailers will face this dilemma the nearterm rather could beneficial slow physical growth the near term based what seems less 
productive store base over the long term stores are necessary now and will remain fully omni channel 
commerce advanced world their role the purchase cycle may evolve but ultimately consumers will still use

look under the hood how our work store closures evolved 
started with the premise that store closure inevitable for retailers they transition towards omnichannel models sought understand which retailers would fare best they close stores 
through alphawise survey asked consumers what they would retailer closed the store 
where they shop regularly travel the retailer nearest location switch another retailer shop 
online the survey results were surprising they revealed that sales transfer retention rates are fairly 
low around and that closing stores likely dilutive for most retailers 
this finding prompted pivot and determine retailers have other ways counteract the dilutive 
impact omni channel transitions decided assess the storing situation the and zoned 
supply retail capacity versus demand growth segment and individual company found that 
the best positioned segments and companies are growing store sales while minimizing square 
footage growth these companies show the most improvement roic while eroding for retailers 
that increase square footage with declining store sales
