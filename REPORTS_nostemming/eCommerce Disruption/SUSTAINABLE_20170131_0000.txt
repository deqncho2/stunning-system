why culture matters

developed given group learns cope with its problems external 
adaptation and internal integration that has worked well enough considered 
valid and therefore taught new members the correct way perceive 
think and feel relation those problems 
edgar schein former professor the mit sloan school management and 
author organizational culture and leadership 
common practice talk about the culture organization but does matter for 
investment decisions would argue that does for two reasons 
culture impacts operational performance 
culture difficult define and assess but there value doing number

the behaviour employees and priorities for the business and operational 
performance according mckinsey companies with the best organizational health

measures health eight year study franchise automobile dealerships 
between and concluded that culture impacts performance and not the 
other way round based four rounds culture surveys plus customer satisfaction 
and vehicles sales data the study identified consistent causal link between strong 
department culture and subsequent higher customer satisfaction ratings and vehicle 
sales there was two year lag these relationships suggesting the impact positive 
culture operational performance not immediate there was evidence that 
positive performance fed back into culture 
similar relationship between customer satisfaction and workplace culture 
highlighted primed perform neel doshi and lindsay mcgregor based their 
study airline carriers they found positive correlation between customer 
satisfaction and employees total motivation tomo which they defined how 
much person feels six different motives their work play purpose potential 
emotional pressure economic pressure inertia the first three are deemed positive 
while the last three are viewed having negative impact employee motivation 
mcgregor writes the harvard business review cultures that inspired more play 
purpose and potential and less emotional pressure economic pressure and inertia 
produced better customer outcomes mcgregor and doshi found similar conclusions 
other industries including retail banking telecommunications and the fast food 
industry harvard business review november
