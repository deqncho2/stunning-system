see potential inflection point after slow start online retail penetration 
accounted for only retail sales saudi arabia and the uae 
with high internet usage rates numerous commerce players having 
entered the market recently and young demographics believe online retail 
poised enter phase rapid growth our proprietary models suggests high 
growth and uae and saudi arabia through with ecommerce penetration rising and respectively 
high internet use but payments and logistics are bottlenecks high percentage 
internet users are already purchasing items online estimate the 
uae and saudi arabia however order amounts remain relatively 
small this point estimate online shoppers overall retail spending 
payment security and logistics remain key challenges that will need 
overcome drive further growth 
store sales uae greater risk relative saudi arabia view ecommerce greater risk the uae traditional store retail market while 
expect the traditional saudi store retail market grow cagr 
under moderate penetration scenario expect the uae store retail 
market grow only assuming euromonitor retail sales forecasts 
uae and saudi arabia 
implications for emaar malls and jarir although lower our forecasts for 
emaar malls reflect online retail risk our case studies suggest dubai mall can 
continue grow rents post emaar mall underperformance global peers 
believe the market has already priced online risks see our note see jarir 
well placed maintain its market share key categories commerce 
world concerns margin pressure are only partially valid our view and will 
materialize gradually overall think the shares fairly price the risks see

online retail penetration the middle east has lagged developed and emerging market

penetration rising and respectively 
order amounts remain relatively small this point estimate online shoppers 
overall retail spending online retail spend approximately online shopper 
less than the spend the and given the high percentage users who 
are already purchasing online the low amount spent could part reflect the relatively 
limited purchase options available new entrants provide wider range online 
shopping options think reasonable expect spend per buyer increase

cash delivery popular 
according citc survey saudi arabia more than two thirds respondents were 
apprehensive about entering their credit card and personal details commerce 
websites however such concerns faded among individuals who had shopped online 
the past while banks have implemented two factor authentication make credit card 
purchases safer and trust local payment providers gradually improving low credit 
card penetration and existing regulations that prevent individual online buyers from 
using their debit and atm cards make online purchases continue weigh the 
saudi commerce market growth until security and payment challenges are resolved 
expect cash delivery remain popular payment method among saudis 
that said cash delivery presents significant challenge for logistics players the 
payment method increases delivery costs when customers are not home accept and 
pay for orders logistics players also face challenges with last mile delivery delivery

bespoke products are the products commodities there high level 
product uniqueness multiple brands variations etc there bespoke design 
element involved the team argues that commodity products are more 
susceptible amazon disruption while unique and bespoke items are less likely 
purchased through amazon souq marketplace industries with high 
degree customization include travel formal apparel intimates luxury goods 
and grocery 
regulatory hurdles there legal regulatory complexity around selling the 
product through either local state federal laws another governing body the 
more regulation around product the harder for amazon souq enter the 
market industries with relatively higher regulation that may prove more difficult 
include pharma healthcare autos financials insurance energy utilities telecom 
and commercial airlines 
industry business model ecommerce inherently more challenging scale 
products with lower gross margins lower order frequencies and inventory turns 
higher sku mix requirements and heavier weights etc this not say amazon 
can invest capabilities and seen with the proposed wfm transaction 
acquire try work through these difficulties but baseline believe 
industries this nature are likely more challenging industries with business 
models that may prove relatively more difficult for amazon here include grocery 
diy auto parts dollar stores arts crafts home furnishing and specialty 
industrials 
attention post sale high levels person customer service post sale are 
competitive moat against amazon some products require specialized levels 
customer service and installation travel experiential and the traveler needs 
have sounding board for troubles auto parts need installed etc these 
industries include travel diy auto parts healthcare home improvement and 
specialty industrials 
nuances the more complex the purchase transaction the less likely amazon 
gain large industrial contracts can take months negotiate the scripting and 
payment reimbursement mechanisms the pharma industry are foreign 
amazon adding complexity the transaction process makes scalability more 
difficult and requires customized sales process industries with high transaction 
complexities include pharma healthcare real estate specialty industrials and

electronics well suited ecommerce 
think the electronics category well suited commerce and across the world 
consumers have chosen increasing share their shopping this category 
online penetration online sales remains very low the gcc based qualitative 
feedback from regional retailers think only present expect that will 
rise over time highly developed online retail markets like the and 
sales are now made online depending the category electronics product 
the example smartphones illustrates why this may many these arguments 
apply also tablets laptops pcs game consoles etc 
price the product commodity branded product available certain 
number different models with clearly identifiable features memory size colour 
etc this enables the consumer make direct price comparison between online 
retailers 
convenience given that the product commodity convenience may push 
consumers shop online rather than store contrast some consumers might 
see the convenience factor reason continue shopping store for some 
categories such apparel due the need try for fit and potentially return 
unwanted items 
ease fulfillment the product small and thus readily deliverable via standard 
parcel courier service rather than requiring specialist installer would the 
case for large household appliances for example 
the early days smartphones many consumers needed advice order decide 
which model would best suited their needs which gave advantage traditional 
bricks and mortar retailers consumers are now much more familiar with the product 
and many cases know exactly which handset they want the extent that they need 
any advice the growth online review sites some attached online retail sites may 
satisfy their requirements 
contrast think that sales large household appliance are less suited online 
distribution and will slower move online our view the number potential 
model options and the customer need for advice materially greater the field 
large household appliances refrigerators ovens washing machines etc this and the 
need for two man delivery for installation and removal packaging should make 
much harder for pure online retailers penetrate this segment some specialist online 
retailers have been successful the large appliances category such 
appliancesdirect the but this would niche business the smaller 
markets the gcc and may not attract strong competition 
sales televisions may also slower move online the purchase price higher 
which means that the potential price discount from online merchant might greater 
absolute terms than for phone handset the other hand the price larger 
financial commitment for the consumer who may more inclined seek advice instore 
online food delivery may disrupt traditional fast food models 
the gcc big market for fast food and food delivery popular because local 
factors that include the harsh climate and cultural preference for eating home 
morgan stanley internet services team has recently highlighted that the vast bulk 
orders for food delivery are placed over the telephone directly with the restaurant 
rather than online our colleagues estimate that online penetration only 
present saudi arabia germany the and the see 
delivery hero mena oasis food delivery jun 
our colleagues believe that online platforms like delivery hero similar just eat 
deliveroo uber eats etc are poised grow very rapidly ordering moves online they 
argue that high smartphone penetration already place and see increased marketing 
effort platforms key catalyst they estimate that online penetration kuwait 
where delivery hero local brand has been building the online market for over 
decade now high online ordering platforms such hunger station started 
the saudi market much more recently 
our view one key advantage for consumers ordering online choice there are 
materially independent restaurant listing and review sites key attraction delivery 
platforms this could particularly attractive consumers looking try out new 
food options 
think that key obstacles higher online penetration include fulfilment saudi has 
national address system and restaurants based the immediate locality will likely 
provide more reliable fulfilment than ordering platforms and geographic dispersion 
saudi cities are hundreds miles apart potentially adding the cost and complexity 
building delivery infrastructure 
our view food ordering for delivery moves online this could disruptive for 
traditional quick service restaurant chains such herfy first would lower market 
entry barriers for new restaurant brands giving them ready made distribution 
potentially impacting revenues second could erode their margins they felt 
compelled offer their own product via the same online ordering platforms
