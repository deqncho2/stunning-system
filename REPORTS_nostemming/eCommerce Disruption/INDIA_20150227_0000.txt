what new attended ecommerce forum hosted circle 
mumbai over people participated the event where some entrepreneurs 
and large investors shared their views the industry some our key 
takeaways are follows 
valuations are high but need looked context growth 
one the key debates whether valuations for ecommerce companies are 
high clear consensus emerged the view which was commonly shared 
investors entrepreneurs was that disruption ecommerce companies for 
real and believed that india will reach gross merchandise value 
over next few years significant increase internet users over 
online buyers over large market opportunity and improving 
ecosystem payments and logistics will support continued strong growth 
which driving premium for valuations overall there was optimism that 
india will see better regulatory landscape and potential listings over next 
years the two key challenges highlighted companies are retention 
talent and movement merchandise across the country remains one the 
biggest pain points for ecommerce 
horizontals verticals vertical specific platforms will have enough time 
years before will start facing competition from the horizontals while 
eventually consolidation will set the platform which differentiated and has 
built brand will continue stay within verticals however some 
consolidation has already been happening for example within babycare food 
ordering media reports around consolidation taxi booking within real 
estate there are two models emerging classifieds listings and transaction 
based however there has been limited consolidation far 
offline online some categories like furniture jewellery beauty 
products are building offline presence some the key reasons provided 
companies were building omni channel presence provide touch and 
feel customers and build higher level trust offline presence become 
extension online buying process where transaction closed some 
brands like adidas have started separate online channel drive ecommerce 
sales some the strategies adopted brands with large offline presence 
check cannibalization from online sales are segmentation products 
separate line products for online and offline channels and converting 
existing retailers into tailers

mobile desktop there was clear consensus amongst companies that 
mobile has become the predominant means doing online commerce and 
desktop eventually will become less relevant times come for example 
flipkart indicated that over its traffic coming from mobile 
years ago freecharge gets traffic from mobile and ixigo getting 
its traffic from mobile the key issue with traffic and transactions 
moving mobile higher failure rates transactions and lesser reliability 
relative desktop within mobile the apps are more sticky than mobile 
websites which drives down the cost engagement with customers for 
companies 
outsourcing self owned operations companies indicated some merit 
outsourcing operations third party facilitator for logistics payments etc 
doing everything their own the merits for outsourcing would that 
facilitator the same job better and cost doing own goes beyond just the 
price outsourcing due bandwidth issues 
ecommerce longer about discounts and lower prices high 
discounting not sustainable over longer period time customer loyalty 
will come from addressing basic issues and pain points the customers and 
moving further provide higher level personalization and customization 
through analytics larger scale while companies may doing 
independently for customers their own platform another approach 
improve customer loyalty would collaborative approach through third 
party platform like payback
