key take specialty food retailers have greater geographic overlap whole 
foods than conventional and mass club operators fifty four percent 
sprouts sfm locations are within miles whole foods compared 
kroger locations and walmart wmt locations across retailers 
direct overlap appears low with location overlap whole foods average 
within mile radius for retailers our analysis 
key take whole foods reaches large number customers despite 
relatively modest store base within mile radius whole foods wfm 
reaches population this only below kroger despite 
whole foods operating fewer stores whole foods has national store 
footprint and demographic analysis shows above average income skew 
believe these factors increased whole foods attractiveness acquisition 
candidate for amazon 
food retail takes retailers with greater whole foods overlap could most atrisk for incremental top line pressure more broadly see setup for industrywide margin pressure with combination increasing price competition and 
greater need invest omni channel capabilities under this backdrop food 
retail stocks are generally pricing earnings growth which believe fair 
following our kroger downgrade investors have generally been agreement

struggles the category and high overlap with wfm customer store base 
cost has greater store overlap with wfm than tgt but has been competing 
against low priced sellers natural organic food for years prices food retail 
are undoubtedly heading lower which will impact market shares and likely create 
margin pain for food sellers those who are behind the curve with delivery pick 
store options and those with undifferentiated higher priced offerings 
face the greatest risk
