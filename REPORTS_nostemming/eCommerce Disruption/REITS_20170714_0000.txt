the debates that made write this note 
debate the future ecommerce supply 
chain still for debate 
ecommerce and amzn particular has been key demand driver 
for warehouses and fulfillment centers the market believes may 
too early tell how omnichannel changes the equation the 
bearish view that retailers now have greater optionality terms 
market view early say what the leading model for 
physical stores products and may less inclined lease 
ecommerce supply chains 
warehouse space but think this only accelerates the arms race for 
our view the debate likely over and looks like 
omnichannel potentially favored while one model 
probably fits all the amazon whole foods deal 
underscores the rising value brick and mortar and the 
last mile 
space that has been taking place the sector since because 
amzn now within striking distance costco terms its 
market footprint and penetration our alphawise analysis 
over stores and warehouses suggests 
peers like walmart and costco have noticeably expanded their 
warehouse footprint since ironical response amzn 
competitive threat our deep dive their warehouse leasing 
the amzn wfm merger signals that even the largest ecommerce 
shows and think 
retailer may need physical store presence order expand its 
amzn will continue expand its footprint and grow penetration 
product offerings this case groceries and consequence its 
its top markets given its goals accelerate prime subscriptions 
customer reach see amazon cometh groceries while amzn has 
and emphasize expedited delivery estimate that amzn could 
not officially commented our internet analyst brian nowak expects 
lease close mil exceed costco penetration levels 
expanded roll out hour deliveries prime now and 
the total population served its footprint and would 
possibly store customer pick ups and new brick and mortar 
need times this space match wmt penetration levels 
shelf space for amzn other products which was also hinted 
longer term think amzn would need almost double 
during recent townhall meeting whole foods for the supply 
its footprint match wmt nationwide presence 
chain expect greater adoption omnichannel model where 
the last mile last touch point can take any form stores fulfillment 
industrial reits have been favored reit investors driven 
centers combination the two our view the debate isn 
broader ecommerce trends since late but the sector gains 
whether omnichannel favored over retail pure play ecommerce 
more generalist interest note greater competitive advantages

and value prologis pld and duke realty dre relative peers 
question for what does this mean for the demand drivers for 
given estimate pld amzn biggest reit landlord the 
warehouses and last mile parcel delivery logistics 
amzn warehouse space and pld portfolio 
followed dre amzn warehouse space and 
dre portfolio pld has significant proximity and exposure 
debate does omnichannel signal the end 
the race for warehouse space 
densely populated markets which major part amzn focus 
noted who leading the last mile dre land bank 
has the largest overlap with amzn top leasing markets and 
these names have shown less cap rate compression relatively 
market view early say but the omnichannel model 
could erode the value the warehouse 
our view amazon move actually accelerates the arms 
race for warehouse space with prologis and duke realty 
key beneficiaries 
cheaper than peers over the last years 
debate who benefits logistics 
omnichannel world 
market view parcel companies are the natural 
beneficiaries the broadening horizons ecommerce 
our view parcel networks would disintermediated 
truckers serve the giant retailers and logistics players like 
xpo serve the sub scale ecommerce space 
disagree with the consensus view that parcel companies have 
entrenched networks and will net ecommerce beneficiaries 
instead think that parcel companies are most risk from 
disintermediation omnichannel world 
the reinstatement the warehouse store moves 
effectively take packages out the hands ups fdx and hand 
truckload less than truckload carrier move closer 
the customer part regular store inventory fill 
while possible that the parcel companies can involved 
the warehouse store move especially part their 
freight less than truckload businesses estimate that they 
have the parcel delivery market between them but barely 
the trucking market which means they can get back 
what they lose 
addition the insourcing logistics ecommerce giants like 
amzn and wmt takes the best most dense and fastest growing 
business out their hands 
the face this new model think upstream closer suppliers 
and warehouses supply chain logistics providers rise importance 
particularly those with greater exposure the rest ecommerce

recommend xpo and are raising our xpo from

what you need know from this report 
the retail supply chain wars are heating again and 
looks like omnichannel may benefit the wfm amzn 
merger signaled that the dominant ecommerce retailer 
also needs brick and mortar stores serve customers 
effectively does this suggest that the demand drivers for 
warehouses and logistics firms two important 
components the supply chains should change 
examined the implications closely collaborating with 
our alphawise teams well analysts across the retail 
and internet industries and although still believe 
warehouses and specialty logistics firms see legacy 
parcel carriers like fdx ups vulnerable 
does this mean that amzn going lease less warehouse 
space 
will amzn buy lease more stores lieu warehouses 
expands 
importantly the demand for industrial reits about 
plummet 
this not zero sum game and think counterintuitively that this 
accelerates the warehouse demand and here why

for amzn warehouses are more efficient than physical retail 
who best positioned estimate that amzn 
agree that amzn could open more retail stores given 
warehouses are leased from reits with pld accounting for 
management has hinted another store format recent wfm 
followed dre and lpt but order look ahead 
townhall meeting think this particularly critical for groceries 
examined each the reit land banks and compared their 
where product spoilage and temperature requirements are suited 
footprints with amzn recent leasing markets here dre leads with 
retail and cold chain warehouses rather than traditional warehouses 
overlap with amzn top markets with lpt and pld 
see challenges grocery chain supply chains but retail stores 
think this very positive scenario for all industrial reits 
aren efficient warehouses given they are smaller wfm 
and expect increased interest catalyzed guidance raises the 
stores are the size typical last mile warehouse amzn 
second half the year however see relative value dre and 
store backrooms represent less already constrained space 
pld given they trade lower spreads than their year average 
even backrooms are expanded zoning and urban area traffic 
implied cap rates bps and bps respectively the sector 
restrictions limit the size the transportation into the backrooms 
yields have compressed more expensive average 
and warehouses are more automated particularly for amzn with 
accordingly are raising our dre and pld 
its best class fulfillment technology and can process more orders 
with less labor than retail stores 
retail stores still drive warehouse demand even amzn 
decides meaningfully expand its retail footprint can expect 
more warehouses given that our analysis suggests that even for thin 
grocery supply chains warehouse space typically 
needed for billion sales which the mil 
warehouse space needed for ecommerce heavy model like 
amzn traditional retailers require per billion

three major retail supply chain models 
ecommerce and omnichannel with each posing 
there not one size fits all solution though every retailer 
significant challenges either growth profitability both 
likely have slightly different supply chain solution that plays 
their strengths and weaknesses for example amzn online 
now seems like omnichannel may have potential advantage 
retailer will likely minimize reliance physical storefronts for 
the retail supply chain war the biggest takeaway from the 
while wmt likely leverage its powerful network dcs and 
amzn wfm deal was admission from the world most 
private truck fleet and target will likely continue emphasize the 
dominant ecommerce provider that needs brick and mortar stores 
use its stores micro fulfillment centers whichever the model 
effectively serve customers and likely beyond just the grocery

which could significant net positive for trucking whole 
however consensus views ecommerce positive for ltl and

believe the line between and ltl will increasingly 
blurred retailers look connect dcs directly stores 
can see scenarios where both and ltl can benefit depending 
the size the retailer and the complexity the supply chain for 
instance farm upstate that the primary supplier organic 
potatoes wfm amzn stores manhattan likely move full 
freight from source destination however smaller retailer 
can use ltl collect few pallets each from multiple farms and 
move store ultimately truck truck see times 
little over almost stores now online 
extreme industry tightness looseness and there are very few

scenarios that can good for ltl and bad for and vice versa

national networks are not built maximize density the hyperlocal 
stand alone business that can generate meaningful roic

our view the most likely solution for the last mile operation 
with last mile operators and crowdsourcers and the returns the
