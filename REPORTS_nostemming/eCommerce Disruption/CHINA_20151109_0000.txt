big box retailers digital transformation slowing retail 
environment will difficult however evidence suggests 
profitable partnership model emerging china share 
retailers valuations are unattractive 
near term outlook offline retailers negative big box retailers are 
mired with challenges slow declining sssg given overcapacity and 
slowing macro growth declining gift card sales which think are 
unlikely trough until early despite signs narrowing decline and 
ongoing market share losses online retailers slowing store expansions 
even store closures could result slowing rental income further pressuring 
profit growth prospects these combined with increasing investments 
ecommerce could result multi year earnings dilution leading competitors 
may more resilient but material outperformance unlikely 
digital transformation supports better medium term outlook over

retailers need embrace omni channel retailing drive more profitable 
direct sales business and reduce their reliance rental income retailers that 
still view online and offline separate channels will less competitive 
and leading retailers are likely benefit the most from 
expanding digital catchment area china one the most attractive 
location based service lbs markets globally given its higher urban density 
most countries with the population cities over demand food 
delivery has gained mass appeal and companies like koubei and baidu 
delivery have generated much higher daily orders than grubhub the 
lbs players expand into the demand delivery market believe offline 
stores could benefit lbs partners will continue subsidize user acquisitions 
the near term the expansion the digital catchment area makes leading 
players with large store base competitive pricing and wide offerings better 
positioned however given few successful precedents globally still see 
risks the medium term relating partnering with lbs players including 
costly investments and the lack reasonable profit sharing mechanisms

investment case 
near term headwinds remain intense for big box retailers 
china big box retailers such the grocery consumer electronics and department store retailers will continue 
face several headwinds that think are long standing fundamental issues that are unlikely abate the 
next months weighing top line growth and margin improvements 
headwind expect weak and sssg outlook our retail sales leading indicator 
continues project decelerating retail sales growth for year end suggesting broad weakness 
same store sales growth sssg among the big box retailers sssg the big box retailers continues trend 
slower than retail sales growth mainly because the following headwinds that are well known the market 
shrinking catchment area from excess retail capacity resulting modern retail fragmentation declining 
gift card sales and share losses online platforms positive note gift card sales declines have narrowed 
since the beginning this year and have seen pockets consolidation and store closures that could 
improve retailers long term growth prospects 
headwind over reliance rental income could put pressure margins floor expansion 
slows the landlord model sub leasing space marketplace tenants has become main profit driver 
given weak direct sales model merchandise segment among the grocery and electronic retailers under 
our coverage about profits before shared expenses are from other revenues with rental income 
representing the majority this slower traffic growth given combination the previously mentioned factors 
above makes lease rate improvement difficult additionally space growth highly correlated with rental income 
growth with space growth leading around one year slower store expansion and even store closures 
among the chain retailers could result slower rental income and beyond weighing operating 
margins 
headwind lack differentiating ecommerce strategy expect offline players suffer from multiyear losses their online operations given lack differentiation and high upfront costs customer 
acquisition and technology spend traditional retailers that seek incubate online marketplace 
business model similar that online retailer could face challenges our view price competition 
from will continue intense leverages loss making business draw traffic expand its 
marketplace our view has stated does not intend profitable the near term and the positive cash 
flow from its business would further enhance its ability increase merchandising scale other categories 
additionally believe marketplaces will dominated few leading players tmall that require 
different sets capabilities large advertising network alliance technology solutions for merchants 
estimate that tmall larger than marketplace and larger combined with taobao 
the lowest cost merchant provider leaving little room for smaller rivals gain material market share medium 
term 
digital transformation supports brighter medium term prospects 
september the state council released formal opinion acceleration and circulation 
innovation that focused encouraging innovation online and offline counterparts encouraging 
development these business entities and improving the modern market system believe the opinion 
will lead digitization integration and convergence the online and offline retail landscape further 
believe this trend starting take shape alibaba invests suning and invests yonghui for details 
the investments please see suning investment concerns and positives and yonghui investment concerns 
and positives 
highlight three phases digital transformation that leading big box retailers are focusing enhance 
their long term competitive position 
china retail internet november 
phase focus omni channel retail store purchases are increasingly digitally influenced enabled 
over store retail sales are digitally influenced the and believe this could higher 
china big box retailers need take holistic approach embrace digital commerce and view metro 
group omni channel strategy china good example evidence shows that successful omni channel 
strategy could result higher store sales and customer loyalty 
phase embrace the partnership note company including online and offline can 
competitive and profitable all four phases transaction value chain advertisement selection 
payment inventory and fulfillment believe only the partnership approach that integrates both forms 
location based services lbs and omni channel retail can profitable the long term leveraging the 
strength lbs players search advertisements and offline retailers products supply chain profitable 
partnership model already taking shape and the convergence helping offline big box retailers increase 
sssg regional grocery retailer wumart partnering with dmall lbs player enable demand grocery 
delivery that has resulted sssg for wumart stores beijing 
phase expand digital catchment area china attractive lbs market globally given its high urban 
density which could translate high order volume industry survey conducted analysys 
suggests demand food delivery service has mass appeal for adoption consumers that have monthly 
incomes above our industry checks indicate daily orders leading food delivery companies such 
alibaba koubei and baidu delivery have reached and respectively august above the 
daily orders for grubhub the more importantly leading food delivery lbs players are 
offering complimentary grocery delivery services believe leading grocery retailers stand benefit the most 
from this trend these partnerships could expand their digital catchment area and capture new group 
younger customers that are longer visiting stores make purchases 
while see opportunities for offline retailers the medium term they leverage the digital transformation 
also see that such investments and partnerships could pressure returns equity and margin outlook 
result rating may continue until market consolidator emerges risks partnering with lbs players and 
offline stores mainly lie 
risk few successful track records for retailer lbs partnerships globally few partnerships between 
retailers and lbs players china and overseas have achieved large scale and sustainable profits china such 
partnership still the initial stage with lot innovation happening thus the offline stores well lbs 
players china will have existing role model and thus would have result trial and error 
risk costly investments think investments incurred offline stores will costly including 
upgrading systems integrate with building infrastructure and adjusting offline networks better match 
those their lbs partners and recruiting staff experienced online offline integration assessment and 
management these investments can cause undue pressure already declining margins and roi and only 
few retailers will likely survive the market consolidation the other hand lbs partners will continue 
subsidize user acquisitions logistics and sometimes even online platform construction are concerned about 
the sustainability such subsidies from lbs partners given the cooling off the investment cycle 
risk lack reasonable profit sharing mechanisms believe reasonable profit sharing mechanism 
can reduce the risk having unsuccessful partnership existing partnerships have yet come with 
sustainable profit sharing plan that would motivate both parties currently lbs players state they usually apply 
take rate value products services provided and may also generate revenue from merchant 
advertising fees the cost side lbs players and offline stores may share the burden the discounts offered 
customers depending their bargaining power note that lbs players have not yet established mature 
and profitable business model and offline stores are also concerned about deteriorating margins due 
extensive discounts and promotions

the landlord model subleasing space tenants receiving fixed variable rental income has become the 
main profit driver for big box retailers representing large percentage their operating profits elaborate 
most chinese offline big box retailers leverage traffic generated from the sale competitively priced 
merchandise charge higher rental income for instance rental income for one the country leading 
hypermarket chains sun art represented operating profit assuming cost rental income for 
simplicity those with limited rental floor area tend much less profitable even loss making 
this business model under attack however given the shift shopping online which affecting both traffic

and slowing rental and other income growth could weigh overall margins 
the three levers for rental income growth among the big box retailers are new space growth existing store 
lease adjustments and tenant mix changes among these new space growth has been one the key reasons 
rental income growth continues robust despite weak sssg estimate space growth leads rental income 
growth months 
slower expansion plans and even store closures mean rental income will likely slow well and 
beyond depending chains strategies rental rates existing stores would likely have room for growth 
anecdotally however chain specialty retailers have commented slower lease growth rates the low 
mid single digits which could limit the upside rental rate potential the combination these effects would 
likely result limited margin upside for the offline business the next several years

similar offline business the profitable online business model the landlord model marketplaces such 
tmall the consignment model such vipshop such traditional retailers are migrating online with 
their own mixed and marketplaces they are following the same logic leveraging traffic from sales 
increase revenue believe this will met with lot challenges for two reasons 
the ability aggregate lot users with high repeat purchases the key reason these marketplaces 
succeed especially taobao tmall their ability acquire these users requires different set capabilities 
compared with offline business specifically taobao has one the largest advertising network alliances 
rivaling baidu and has led the internet industry allow merchants advertisers real time bidding rtb

even assuming all advertising revenue and commission income borne tmall merchants same 
other platforms china its take rate would low which forecast trend even 
lower since merchants contribute some the advertising revenue tmall platform should the 
lowest cost platform with the largest gmv contribution any merchant online sales activities 
long term these low cost marketplaces will the main channels for most brands merchants conduct 
businesses and will likely reduce exposure other smaller marketplaces they incur incremental costs 
would thus difficult for traditional retailers grow their online businesses and the same time incubate 
another large profitable marketplace our view

which believe largely explains its weaker than peer sssg from

given the intensive competition from highly promotional online players online prices had 
historically been significantly lower than those for the same skus that were sold offline the 
same price strategy hurt the profitability suning suppliers which consequently 
reallocated promotion resources other retailers even terminated their cooperation with

online sales that also boosted its cooperation with tmall and stabilizing offline sssg expect gross 
margin remain stable versus with the positive impact from increasing scale offsetting the 
negative impact from intensifying competition expect recurring net margin improve slightly from 
mainly because operational leverage 
assume revenue will increase yoy driven recovery the large home appliances segment 
the replacement cycle kicks which partially offset intensive competition from online retailers such 
expect gross margin remain stable versus with positive impact from increasing scale 
benefit and negative impact from intensifying competition offsetting each other expect recurring net margin 
slightly improve from mainly due operational leverage 
valuation 
suning currently trading versus gome our price target 
based implying slight discount versus gome after applying premium 
believe our concerns suning continuous margin pressure from its online offline same price 
strategy well lower earnings visibility deserve valuation discount over gome although this partially 
offset suning leading position the electronics and appliances market and development its ecommerce 
business 
upside risks our view include quicker than expected ramp ecommerce business thus achieving

sun art has great potential ramp its network effects like online marketplaces and lbs players 
reality offline retailers such sun art addressable household likely much smaller limited catchment 
area its stores for simplicity assume per basket asp and that each household shops once 
week sun art then sun art could reach households this would represent 
penetration out the estimated maximum households could potentially reach number view 
optimistic considering likely higher basket size weekly frequency thus believe there still great room for 
sun art improve its network effects and enlarge catchment area enhancing its digital presence and 
cooperating with online players

slower expansion offline network although the total number stores added 
unchanged 
slightly higher operating expense ratio assumptions reflect expense ratio

fine tune our earnings estimates for this mainly reflect slowing new store
