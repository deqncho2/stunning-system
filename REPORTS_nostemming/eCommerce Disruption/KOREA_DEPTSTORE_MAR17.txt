department stores value proposition not much 
impaired think overseas online shopping and 
parallel imports attract customers with cheaper pricing 
the expense convenience authenticity products 
naturally most items purchased through these channels 
tend more commoditized there little overlap with 
high end department stores offerings the traditional 
channel including fragmented specialty stores has felt 
the greatest impact from channel shift 
department stores are capturing price sensitive 
consumers through outlet and online initiatives 
have been highlighting department stores format 
diversification into premium outlets and the online 
channel these efforts are becoming sizable enough 
fuel growth particular premium outlets earnings 
contribution already made more than 
shinsegae earnings

think recent rebound underlying sales should well 
prove that channel disruption has only limited impact 
even during high season promotion period thanks

summary key debates 
market concern 
our view 
overseas online shopping 
agree the rapid growth overseas online shopping korea 
cagr over and expect cagr the coming 
three years 
attractive pricing overseas online sites will 
lead consumer shift away from department 
stores thus rapidly increasing overseas online 
purchases will materially erode department 
stores sales and profitability 
however product overlap with department stores should limited 
mostly high end apparel and cosmetics estimate that 
the mix competes directly with department stores 
estimate overseas online purchases domestic retail 
sales our assumption cagr implies 
this would erode department store sales growth per annum 
which could easily overcome improving cycle 
more importantly think the value proposition provided 
department store channel very different from that overseas online 
sites cheap pricing especially for high end shopping 
parallel imports 
increasing parallel imports will affect department 
stores sales because price competitiveness 
due inherent shortfalls parallel imports difficulty consistent 
sizable sourcing authenticity issue also see limited impact 
department stores 
eventually imported brands will lower their 
prices korea which will lead average basket 
price decline department stores 
rather department stores could use this channel for their 
merchandised products especially lure price sensitive consumers 
during promotion periods 
think the price normalization for certain products with abnormally 
high prices korea should positive for department stores the long 
run could bring more traffic with improved credibility pricing 
amazon korea potential business launch 
amazon enters the korean commerce 
business would accelerate overseas online 
shopping with more friendly interface service 
for korean consumers 
backed its merchandising power and global 
sourcing capability amazon commerce 
launch would put department stores peril 
seen japan 
premium outlets earnings contribution 
pbt 
compared amazon successful penetration japan think key 
difference the timing amazon was one the early movers online 
retailing enjoying both channel growth and its own market share gain 
but the korean market already well penetrated commerce 
retail sales took place online with large players the big four 
hold over market share 
think amazon service offering relates more amazon web 
service corporate cloud computing and digital content rather than 
online shopping 
what we wrong 
overseas online shopping parallel imports attract more 
price sensitive consumers off season promotion periods could boost 
demand these channels strongly thus rebounding sales momentum 
jan and feb near estimated could support our argument

channel disruption have only limited impact 
share underperformance amid rising concern 
department store names have underperformed the kospi 
ytd relative performance kospi lotte shinsegae 
and hds weaker than expected earnings 
especially from lotte could one reasons but think 
that overall concern about channel disruption could key 
issue the moment weighing share prices identify 
three key developments and the market concern follows 
overseas online shopping since late the media 
has highlighted wide price gap for certain imported 
items between overseas and korean outlets channels 
the sharp discounts offered retailers after black 
friday last year also attracted korean consumers 
amazon entry since amazon korea hired the ceo 
google korea last january there has been 
speculation the media korea economic daily 
about the potential launch the near term amazon 
business korea should amazon launch its 
commerce business could accelerate overseas 
online purchases using the amazon site according 
the media 
parallel imports the government korea customs 
office has promoted parallel imports with certified 
clearance lower imported product prices 
during the period department stores channel share improved 
from although small 
gained share online disruption has been real 
threat the traditional channel including fragmented 
specialty stores which has lost share continuously from 
with this channel shift 
department stores may lose opportunity share online but 
far they have survived through scaling and providing 
differentiated services offerings

source nso morgan stanley research 
these developments have been highlighted the media 
korea economic daily maeil business etc potential 
threat the department store industry which could lose 
channel share however think the actual impact could 
prove somewhat limited because the overlaps between 
customers and between brands are not that big the size 
the online channel relatively small for big near term impact 
and department stores are diversifying their format and 
sourcing attract price sensitive customers 
department stores little overlap with other channels 
terms value proposition and customer base 
think the value proposition overseas online shopping 
and parallel imports lies mainly competitive pricing brand 
differentiation for brands not introduced domestic channels 
yet could prove another merit but should not much big 
impact for existing channels anyway instead inconvenience 
not easy for refund exchange and long delivery time could 
prove trade off for overseas online shopping and 
authenticity issues could prove major loophole for parallel 
imports 
channel disruption not new thing korea 
the online channel represented the retail 
market excluding auto and fuel with growth yoy the 
growth rate had slightly decelerated from even 
with mobile commerce penetration without the mobile 
channel the size the online channel would have seen only 
growth mobile commerce now represents 
total online commerce the online channel had only 
channel share years ago but has taken share 
every year and think its share could reach 
department stores key competitiveness has never been 
pricing but rather brand selection convenience and service 
offering differentiated experience high end consumers 
based our european retail team framework please refer 
european retailing the internet and the long term 
published feb ultimately there are two shopping 
missions functional maintenance purpose and leisure 
while there are four types retailer distribution driven

this context think department stores current efforts

consumer experience related leisure function should well 
serve differentiate its value proposition against other 
formats the long run

still there could issue for pricing gap identical items 
which could lead consumer shift given that many luxury 
brands employ global dynamic pricing policy avoid too 
much arbitrage and that consumers still have pay tariffs 
for apparel above korea think the 
pricing gap between department stores and overseas online 
purchases could eventually reduced think the price 
normalization for certain products that are abnormally highly 
priced korea should positive for department stores 
the long run could bring more traffic especially from 
price sensitive customers thanks higher credibility

expected impact from parallel imports 
think parallel imports have double edged effect 
department stores both positive and negative way 
parallel imports have their inherent shortcomings 
difficulty sourcing products are sourced from 
non manufacturers brands indirectly not easy provide 
consistent and large scale offerings consumers 
especially with new popular items even mart 
which has been 
aggressively increasing its parallel imports recorded 
sales and plans increase this 
market share internet retailing the secondlargest player after rakuten this 
translates share the total retailing market japan 
think key difference between japan case and the 
potential scenario korea lies the timing amazon 
potential entrance mentioned earlier commerce already 
has high penetration korea japan and 
well consolidated the large players therefore think 
japan success story will not repeated easily korea 
think amazon service offering korea would more 
amazon web service corporate cloud computing and digital 
content rather than online shopping 
exhibit 
authenticity products this issue likely prove 
major obstacle for sales high ticket items recently 
korea customs office said plans increase clearance 
certification allowing customers check where the 
products were sourced from but this does not guarantee 
the product authenticity hence the negative impact 
department stores cheaper priced parallel imports 
should prove limited especially for high end shopping 
our view rather believe department stores could use 
this channel for its own merchandised products 
especially attract price sensitive consumers during 
promotion periods
