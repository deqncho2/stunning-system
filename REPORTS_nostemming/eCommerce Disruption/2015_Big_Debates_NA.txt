view primary hurdles include solving distribution and 
potential for attractiveness competing structures 
blackrock precidian rowe price the news shows 
the desire active asset managers reduce distribution 
transfer agency and flow related costs associated with mutual 
funds all while retaining their full management fees believe our overweight rated stocks skewed etfs blk 
wetf will relative winners this environment given 
etmfs put the cost discussion front and center which 
likely puts more pressure providers activelymanaged mutual funds will take time for the etmf product 
work and gain acceptance the meantime believe 
etfs have gained meaningful ally and will benefit the lowcost market solution

initially expected 
various times 
decisions expected from sec other proposals for actively managed exchange traded mutual funds including those from precidian blackrock rowe 
two main sticking points impacting etmf proliferation 
distribution the key sticking point the proliferation 
actively managed exchange traded mutual funds our 
view for three primary reasons 
first remains unclear how brokers financial advisors 
fas will incentivized sell etmfs revenue share 
incremental fund cost pushed extinction 
second and also tying into solving distributor compensation etmfs mark the transition mutual funds from being sold products bought ones actively managed 
mutual funds remain sold product with network 
wholesalers pitching the merits their products brokers fas who turn select products for their clients 
etfs for the most part have historically been more 
bought ticker some would argue potentially more meritbased 
third offering etmfs requires substantial investment 
the part distributors with incremental benefits unclear 
it uncertain whether distributor would that 
since brokerage arrangements remain majority the 
industry believe fas are still somewhat disincentivized invest immediately the infrastructure and investor education needed hop onboard etmfs especially 
when the incremental benefits remain unclear and 
for some potentially cannibalizing see little first 
mover advantage with etmfs 
buy build nothing mutual fund providers 
must decide pay another provider should there 
one license its structure build their own structure 
stay uninvolved the etmf space altogether our views 
the matter are follows 
expect multiple structures approved the 
sec precidian blackrock and rowe among others are forging ahead with alternative proposals admittedly don know which proposal may ultimately 
approved the sec but are confident that competing structure will emerge some point 
expect the process long and drawn out 
many asset managers wait see how many competing 
structures exist before choosing with whom align 
etmfs all though think the expected timing 
the nextshares launch potentially aggressive 
believe there will ample time for asset managers 
that are wait and see mode assess the full landscape competing products 
how play the etmf debate 
believe our overweight rated stocks skewed 
etfs blackrock blk and wisdomtree wetf 
will relative winners this environment 
etmfs illustrate clear interest the part asset 
managers lower product costs and shine even 
brighter spotlight cost investors weighing various investment products this dynamic will likely put 
more pressure providers actively managed mutual 
funds addition distributors 
however big hurdle facing etmfs solving distribution etfs have established distribution channels and 
should able thrive the low cost market solution

the north america autos team sees alignment forces that could drive the largest decline used vehicle prices history while there has been more balance the 
investor conversation lately believe the stock market 
doesn fully appreciate the impact that stealth deflation 
new car pricing could have the second hand market 
see new car prices coming under pressure over the next couple years spurred excess north america light vehicle 
capacity weakening yen and easy auto credit that may not 
feasibly get much easier true the impact car manufacturers car rental firms and dealers could severe

come under modest pressure but only due growth 
off lease supply moreover sub manheim print currently seen extremely unlikely the index has 
been stable since the financial crisis new car prices will likely 
remain elevated the saar reaches record highs while the 
weakening yen will have small impact rivals 
however believe the market not appreciating the potential for deflation new car prices even decline over 
the next years could prove material for used prices given 
that used prices tend more volatile than new prices 
from peak trough

used car price volatility typically that new car 
price volatility ever wonder why many investors are 
surprised that used price volatility that new think 
the most compelling explanation this phenomenon that 
new car supply can quickly corrected downturn from 
days supply million saar less than days 
supply million saar while used car inventory 
fixed the only mechanism which used car dealer can 
equilibrate supply and demand used cars during downturn through price you can make new car but you 
can prevent the production new car the first place 
implications our call car rental companies dealers 
and oems meaningful decline used and new vehicle 
prices would have major implications for our coverage universe beginning with the rental car companies expect 
lower residual values over the next couple years will impact 
the expense item for hertz and avis budget our depreciation estimates are well above consensus both htz and 
car and can envision scenario where monthly per unit 
fleet costs approach nearly even the industry 
able realize stronger pricing sooner than later higher 
depreciation would likely severely undercut profitability with 
respect the dealers the factors that expect create 
deflationary new and used pricing environment capacity currency credit and used supply would also make very competitive for dealers sustain current gross profit per transaction new used finance insurance they try attract 
the incremental buyer and get the deal done competitive 
forces also hurt costs and rising saar

the potential benefit from number favorable macro indicators going forward lower unemployment improving consumer confidence lower gas prices and minimum wage hikes

perspective centric stocks our coverage have outperformed bps the last month emerging market 
centric stocks helped both trends and underlying fundamentals 
while investors have focused this benefit across these two 
groups would argue that the beverage sub sector rather 
than hpc the better way play this dynamic for two key 
reasons first non alcoholic beverages are seeing improved pricing play out with coca cola leading carbonated 
soft drinks pricing higher and energy drinks the promotional 
environment has subsided ahead planned red bull price 
increases this enhanced pricing should augment any 
macro driven beverage volume recovery the alcohol side

though cord cutting precipitated several new ott offerings real concern continue expect flat 
modest increase pay subs and cable 
broadband position and falling video cash flow exposure 
limit the risk while recent over the top ott announcements 
are step toward more customized bundles internet delivery 
content and even direct consumer model argue

the broadband hedge title creates some risk but

current peak trough decline function supply 
while both price movements impact the high end the petrochemical cost curve neither affects global polyethylene capacity utilization thus see decline more than

first regulators are becoming more balanced their

john kanas bankunited although we heard this from 
other banks well the overarching view that banks have 
benefited over the last several years from reserve release and 
expense reductions but that those tailwinds are subsiding 
without higher interest rates see few remaining levers 
drive improved financial conditions across the industry 
second higher interest rates are not always good thing 
for bank earnings generally speaking higher short term 
interest rates are positive for many midcap banks but this 
not universal several the banks within our coverage universe are liability sensitive meaning net interest income goes 
down rates rise moreover other banks such cullen frost are buying very long duration assets increase 
earnings today but this comes the expense future earnings improvement for those types banks see higher 
interest rates more threat than benefit 
third the timing rate hikes open question the 
market view when the fed will hike rates continues

hikes begin early but for banks relying higher

the property cat reinsurance market but the expansion alternative capital into long tail lines watford between arch capital and highbridge capital and primary insurance the potential between ace and blackrock could

large reinsurance brokers aon benefield marsh

enter markets and lines business lower operating

those that adapt can not only survive but thrive our 
view longer term believe thriving insurers that adapt 
this secular change should maintain strategic relevance

ace and blackrock will likely see more new 
alternative capital entrants jvs between traditional

large cat losses billion plus unexpected losses 
reserve charges that could potentially turn pricing and rising

intel has had window exploit manufacturing leadership drive success outside its core business but 
this likely narrow not widen intel has had monopoly for nearly years advanced manufacturing technology called finfet which the company has used try 
build presence other businesses such foundry tablets 
and smartphones believe that monopoly will fade next 
year competitors ramp similar technologies intel has scaling advantages this node but not project that continue increase intel other manufacturing advantages are 
likely overrated outside the and server business for 
which intel manufacturing process optimized believe 
the market pricing profits outside pcs and servers that 
remain unlikely leading our underweight rating 
consensus among bulls that moore law working 
for intel but not for peers time when capital intensity 
concerns are dominating the industry intel has shown better transistor scaling the current generation than tsmc and 
consensus that this will continue though think finfet 
not transistor scaling the point tsmc current transition 
which why the difference large many bulls believe 
that intel merely needs properly apply its advanced manufacturing capability new markets and can drive substantial 
new revenue and earnings streams and that this advantage 
will increase geometrically over time respect intel manufacturing prowess but think the value that technology outside intel core market overstated particularly intel 
period the only manufacturer finfet transistors fades 
what the price 
intel valuation premium large cap peers reflects optimism about new business opportunities

background intel has had three year lead key manufacturing technology called finfet three dimensional 
transistors which gives them potential edge key areas 
such performance per watt 
intel also has shown data that its cost per transistor will continue come down its historical rate along the called 
moore law curve time when that has been called into 
question for peers 
intel believes that can exploit this advantage enter new 
markets such foundry tablets and smartphones this 
narrative has become central the bull case which has the 
company eliminating billion segment losses its 
smartphone tablet business and building viable profit pools 
those new markets just properly focusing this technology 
advantage 
our view that intel will retain advantage but that 
will narrow and this manufacturing advantage will 
tough apply new businesses though has been critical dominating the core and server businesses intel 
revenue per wafer nearly times foundry competitors 
revenues per wafer the cutting edge which has caused the 
competitors optimize for performance not cost flexibility 
believe that this view has been validated the relative 
lack foundry customer announcements with altera the only 
morgan stanley research 
the big debates 
december 
major customer publicly sign thus far and intel failure 
move its own baseband business onto its own manufacturing process until partly because per intel baseband 
contacts the intel finfet process was optimized for 
cpus and therefore not optimal for baseband 
the monopoly this key finfet technology ending 
with below plan returns from the year exclusive 
window expect tsmc will make significant strides with 
its finfet technology which should see first production with the original finfet technology and also 
believe second version called plus seeing better yield 
ramp and could hit volume earlier than expected tsmc customers tell that will have very good specs though 
won really know until see product the market 
also expect samsung covered shawn kim and technology partner global foundries ramping finfet 
altera xilinx shines light this debate 
altera remains intel only announced large customer for the 
foundry business which was announced two years ago they 
plan tape out their first intel based product with 
first silicon likely going customers xilinx which 
has remained with tsmc also aims tape out its first tsmc 
finfet based product with first silicon customers 
while both product lines will small those 
products will scrutinized for signs intel leadership 
intel costs are coming down faster than tsmc but 
this may not the game changer the bulls think 
believe that least intel cost per gate will come 
down more than tsmc but have estimated that intel 
manufacturing cost per wafer about 
higher than tsmc cost that cost disadvantage 
will narrow they get better transistor scaling but some 
that reflects the fact that tsmc scrambled catch 
finfet and even has minimal scaling 
the bottom line that intel costs are likely remain 
significantly higher than tsmc through 
the long term trajectory still uncertain whereas consensus sees clear win for intel don know how 
aggressively tsmc can scale its costs beyond 
see tsmc going risk production late 
meaning production for customers likely intel 
should similarly late early newer extreme 
ultraviolet euv technology proves cost effective the next 
couple years tsmc could use whereas intel 
extended planning process wouldn allow for that until 
this could give tsmc advantage 
argue will the merit the products not because 
moore law working for them and isn working for anyone 
else our view build successful foundry business intel 
will have orient its business toward foundry successful smartphones think intel will have build product much better than qualcomm don believe that intel manufacturing benefit you win card which seems 
the underpinning the bull case we consider setback intel finfet exclusivity closes without exploiting that 
lead outside its core business 
what means for tsmc tsmc has typically thrived 
moving high volume advanced technology ahead its 
competitors but with samsung and intel potentially getting 
into the business and intel technology leadership the competitive dynamics may changing ultimately stated earlier not believe intel large advantage relative 
tsmc its cost higher its manufacturing process 
not optimized for the foundry business model and tsmc 
accelerating its development however 
moore law aside intel does want get into the foundry 
business still see potential threat for tsmc just 
because tsmc has had monopoly the leading edge and 
customers will want second source timing wise see 
samsung the larger threat probably too 
late for intel secure additional customers this point 
however worth watching 
potential catalysts 
tsmc starts ramp its own finfet technology 
and intel starts ramp its second generation finfet 
intel first major foundry customer altera moves 
its first product into manufacturing xilinx moves its first 
tsmc product into manufacturing 
intel should start move its own baseband into 
its own factories nearly years after acquiring its baseband business 
first news progress from intel and 
tsmc expect production late also expect
