defensive case for last mile properties sticking with downturn 
scenario last mile properties show stronger and more resilient 
vacancy profiles which gives greater comfort owning these

longer term the last mile distribution fertile ground for 
innovation and change long term scenario could include using 
other real estate asset classes such self storage and lockers 
serve even closer last mile asset could also envision scenario 
where the economics warehouse outweigh those retail
