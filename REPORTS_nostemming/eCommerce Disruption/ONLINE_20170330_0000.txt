online grocery 
europe asia who ahead 
asia has some the world most advanced and fastest 
growing online grocery markets typically led ecommerce 
pureplayers europe this channel dominated 
conventional operators examine the specifics each 
geography and identify potential readacross 
the world most penetrated online grocery markets are located europe and 
asia europe estimate penetration highest france and the 
asia japan china and korea lead the way 
put things perspective this higher than the 
penetration rates are relatively similar but business models differ materially 
europe incumbents such tesco carrefour have largely been able 
keep new entrants bay and their combined market share exceeds these 
players offer full basket perishables fmcg frozen either via home delivery 
click collect orders are collected from the stores 
but asia leading ecommerce players alibaba and china 
rakuten japan that typically capture higher market share online grocery 
although korea market structure hybrid and more similar europe 
online offline partnerships are developing rapidly sun art with baidu 
waimai metro with dmall they remain early stages with unproven 
economics but allow grocers and partners each focus their core strengths 
penetration levels category france and the online baskets are 
fairly similar that average supermarket but asia some categories 
remain under penetrated produce while others have already reached 
high online penetration levels pet food china europe 
going forward europe market growth has somewhat slowed recently high 
single digits both france the incumbents have reduced subsidization 
the channel tesco raised the minimum basket size for free delivery july 
however expansion ecommerce pure players generalists such 
amazon fresh specialists such zooplus could translate into reacceleration channel growth asia most conventional players have only 
recently started fight back although mart has pioneered online grocery 
korea they roll out their full basket offers expect online grocery asia 
grow double digit cagrs over the cycle 
europe the stocks see most risk are tesco carrefour metro 
and casino for their exposure large box formats increasingly 
under pressure from online most immune appears jeronimo martins 
whereas ocado should key beneficiary asia mart 
transition looks good shape and its online business gaining traction and 
think alibaba and rakuten will remain the main platforms

executive summary 
key conclusions 
there are important differences between european and asian online grocery 
conventional players europe have developed online solutions earlier the 
channel shift process compared their peers asia tesco pioneered 
online grocery with launch but sun art only started online grocery 
preventing ecommerce pure players from taking too much market share 
within the segment today where they are the biggest the their market 
share south korea saw somewhat hybrid evolution with leader emart starting online grocery early but pure players following suit quickly after 
online adoption fresh produce much higher europe asia and the 
composition online and offline baskets much more similar online pureplayer ocado even over indexes fresh compared the national average and 
online grocery logistics are much more integrated europe opposed 
generally relying party partners asia far 
online grocery date has taken slightly different shapes the three asian 
countries look but isolate three common features specific asia 
very high penetration some discretionary categories and contrast still low 
fresh produce high market share captured leading ecommerce pure 
players importance online offline partnerships 
think these could help foresee how online grocery might evolve europe 
given what already happening asia looking forward see within european 
online grocery significant potential for further online shift some fmcg 
categories for instance simplistically assuming that penetration levels 
discretionary categories such beverages beauty personal care and 
tissue hygiene reach those achieved today asia would translate into 
additional consumer spend shifting online the and france 
calculate ecommerce pure players either generalists like amazon 
specialists like zooplus want seat the table and expect them further 
attempt leverage their more efficient cost structure helped lack legacy 
format issues grow volumes and gain market share which some cases they 
can leverage elsewhere their business increasingly diversified business 
models whereby some conventional players will choose outsource part 
whole their online grocery business and notably the last mile logistics 
morrisons the trials auchan and carrefour france all this suggests 
there much more for european online grocery 
while the two continents asia offers the biggest growth opportunity 
acknowledge the potential barriers entry some these markets such 
less developed chilled supply chain china compared western standards 
and cultural demographic hurdles japan but despite that see asia the 
greater opportunity between the two continents with potentially 
cagr across the three main geographies there equating additional 
grocery spend migrating online broadly the size the spanish grocery 
market 
after slow start expect incumbents asia fight back online grocery 
the pace which online grocery developed asia surprised most but too did 
the fact that its rise mostly stemmed from pure players with little prior expertise 
grocery china the major hypermarket players have only started recently 
focus their multichannel transformation for the majority since 
only leaving lot potential for future growth the channel once fullassortment offers are more developed typically more difficult full 
weekly basket shopping with the ecommerce pure players today 
south korea the world most penetrated grocery market ahead the 
process and believe the most advanced players there could now 
position reap the benefits important investments online grocery over the 
past few years 
stock implications most exposed are those operators large box formats that 
are still the early stages the multichannel transformation process europe 
reiterate our structurally cautious stance the listed names with high 
exposure the hypermarket format see exhibit most exposed across both 
continents are tesco carrefour and metro biggest beneficiaries 
are ocado europe well alibaba and rakuten asia

how online impacting asian grocery markets 
this section look the disruption food retailers from online the three most 
developed online markets asia namely china japan and south korea 
china 
sudden rise ecommerce 
online penetration has ballooned the last three four years online penetration 
for fast moving consumer goods fmcg china has rapidly increased from 
close today according kantar estimates carrefour ceo said 
the interims china the country the world where the internet and ecommerce 
tsunami has been most vigorous hear that about chinese people now use 
ecommerce this absolutely considerable penetration has even reached 
some categories such tissue hygiene home care and pet care 
although the core supermarket categories have date remained relatively immune 
indeed the most disrupted categories far have been discretionary categories such 
apparel computers communications and consumer electronics home appliances 
followed some cosmetics and hpc household and personal care products such 
that estimate that supermarket space and sales has already 
been disrupted online 
far however supermarkets core categories fresh food and dry groceries have been 
less affected ecommerce with penetration fresh food being estimate 
based combination kantar and iresearch data this mainly due three main 
reasons believe 
consumers behaviour believe the core food and fcmg categories remain 
more needs based and impulse driven china meaning offline stores remain the 
preferred channel meet this type demand also offline hypermarket players 
are still the most suited today for completing one full weekly grocery basket 
logistical barriers there are the well known logistical challenges online 
grocery higher shipping costs per order due weight size and triple 
temperature shipping frozen chilled ambient but china this compounded 
relatively low average basket size with the average basket for offline 
supermarkets standing per typical ecommerce 
order well relatively less advanced chilling capabilities last for chinese 
online players selling groceries note that most often they rely thirdparty model which makes the logistics combining the odd items 
typical supermarket order more complex for instance the chinese shopper 
shops from multiple different grocery vendors 
still limited offer far evidence from europe suggest online grocery very 
much still offer led market but probably related what have just 
mentioned above conventional operators have far only recently awakened 
the idea multi channel business model for instance carrefour efforts 
online grocery only picked really such that its online grocery 
presence remains very early days carrefour offers online services chinese 
cities only with the intention going the end 
but offline players attempting catch might soon break the status quo online 
grocery similar prisoners dilemma for established conventional supermarkets 
ideally given the much lower margins the segment conventional store based 
operator wishes that none its competitors moves online but soon believes 
one its competitors might about launch full fledged online grocery offer then 
its interest launch its own because losing the totality shoppers weekly 
shop competitor online offer would even worse than seeing that shopper move 
lower margin channel but within the same group and china are already 
witnessing clear commitments from conventional players ramp their multichannel 
offer sun art for instance see dedicated section below 
purchases groceries online are not only growing fast and accelerating for example 
according beijing based consultancy iresearch purchases fresh produce online 
grew yoy reach close accelerating 
growth rate they also widely appeal chinese consumers seems indeed 
mckinsey estimates that already about half chinese consumers have bought 
groceries online high figure when compared just the 
addition over the medium term believe the development online offline 
partnerships could further challenge the current status quo this there has 
been few notable developments recently such investing yonghui for instance 
see below 
four specific features the chinese online grocery market 
amongst what sets apart the chinese ecommerce market would highlight the 
following 
fragmented online grocery market data online grocery difficult come 
china and one the reasons due its fragmentation while estimate 
pure players account for over half the online grocery market and out these 
the top players alibaba mostly likely for the majority china online 
grocery today characterised long tail small specialised pure players 
conventional offliners are growing fast and ramping but have only recently 
launched their online grocery businesses sun art 
still relatively immature grocery retail market contrary europe where 
modern grocery opposed traditional grocery some countries such the 
accounts for the overall grocery market china the channel shift 
favour online has started what remains relatively immature grocery and 
for that matter retail market leap frogging steps seen traditionally more 
mature markets where typically one the conventional players pioneering 
online 
logistics built franchised model ordering online can done just 
few clicks but getting goods delivered chinese customers requires complex 
network able reach tens thousands cities counties and even villages 
china franchisers that have played and are still playing crucial role 
allowing chinese ecommerce firms achieve geographic reach these 
franchisers have considerably expanded their networks and done much faster 
than their integrated competitors mostly thanks the fact that the 
franchised model much the opex and capex being absorbed the multiple 
local franchisees 
mature markets japan and europe the express delivery segment 
concentrated among major players but china remains more fragmented with 
the top players being similar size and offering comparable services 
support from the authorities according carrefour ceo july 
there massive support for ecommerce the part local authorities and 
this should seen the context digitalisation and ecommerce being seen 
very strong tools for the country modernisation for example september 
the state council released formal opinion acceleration and 
circulation innovation that focused encouraging innovation online 
offline counterparts and promoting the development these businesses entities 
key players chinese online grocery 
china the channel shift online has been fuelled mostly pure players with 
conventional players far reacting only defensive basis 
the main pure players 
tmall alibaba formerly known taobao mall tmall alibaba 
platform tmall launched nov allow its authorised verified 
distributors differentiate from the merchants taobao june 
parent company alibaba reorganised into three separate companies which led 
tmall become independent business within the group the other two

one store was founded july and such one china earliest 
online grocery retailers walmart bought stake the business which 
was increased the following year and finally summer 
june walmart sold the business return for which the 
retail giant took stake worth about the share price 
then had the past expressed its interest the grocery business and 
august had bought stake supermarket chain yonghui for 
october walmart increased its stake 
founded the company launched its platform 
mostly selling consumer electronics then only started selling grocery items 
from december from then has benefited from the fast rise 
foreign food sales ecommerce platforms chinese demand for foreign food 
has been rapidly growing the past few years driven the appetite for 
affordable luxury that appeals the rising chinese middle class separately

the largest conventional players 
sun art china largest hypermarket operator with national market 
share among stores launched its ecommerce operations january 
with feiniu full line ecommerce direct sales platform which started 
sell fresh food december shanghai sun art online grocery 
operations achieved nationwide coverage thanks its online offline 
programme may separately sun art acquired april online 
grocery store fieldchina the gmv feiniu doubled reach 
with this delivered out stores 
exhibit sun art uses four main different channels sell online grocery china 
source company data morgan stanley research 
carrefour china response the acceleration the decline its 
like for like sales carrefour initiated repositioning its business model away 
from its previous strategy relatively aggressive hypermarket openings spread 
across very different provinces and towards more focused multi format and 
multi channel strategy this change strategy involved taking control their 
supply chain today still only products sold carrefour through 
carrefour distribution centre closing stores refocusing their stores 
fresh food via improved food courts and launching their own food ecommerce 
operations shanghai august and later beijing april the 
end last year carrefour offered online grocery services cities and its 
ambition extend this the end 
walmart china walmart online grocery history china started with its 
agreement with yihaodian detailed above towards the end its 
sam club format started directly deliver chilled and frozen food through its 
sam club online shop also offering specific same day delivery options 
shenzhen guangzhou beijing and shanghai cities where its sam club stores 
are located 
october last year walmart said will invest new dada chinese 
online grocery and delivery crowd sourcing platform part owned 
which walmart has minority stake following the sale its yihaodian 
subsidiary addition walmart china partnering with launch two hour 
delivery services china announced that more than its stores 
china will provide the express delivery service for customers ordering new 
dada walmart covered our colleague simeon gutman 
yonghui august agreed invest for 
stake yonghui which the fifth largest food retailer china see exhibit 
part the agreement obtained the right appoint two directors 
yonghui board including one independent while both companies decided 
cooperate supply chain improvements and explore partnerships 
december yonghui started roll out hour home delivery service for 
groceries and fresh food the service launched with yonghui superstores 
beijing and with relatively narrow range products both fresh food 
such meat and everyday home essentials like shampoo delivery fees for 
orders above are free but charging for orders 
below that threshold 
metro china metro cash carry operator but estimate its 
chinese sales are done households small company offices scos 
september metro launched three pronged multichannel strategy first 
the group formed strategic alliance with alibaba establishing presence 
taobao tmall and tmall global which offers high quality products sourced 
from europe this should allow metro acquire new online customers lower 
costs well leverage the platforms real time big data solutions helping 
metro select overseas products that would sell well china second metro 
launched local ecommerce proposition with combination home 
delivery and click collect services rolled out out the 
stores they have today spread across cities for the home delivery option 
metro partnering with lbs players such dmall meituan and xiaomei 
offer one hour delivery services last metro has launched its own stand alone 
website metromall with the objective retaining acquired online customers 
and maintaining the direct customer relationship 
the ongoing digital transformation big box retailers what remains market 
marked overcapacity will probably remain painful the short term not only have 
the hypermarket operators seen their general merchandise businesses impacted the 
rise ecommerce sales for example online penetration consumer electronics 
stands today china according euromonitor they are now having adjust 
world where part their core assortment also moving online whilst the worst 
the disruption might behind anticipate few years margin pressures ahead 
conventional players orchestrate transition multichannel world 
the case carrefour although model the asian level including taiwan 
expect the china component the division remain loss making for the whole 
the tune maybe the ebit level this would mark improvement 
losses mse but still far off from the ebit margin generated 
the start the decade subsequently expect very little margin improvement for 
carrefour operations the country for sun art its commerce operation incurred 
losses with gmv management expects loss 
reduction the company has been shifting focus and scaling back the traffic 
acquisition costs 
elsewhere the challenge for conventional operators could also come from the fact that 
pure quasi pure players might remain very top line driven for the forseeable future 
note for instance that has stated does not intend become profitable the 
short term and that will use the positive cash flow from its business further 
enhance its ability increase merchandising scale other categories today 
estimate that tmall potentially larger than marketplace and 
larger combined with taobao implying significant room for catch 
exploring potential partnership models between lbs and conventional grocers over 
the past two years have seen rising attempts develop collaborative business 
models between players and traditional retailers 
for instance dmall demand grocery lbs player has tied with wumart 
beijing lianhua shanghai and cre vanguard shenzhen offer hour grocery 
delivery for certain items the opportunity for the partners clearly increase its 
volumes and make its offer more relevant both convenience and range whilst 
typical offline supermarket could stock skus and reach catchment area with lbs partnership both reach and range can easily multiplied three fold 
the case the dmall partnership the latter fully integrated with the retailers erp 
systems the back end which allows real time inventory visibility and efficient 
allocation supply and demand 
have yet see confirmation the sustainability these business models for 
both partners far there indeed limited track record from such partnerships with 
most remaining very early stages currently lbs players state they usually apply take rate value products services provided and may also generate revenues 
from merchant advertising fees terms the costs lbs players and offline stores 
would typically share the burden the discounts offered consumers lbs players 
have yet establish mature and profitable business model while offline stores are 
also rightly concerned about fast deteriorating margins due channel shift and price 
competition online order work over the long term these lbs partnerships will 
need come with profit sharing agreements that would motivate both parties 
however believe the potential success such partnership models have lot 
with some specifics the chinese market would argue that there are key 
features the chinese market that make lbs partnerships particularly compelling 
compared other potential alternative business models high urban density china 
counts cities with population point point logistics with lot the 
grocery items not transiting through centralised dcs relatively low wages which 
means relatively manual fulfilling processes which the case when picking orders from 
the stores not too detrimental unit economics

why has online grocery been successful the country course due 
combination factors including very high urbanisation the population internet wifi 
available nearly everywhere high smartphone penetration around people own 
smart phone korea almost double the global average around digital savvy 
consumer and offer that comes with free delivery subject minimum basket sizes 
varying company wide range products offered and very attractive prices driven 
promotions 
home delivery the main customer proposition similar that respect the 
market but contrary other europeans markets such france belgium south 
korea market dominated home delivery opposed click collect drivethrough models this could due the high urbanisation the country 
defined euromonitor which translates into high drop densities turn 
improving the economics otherwise very costly last mile delivery service the 
for instance estimate costs related the last mile delivery alone add 
sales the typical delivery cost any online order regardless product type ranges 
between and per parcel usd and often delivered for free when 
total basket size exceeds the minimum requirement hence customers could order 
frequently without burden and with convenience the delivery dropped front 
the door steps 
more recently pick services stores have started rolled out but still 
the nascent stage from two years ago major department stores have started rolling 
out click collect services from their offline stores and recently this service has 
expanded pick service after ordering online from some the convenience stores 
korea has more than stores other than lotte shopping 
other commerce plays signed contract with other stores for the same service 
however this feature more relevant general goods rather than the grocery 
category 
still think there room for further growth demographic and changing life style 
the rise single and double person households single person household comprise 
and additional for double person households helped further penetration 
online grocery these consumers are likely use the online channel more often for 
their convenience than regular offline shopping hypermarkets traditional markets 
these changing trends have fostered rapid demand growth online grocery shopping 
and expect higher penetration rate result changing consumer demographics 
and demands 
key players 
distinguish three types players online grocery south korea 
conventional players dominated mart online business commenced from 
and pioneer online grocery market which has multiple competitive edges 
over other new entrants please refer mart inflection year for change 
earnings structure published march 
merchandising competency first mart has long history the grocery business first 
hypermarket allowing build expertise merchandising critical offering 
wide assortment and good quality control two points which remain today challenge 
for the open market players particular within fresh food produce categories also emart has some successful private label products including brand and peacock brands 
and globally sourced products which provide good value for money 
bargaining power second based its large scale hypermarkets mart could 
provide competitive pricing consumers mart has maintained its position 
hypermarkets over the past decade and captures today total food retail sales 
making mart the largest food retailer south korea 
service offering currently mart run two online dedicated fulfillment centers and 
one spoke center also utilizes hypermarket stores for fulfillment and distribution 
two fulfilment centres are now covering the southern and western area 
seoul metropolitan area and one more addition should enable full coverage 
the seoul metropolitan area with rising utilization rates the first center already 
running full capacity and the second should reach late the two fcs 
generated total online sales using fcs mart could achieve higher 
efficiency terms service quality product offerings time delivery and faster 
delivery and cost burden less labor cost and delivery cost once utilization has ramped 
open market players which combine market platform more ebay like model 
and models amazon like model lead korea commerce industry 
gmarket and auction both owned ebay dominate the channel along with 
planet street together open market players account for the largest portion 
ecommerce the market believe however terms online 
grocery shopping they are far behind the conventional players that have off 
mixed retailing and are able source and carry fresh food inventory including 
produce because open market mainly platform business they not buy the 
merchandise and hold the inventory which deters them from providing true 
grocery shopping experience neither does the delivery come together one 
basket and the operators cannot ensure the quality the grocery they have 
made efforts listing farmers profiles give more assurance customers who 
buy agricultural goods and allowing more lenient return policy for those 
dissatisfied with quality yet see limitations the proliferation freshfood 
category this channel 
social commerce players social commerce started groupon like 
business model connecting customers local merchants providing discount 
coupons for activities restaurants parlors etc the major players coupang 
recently changed its business model open market ticketmonster and 
wemakeprice rapidly transformed their business model commerce sell 
online household products ranging from laundry detergent snacks yet they 
have stayed away from fresh grocery items only recently from late have 
they started deliver fresh food including produce fruits and other perishable 
items they have ramped proprietary logistics center with refrigerating 
functions collaborate with logistics players who could provide such functions 
social commerce players strong value proposition has lied its competitive pricing 
but due lack sourcing expertise fresh grocery would have see they 
could apply the same pricing methodology fresh food the social commerce 
players fail ramp fresh food skus considerably enlarge their logistics 
capabilities with chilled supply chain and raise awareness trust from its customers 
then they could remain demand shopping providers delivering only few 
items time similar the open market players 
compared open market and social commerce players believe mart 
competency offer full basket shopping supported wide range product 
offerings including fresh foods and house logistics infrastructure the offline 
hypermarket business mart has well established its competitive positioning fresh 
food category through quality product sourcing and advanced distribution centers 
other players those without strong grocery segment the house infrastructure 
handle delivery fresh food face limitations meeting the needs customers 
who want one stop shopping services despite the recent ramp grocery skus 
buying hello nature organic produce delivery start these players face 
difficulties need significant amount time investment establishing credibility

japan 
online grocery japan takes three main forms first there online grocery tied 
local communities and which offered the offline called gms general 
merchandise stores second japan leading ecommerce player rakuten operates 
ecommerce service rakuten mart since addition rakuten part efforts 
strengthen the daily items domain including groceries made kenco fully owned 
subsidiary january and december the same year acquired soukai drug 
last there are numerous small independent specialist online grocery websites 
operating niche categories such vegetables organic food but that are still low 
consumers radars 
according the government data meti online penetration grocery that for food 
beverages alcohol only stands however this penetration figure based 
relatively extended definition the overall market estimates from kantar worldpanel 
through their collaboration with intage puts online penetration within the more 
constrained fmcg category this would imply that online penetration 
remains very low for the fresh produce category 
specific social structure japan could explain why online grocery penetration 
japan remains relatively low compared south korea the other advanced and 
generally seen most comparable online grocery market the topic japan social 
structure wide ranging and beyond the scope this note but highlight two 
factors which could somewhat holding back the success online grocery one 
that japan has relatively low ratio payments credit card and the other that 
japan has relatively low ratio female participation the workforce which hence 
decreases the convenience factor online grocery for this part the population 
another likely reason that japanese consumers not have deeply entrenched habit 
bulk buying and have exceedingly well developed network readily available 
retail outlets convenience stores etc not have keen sense the 
convenience shopping for groceries online 
there also the question how traditional retailers view online grocery business 
contextually with some exceptions not believe they are engaging particularly 
proactively think the main reasons for this are that online grocery business may 
offer low profit margins for relatively small retailers and not always easy 
secure the manpower cover the process from item picking delivery right the 
doorstep traditional retailers who offer online grocery services include the likes 
seven ito yokado aeon and seiyu but estimate that the ratio online sales 
total sales more than low mid single digit all cases 
gross margins japanese supermarkets are generally with margins 
food daily items lower still japan moreover many market participants mainly 
traditional retailers share use existing store inventory and regular workers the 
early stages online grocery business shipping items from inventory physical stores 
and this leaves some inefficiencies the picking and distribution processes charges are 
burdensome too believe that many cases retailers effectively shoulder shipping 
charges online grocery business 
many online grocery services offer free delivery users who purchase over certain 
sum and indeed think large majority users not bear shipping costs already 
there are also cases even leading players pulling out online grocery business 
the grounds unprofitability net super corporation sumitomo corporation 
subsidiary announced october that was withdrawing from online grocery 
business summit net super some five years after launching the first place 
currently moreover rising door door delivery parcel volume with the spread 
online shopping general and aging the workforce creating chronic shortage 
drivers making increasingly difficult secure the necessary driver numbers 
constant basis for traditional retailers japan continuously expand online 
grocery business greater operational efficiency calling for investment considerable 
scale and securing the means cover the last one mile users are essential and are 
both issues that think will challenging resolve 
however not think these headwinds are material enough prevent the rise 
online grocery the medium term particular note that although the ministry 
internal affairs and communications mic data suggests that only those aged 
shop online and just for the according the market insight firm 
intage almost japanese consumers aged between and already such 
that believe that the headwinds for the japanese online channel might have more 
with generational issue rather than with structural cultural preferences

described the previous section there are different categories players japan 
online grocery segment rakuten has clear dominant position online groceries but 
major ecommerce operators are starting focus the grocery space including 
amazon which has bolstered the number items handles and improved the 
convenience deliveries the near term expect major ecommerce see not only 
market growth but also expand takes away market share from individual online

over the longer run believe should factor some risk market share loss 
traditional retailers 
local online grocery services through japan gms these are communitybased ecommerce services pioneered gms format gms stands for general 
merchandise stores offline stores they basically relate sales offline store 
inventory and remain positioned niche service partly due issues with

conventional players dominate the segment europe across europe conventional 
players are far the market leaders they were also often the pioneers online 
grocery for instance the tesco was the first properly into online grocery 
shortly followed sainsbury despite the fact that the first online only 
supermarket ocado was founded essentially the online grocery market 
the was completely dominated conventional players its early stages still 
remains the case today although pure player ocado now capturing the 
channel 
france its current form online grocery started june when private player 
auchan sales introduced drive through service allowing customers 
order online drive the unit and pick the collated orders generally less than 
two hours after must faster that what home delivery typically offers the service 
proved remarkedly popular and was subsequently copied other french grocery 
retailers including leclerc carrefour and casino and january there were 
drive outlets france from some these units generate

the channel moves towards becoming mass market centralisation and automation 
typically increases see grocers online strategy europe both defensive and 
offensive strategy generally starts off with prisoners dilemma whereby ideally 
grocers would like online never appear one market owing its margin dilutive 
consequences but the prospect competitor launching online offer forces 
grocers into offering their own 
most cases the initial stages conventional players have started their online grocery 
offer spending limited capital and resorting relatively manual and inefficient picking 
processes such cases the additional costs providing online services customers 
remain very limited considering the modest size the new channel comparison the 
core and given generally the store pick model illusion whereby the incremental costs 
fulfilling online orders appear marginal given labour already employed stores 
already owned rented etc but this misconception would argue not 
accounting for the fact that the cost fulfilling these online orders additional 
something which becomes clear the size the online business grows that these 
costs come top already very thin operating margins and that not 
fulfilment method that allows lot economies scale 
the channel becomes more prominent players conventional resorts more 
centralised picking solutions and most cases more automated processes for 
instance tesco the opened its first dark store dedicated fulfilment centre 
for online orders also interesting note that even long term advocates 
the store picking model such sainsbury the have decided the end 
open dark stores well sainsbury first dark store opened london september 
note too auchan the french hypermarket operator with national market 
share launched october automated distribution centre the greater paris 
region according october challenges article carrefour might follow suit too 
though our knowledge the company hasn commented 
clear risks race the bottom players rationality the online grocery channel 
not given especially the early stages when online sales not yet appear 
zero sum game and generally come welcome top line boost largely mature 
markets the until months ago when saw the first attempts bring 
back rationality the channel mostly through increased delivery charges and lower 
couponing activity the level subsidisation the online grocery channel 
incumbents had gradually increased over the years our view this was mainly driven 
online being one the fastest growing segments the market forcing 
conventional players increase exposure the channel for fear losing market share 
otherwise one point morrison was the only big grocer without online offer 
and believed this was costing lfl every year gradual increase 
dedicated capital for online grocery the market grows and players move more 
centralised fulfilment models turn incentivising them quickly scale their new 
fulfilment centres 
the french example also interesting there believe that the unit economics 
online grocery are balance and far slightly better than the this because 
the drive through operating model accounts for most the market meaning that 
contrary the the retailers generally not bear the cost the last mile delivery 
service which typically would cost sales but for which grocers today 
would only charge customers sales most 
however note that recently february this year auchan has started trial direct 
home delivery bordeaux while paris express delivery being trialled today 
carrefour and rolled out casino might only matter time before part 
the french grocery market and particular urban areas such paris moves closer 
the model marked higher subsidisation the channel still 
europe the key for the vulnerability any business really boils down one thing 
store format indeed the hypermarket format which has been the preferred growth 
vehicle for some the largest food retailers europe over the past years such 
tesco carrefour see exhibit seems the most vulnerable the online channel 
shift this due four reasons online penetration non food has already resulted 
significant decline the profitability the category and the pressure set 
continue for instance the despite penetration already being the highest the 
world non food sales online continue grow double digits hypermarkets poor 
location typically the outskirts cities somewhat far from shoppers home which 
reinforces the convenience shopping online iii the typical hypermarket shopper 
larger households and higher average basket the most prone move online 
online shopping significantly reduces impulse buying thanks which lot 
hypermarket gross margin generated 
potential sweetener for the store format issue would have been have store 
networks easy rationalise unfortunately due labour laws and lengthy leases 
closing down large stores difficult exercise tesco and carrefour domestic 
markets limiting the potential reshape the estate the short term for instance 
the case tesco the understand only its leases are due for renewal 
the next decade 
most exposed and biggest beneficiaries this means think the most exposed 
online grocery amongst the european grocers are carrefour tesco and metro 
relatively immune online grocery picking european mature grocery markets 
should jeronimo martins and dia both have minimal exposure non food operate 
markets where online grocery penetration low and will probably remain contained 
the near future mostly operate relatively small convenient stores and have 
discount positioning think the player best positioned benefit from online grocery 
ocado the leading online grocery pure player and most efficient operator the 
segment also capable licensing its proprietary online fulfillment solution thirdparty grocers internationally

collect

there are two main operating models europe drive click collect integrated home 
delivery the the main operating model home delivery which estimate 
accounts for the overall online grocery market conversely france the main 
players have far mostly opted for the drive click collect model which represents 
the vast majority the market over there 
but are seeing some emerging forms lbs partnerships europe too 
suggesting likely increase the diversity the online grocery business models
