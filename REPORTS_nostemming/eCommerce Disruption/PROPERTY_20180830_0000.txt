back school our best ideas 
for while now our core overweights have been constructed 
around logistics german residential and spain which are all 
maturing equity stories believe these stocks will perform 
for longer relative other property stocks well 
absolute terms but arguably more moderately than before

changed 
property 
from 
industry view 
attractive 
line 
maturing equity stories everywhere for several years our core overweights 
have been constructed around spain logistics and german residential retain 
this positioning even are alive the fact that this offers exposure what 
would call maturing equity stories underlying solid fundamentals but 
relatively few medium term catalysts draw marginal demand for the stocks 
not much absolute upside potential before for almost every property 
stock europe expect lower total return profile compared what has 
been delivering which consistent with the nav valuation rating that 
have witnessed but also argue that this backdrop does not necessarily affect 
relative returns and our order preference particular given average 
dispersion valuation within the sector remains relatively low long term 
average levels 
inflation will expose companies that lack pricing power higher rates pressure 
those with too much leverage property stocks tend well rising bond 
yield and inflation environment argue but note that this the case 
mainly for those stocks that can show solid rental growth stocks that offer 
exposure real assets rather than assets generating cash flow stream that 
largely nominal nature and does not rise rising inflation and higher bond 
yields will trigger increasing differentiation property yields believe the 
biggest changes price targets are making mainly relate shopping centre 
reits for which now assume more yield expansion also believe leverage 
will increasingly become focus our work highlights how the market has 
increasingly penalised stocks with above average leverage 
fundamentals valuation all our overweight rated stocks offer superior total 
return nav growth cash dividends portion nav which our work 
suggests offers strong stockpicking success rates independent the macro 
backdrop and which consistently use guiding principle for our 
recommendations moreover continue shy away from optically cheap 
stocks wide nav discounts and elevated earnings yields often the

yields are getting low the listed property companies reported portfolio yields have 
compressed materially exhibit addition important note these companies 
report gross yields net initial yields are materially lower around 
but the absolute level capital values per highlights the potential for capital 
growth are mainly compelled the absolute value per remaining low even 
after years significant capital growth exhibit and while this well 
understood see several drivers for continued capital growth 
steady organic rental growth while not high numbers landlords are able grow 
rents per annum through churn and regulated uplifts under the mietspiegel 
framework this was for deutsche wohnen while will probably 
closer for this year guided during the call 
boost from capital investment modernisation and densification capital expenditure 
allow landlords generate compelling returns accelerating the capture and 
boosting reversionary potential exhibit this initiative boosted rental growth 
percentage points for most 
significant government stimulus the german coalition has introduced housebuying stimulus programme called baukindergeld the cologne institute for economic 
research koeln estimates that total stimulus could amount billion during 
this coalition year term households will receive per annum per child for 
period years the draft proposal suggests maximum threshold annual 
household income amounting plus per child the case 
households with two children only those with taxable annual income 
qualify baukindergeld will work retroactively for this year baukindergeld 
government stimulus programme drive homeownership and this respect similar 
the elp buy but argue even more advantageous grant 
rather than loan that needs repaid and relates all property purchases not 
just newbuilds see german residential property baukindergeld german elp 
buy stimulus could larger than expected dated june 
and let not forget significant demand outstripping availability and supply what 
ultimately matters most for this equity story the simple fact that germany 
experiencing strong urban household formation from economic and political migration 
into germany and from continued urbanisation 
signs household mortgage debt issue when analysing housing cycles 
often look for signs overheating from excessive mortgage debt there are such 
signs germany exhibit 
more for longer expect stocks exposed german residential property continue 
delivering superior returns even longer expect much differentiation between 
peers other words think berlin exposure longer provides clear path 
outperformance which why are now overweight deutsche wohnen leg and 
vonovia 
our positioning predicated capital growth exceeding rental growth other 
words further yield compression appreciate that for these stocks continue 
performing from current valuation levels some further yield compression required 
are assuming yields coming basis points this year and another 
basis points next year driven the factors highlighted above without such yield 
compression think would challenging for these stocks perform well 
vonovia european expansion opportunity threat vonovia exporting its 
industrialised modernisation strategy into austria sweden and future also france 
and other countries yet unclear what extent this threat 
opportunity from equity story perspective the return profile sweden screens 
compelling even the beta that market can concern while this strategy makes 
sense from return perspective worry weakens the equity story most investors 
ultimately bought into vonovia for its german exposure

importantly yields have compressed materially but are convinced the outlook for

colonial well positioned through its well located portfolio and its redevelopment 
ability colonial has doubled its nav per share since recapitalised four years ago 
while has benefitted from cyclical recovery the pricing for its well located assets 
would argue that its success acquiring redevelopment opportunities and executing 
these projects has been major factor the group has continued reload its

what quant and backtesting tells about stockpicking strategy 
still prefer stocks with sector beating total returns usually advise against 
buying value stocks this space optically cheap stocks wide nav discounts which 
tend value traps moreover our backtesting work shows that picking stocks with 
high total returns has consistently good track record outperformance exhibit 
even regardless nav valuation regularly challenge this paradigm and our 
fundamental views looking nav valuation dispersion levels historically has 
made sense buy deeply discounted value stocks when valuation dispersion wide 
but exhibit shows this not the case valuation dispersion has moderated from 
low levels earlier the year but not back levels that would suggest sharp rotation 
into value

weakening macro overlay recently published collaboration with our quantitative 
strategy team see how quant approach can help real estate stockpicking the work 
shows that cycle downturn high nav based total return still successful guiding 
principle for stockpicking but that the factor return for low volatility and high dividend 
yield improves significantly also suggests that only recovery phase does price tobook become more significant factor this why our quant team current systematic 
factor preferences for real estate are quality high total return and low leverage small 
size and defensive value dividend total yield but their least preferred factors are 
current and deep value and price book this broadly aligns with our lack

alstria the german reit with the longest continuous history this space delivered

zero

increasingly concerned about asset pricing has stated how prefers buying assets 
when they are cheap even with expensive debt rather than buying expensive assets with 
cheap debt and medium term supply the results management even pointed 
challenging investment market and such alstria has taken its leverage down 
proactively which results guided double digit drop recurring eps for
