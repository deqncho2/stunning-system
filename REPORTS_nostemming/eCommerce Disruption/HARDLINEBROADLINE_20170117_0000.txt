imposing such tax imported goods which would essentially impact the entire retail

our positioning for gravitates towards high quality comm protected names that 
have pricing power should the bat materialize unique for that handful 
names with easy compares fall into our high quality premier bucket companies 
ones that operate healthy segments with good top line growth prospects favorable 
competitive dynamics and relative insulation from the commerce threat 
two top ideas are azo and aap azo and aap face the easiest comparisons the 
group due unfavorable weather year ago improving vehicle parc and 
unseasonably cold winter temperatures should lead top line acceleration 
importantly not believe the commerce threat infects the valuation multiples 
this segment underlying fundamentals remain healthy increasing miles driven 
aging car fleet like azo tactical play easy compares and tailwinds from 
colder weather aap our top month story across our coverage given its margin 
upside potential also continue like orly think the stock works and 
orly remains the best positioned longer term story the segment believe orly 
can maintain its market position best class operator and expect will hold onto 
its industry leading multiple street eps 
cost another top idea easy compares represent one several positive catalysts 
cost should benefit from others include likely membership fee hike 
accreting top line and margin contributions from the new credit card and easing 
deflation which total holding back comps about bps cost not inexpensive 
basis but trading below its historic relative multiple 
upgrade mik this largely call valuation mik faces easy top and 
bottom line comparisons and with its multiple near historic lows ebitda 
believe there high margin for error fundamentals likely stay weak 
the final tough lap for the company but expect gradual improvement over the 
course the year given increased advertising and easy compares with sss returning 
the low positive single digit range 
three our rated names tsco and ulta skew positively risk reward 
coincidence that these companies are bucketed our high quality premier group 
stocks tsco particularly intriguing faces easy compares and could 
benefit from favorable weather and oil price inflation while believe the stock has 
near term upside investors flock the favorable positioning not foresee 
much eps upside and result similarly don expect higher multiple 
continue favor home improvement segment and maintain our rating 
low low faces tough compare but the market understands this and expect 
home improvement fundamentals remain healthy even rising rate environment 
similarly believe has upside driven housing gains and continued 
superb execution will anniversary tough compares but this not new and 
share gains should continue 
lastly ulta seems poised rise mid teens comps hold the near term and 
can maintained the low teens think ulta can drive eps growth 
distribution costs moderate and flow through accelerates possible that ulta 
multiple contracts modestly next year but not enough negate the strongest top and 
bottom line growth retail 
our uws are concentrated the home furnishings segment and thematically center 
around names that face structural growth challenges these include bbby and pir 
are downgrading tcs not foresee fundamental turnaround while the 
cost doing business may rise expense reduction gets cycled stay tgt 
believe top line growth will slower and margin performance will weaker than 
what the company expects current valuation ebitda and downside 
could protected should tgt deliver comps the flattish range but past this 
quarter believe there are structural risks tgt business which skews risk reward 
the downside

first our ows are not only high quality names but also face favorable setups which 
increases our conviction and downside skews for our uws are less pronounced

higher tgt which affirmed its comp and ebitda margin targets food 
price reflation would benefit wmt more than tgt and ongoing price and comm

find incremental savings diminishing unless comps materially improve the range early eps will likely underperform 
lackluster profit outlook for home furnishing retailers while forecast solid

equities conversely proposed border adjustment tax imported goods seems 
unlikely our view but the potential eps impact could detrimental retail stocks 
the proposal enacted its current form and market mechanisms rates don 
adjust mitigate the financial impacts 
border adjustment tax bat imports poses significant tail risk that could more 
than offset the eps benefits noted above based the math detailed this section 
tax imported goods could result eps hit the median our 
coverage post election stock movements shown the chart below suggest the 
market thinks this outcome unlikely for several potential reasons the adjustment 
enacted economic theory suggests markets should adjust such that the net effect

compensate addition the proposal may not pass its current form certain

offset this would represent tremendous currency move particularly for the 
dollar our strategists don expect full offset occur the short run 
global supply chains and concerns about wto led response will limit full usd offset 
however still believe usd can rally trade weighted basis border 
adjustment implemented the proposed corporate tax rate moreover there 
risk that markets not fully offset the impact the border tax which case 
retailers would need increase prices help absorb the margin impact 
retailers need raise prices compensate for the border adjustment believe 
the auto parts retail segment best positioned this scenario plays out view the 
auto parts aap azo orly vvv home improvement low tsco and arts 
crafts party supply mik prty segments best positioned these segments have 
stronger price controls given relatively inelastic demand for their product assortment 
segments most risk would include home furnishings bbby home pir tcs wsm

other segments with weaker price controls include office supplies odp spls vitamins 
supplements gnc vsi and sporting goods apparel dks this function 
intense price competition wide product proliferation across retail and each segment 
specialization products with close substitutes 
this proposal may not pass given pushback from impacted industries lobbyists cite the 
massive increase importers income taxes and detrimental impact earnings that this 
proposal could cause there also risk that markets not adjust expected once 
the proposal enacted another concern the border adjustment could trigger wto 
violations the wto permits the border adjustability indirect taxes but not direct 
taxes income taxes another reason this proposal may not pass could trigger 
consequences that don believe lawmakers intend for example the elevated costs 
resulting from this proposal could ultimately borne consumers importers 
would need increase prices compensate for higher taxes for these reasons are 
skeptical that this proposal will garner sufficient congressional support 
tax deductibility capital expenditures 
another pillar proposed tax reform would allow corporations use capex tax 
shield but would not directly impact gaap cash flow based system the 
proposal would remove many accrual accounting structures today tax code 
include the depreciation and amortization capital investments tax deductions 
would replaced with capex deductions and the near elimination interest

personal income taxes for consumers 
trump personal tax plan favors lower and fewer marginal rates whose benefits skew

strategists summarized estimated key potential changes the personal tax code 
the chart below these new changes come fruition only sub earners would 
pay higher tax rate marginal tax cuts would benefit filers earning income the ranges 
and well filers generating income over this could 
spur consumer spending among these cohorts and serve sales tailwind for retailers 
oriented these income groups cost low tsco bby

trump plans also include limits itemized deductions for high earners his plan 
targets high dollar cap deductions for joint filers per analysis from 
our strategists this would not have material effect filers earning less than 
million the treasury secretary nominee has also voiced support for this approach 
steve mnuchin has indicated there would not absolute tax cut for the upper class 
because any reduction upper income taxes would offset less deductions this 
the case the net effect this taxpayer cohort should neutral note that whether 
the above proposals become effective all remains uncertain 
cross border labor restrictions 
during his campaign president elect trump vocalized the need for greater control 
borders future policy could shaped two key beliefs that current policies 
encourage companies outsource low wage manufacturing jobs overseas and 
immigration policies have resulted influx foreign immigrants who make 
more difficult for american workers compete for blue collar jobs during his term 
possible trump pursues legislation that could curtail foreign migration and the 
domestic employment foreign labor this could have negative implications 
industries reliant inexpensive foreign labor the form higher labor costs and 
general disruption the labor model 
homebuilders could risk which could have degree impact and low 
such legislation came pass there prevailing view that homebuilder segments 
could negatively affected because number foreign workers are utilized for new 
home construction this could have negative tertiary impact and low the 
number home improvement projects could decline result fewer homes
