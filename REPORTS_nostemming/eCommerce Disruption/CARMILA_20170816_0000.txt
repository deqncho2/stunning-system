strategy 
carmila strategy comprises five areas focus 
carmila intends drive organic and external growth through five areas focus and 
levers growth 
extensions and restructuring 
the group also has pipeline brownfield extension schemes with expected 
billion investment volume many these schemes are due delivered 
during 
mainly focused france 
the extension pipeline heavily skewed towards france with the projects 
france and the remainder italy 
profitable and low risk 
carmila targeting average yield cost extensions which suggests 
around development margin depending the project these assets are 
developed partnership with carrefour typically around yield cost after 
which carmila buys out carrefour half market value thereby forfeiting half the 
total development profit and lowering the blended yield cost 
extending into the car park rather than the hypermarket 
carrefour not reducing its hypermarket footprint contrast some other players 
such casino ant instead carmila extension programme mainly enlarging the 
footprint the shopping centre 
also stepping restructuring effort 
the group also intends spend around million year restructuring around 
million and rising annual million run rate which are 
improvements its shopping centres without adding gross lettable area but for which 
anticipates similar better yield cost 
restructuring key driver for like for like rental growth 
previous years the group focus has been leasing vacancy which fell around 
percentage points since inception during that period carmila has been spending 
around million per annum restructuring capex from now the group like for 
like rental growth will depend less improving occupancy and more like for like 
growth least part driven capital outlay line with peers who drive this through 
surrender premiums lease incentives and fit out for carmila the emphasis will mainly 
restructuring capex creating spaces that offer the potential attract tenants that 
are willing and able pay higher rental levels 
acquisitions 
carmila estimates owns only around quarter retail assets anchored carrefour 
hypermarkets france spain and italy value such management estimates the 
group has much billion potential acquisition opportunities 
intends enhance value through carrefour relationship 
the group intends buy assets that offer potential enhance value through its 
relationship with carrefour many assets this type are owned investors that lack 
common strategy for the assets which can result stalemate situations regarding 
common area refurbishment maintenance expenditure and extensions 
million acquisition target 
management has indicated that carmila intends invest about million 
acquisitions end 
are assuming million acquisitions per annum 
assume carmila set acquire around million assets per annum 
addition the development capital expenditure 
could also conceivably see large portfolio deals 
mentioned above carmila has grown through large portfolio acquisitions are 
assuming that any further acquisitions would smaller typically single asset deals but 
not exclude the possibility larger deals 
asset regeneration 
third integral part carmila strategy revitalising the retail offer through 
refurbishment and repositioning parallel with hypermarket remodeling based the 
air famille concept this comprises investment facades car parks toilets and 
variety other shared services 
has been doing this from the outset 
the group has already been active this front has been revitalising around 
assets per annum since inception and such the end the current 
portfolio had been fully renovated 
total cost around million 
the total capital expenditure for this renovation initiative around million 
million spent far which around million million spent far around 
quarter carmila share such carrefour and carmila spend average less than 
million per centre which just under million borne carmila 
contributed better occupancy 
carmila occupancy has improved significantly since inception from april 
december excluding around strategic vacancy financial 
occupancy rate improved from france from spain and 
from italy management attributing least part this improvement 
its asset refurbishment effort 
also provides better scope for specialty leasing 
during carmila generated million rent total rent through shortterm leasing activities such specialty leasing and pop stores this reflected 
increase year year management also said that percentage points its total 
like for like rental growth came from specialty leasing and pop stores 
acquisitions 
while the remaining capex required for the current portfolio limited assume 
carmila intends revitalise assets will acquiring also carmila has indicated that 
from this year carrefour and carmila will sharing such capex equally assume 
annual spend around million 
tenant mix optimisation 
the group intends fine tune its retail mix based local catchment areas many 
all leases around have been signed since carmila took ownership 
most its assets 
focus new anchors 
the group has been adding anchors that drive additional footfall such mango zara 
primark fnac superdry and burger king 
and differentiated offer 
carmila also adding strong local brands services medical and dental and 
restaurants 
digital marketing 
carmila has been investing proactively web store solutions through online 
discounts promotions and reservations supported fast wifi access has strong 
team focusing digital strategy 
focus footfall more customers and higher sales 
carmila focused helping its tenants with their online strategies helping local 
brands with online presence and complementing national brands with local 
strategy 
large customer database 
the company has been building database shoppers customers signing the 
shopping centre wifi can opt out providing their data far carmila database 
comprises customers for which acts local digital marketing agency 
volume first monetisation later 
management takes the view that rolling out its digital effort will drive returns two 
ways following the same strategy tends pursued tech start ups aiming 
for many users possible before focusing monetisation such carmila believes 
its digital strategy will provide immediate indirect benefits through higher footfall and 
higher tenant sales leading superior rental growth and ultimately direct benefits 
from being able charge customers for this service

last year the group secured positive reversionary uplift this comprised 
percentage point uplift from renewals and restructuring led initiatives partly offset 
percentage points from lettings acquisitions made and 
management has commented that this was expected and reflected the initial 
acquisition price 
guiding similar rental growth for 
management targeting similar overall level like for like rental growth

carmila targeting average yield cost extensions which suggests 
around development margin these assets are developed partnership with 
carrefour typically around yield cost after which carmila buys out
