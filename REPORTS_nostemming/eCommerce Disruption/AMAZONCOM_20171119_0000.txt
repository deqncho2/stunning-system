recently called out healthcare targeted vertical with labs and hospitals the types businesses that could served amazon 
business and aws while private label strategies could eventually used way for amazon penetrate the large medical device 
manufacturing profit pools don see this near term focus and various impediments exist for even moderately complex devices

tors either think amazon will not enter the pharmacy supply chain expect amazon first step acquiring partnering with pbm 
who are the crossroads all script interactions see them entering through brick and mortar retail pharmacy leveraging their 
prime now capabilities atop their whole foods footprint offer delivery launch pharmacy amazon would likely plug into the existing

where could wrong 
amazon success taking share the medical supply distribution market hinges not only being price competitive 
but delivering more complex high touch service model than currently utilizes channel checks indicate many hospitals 
are buying hoc items from amazon but pricing frequently used items would have improve much factor 
addition improve pricing amazon would need dedicated sales force armed with the ability deliver customized 
logistics capture share 
demands are high our channel checks indicate that hospital customers expect next day delivery medical supplies six days 
per week and target close fill rate the logistics can complex hospitals work closely with their distributor 
manage inventory levels tandem and often rely their distributor break bulk orders from manufacturers and create 
customized deliveries hospitals are space constrained potential customers would need better pricing service levels 
incentivize them switch distributors and cited pricing discounts high depending the compliance rate required 
amazon addition group purchasing organization gpo relationships could complicate amazon entry particularly since 
hospital supplies purchases are through gpo contracts according hcsa some large hospital systems such hca 
healthcare intermountain healthcare own gpos healthtrust for hca intalere for intermountain and benefit from smaller 
systems which purchase from their gpos via fees and pooled negotiating power other hospital systems are gpo members 
which receive rebate from the gpo based volume commitments both relationships present additional hurdle for

enters the whole issue the world insurers and pbms and deciding differential access that whole different skill set 
could manufacturers work directly with amazon bypass the current rebate formulary based system our view amazon would 
need provide comprehensive solution order for manufacturers convinced that patient access via amazon would warrant 
new pricing schemes note that products are unique because doctors dictate the product consumed via prescription 
writing and the consumer typically pays fraction the product cost out pocket believe that employers payers would 
need endorse amazon agent for administering drug benefits order for drug companies confident that their drugs 
would accessible return for alternate pricing the current coupon systems involve manufacturers offering coupons order 
help ensure patient access drugs via low out pocket costs manufacturers and patients have been very pleased with pay 
programs the industry continues expand them possible that amazon could seek offer alternatives disrupt pay 
assistance programs offering lower net pricing drugs but amazon would need convince manufacturers that could 
guarantee patients drug coverage order for manufacturers abandon pay assistance programs different route that amazon 
could pursue acquire low cost drug access service such privately held goodrx which offers low cost pricing options and 
coupons goodrx

amazon storefront for smaller device companies could increase competition and pricing pressure and improve price 
transparency for low end supplies and instruments 
the profit pool medical devices appears largely insulated from amazon disruption 
the medical device market highly regulated large segment the broader healthcare market medical device companies largely 
manufacture products instruments equipment supplies etc used the prevention monitoring treatment various health conditions 
estimates place the medical device market annually consisting many sub segments including orthopedics cardiovascular 
and surgical general medical device companies sell directly healthcare providers hospitals hospital systems integrated delivery networks and not consumers major medical device companies include johnson johnson medtronic abbott labs stryker and becton dickinson among others 
due the large number healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and medical device products distributors and group 
purchasing organizations gpos also play important role the medical device industry distributors often act intermediary 
logistics between healthcare providers and medical device companies delivering product for relatively small fee gpos play role price 
contracting taking small administrative fee from manufacturers estimate that distributors and gpos generate and

why 
believe there are several advantages and challenges for 
aws hospitals 
amazon enter the supply space net net amazon does have the 
ability penetrate this business but challenges that exist would 
amazon has already entered hospitals through aws albeit 
need set industry veterans navigate the landscape amazon 
small way currently amazon does have hospital customers using 
possesses certain competencies that could help propel including 
its aws platform hospitals have turned electronic health records 
and interoperable systems better track and store data fact 
bundling capabilities with aws discussed above there 
philips has announced that its healthsuite platform had integrated 
significant opportunity for amazon the side hospi 
aws better provide backup and recovery solution given that 
tals also view this their initial foot the door which 
data storage one amazon areas expertise makes sense 
could lead new relationships for supplies think bun 
target this large and growing market our view according health 
dling option could very attractive hospitals 
dashboard the complexity the systems has been increasing rap 
existing warehouse and distribution capabilities given that 
idly over the last few years exhibit another area amazon could 
amazon has giant warehouse footprint that removes sig 
potentially further along the innovation curve particularly 
nificant barrier scaling the business also they have per 
genomic data becomes more prevalent the bottom line that this 
fected their distribution network the for both 
product easy opportunity for amazon get their foot the 
consumers and businesses think these two items are cru 
door and eventually offer other products like supplies discuss 
cial amazon decides enter the supply space 
below potentially even bundling the two together far back 
the annual himss healthcare conference began see 
growing acceptance amazon and noted from the panel hospital 
cios hosted interestingly the cios our panel viewed hosted 
brand awareness this point amazon widely recog 
nized and trusted brand given the nature the business 
trusted brand important 
solutions and cloud solutions the same light cloud services should 
continue proliferate though one cio still was uncomfortable with 
the flip side there are several challenges generally think 
emr data the cloud amazon offers compelling cloud storage solu 
amazon could overcome these barriers but would need careful man 
tions which could gain traction genomic and other data increases

gpo competition currently hospitals are joining together

for our facilities coverage 
challenges view this one the easiest overcome 
what about opportunities for alexa echo products voice control technology particularly compelling for sterile environments 
like operating rooms while hospitals are interested not hipaa 
compliant significant barrier recently carolinas healthcare began 
using alexa help patients decide which facility visit case 
emergency based wait times there are clearly several applications healthcare for alexa 
average hospital ebitda margin 
how does amazon entry into hospital supplies stack under 
supplies hospital revenues

the brian framework 
view amazon less likely enter the managed care space 
bespoke see opportunities for the commoditized prod 
unlike some the services mentioned above the insurance space 
ucts excluding devices like implants and robots that can 
going much tougher penetrate the largest barrier entry 
customized include capital purchases 
the regulatory environment which entails both federal and local 
regulatory this certainly challenge but outlined 
laws which vary from state state secondly the nuances the 
above can overcome with the right expertise unlike the 
industry like setting provider network government relation 
insurance industry see below the regulatory environment 
ships and the reimbursement landscape make very tough enter 
can manageable 
without the right knowledge base very easy lose money 
industry there low reliance retail for distribution and 
the products have both low price point and gross margin 
with higher order frequency certain supplies hospitals will 
order frequently and bulk 
lastly given how relationship based this business are skeptical 
amazon desire move into such high touch area taken 
together believe certainly less likely see amazon make 
moves into the health insurance market this time 
attention not much after sale service needed for basic sup 
plies like catheters for supplies that require specialty sales 
force like orthopedic implants expect this the barrier entry preventing amazon from coming 
nuances once the relationship place generally not 
hard maintain given reliability and favorable pricing relationship building can challenge bundling with other 
things like aws likely good way into the suite hospital and into the purchasing department
