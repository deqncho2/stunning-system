our solar growth forecast aggregate below industry 
estimates driven more bearish outlook solar 
demand china and japan while project cagr 
solar capacity china from industry 
estimates call for far more rapid growth rate our projected 
solar demand china below industry levels due our 
view that the chinese government will seek grow solar 
similar rates nuclear and wind minimize the cost 
achieving emission reduction goals and ineffective distributed 
generation policies japan are relatively pessimistic 
regarding the outcome the pending review solar 
subsidies the japanese government without subsidies 
solar power has long road ahead japan before the 
technology can reach grid parity driven poor solar 
conditions the country 
are relatively bullish solar demand growth the 
driven strong and improving rooftop solar economics and 
the likely continuation favorable net metering subsidies for 
solar which together more than offset likely reduction from 
the solar investment tax credit itc 
the long term believe solar power will economic 
some states without any form subsidy 
europe see mixed bag slowdown additions 
germany but with solid growth other regions overall 
expect european capacity additions remain flat 
but with different regional mix 
what sets our solar analysis apart believe our global 
analysis benefits from the close integration local utility 
regulatory dynamics subsidies well explicit renewables 
goals set government entities solar operating conditions 
and future trends the local installed cost solar each 
these factors has significant impact solar demand 
estimates and none these factors static solar 
economics continue improve however there may 
further reductions government support such the current 
review solar subsidies occurring japan also factor 
physical limits such the availability suitable land india 
that the future may limit the growth solar power our 
analysis factors these evolving dynamics drive our solar

energy storage specifically tesla product could 
disruptive the and europe but less likely 
economic the rest the world given the relatively high 
cost the power grid think that customers parts the 
and europe may seek avoid utility grid fees going 
off grid through combination solar power and energy 
storage believe there not sufficient appreciation the 
magnitude energy storage cost reduction that tesla has 
already achieved nor the further cost reduction magnitude 
that tesla might able achieve once the company has 
constructed its gigafactory targeted for completion later 
the decade while off grid applications are the most 
disruptive use energy storage note that there are also 
less disruptive applications such strengthening the grid 
compensate for the variability solar output

process for rooftop solar installation costs have fallen 
rapidly improving rooftop solar economics 
favorable regulatory treatment europe the brazil 
and japan residential and commercial customers are 
able avoid some portion all their utility bills 
installing solar panels the entire utility bill far greater 
than simply the cost generating power from the largescale power plants that feed the power grid result 
solar panel project economics can often attractive 
given the ability arbitrage some most the utility 
bill under such incentives believe solar growth and 
returns solar investments solar integrators that 
provide complete solar power solutions customers can 
surprise the upside however many 
countries regions may well see this favorable 
regulatory treatment change over time and result 
solar power would able compete only against the 
portion the utility bill associated with the cost 
producing power from relatively efficient large scale 
conventional power plants sun rich regions such 
the southwestern and india solar power may the 
long term become economic against large scale 
conventional power plants even without government 
subsidies 
the following two charts show solar economics with and 
without the investment tax credit itc subsidy for solar 
power and applying varying fixed grid fees solar 
customers fixed grid fee indicates that the solar 
panel must compete solely against the power generation 
portion the utility bill these charts illustrate how further 
solar cost reductions can some geographies offset the loss 
subsidies but other geographies the loss subsidies 
would have critical impact the ability solar power

fossil fuel demand keep mind that solar power still 
extremely small element the overall global power

potentially advantaged companies and 
those facing downside risk 
potentially advantaged companies according our 
analysis 
tesla tsla from our analysis the economics 
energy storage products conclude that tesla will likely 
have the most economic energy storage solution 
significant margin this advantage driven primarily the 
company very significant scale tesla will produce 
many cells from its gigafactory are currently produced 
all worldwide battery manufacturers combined and 
integrated manufacturing efficiencies project the capital 
cost tesla battery will fall from the current kwh 
kwh whereas its closest competitor will 
cost kwh the utility sector market potential for 
tesla storage product difficult determine given the 
number variables that affect this market size but based 
our analysis believe could above gwh 
storage per year equal least annual revenue 
tesla today numbers incremental gwh 
storage sales gross margin would boost tsla 
share price 
solar power integrators sunedison solarcity and 
nrg energy given the falling cost solar believe 
the integrators companies that offer finance design 
and install solar power solutions for customers will create 
greater shareholder value than the panel manufacturers 
this the case because the integrators typically compete 
against fixed utility rate the europe brazil and 
japan solar costs fall and many utility rates increase 
with substantial grid investments around the world returns 
equity can rise significantly given the small number 
companies positioned capture meaningful share very 
large market 
europe some the utilities may pursue successfully 
integrator business model this could growth 
catalyst and meaningful value driver present 
unclear who will develop the best and most successful 
european integrator business model the larger 
integrated utilities rwe seems most focused 
developing residential energy services model but many 
others are also focusing this 
renewable energy yieldcos nrg yield abengoa yield 
nextera energy partners and terraform power 
see new investment class emerging the renewable 
yieldco that economically similar master limited 
partnerships mlps but applied renewable generation 
assets think yieldcos will have cost 
capital valuation advantage over competitors and will 
able create shareholder value growing their 
renewables asset base returns significantly excess 
yieldco cost capital benefits the yieldco investment 
vehicle include appropriate focus cash flow the 
most important valuation metric opposed multiples 
gaap earnings for example given that earnings are often 
lower than cash flow for reneables the ability efficiently 
return capital shareholders often dividends are largely 
entirely tax free returns capital and lower required 
rate return from investors given the long term contracted 
cash flow stream with creditworthy power purchasers 
sunedison sune recently completed yieldco ipo 
terraform power terp our view should allow sune 
capture long term project value and monetize its asset 
base more attractive valuation similar what nrg 
doing with its yieldco nrg yield nyld both parent 
company and yieldco subsidiaries can our view create 
shareholder value through the parent selling assets the 
yieldco values above the implied value the assets 
reflected the parent stock driving significant dividend 
growth for the yieldco this approach has been pursued 
with great success the mlp industry and believe the 
renewables segment well suited such approach 
european utilities investing regulated good capex 
sse rwe and enel increasingly 
decentralized energy will emphasise the need for reliable 
grid and require significant capex distributed power will 
become part the network balancing solution this should 
positive for regulated capex which view good 
capex the most increases capex are likely where 
see the biggest solar penetration germany italy and the 
these markets sse rwe and enel could 
benefit from higher grid capex and associated returns the

increases solar demand believe margin expansion 
for solar panel manufacturers may muted 
given our view that rooftop solar will play increasingly 
large role solar demand growth believe silicon based 
solar panels will our view more competitive than thinfilm and concentrating solar silicon based solar panels are 
the most appropriate technology for rooftop applications 
result are cautious with respect first solar thin 
film panel product given the higher cost this product 
relative silicon based panels and the inability first 
solar thin film panels used economically for rooftop 
applications 
polysilicon manufacturers wacker chemie gcl 
oci and hemlock given that industry projections 
solar panel installation growth are significantly more 
bullish than morgan stanley projections for key 
countries such china and japan key material 
used the manufacture silicon based solar panels 
with the solar panel industry industry estimates 
growth for china and japan are significantly excess 
morgan stanley estimates through industry 
estimates for chinese solar panel demand morgan stanley demand and morgan stanley 
estimates for japanese demand during the same period 
demand levels these two key countries disappoint 
likely our view that prices would disappointingly 
low and manufacturing costs due low capacity utilization 
levels disappointingly high although those with the best 
quality product would likely remain fully utilized 
and european utilities that see significant solar 
growth and either experience further generation 
headwinds lack sufficient regulatory protection from 
the loss demand pinnacle west the rwe 
enel gdf suez sse europe most utilities 
solar heavy states such california and hawaii have 
decoupling mechanism under which utilities are made 
whole from the loss power demand due customers 
self generating power however solar power grows 
these states does the gap between the cost power for 
solar customers and utility customers who receive their 
power from the grid 
this can result tipping point that creates ever greater 
incentives for customers adopt solar thus leaving utilities 
with the potential long term issue losing significant 
portion their customer base highlighted our 
report batteries distributed gen may negative for 
utilities given the very high cost power hawaii 
believe the solar power adoption rate could very high 
pressuring rates for non solar utility customers which 
turn could create sufficient incentive for customers 
fully off grid arizona pinnacle west has only partial 
insulation against loss demand customers selfgenerate power continue monitor the solar 
penetration rate arizona closely solar 
applications have been rising throughout the year although 
the absolute level has still not reached the point that 
would expect major impact pnw eps 
fast growing economies such china brazil and india 
solar power growth driven large power demand 
growth result solar power has less severe 
cannibalization impact other generation types and 
smaller impact utilities 
europe the rollout solar photovoltaic systems 
has had big influence power markets especially 
northwest europe and particularly germany this has 
been major negative over the last few years for rwe 
and gdf suez however this was exacerbated 
the decline coal and prices the rollout solar 
the has also been faster than expected believe this 
one reason for the slower than anticipated improvement 
spark spreads negative for all generators but 
especially for sse centrica rwe and 
potentially significant negative impacts the extent 
energy storage costs drop hawaiian electric and 
california utilities sempra energy edison international 
and corp and the generation divisions 
european utilities including enel sse rwe and 
gdf suez worth noting that due important 
regulatory market structure and economic differences 
see limited scope for material move customers offgrid europe this different from our expectations 
the 
europe and parts the utility bills are relatively high 
which could encourage relatively greater numbers 
customers disconnect from the grid using solar power 
coupled with energy storage europe consume more 
self produced power but remain grid connected under this 
approach customer solar panels would overproduce 
power during the day and the excess power would 
stored batteries and drawn upon night this risk will 
likely materialize over many years years and the 
degree risk subject many variables that discuss 
this report europe particular there are numerous 
issues that may hinder the ability customers move fully

solar power energy storage 
off grid for example the vast majority customers solar 
panels are not sized allow for complete reliance solar 
power that such customers would still dependent 
the grid for portion their power there are also 
regulatory impediments perhaps most importantly adding 
sufficient storage capacity provide full autarky 
sufficiently expensive that drives irr unattractive 
below breakeven levels 
and avoid the fixed grid fees the size the storage 
market and the corresponding negative impact utilities 
quite sensitive the fixed grid fee that regulators impose 
solar customers for example moving from our base 
case typical fixed grid costs imposed solar 
customers our storage bull case typical fixed 
grid costs imposed solar customers results sharp 
increase demand for energy storage the from 
gwh gwh 
exhibit 
solar power output differs substantially from 
customers power demand profile 
source edison electric institute the profile power output and demand represents 
typical customer california 
based our analysis for the believe that hawaii 
and california represent the greatest opportunity for off grid 
approaches because their significantly higher electricity 
rates and strong solar conditions given that utilities 
hawaii and california are decoupled rates for non solar 
customers will rise more customers install solar panels 
this rate shift accelerates the adoption rate for solar 
because the delta between the utility rate for power and the 
cost producing solar power increases 
over time the extent regulators increase the fixed grid 
fee that solar customers must pay remain connected 
the grid not believe there will material increases 
these fees the near medium terms there will 
growing incentive for consumers install energy storage 
for europe storage cheaper than expect and 
penetration faster bigger the main negative implication 
see for utilities would peak shaving and the impact 
that this could have the peak baseload power price 
estimate that this would additional negative for all 
conventional generators however the additional impact 
function how much more peak shaving seen and this 
hard quantify suffice say that would negative 
for all european generators markets where see 
storage economic especially germany and italy the 
stocks most negatively affected would rwe gdf 
suez enel and sse enel and sse have the largest 
generation exposure percentage ebitda 
rwe enel and gdf suez have the biggest exposure 
production twh see the risk stranded 
distribution assets very low expect few customers 
move off grid europe given the economic and 
regulatory issues 
conversely greater storage penetration would likely lead 
faster development residential energy services model 
and that could positive for utilities that successfully 
develop very early identify potentially advantaged 
companies though note that rwe have been focused 
this space however possible that the big winners 
come from outside the utility space

analytical approach 
have constructed model that calculates returns 
associated with solar projects around the world 
potential approaches customers could take 
the grid but net zero grid power usage under this 
approach customer solar panels produce excess power 
during the day which sold back the grid and night the 
customer draws power from the grid this approach could 
result low net zero usage power produced largescale power plants attached the grid 
the grid partial grid power usage this approach 
often taken europe where solar panel systems are not 
sized fully allow customers eliminate their net usage 
power from the grid and where economics and regulation 
mean moving fully off grid very unlikely thus unlikely 
that such customers pursue fully off grid approach 
fully off the grid this approach consumers fully depend 
their site power generation using storage and power 
management system provide power the home when 
needed consumers could choose this approach for number 
reasons for instance select markets customers who 
choose net meter the grid approach described 
above have pay large non bypassable fixed grid charge 
these consumers have incentive fully off the grid the 
key variable this approach the cost power storage 
tesla gigafactory for battery production which will our 
view reduce the cost batteries significantly below the cost 
other storage options may significant affect how many 
consumers seek off the grid 
methodology 
our model uses national system pricing and financing 
assumptions and statewide average irradiance and electricity 
rates estimate the solar levelized cost electricity lcoe 
versus grid sourced electricity countries regions with 
combination high irradiance and high electricity rates are 
nearing grid parity those with less sunshine and lower 
electricity rates tend farther away calculate lcoe 
measured kwh tally the present value after tax 
cash costs incurred over the lifetime the system then 
adjust for tax benefits then divide the result the 
present value all electricity produced over the lifetime the 
system arrive each state country lcoe 
compare the resulting lcoe against the appropriate 
leverageable grid supplied electricity cost next compare 
the solar lcoe against the relevant electricity rate the 
lcoe lower than the relevant threshold electricity rate 
remember have already taken into account the project 
owner required equity return through lcoe consider 
the market the money divide this addressable 
consumption the same annual sunlight hours data that fed 
the original lcoe calculation determine country solar 
addressable market megawatts capacity 
europe where the electricity produced partially self 
consumed and partially sold either under fit into the 
wholesale power market when subsidies end use the 
same model but focus the irr rather than the lcoe 
which can confusing given the different revenue streams 
for self consumption and power sold 
solar cost assumptions 
assume that solar costs continue decline although 
lower rate than over the past years this decline rate varies 
significantly country with slower pace more mature 
solar markets such germany whereas pricing has 
declined more key markets cumulative 
basis over the last few years expect pricing decline 
lower rate less than through our base case 
cost declines should driven combination 
operational efficiencies with respect design and installation 
systems well continued equipment cost declines 
energy storage system cost assumptions 
addition battery cost declines consistent with 
tesla gigafactory roadmap that could reduce battery costs 
forecast declines costs associated

global solar market landscape 
solar economics and regulatory dynamics vary significantly 
among the six regions countries analyzed the following 
high level overview solar economics and regulatory 
treatment region country 
china projected demand solar power one 
three zero carbon zero emissions power sources the other 
two are wind and nuclear that the government china 
increasingly promoting address the growth power 
demand the magnitude power demand growth china 
very significant the country added per year 
equal total installed capacity china 
uses feed tariffs fits fixed payment stream for power 
produced solar panels coupled with local incentives 
ensure that solar capacity growth meets government targets 
our projected growth solar demand line with the most 
recent chinese government targets 
europe projected demand given the very high 
cost power europe solar already economic relative 
the entire utility bill which all countries comprised 
grid costs taxes subsidies and the costs actually 
generating power governments europe primarily use 
fits and tax breaks incent the growth solar power 
many european countries germany being the most 
significant already have relatively high solar penetration 
levels but there the potential for significant future growth 
given how competitive solar power throughout europe 
united states projected demand 
states solar panel owners are allowed net meter 
effectively allowing panel owners avoid the entire utility bill 
both the portion associated with fixed grid costs and that 
associated with actual power generation given rapidly 
declining solar costs and rising utility bills believe solar 
growth potential well above market expectations even 
under our base case assumption which the 
investment tax credit itc steps down and the net 
metering rules are changed solar customers must pay 
the typical fixed grid costs that utility customer 
pays 
japan projected demand much europe 
japan uses fits incent solar power installations and 
these incentives have allowed for rapid recent solar growth 
the country however are concerned that pending 
government review the solar fit may result 
substantial reduction this rate which would reduce solar 
growth potential 
india projected demand india conducts 
competitive auctions for the procurement additional power 
plants and growth power demand has been very high 
per year over the past several years the government 
has conducted some plant procurement designed solely for 
solar power procurement auctions open all generation 
types solar has not been competitive but recent data points 
highlight the potential for solar power become closer 
competitive with other generation sources given practical 
limits the growth other types generation india 
think solar power will have significant growth potential but 
solar grows land requirements will increasingly become 
limiting factor 
brazil projected demand the government brazil 
has recently pursued number approaches encourage 
solar development including tax breaks solar only 
procurement processes and net metering approach similar 
that the united states the objective bring scale 
and turn solar into competitive source the country given 
the strong solar conditions parts brazil and the net 
metering approach believe solar projects will become 
economically viable parts the country 
africa projected demand the solar potential 
huge nasa data suggests that the total global solar 
potential concentrated the middle east and africa but 
current installed capacity minimal only the end 
expect this double the end and 
double again the end capacity 
row projected demand estimate row 
installations applying the same forecasted growth rate 
from china the india and brazil exclude europe 
and japan from the calculation given their maturity relative 
the remainder our focus regions 
note the middle east electricity consumption rising 
rapidly across the middle east year cagrs are 
common and governments have struggled boost their gas 
output fast enough meet demand keen maximize oil 
exports some governments have identified solar 
potential solution most notably the saudi arabian 
government announced plan build

need overcome number technical and organizational 
challenges dust water scarcity etc meet its goal and

the solar potential africa huge but current installed 
megawatts are minimal the end and 
our projected growth solar installations per 
year through relatively small absolute 
basis nasa data suggests that many countries africa 
and the middle east have daily solar radiation ranging 
between and kwh equivalent roughly the 
total global potential however the speed with which this 
potential has been harnessed still some way behind 
developments all the other regions the world the 
end according the ihs only the world 
solar capacity was operating the middle east and 
africa combined 
what next africa solar capacity growing quickly 
within the region the drivers are combination 
government support feed tariff schemes and better 
economics the price solar capacity has continued 
fall however given the abundance competing and 
cheap energy sources many african markets coal 
south africa and mozambique oil across much west 
africa the solar roll out coming off very low base and 
unlikely make significant proportion total

completed 
morocco currently building plant part 
their solar build plan set achieved 
south africa current total electricity generating capacity 
expansion plans are place increase capacity 
and further the 
new build coal will account for the bulk nuclear

visualizing market attractiveness 
from our analysis compared the relative attractiveness 
markets well subsidy levels now and over time 
the following chart highlights our view 
market attractiveness the degree which the 
market offers attractive growth opportunities given 
solar economics and magnitude potential growth 
subsidy level amount subsidy provided the 
federal and sometimes local government 
believe china will remain attractive market for solar 
driven continued strong government support and 
improving solar economics the chinese government has 
targeted the growth three zero emissions power 
generation types solar wind and nuclear reduce the 
country emissions intensity 
europe remains attractive market given high utility bills 
the region but there potential over the long term that the 
growth solar penetration slows europe further 
considers subsidy reductions and solar reaches high 
penetration levels germany 
india and brazil are increasingly attractive markets for solar 
driven solar cost declines and degree further

there are many free rider issues with solar across 
europe this would also apply combined solar panel and 
battery system the free rider issue arises result the 
inequality the treatment grid fees charging utility 
customers fully variable basis that per unit 
power consumed solar customers can avoid paying the utility 
for fixed grid costs when solar customers eliminate reduce 
their net power demand from the grid the states 
with net metering rules and brazil this approach raises the 
retail price for standard non solar customers the same 
free rider concept applies renewable subsidies per unit 
power consumed billing approach implies that the greater 
the renewable penetration the higher the retail price for 
standard customers who must pay for the subsidy given that 
solar moving from emerging technology one that 
increasingly competitive believe likely that some 
these charging systems are likely altered over time

growth slowed materially and the first five months

legislation coming this summer could explain some the

install before the new legislation takes effect however for 
smaller residential installations the changes legislation are not 
nearly severe irrs remain healthy for residential installations

but irrs are more attractive today why the 
residential slowdown 
but counter intuitively our experience has seen that whilst 
households are aware fits they don tend calculate 
their own projected irrs focussing rather payback 
periods and affordability one possible explanation then 
that the fall residential demand more likely result 
market saturation among consumers interested installing 
solar other words perhaps the majority those 
households that were interested having solar had the 
financial wherewithal afford and have suitable rooftop 
location have already installed solar panels this difficult 
thesis prove but unless the rate residential solar 
installations picks may that correct also 
possible that households have witnessed the decline cash 
fits and subsequently decided against solar purchases 
conceivable that only sharply falling costs

implications for power markets and stocks 
morgan stanley blue paper 
solar additions with without storage are likely continue 
high rate further depressing power markets however 
see further slowdown solar germany this would 
positive surprise for utilities our view primarily benefiting 
rwe there are also significant upcoming power plant 
retirements which will improve market fundamentals and 
improve utility margins which partially offsets the growth 
solar power these retirements which should help return 
oversupplied systems back balance are happening 
different speeds across the european power markets for 
example germany and benelux there will

obvious that all else equal the higher the rate solar 
additions the longer will take see european power 
markets recover 
solar and battery storage could become solution 
meeting peak demand this would the solution the 
power generation holy grail renewables are nature 
intermittent and produce substantially less than their 
nameplate capacity such they are problematic for grid 
operators and consumers however with the right smart grid 
technology smart meters software regulation and 
agreements between customers and tsos solar and energy 
storage could used help balance the grid system not 
just generation units other words they could act 
peak shaving and supply demand management devices 
they can provide power that has been stored back onto the 
grid this negative demand sometimes called negawatts 
this could mean that rather than simply continuing build 
large centralized power capacity cover for peaks 
consumption and troughs intermittent production 
transmission system operators tsos gradually would 
able call consumers reduce consumption through 
direct pricing signals with the intermediation 
aggregators 
solar and battery storage could have negative impacts 
utilities but many technical issues obstacles would need 
overcome for solar power and energy storage 
truly disruptive utilities customers would need 
capable and motivated fully disconnect from the grid 
for this feasible for the residential market think 
number complex system architecture changes need fall 
into place 
number regulatory developments including the 
legal framework for contracts the role and power 
tsos which can vary country country and the 
increased availability battery storage produced 
big enough scale justify the efforts the regulatory 
issues above 
standardization smart meter devices and 
applications partly dependent smart meter rollout 
and other issues 
integration software customer side devices that 
allows tsos govern interruptibility the 
switching off household freezers electric 
heating and air conditioning for short periods time 
according the needs the greater grid 
note that our models this report are based the 
principle that the solar economics are driven avoiding the 
cost retail electricity focus the residential side 
the market selling power back the tso the wholesale 
price mwh versus retail price mwh germany 
for example would thus detract materially from the economics 
for the consumer and paying price high the retail 
price extract stored electricity would very expensive for 
the tso relative current balancing power 
regulation going critical for many reasons and 
the devil will firmly the details the short term 
expect material solar additions steep decline storage 
costs and therefore increasing numbers solar battery 
additions this will focus the debate how grid fees and 
other parts the retail tariff should treated utilities should 
heavily involved this debate but even changing the 
treatment grid fees unlikely reduce material additions 
residential solar and battery storage assuming our forecast 
cost reductions are correct 
the industry would well advised stop investing 
unsubsidised thermal generation our view the last 
decade has shown that very hard accurately predict the 
economics thermal generation the relationship between 
gas coal and costs the supply demand balance the 
renewable capacity additions all have been underestimated 
importance the european utilities 
governments whether accident design have been only 
too willing let thermal generation economics suffer the 
expense other areas like small scale renewables the 
reduction costs solar and the potential competitiveness

shortfall the target clear that there still lot

greater clarity the framework would extremely 
welcome 
and potential key surprise the logical extension this 
could much bigger focus cash flow the generation 
businesses the utilities the cash flow from the large 
integrated gencos much more attractive than the 
accounting earnings thus theorise that one more 
integrated operators could decide take action and 
externalise its depressed generation business highlight the 
value case this could take the following form 
companies could start show generation cash 
flows separately highlight the value case our 
view most generation portfolios are undervalued one 
assumes the businesses are put run off mode and 
with support and low power prices not see any 
other mode that would make sense 
eventually one integrated utility hypothetically 
could take this step further and split its generation 
unit and possibly associated decommissioning liabilities 
into separate business this would make further 
closures politically easier implement our view 
some the assets would now visibly loss making 
further impairments could follow suit rebasing 
more realistic level and enhancing earnings other 
developments could include announcement that staff 
incentives would changed materially and the 
company would likely focus almost solely reducing 
cash costs minimising maintenance costs and beating 
forecast decommissioning costs this would highlight that 
the internally generated cfs would sufficient 
deal with the decommissioning liabilities and that 
after stripping out the generation business and the non 
cash interest charge the provision the rump earnings 
power would much higher than expected this would 
crystallise material value and could attract interest from 
financial buyers minority stake note that are 
speaking theoretically and have knowledge any 
such action under consideration 
another potential scenario that effort hurry 
change policy capacity markets slow change two 
large utilities take matters into their own hands combine their 
generation fleets and announce material further 
impairment charges which would serve boost accounting 
earnings the generation business and raft closures

country average daily solar irradiation high compared

solar installed capacity has maximum irradiation 
currently brazil has negligible installed capacity 
solar representing just the total

the main reason behind the stagnation solar 
generation the lack competitiveness due high 
costs associated with the product especially when 
compared wind biomass and hydropower only 
recently solar projects became available the 
regulated market auctions but under still unattractive 
conditions compared other renewable sources 
source aneel inpe morgan stanley research 
solar energy can developed brazil through new 
energy auctions distributed generation and see 
potential for both mechanisms the former involves 
larger scale projects and was critical for making wind 
power more competitive brazil the latter just had its 
regulation defined and benefits from not having 
transmission costs 
growth potential the brazilian energy planning body 
epe expects new auctions contract from 
solar power between and this represents 
the additional capacity expected for this period 
and could attract suppliers brazil similar what 
happened with the wind segment this possible our 
view only dedicated auctions and special conditions 
are created for solar financing conditions tax 
exemption etc competion with other renewable types 
would not allow such large amount solar the

our analysis competitive solar project requires 
price roughly mwh order achieve minimum 
equity irr real terms considering that this price 
level still significantly above other renewable sources 
large scale solar projects currently depends dedicated 
auctions specific incentives believe capex would need 
low mwp make solar competitive 
wind level that not realistic the short term the main 
assumptions our analysis are load factor capex 
mwp iii asset life years ppa duration

solar power should gain momentum through the 
development dedicated auctions the state 
pernambuco was the first promote solar exclusive 
auction which took place december and contracted 
start supplying energy mwh 
the regulated market two auctions should negotiate solar 
energy auction that should take place 
september this auction solar energy will negotiated 
the same category wind energy and the same prices 
limiting the potential for new projects and reserve auction 
take place october which will have solar projects 
registered exclusive category for the first time the 
regulated market this should allow the development the 
most competitive projects although details such ceiling 
prices and bndes financing conditions are not available yet 
the government expects success contracting solar projects 
supply energy for period years starting 
aneel gives solar projects that start operating until dec 
discount the distribution and transmission tariffs 
tusd and tust during the plant first years 
operation being reduced after this period project 
becomes operational after the mentioned date the discount 
the tariffs becomes during its whole operation period 
however financing and taxation are still challenges 
towards solar generation development since brazil does 
not have robust and developed solar industry obtaining 
financing from bndes becomes difficult the development 
bank requires the project have national inputs terms 
taxes according rodrigo sauaia president the brazilian 
association photovoltaic solar energy taxes are 
responsible for the total production cost required 
for such activity 
brazilian energy research company epe expects new 
auctions contract from solar power between 
and this represents the additional 
capacity expected for this period and could attract suppliers 
brazil like happened with the wind segment the 
international energy agency iea estimates that the solar 
electricity will demand investments per year from 
this suggests that additional 
solar capacity will added the period which line 
with the aforementioned scenario from epe that solar would 
contribute with the capacity expansion brazil over 
the next years this possible our view only dedicated 
auctions and special conditions are created for solar 
financing conditions tax exemption etc competion with 
other renewable would not allow such large amount solar 
the electricity matrix the medium term 
exhibit 
epe expects new auctions contract from 
which implies that solar would contribute 
with the capacity expansion brazil 
installed solar power brazil under different 
weights the national capacity expansion 
the brazilian government offers series incentives for 
renewables expansion order enhance the 
diversification the brazilian energy matrix however these 
incentives have not been sufficient order transform solar 
projects into competitive source brazil the majority 
these incentives are also available wind small hydroelectric 
and biomass sources which are relatively more competitive

distributed generation 
regulation for distributed generation was only defined 
brazil distributed generation consists the 
generation energy the final consumer which can 
connected directly indirectly the grid this system 
consumer that has photovoltaic other renewable driven 
plant his residence might sell the excess energy back 
the grid monetary transaction occurs brazil instead 
the consumer earns energy credits that can used reduce 
its bill the following months this was defined april 
concepts micro and mini generation distributed generation 
and created the energy compensation system net metering 
the net metering system allows the consumer with small 
sized plant that uses renewable sources sell the 
excess energy its distribution company for the same tariff 
would charge him minus the taxes 
the improvement energy taxation could accelerate the 
development distributed energy the challenge this 
case lies the fact that the legislation should adjusted 
each state involves icms taxes the state minas 
gerais has already adjusted its taxation favor this 
mechanism and combined with the relatively high irradiation 
should put the state the forefront the distributed 
generation development the equipment side there 
national resolution from confaz that foresees exemption 
icms and ipi the photovoltaic module some states are 
considering the extension this benefit for other 
components sauaia states that both distributed 
generation and centralized generation large projects are 
heavily affected taxation believes that the excess 
energy that might traded with the grid still discounted 
taxes that can reach the value per kwh 
epe expects installed capacity residential and 
commercial segments reach gwp although 
this may look conservative considering that implies 
penetration less than the residential and consumer 
segments this could prove realistic the proposed timeframe the power will not yet economically viable for 
several regions what should happen gradually over the next 
years

distributed generation offers clear benefits for the 
system our view the key benefits are environmental 
impact reduces the requirement invest generation 
projects with higher environmental impact does not 
require transmission investments significant cost when 
consider that large portion the wind and hydropower 
potential brazil distant from the consumption centers iii 
lower energy losses the transmission and distribution 
electricity once viable from economic point view the 
benefits are clear and the growth potential 
expect distributed generation become more 
attractive after compared average tariffs the

distributed generation competitiveness the southeast

storage does not seem viable brazil due taxes and 
high battery costs all energy exported the grid taxable 
and given that the pricing energy export cannot made 
hourly basis benefiting from peak hours this reduces 
the potential benefit storage storage would help 
export the higher prices time but this not possible the 
current regulation also storage does not make sense 
considering that the customer payments for the minimum 
consumption level are far lower than the cost storage 
system the availability cost calculated multiplying fixed 
value consumption which depends the connection type 
number conductors consumer and his electricity bill 
these values are for consumers with one conductor 
mono phasic and for consumers with two 
three conductors respectively and tri phasic storage 
seems make sense currently only for those who are located 
areas poor quality services and cannot exposed

renova the company has currently more than 
ten distributed generation solar projects and recently 
announced the construction its solar power plant which will

the government efforts enable solar generation brazil 
quite positive and exclusive auctions will key organize

the matrix has been the main driver low short term prices 
for long period due low variable costs fuel required
