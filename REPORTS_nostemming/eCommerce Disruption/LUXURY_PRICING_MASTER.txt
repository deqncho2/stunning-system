luxury revolt change coming 
think have reached tipping point terms the pricing 
structure for the luxury brands overpricing the era 
needs corrected and digital threatens destabilise the global 
pricing architecture which has supported best class profitability 
this report consider 
has pricing gone too far see increasing evidence negative 
price mix brands need reverse price hikes taken 
think the relationship between price and growth has reached 
unsustainable levels and shows the brands have been overpricing 
particularly within the leather accessories category 
will digital threaten the global pricing architecture regional 
price lists local taxes look unsustainable digital era 
whilst price differentials are well understood greater transparency 
will deem brands overcharging certain regions notably asia 
our base case now assumes regional prices converge 
new competition for wallet share the four core factors driving 
brand desirability are important ever quality authenticity 
design and service but younger consumers are attracted other 
categories within high end consumer durables technology 
this creates new level competition history 
have the luxury companies been over earning over the past 
decade the average ebit margin for the six european luxury 
groups analyse has averaged but this masks the 
average margin for the mega stand alone brands whilst high 
barriers entry seek protect superior margins new competition 
beyond traditional brands digital investment and pricing disruption 
all suggest earnings power has peaked post period excess 
earnings think revaluation required 
where could wrong after months underperformance 
and low market expectations for greater china there risk the 
high beta luxury stocks rate fundamentals could too 
bearish our volume and pricing assumptions the global brands 
are characterised high barriers entry and strong pricing power 
however think history not valid benchmark this new era 
revised price targets why not more caution our more 
cautious view the luxury brands reflects the limited upside just 
upside market cap weighted now see our price targets 
and less favourable risk reward bull bear our 
price targets are referenced against our earnings forecasts both 
capture the margin deterioration anticipate and 
this year acknowledge favourable tailwinds for the european 
brands excl those with large swiss franc exposure which support 
reported earnings 
pricing has reached ceiling our view the luxury 
brands have been structural price setters aided 
favourable supply demand dynamic with high barriers entry 
however think the pricing model risk following the 
slowdown volumes since are seeing evidence 
negative price mix new product lower asps help 
improve footfall the consumer behaviour towards pricing 
important not see existing luxury consumers trading 
down more aspirational brands but frequency spend and 
ticket price being impacted for new millennial consumers 
see greater focus value and change spending 
behaviour shift from the traditional view that luxury good 
one off purchase rolling spend mindset seen 
across high end consumer durables this could materially 
impact the average price consumers are willing pay 
just digital threatens the global pricing architecture 
one product one price now drives our base case 
whilst investors are progressively thinking about the longterm impact digital luxury context think they are 
underestimating the risks what this will ultimately bring 
one product one price online has revolutionised pricing 
adjacent categories particularly general retail why should 
luxury immune regional price lists are well understood 
evidenced european sales made chinese 
consumers estimate but brands prioritise digital 
initiatives necessary engage with the millennial consumer 
greater transparency will eliminate differentials excluding 
local taxes our view 
and new competition for wallet share threatens 
volumes the four core factors driving brand desirability are 
important ever quality authenticity design and 
service however younger millennials are attracted new 
product categories particularly high end consumer durables 
which creating new level competition versus history 
more choice means spending spread more thinly which 
implies risks both brand loyalty and average transaction 
value compared the traditional luxury shopper see 
millennials placing greater importance upon brands having 
social acceptance well value for money

there are already indications some brands adjusting 
global price lists have looked across the major brands 
our coverage and are surprised two factors firstly 
the difference online capabilities ranging from product 
education through the buying experience see exhibit 
and secondly examining regional prices clear some 
brands notably cartier have already started adjust price 
points globally richemont expect this move has been 
encouraged internally from the information and consumer 
insights from its net porter online platform 
category see jewellery and apparel best 
positioned the context global pricing structure 
jewellery relatively immune see price lists that are 
already reflecting global structure also believe apparel 
relatively well positioned reflecting local content climate

items purchased for gifting the most exposed categories 
believe global pricing structure are leather goods 
particularly handbags 
exhibit 
the impact global price lists would see greatest 
risk for the luxury leather accessory brands least 
risk for the jewellers our estimates 
whilst regional price differences will gradually disappear the 
premium price structure the brands remains structural 
advantage consumers will still willing pay for quality 
design and desirability also see the opportunity for more 
regional product brands are likely increase regional 
product and the number limited collections this will 
encourage greater innovation and will key method 
support regional pricing 
have looked detail the regional price differentials 
the major brands make the following assertions 
regional price differences will reduce digital drives 
one product one price initiative regional differences 
will still exist reflect local taxes and foreign currency 
fluctuations 
compare prices the major brands their home 
market against the main international regions hong

underlying price lists largely reflect those with the

consider the most material price discrepancies

price differential between europe and 
consider price decrease reduce the 
price gap taken over largest impact and 
assume price differentials any 
region with the home market remain feasible particularly 
given fluctuations foreign currency 
extreme circumstances brands will look move 
prices accordingly also prevent consumer arbitrage

access the sales assistant basic inventory data differed widely across the brands some brands the sales 
assistants were able instantly access and identify the stock level per sku store via database while others 
required sales assistants manually access the shop floor search for the item and were unable offer stock 
information other stores 
not all brands use unique product codes per sku across platforms our experience not all brands had product 
codes linked their product listing online some instances the product code quoted the sales assistant store 
led confusion the product code used store was different the online code some brands also did not 
provide sku product numbers all the customer would have describe the item which occasionally led 
confusion the sales assistants parts and lengthier phone enquiry process

valuation methodology and risks 
burberry our price target for burberry which derived using dcf valuation reflect burberry monobrand status 
revenue growth opportunities and potential for higher margin expansion assume wacc and long term growth value 
risks macroeconomic risks which face burberry and peers and particular risks deterioration china given 
the importance that nationality with regards luxury consumption 
kering our price target derived using sotp methodology blend and this reflects the group multibrand portfolio exposure luxury and lifestyle apply the gucci brand for bottega veneta and sales 
for saint laurent smaller brands for the lifestyle division apply multiple assume conglomerate 
discount assume conglomerate discount see meaningful synergies between the luxury and lifestyle divisions 
risks valuation methodology using sum the parts methodology benchmarked against peer group multiples has its 
limitations but with meaningful synergies between the luxury and lifestyle divisions and its multibrand structure believe this 
the most suitable methodology 
lvmh our derived using sotp methodology blend and this reflects the group diversified portfolio 
apply target multiple implied net earnings for the brand premium our luxury benchmark 
assume target for wines spirits not apply conglomerate discount key risks our price target include 
greater than expected slowdown demand from consumers particularly from china our base case does not assume 
recessionary scenario addition greater than expected margin pressure advertising raw materials retail expansion would also 
provide risk our earnings forecasts external shock event could also materially impact demand for luxury goods given the risk 
slowdown travel trends travel significant driver luxury consumption the upside better than expected pricing 
environment and demand for premium products globally would leave our forecasts conservative 
prada our price target dcf derived assume wacc similar other brands peers and long term growth rate 
our implies the group consists four brands although core prada accounts for ebit and 
miu miu unlike other multibrand groups within luxury not view acquisitions likely but rather expect the strategy 
focus organic growth price target risks include weaker than expected lfl growth the core prada brand would pose margin 
pressure given the level fixed costs and ambitious retail roll out plan there very limited visibility for prada and peers 
further softening the consumer environment decline tourism trends particularly asian consumers travelling europe 
would present downside risks our base case forecasts like the relatively short supply chain dynamics prada and the 
proportion best selling items including replenishment products but prada does pose fashion risk its success the 
leather accessories segment and positive industry feedback has been key driving superior like for like momentum versus peers 
our view 
richemont our derived using sotp valuation blend apply target cartier 
premium our industry benchmark which reflects its robust pricing power and dominance the high end luxury segment 
have estimated the revenue size and ebit contribution brand richemont highlight this information not disclosed 
the company richemont commands higher proportion revenues from the higher end luxury segment with greater exposure 
the directly operated retail channel both characteristics command premium rating the current environment our view 
swatch use sotp multiples based approach blend and implying discount the 
group average believe swatch will trade discount given its greater exposure the low mid tier category 
increasing forecast risk for reference the group historical average year forward have estimated the revenue 
size and ebit contribution brand and price category swatch highlight this information not disclosed swatch 
highlight some risks our price target assumptions the demand for luxury and branded goods dependent upon consumer 
confidence and global gdp outlook tourism travel the most important driver demand any deterioration the travel trends
