addition its buy button facebook also recently launched shop section facebook pages which allows 
retailers showcase product offerings within their existing facebook pages see exhibit our view this 
primarily aimed small and medium sized businesses smbs and part facebook efforts attract 
more advertising dollars from the more than million smbs that have active facebook pages 
many smbs often not have the resources capabilities compete with amazon other large retailers for 
online shopper traffic google also expensive develop and maintain effective mobile apps and mobileoptimized websites facebook shop pages solve these issues and enable smbs leverage facebook 
platform and significant scale monthly active users their online storefront 
the facebook shop storefronts are free setup and again are primarily designed bring more advertising 
dollars onto facebook and while they are mainly aimed smbs believe consumer adop tion these 
stores which would expect eventually have buy buttons ould likely cause other larger retailers 
explore setting shop the facebook mall another incremental online distribution channel after all 
believe retailers are eager for new online channels gain consumer adoption beyond google and amazon 
here again consumer behavior and social network use trends will important monitor 
note that facebook also recently announced partnership with shopify shop covered morgan stanley 
software services analyst brian essex that allows shopify merchants create shop sections their 
facebook pages for free this makes easier for merchants showcase and sell their products directly their

collected and analyzed social media data across brands the retail space for this analysis 
considered the most prominent social media platforms facebook instagram twitter and pinterest within 
those sites measured follower base and engagement over day period other factors included the 
analysis were the presence brand sponsored snapchat page well overall shopability the ease for 
customer shop via social media facebook and instagram played key role evaluating top performers 
given their large user bases both platforms yielded data set average and followers likes 
respectively because twitter and pinterest have smaller user bases they also had smaller data set averages 
and respectively 
given this framework believe victoria secret michael kors nike pink and forever are best poised 
capitalize social commerce given their strong brand identities across the most important platforms these 
brands show large and sustainable total user base with high levels engagement which think the 
companies can leverage successfully incorporate social commerce channels into their overall marketing and

social media the path purchase 
previously discussed the changing path purchase who best positioned see three key steps 
consumers path purchase catch connect and close traditionally these three steps occurred entirely 
stores however over the past years technology faster data speeds and the rapid adoption smartphones 
has drastically changed this what used one simple path has became web more than potential 
paths exhibit social media platforms enhance the path purchase transforming the way the consumer 
moves through the catch connect close framework 
exhibit there are over paths purchase path years ago

the catch connect close framework 
catch 
traditional path purchase consumers traipse the mall stores with friends trying understand and 
identify the latest fashion trends and build consideration set shoppers must then visit each store review 
selections and compare prices and quality the entire process takes place within the mall off mall stores 
omni channel path purchase consumers are inundated with email marketing sent directly their 
computer smartphone tablet when new merchandise arrives often with targeted promotions shoppers can 
compare price points across multitude different items minutes and read other customers reviews 
products all without leaving the comfort their own home the catch process occurs store personal

able browse where they want and when they want this diminished emphasis physical location breaks

how social media plays role consumers are able view trends and build consideration set directly from 
social media platforms fashion has become democratized through consumer involvement the creation and 
dispersion trends social media channels social media platforms allow for more personal interaction 
than email consumers experience more than just promotional content and retailers are able receive 
immediate product feedback the catch phase hinged consumers resonating and interacting with 
brand social media page which then may lead them visit the brand store website 
connect 
traditional path purchase this stage consists filter and trial consumers try items test fit and 
quality and feel fabrics once again this historically occurred entirely store store associates are critical the 
process they must educate consumers about products and other merchandise the retailer might carry price 
comparison much more difficult conduct customers have write down commit memory prices 
from store store 
omni channel path purchase consumers can filter and compare prices across similar identical items 
within seconds either prior visiting store while store using mobile device however brick mortar 
stores remain critical trial and one the reasons why believe multi channel apparel retailers will 
outperform single channel apparel retailers overtime repeat purchases commodity items toothpaste paper 
towels and merchandise without sizing handbags jewelry makeup are easier sell online and less 
dependent stores but apparel and believe will continue heavily dependent brick mortar 
how social media plays role social media aids connecting consumers mobile and desktop retail sites 
for clothing and apparel specifically all social media influenced orders originate from facebook exhibit 
highlighting the platforms importance the connect phase notably referrers overall the top social
