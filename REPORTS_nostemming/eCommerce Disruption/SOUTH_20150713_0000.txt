why are credit apparel retailers struggling grow their account 
base think the answer has less with the new amendments 
the credit act far more with the disintermediation

banks are well placed disintermediate apparel retailers credit apparel 
retailers continue migrate account holders away from month interest free 
options longer dated interest bearing credit terms this exposes the 
consumer the credit pricing debate retailers are charging interest 
edcon and foschini truworths banks the same time 
credit apparel retailers now have contend with more onerous proof 
income requirements while banks face the potential loss interchange fees 
which motivating them convert debit hybrid card account holders 
credit cards banks secured card facilities issued south africa 
significantly the achieved with the transfer 
woolworths and edcon books barclays aiding market share gains 
more level playing field highlights the importance price over store 
card limit our apparel basket pricing research reveals that credit apparel 
retailers are pricing more keenly with the premium cash based volume 
retailer price coming down from december for 
truworths from for foschini from for 
edcon and from for woolworths 
from earnings perspective price and foschini fare best 
attempt capture the earnings impact the evolution consumer credit 
from apparel retailers banks and resumption credit being extended 
apparel retailers our analysis suggests that price and foschini 
top pick will achieve better earnings growth under both scenarios with 
stronger earnings from resumption credit yet earnings growth still intact 
should consumer credit continue evolve with the banks taking greater 
share truworths earnings growth remains moderate under both 
scenarios provisions would need revert meaningfully drive earnings

have the balance sheets extend more consumer credit edcon argue 
and our case study indicates that credit extension practices remain largely 
unchanged despite the recent nca amendment requiring proof income 
the largest credit apparel retailers truworths and foschini the demand 
side our economists delve much deeper into consumer balance sheets and 
income statements and find that both are fact now stronger and that

what new this report 
some background south africa consumer credit industry large and well entrenched there are 
numerous credit providers the largest being the big four banks standard bank first national bank 
barclays and nedbank where the focus asset backed finance and growing exposure unsecured 
credit the fallout from the strong growth unsecured credit has been well documented 
african bank and the furniture retailer ellerines being placed receivership after collapsing under 
mountain debt this was partly due the strong growth credit extended which led excessive 
levels bad debt and partly due the slowdown new loans being granted with new players 
entering the market and acting disruptors 
what are doin this report focus the role that south african apparel retailers play 
providing credit outline their respective strategies and examine the credit practices other emerging 
markets doing and through scenario analysis where outline the potential outcomes 
extending credit from medium term year perspective aim provide picture how consumer 
apparel credit may evolve south africa 
our economists delve deeper into south africa consumer credit cycle 
the market focused trying ascertain where are the credit cycle debating whether have 
reached the bottom when credit extension will resume earnest and what will the likely consumer 
appetite for credit try and answer these questions draw our proprietary household balance 
and cash flow framework and assess all three consumer income categories low middle and upper 
explore why new apparel store card growth has been slowing carry out our own case 
study opening new apparel accounts understand first hand whether the amendments the credit 
act nca may blame for the slowdown see debate extending credit depends the credit 
retailer balance sheet but new customer growth cause for concern exhibit the results 
take closer look the consumer credit strategies followed the south african banks and find that 
the change interchange fees playing key role see debate are the credit strategies 
major apparel retailers likely change medium term round out our view discuss with our 
global consumer colleagues the apparel credit strategies being pursued other developing markets and 
find brazil possible barometer the consumer credit path that south africa may down 
our deep dive into apparel credit reaffirms the view expresse our feb report 
apparel retailers not about the store card all about the price tag namely that the price 
merchandise not the credit limit consumer store card drives the top line the most exposed 
apparel retailer this scenario truworths update our apparel basket pricing and find that 
truworths basket still more expensive than price improvement the measured 
december until reinvests price and sacrifices some its superior gross margin truworths 
top line growth will remain below its peers maintain also argue that provisioning for bad debts 
will take longer return lower levels given slower new account growth remain the stock 
with our earnings forecasts for and and below consensus 
what would the earnings prognosis our thesis fails play out separate our view from 
our earnings forecasts and run earnings scenarios based the continuation current apparel credit 
practices and scenario the earnings impact from consistent forecast impact from evolving 
apparel credit industry our scenario analysis suggests that price and foschini top pick 
will achieve better earnings growth under both scenarios with stronger earnings from resumption 
credit yet earnings growth still intact should consumer credit continue evolve with the banks taking 
greater share truworths earnings growth remains moderate under both scenarios provisions 
would need revert meaningfully drive earnings our view 
south africa apparel retailers july 
key debates 
exhibit four key debates 
market view 
our view 
are the credit strategies major apparel retailers likely change the medium term 
the existing strategies will remain 
yes see more disruption the consumer credit industry more south 
place the amendments the national 
african consumers become banked the structural change interchange fees 
credit act requiring retailers undertake 
effective april incentivises banks migrate consumers from debit cards 
affordability assessments including validation credit cards limit the loss fees think consumers are becoming more 
gross income from the latest months 
savvy the cost interest rate differentials between the credit provided 
payslips bank statements may slow the 
apparel retailers and that provided the banks iii also look the evolution 
rate growth new accounts the short credit provisioning other emerging markets the pricing differential 
term however the major debate surrounds between credit dependent apparel retailers and cash based fashion value retailers 
the credit cycle and when the level 
has narrowed the past months supporting the view expressed our 
provisions and bad debts will revert 
initiation report back february apparel retailers not about the store 
previous lower levels doing supporting card all about the price tag namely that consumers are accessing other 
earnings growth 
forms credit enabling them focus the price tag rather than being reliant 
store cards 
extending consumer credit depends the credit retailer balance sheet but new customer growth cause for 
concern 
the market becoming more concerned 
apparel retailers excluding edcon have sufficient balance sheet strength 
about the low number new credit 
extend more credit the new amendments the national credit act have not 
customers being added the credit 
slowed down credit extension our lending analysis suggests however more 
portfolio however the position expected consumers are taking out credit credit cards rather than store cards 
remain net positive albeit with much lower found which points slowdown the acquisition new customers apparel 
growth levels 
retailers 
will the repair consumer balance sheets fuel lower provisions and bad debts being written off 
consumers have not gone spending 
consumers have repaired their balance sheets extent however the 
spree following lower fuel costs the start unwinding provisions and bad debts will slower due the slower growth 
the year which implies that they have 
the debtors book think illustrate the earnings impact under evolving 
spent the windfall repaying debt leaving credit thesis versus credit environment that remains unchanged set out 
room for retailers provisions and bad debt various scenarios for each apparel retailer this report 
experience improve 
what are the implications for stocks evolving apparel credit market 
the market does not think the credit market under our evolving credit thesis truworths would earn 
will evolve our view status quo basis rather than growth under sustained credit environment foschini would 
therefore truworths could earn 
earn rather than under status quo environment 
well ahead our current price would earn rather than under status quo 
forecast earnings decline foschini would 
scenario should the current disintermediation from the banks accelerate 
earn ahead 
clear that negative for all three apparel retailers with truworths coming under 
our forecast price would earn 
the largest earnings pressure 
again ahead our 
growth rate truworths therefore would 
benefit the most should the status quo 
extending apparel credit preserved yet 
foschini and price would also benefit 
albeit lesser extent

from 
our deep dive into consumer apparel credit reaffirms 
our view that the price tag merchandise sold the 
value added consumers will drive top line growth 
rather than the size credit afforded consumers the 
slowdown sales growth truworths and edcon 
more structural than cyclical trend argue 
are not making material changes earnings forecasts 
price targets the back this deep dive only slight 
revisions reflect recent results 
rce rmb rgan stan ley research estimates 
our stock views 
prefer foschini truworths foschini six years ahead truworths terms reducing its 
reliance credit drive sales which now stands including phase eight rather than the six years 
ago our view and reports stronger cash and lfl growth even though lags truworths space growth 
increasingly competitive apparel landscape argue that foschini diversified revenue stream 
merchandise offering and geographic exposure better insulate foschini has rated from the significant 
discounts which traded following the curtailment credit back november reconfiguring its 
business model has given good earnings momentum and see strong likelihood that will deliver 
earnings growth ahead market expectations 
for and our earnings forecasts are above consensus addition given its earnings profile 
over the next two years expect foschini deliver earnings growth line with its retailing peers and 
think should trade line with the retailing index based our medium term earnings forecasts and the 
defensiveness that its diversified merchandise geographic exposure and window fronts afford the company 
addition the group focus improving the cash invested its working capital cycle together with moderate 
capex requirements bodes well for its longer term valuation captured our per share dcf 
foschini trades ntm and based our estimates for months forward earnings our

price fashion value retailer business model targeting aspirational market the business 
model well designed leverage the growing global disposable fashion drive our view the slowdown 
credit provided truworths foschini and edcon has helped the market share gains yet think consumers 
have now been exposed price offering and while the opening the credit taps will lead some 
customers return truworths and foschini expect they will remain loyal price supporting its 
innovation fashion and value for money offering thereby meeting their desire for disposable fashion 
market share gains have not been supported excessive space growth not anticipate backlash from 
negative operating leverage the next three years think price will sustain its rating retail growth 
story albeit high with earnings growth sufficient yield year capital return 
woolworths well its way disrupt apparel spend the southern hemisphere the david 
jones deal appeals terms its earnings accretion potential does the company strategy for its food and 
clothing offerings woolworths has owned david jones for less than year effective august it 
early days yet the company turnaround appears track and the market has rated woolworths line 
with our thesis that the ebit uplift would higher and earlier than management guided with our investment 
thesis having played out and the stock currently trading ntm and offering only upside our

key drivers potential disruption credit supply strategies 
change interchange fees and why this motivates the large banks migrate consumers from 
debit cards credit cards limit fee loss 
the south african reserve bank revised framework for interchange fees came into effect april with 
industry guidance suggesting that lost revenues for the banking sector could high per annum 
see banks all about that pace may our financials team headed elan levy has taken closer 
look what this likely means for the revenues sa major banks the potential loss revenues becomes 
focus area for the banks comes time when non asset derived nir generation increasingly 
important revenue component while appreciate that each management team the banking sector has 
taken appropriate strategic action mitigate the impact the change interchange fees provide case 
study showing the likely best action for the banks take limit the revenue loss below detail the old and 
new interchange fees and provide business case study per transaction the value this suggests 
that 
higher transaction volumes with loyalty programs are driving the level differentiation here 
increased average fee margins from migrating debit and hybrid cardholders credit cards where new fee 
caps are almost triple certain cases the new fee rates hybrid and debit cards the strategy does however 
involve offering new credit lines non loan customers and risk management will key avoiding 
unintended risk potentially higher impairment rates

differential interest rates and move towards interest bearing accounts 
apparel retailers have also migrated large portions their debtors book interest bearing credit partly 
earn more the credit provided and partly alleviate the financial stress indebted consumers spreading 
the repayments over longer period thus extending months worth interest free credit months 
interest bearing debt truworths has been the most aggressive ageing its book the exhibit below shows 
foschini also migrating consumers albeit not the same extent while price has adopted different 
strategy has always charged interest both and month accounts the company also deciding what 
its appetite for risk whether prepared open month accounts which have shown have 
higher risk profile than month accounts only the very small milady debtor book still run month 
interest free basis price 
the change the ageing debtor accounts highlights that apparel retailers give smaller number 
consumers account holders the benefit purchasing apparel merchandise credit and not incurring interest 
costs long each monthly payment made time 
the change interest bearing versus non interest bearing structurally alters the benefit that consumers enjoy 
holding private label store card relative credit card with only the rewards programmes and the credit limit 
being key differentials the offering this begs the question would the consumer not rather apply for credit 
card rather than store card the interest rates are often lower particularly the consumer incurs interest 
both accounts 
banks are able personalise credit card interest rates based the cardholder credit history and bank 
funding cost lower than retailer the interest rate charged therefore generally lower than the maximum 
permitted rate currently

the brazilian market consumers are becoming more banked result lojas renner one the largest 
providers apparel credit targeting the higher and middle income consumer category consumer has 
seen sales its private label store card fall from years ago currently with further 
revenue being concluded branded store bank credit card introduced two years ago further 
apparel sales are now done third party bank credit cards result slow economic growth however 
brazilian consumers are using the credit extended large apparel retailers this has led market share gains 
credit apparel retailers are securing positive like for like sale growth over smaller independent largely cashbased apparel retailers with the overall apparel market declining year date important note 
though that consumers have shifted from instalment credit months repay the balance contracts due the onerous interest rate charged the instalment versus the interest free contract lojas renner charges interest per month the benchmark interest rate brazil

levels recorded south africa 
comparison between south africa major listed apparel retailers that provide credit their own book with 
the two credit apparel operators brazil lojas renner and lojas marisa reveals the following see also charts 
below 
the brazilian retailers reined credit growth aggressively the wake the global financial crisis whereas 
south african apparel retailers continued extend credit levels similar and 
credit growth the brazilian retailers was far more pedestrian and whereas south africa 
price the only retailer have aggressively reduced its exposure credit and post the credit 
acceleration experienced foschini and truworths continued grow annual credit extended for truworths and for foschini between and 
assessing past dues percentage the debtors book reveals that lojas renner has strong track record 
having very small percentage accounts past due this also reflected the low levels provisions 
required the company 
foschini has the second lowest past dues yet its provision for bad debts stands its debtors book 
contrast price has higher levels past dues yet its debtors book its requirement provide for 
bad debts very low 
overall provision for bad debts has increased most credit apparel retailers the only exceptions being lojas 
renner and price

taiwan the banking system taiwan mature and therefore major retail stores extend credit retail 
customers consumers pay via cash debit card credit card and stored value card 
with more than million credit cards issued taiwan population million and more than 
million effective cards penetration high long stores accept credit cards consumers will use them that 
said credit card transactions account for only taiwanese individuals consumption expenditure because 
many small medium sized stores prefer cash transactions thereby avoiding unnecessary banking fees and

total household debt growth has since slowed about the result has been deleveraging 
household balance sheets this similarly reflected the sarb debt disposable income ratio which 
peaked early and has since eased was therefore income growth driving 
deleveraging not debt pre payment 
the sarb data useful monitoring systemic risk believe more bottom approach 
required measure the micro picture this need look past just the official sarb debt todisposable income ratio for two important reasons first the sarb data measures the aggregate level 
household debt outstanding relative the total amount disposable income earned over any one period 
unfortunately this data does not differentiate between incomes earned indebted versus non indebted 
households while this perfectly consistent with international norms masks the underlying vulnerability 
levered households via overstated deflator second given that this micro exercise prefer richer data 
set that provides colour the level indebtedness across lower middle and upper income households not 
just macro aggregate applicable all households average 
our proprietary household balance sheet and cash flow framework meet both these requirements using data 
published quarterly the national credit regulator the statistics south africa income and expenditure survey 
cpi data and trends employee wage settlements are able construct cash flow statements for typical 
leveraged household for the full methodology see south africa economics household debt metrics and 
susceptibility the upcoming cycle august from this are able quantify what each 
representative household spends debt repayments the ncr publishes information debt oustanding

middle income households entered the global financial crisis slightly lower level indebtedness but

this segment stands level which estimate will plateau over the coming months net credit 
extension approximately matches net income growth 
the upper income household where the lion share the stock household credit resides has also made 
active progress winding down debt but still remains quite extended today versus when the 
global financial crisis broke the tailwind from disposable income growth has been somewhat less pronounced 
this segment here where believe there case made that decline debt servicing costs over 
the sarb policy easing cycle created the opportunity for households prepay debt looking the debt 
burden this context suggests there room for households gear should the supply credit available 
match any possible increase demand 
alternative indicator that would seem support this assertion the sarb consumer

debate what are the implications for stocks evolving credit 
environment 
the extension credit will continue evolve south africa our view with the migration consumers 
from apparel retailers banks already evident with regards credit apparel retailers this likely have 
meaningful impact how retailers apply valuable resources 
the first implication that gross margins will have lowered smaller element risk needs 
factored into gross margins the size the debtors book reduces over time slower than forecast growth 
the debtors book also implies that provisions may remain higher for longer owing the slower debtors book 
growth rather than deteriorating debtors book the rate growth selling financial services new and 
current account holders may well slow the size the market reduces the impact the aforementioned 
could some extent mitigated rationalising the resources allocated opening new accounts and 
managing existing accounts 
also run scenario capturing the earnings impact should our thesis not play out the status quo remains 
place and credit apparel retailers are able accelerate the credit extended consumers 
have not included woolworths this scenario analysis the debtors book not held balance sheet 
following the sale and ownership the joint venture created between woolworths and absa bank 
scenario analysis 
retailers continue grow the number store cards change credit strategies 
gross margins increase per annum the extension credit accelerates 
provisions for bad debts reduce per annum the book continues extended and stronger 
consumer balance sheets result better repayment profiles 
the proportion credit sales total sales rises thereby increasing the other income secured from 
extending more financial services the existing account base aiding earnings 
disintermediation the banks providing credit credit cards rather than retailers 
gross margins decrease per annum the extension credit accelerates 
provisions for bad debts increase per annum the book growth continues slow 
the proportion credit sales total sales falls thereby decreasing other income secured from 
financial services the existing account base slows down 
conclusion foschini and price are better off relative truworths 
under evolving credit structure our earnings calculations show that truworths would secure the lowest 
earnings growth the next financial year with price best positioned followed foschini ensure the 
scenario analysis not influenced our earning forecast assumptions our earnings results have been 
compared the last published annual results reported each company 
should there change the status quo our scenario analysis shows that foschini and price earnings 
growth will exceed truworths highlighting that downside limited price and foschini should banks 
continue disintermediate consumer credit the downside has been protected price reduced exposure
