consumers easier access foreign brands 
building new channels takes time and money reforming their

any time soon the current leadership appears determined push austerity measures 
sluggish growth business related demand economic downturn continues weigh wine 
consumption while think the presence wine business events continues grow the frequency and 
volume consumption may decline 
stronger growth retail consumption but from small base believe there substantial potential 
the retail segment given relatively low wine drinking volume china liter per capita compared taiwan 
liters japan liters and korea liters however could take time for private consumption make 
for the portion lost from government channels 
imported wine taking market share while growth imported wine down trend still mops 
more demand than domestic wine does imported wine can offer various brands various price ranges 
can more easily adapt changes consumer spending patterns also think the imported wines are gaining 
more traction among business and retail consumers
