key conclusions 
our alphawise china imf survey update demonstrates 
continuation favorable consumer trends well 
continued evolution normalization competitive 
dynamics following disruption from product 
recalls this the third edition our alphawise china infant 
milk formula imf survey which update our and 
surveys and chinese mothers 
respectively 
iii price elasticity remains low and brand loyalty high 
premiumisation still ongoing despite governmentmandated price cuts consumers our survey continue 
favour product quality the single most important 
purchase criterion which should support further expansion 
the premium and super premium segments 
online channel growing fast and increasingly 
important providing tailwinds for nestle and danone 
while the online channel still developing penetration 
growing rapidly from overall purchases 
since moreover expect this trend continue 
respondents expect increasingly use the online 
channel the next months nearly half 
online store users rely them their primary 
imf purchase channel and think this percentage 
should continue increase the near future imf 
buyers value the convenience online shopping well 
cheaper prices and access larger range 
foreign imported products see nestle best 
positioned benefit from expansion the online channel 
share followed danone and lesser 
extent abbott whilst mead somewhat laggard 
while foreign brands are still viewed more favorably 
perception gaps with local brands are gradually 
normalizing found that foreign brands continue hold 
strong preference consumers minds most 
purchase criteria and tend disproportionate 
beneficiary potential brand switching particularly nestle 
and danone however the percentage respondents 
viewing foreign brands better declined modestly 
most key measures including product quality and 
reputation for safety 
structural level drivers support continued 
robust consumption growth remain place our survey 
indicated that the frequency imf use within existing 
households fairly stable and household 
penetration likely continue increasing given 
consumers continued focus product quality rather 
than promotions doctor recommendations 
expect mix continue significant driver category 
growth the other hand expect relatively modest 
impact from the relaxation the one child policy our 
survey indicated decrease the likelihood having 
second child among respondents 
our goal was seeking understand number key 
questions surrounding the following dumex and 
abbott pace recovery after fonterra product scare the 
impact the chinese government price probe iii the growth 
the online channel for milk formula and the impact 
government supply chain efforts perception local brands 
and the impact recent regulatory dynamics including the 
relaxation the one child policy the consumption outlook 
our key conclusions drawn from comparison prior results 
with our april face face street interviews with 
parents across tier cities narrowed from tier last year 
given our greater focus the online channel this year include 
the ndrc pricing investigation and fonterra recall 
have relatively low awareness and have not materially 
shifted the preference for foreign brands only 
buyers are aware the government price probe whilst 
are familiar with fonterra botulism scare incident 
and associate foreign brands with perhaps result 
overarching brand preferences have stayed consistent 
with our findings with foreign producers continuing 
dominate the fragmented chinese imf market although 
the perceived gap local brands has reduced 
the fonterra recall has driven near term market share 
shifts but not see significant structural hurdles for 
danone abbott regain share the recall appears 
unsurprisingly have impacted danone dumex brand 
most negatively and respondents considered that 
more needed restore confidence the brand 
estimate that iluma nestle and enfagrow mead have

key findings and context implications stock 
danone market share impact confirmed but brand 
equity positive channel mix suggest improvement 
our survey clearly highlights that consistent with company 
commentary and nielsen share data danone dumex was 
significantly impacted the fonterra product recall its status 
most frequently purchased brand declined from 
and half consumers indicated that danone 
needed take further action restore confidence the brand 
however these issues are already well known our view 
and our survey also suggests more modest impact 
danone overall portfolio brand share down from 
prior due increased share for both cow gate and aptamil 
addition while dumex brand loyalty and overall impression 
ratings have fallen this appears based consumer 
responses more case stalled momentum than 
structural issue given still strong brand equity ratings and 
continued willingness consider switching dumex 
brand switchers finally danone recent brand launches 
despite still low brand awareness levels are among the top 
brands purchased the fast growing online channel where 
has share indicating room for upside going forward 
with the worst appearing over china the category 
think should see significantly positive growth 
inflection point are upgrading danone equal weight 
today separate note 
nestle expect market share momentum continue 
our survey findings support our view that following its 
transformational acquisition wyeth nestle imf market 
position china has been uptrend and set improve 
further brand awareness for all nestle brands has significantly 
improved since and our survey notably highlights iluma 
now being the standout brand nestle portfolio despite 
only being launched years ago illuma now ranked 
brand share increasing from which 
benefits the company mix given its ultra premium positioning 
iluma wyeth also stand out terms overall favourable 
impression ratings ranked and respectively and key 
product attributes such product safety and taste although 
some nestle share gains can attributed competitor 
recalls also believe the company can continue benefit 
from positive channel mix given its apparent share leadership 
the rapidly developing online channel share terms 
most frequently purchased brand and its disproportionate 
preference among consumers who intend switch 
brands during the next months going forward expect 
nestle broad portfolio depth drive growth well provide 
defensiveness the event further regulatory changes while 
china imf only nestle group sales estimate 
and contribution group sales and profit growth 
mead johnson strong brand equity and share 
improvement channel mix potential headwind 
our survey supports our view that mead dumex primary 
competitor has seen significant recent benefit from the 
fonterra recall with its brand preference levels increased 
versus our prior survey and placing the 
company line with danone but still lagging the combined 
nestle wyeth the company reputation and brand equity 
with consumers remains arguably the strongest and most 
consistent the industry and over respondents hold 
favorable view its brands with the company ranking among 
the top nine the most important selection criteria 
however our survey indicates that mead under represented 
the fast growing online channel with its brand most 
frequently purchased only respondents who purchase 
imf products online view this byproduct the 
company historical distribution strength hong kong which 
has led underemphasize the development potentially 
cannibalistic online presence ultimately remain confident 
mead ability defend its now higher share position but 
believe danone and abbott ongoing recovery coupled 
with nestle wyeth momentum could limit further mid term 
gains remain equal weight viewing mead strong growth 
outlook largely discounted ebitda 
abbott labs positive brand awareness and share 
gains positive sign for continued growth 
abbott had the second largest market share gains within our 
survey results share total purchases while 
brand awareness for its products made substantial low 
double digit gains from closing the gap with other 
multinational brands abbott brand reputation reflected less 
impact from the supplier recall than that competitors 
respondents saying recall had some significant impact 
similac for dumex overall see the recall 
impact temporary headwind that should diminish over 
time management estimates and 
note that consumers continue rank abbott brands 
highly quality critical factor determining purchasing 
decisions abbott recorded brand association with 
quality among our survey respondents behind cow and 
gate and dumex and ranked place behind mead johnson 
for net brand improvement quality nevertheless with high 
brand loyalty for abbott and its peers see future share

cans milk formula and mostly pay more than 
per can according our survey the super premium segment 
imf priced now accounts for the market

contraction demand for mainstream and value products 
well transfer part the premium demand the super 
premium segment over the period 
well significant brand loyalty the relatively low 
price elasticity seen the china imf market coupled with the

high level brand loyalty exhibited imf buyers only 
imf buyers tier cities have switched brands the past 
months and would suspect that this was mostly related 
product quality concerns the time the botulism scare 
highlight exhibit estimate dumex suffered most 
from this dynamic while nestle illuma and mead enfagrow 
were the main beneficiaries looking forward only are 
very likely somewhat likely switch brand the next 
months mainly due product quality concerns and family 
friends recommendations see exhibits 
among brand switchers the preference for foreign 
manufacturers still particularly strong 
respondents are unlikely switch brand the next months 
and respondents are unsure however foreign

could strictly interpreted requiring product fully 
manufactured either within outside china since selected 
companies such mead johnson partially manufacture their 
products foreign locations such the netherlands and 
ultimately finish the blending the final product china this 
could under some interpretations require changing the 
steps the production process however view this 
tail risk rather than outcome that appears likely play out 
and note that mead has previously addressed this possibility

characteristic with foreign brands may justify pricing premiums

our survey also shows significant brand stickiness the 
face hypothetical price cuts response scenario 
where brand maintained prices while other brands cut prices 
those aware the government investigation 
and the overall survey population stated that they would 
continue purchase their current brand the second most 
popular response hypothetical price cut was shift 
cheaper milk product from the same brand overall 
all respondents would stick with their current manufacturer 
choice despite price cut other brands this further 
supports the view that price remains largely secondary factor 
while did see sharp drop purchases imf 
cans priced from rmb and small uptick 
formula priced slightly cheaper are hesitant ascribe 
the ndrc investigation the sole driver mix shift

lower rmb price point may reflect some marginal 
impact from the price cuts introduced certain brands
