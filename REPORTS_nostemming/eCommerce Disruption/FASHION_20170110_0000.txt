europe next top model 
incorporate european fashion ecommerce our internet 
coverage and apply new value framework the stocks 
zalando our top pick its attractive marketplace model 
are overweight ynap for its attractive unit economics 
and equal weight asos given less margin upside 
lay out the key drivers determining long term value for ecommerce 
stocks believe zalando has the opportunity reach greatest scale given its 
mass market lower risk marketplace platform approach traditional online 
retail find that the key determinants long term profitability are order 
values ynap clearly the lead local scale focus for zalando return habits 
ynap leads and import duties most favourable asos although risk 
longer term zalando transition towards marketplace could game changer 
for its growth and margins beyond use these attributes determine our 
new order preference within the fashion ecommerce stocks 
zalando and ynap trade discount asos and believe they are 
undervalued see long term margins for asos whereas for zalando 
and ynap see them double digits given asos combination growth 
and long term margin believe the shares are fairly valued 
revenue our forecasts zalando and ynap trade and yet they 
should trade premium given their greater margin upside 
zalando our top pick the space with price target zalando datadriven approach online fashion could allow become the greater scale 
ecommerce platform europe its platform strategy provides opportunity 
scale lower risk with greater margins and higher returns believe could 
add our valuation but await more detail the capital markets day 
june incorporate into our price target 
are overweight ynap with price target ynap has the most 
attractive unit economics driven its much higher average order values 
which should lead the highest ebit margins not believe this fairly 
reflected its valuation prefer zalando because while see great upside 
long term the short term still needs adjust for changes consolidation 
what tend top line momentum driven stocks 
are equal weight asos with price target asos benefits from 
strong competitive positioning its own brand and the opportunity expand 
into europe and the and see upside risk revenue forecasts the short 
term however while our revenue forecasts are ahead consensus not 
expect see any meaningful margin progression over the next three years given 
sharp capex increases and global ambitions the current lack sales tax 
sales adds gross profit margins the region which could risk 
following the change government

what the price 
trading investors are valuing the long term opportunity this 
right our view believe the three companies can continue grow revenue 
every year the next years fact double digit growth could for longer 
online penetration levels increase still most markets and growth online 
tends lead greater market share concentration this leads investors frequently 
looking sales with asos trading calendarised zalando and 
ynap ecommerce stocks have historically held multiples returns 
could very healthy the stocks can maintain this multiple discuss the long term 
growth opportunity for each the report 
although current valuations capture top line growth better than long term margins 
given the scale the opportunity for the three companies believe the companies 
are right prioritise revenue growth over short term margins however valuations 
should reflect realistic margins maturity our growth assumptions are right and 
they are not far from consensus for estimate the current share price 
implies long term ebit margin around for zalando asos and ynap 
and believe that zalando and ynap should achieve double digit ebit margins 
leading rating based the key margin drivers discussed above and detail 
the report argue that there are structural reasons why ynap and zalando 
margins will higher maturity than those asos zalando could even higher 
incorporate upside from its marketplace our bull case our base case 
assume zalando margin gets years ynap and asos this 
leads price targets upside and implying 
sales and respectively ebit they imply for 
zalando for ynap and for asos 
prefer zalando ynap take long term approach valuation but oneyear timeframe believe momentum and catalysts are more supportive for zalando 
ynap consensus needs adjusting for headwinds changes perimeter and 
higher which could put some short term pressure forecasts and consequently 
the shares also see greater risks driven underlying weakness the luxury 
market growth should pick into and margin upside should continue come 
through the shares could under pressure short term consensus adjusts which 
could present good entry point conversely for zalando already see margin upside 
base case forecasts the company improves disclosure its marketplace its 
capital markets day june 
with upside our price target why equal weight asos see upside revenue 
forecasts short term the company guidance for reported revenue growth 
could prove too conservative believe incorporates benefit and 
given reported constant currency growth think unlikely that 
will decelerate close this fiscal year the first half will continue benefit 
from the loyalty programme addition free returns outside tax benefits the 
and tailwind non gbp volumes longer term see upside from the expansion 
into sportswear and growth the and with short term sales momentum being

the maxed out for asos asos estimates that has share the

would imply that asos has share while its own brand has been the biggest pull 
this also means could have close market share its addressable market with 
the asos apparel brand high level are not saying its market share cannot grow 
beyond that but unlikely easy has been online penetration the 
still just according the company online sales could still double from here 
ability scale zalando ynap asos 
zalando talks about revenue growth corridor asos isn explicit but 
recent years has guided towards this range and ynap guides one the 
key limitations faster growth the logistical capabilities well additional 
inventory risk that the companies are forced take they increase scale this why 
see zalando best placed scale its marketplace model reduces its inventory risk 
and leads higher returns its traditional online retail model has shown 
the past year that can move onto new warehouses without operational issues 
impacting margins ynap technology investment and omni stock plan leave better 
placed scale the future encouraging greater season sales customers get 
greater visibility inventory asos has shown greater operational challenges with the 
site being down for extended periods still last year and pricing issues the last two 
however its transition cloud servers and capacity expansion europe mean that 
better placed than the past 
margin upside 
unit economics are most favourable ynap zalando similar asos average 
order values aovs are over higher ynap even though provides services 
such same day delivery the company still benefits from better unit economics not 
only are ynap average order values higher but its order returns are lower than peers 
zalando has higher returns than asos asos however the 
average selling price for zalando well above that asos which leads higher 
average order values aovs net returns the contribution margin defined gross 
profit after shipping costs clearly higher ynap but similar asos and zalando 
for detailed account margin drivers see exhibit 
leading highest long term ebit margins ynap use systematic approach 
estimating long term margins for the three companies break down two 
stages 
because they are all growing super normal growth rates expect fixed 
costs continue increase above inflation over the next five years all three 
companies have rampant costs capex substantially above inflation 
asos has the most aggressive cost expansion plan the three intends add 
new head office staff three years with focus technology 
merchandising and retail buying has also discussed the intention shift some 
its production into the which could help drive growth from fast fashion sales 
but may also have impact margins and execution could challenging its 
capex increasing and and expect remain 
least the lower end that range after that depreciation was only last 
year there significant catch there forecast ebitda margins increasing 
from and but ebit margins only move 
from and respectively 
ynap benefits from integration synergies and scale ynap the only company 
that has provided specific ebitda margin target incentive plan costs for specific point time reaps the benefits from the merger 
including better negotiation terms smarter stock supply through its omni channel 
programme and scale believe should able grow ebitda margins 
incentive plan costs from estimated 
guidance however expect ebit progress lower depreciation catches 
with capex and ebit including ipc make comparable peers moves from 
zalando has the greatest scale and operational gearing has also seen sharp 
one off increase capex costs but while slightly higher absolute basis 
percentage sales lower given greater scale forecast ebitda 
margins increasing from and and ebit 
margins moving from and respectively 
terminal margins assume fixed costs are sales for the 
three companies these then grow line with inflation with things like gross profit 
margins shipping costs warehousing etc remaining static get margin for 
ynap for zalando assuming shift towards marketplace which only 
incorporate our bull case and for asos make exception for zalando 
where given its runway for growth won reach its target margin 
assume the lower end terminal value within our explicit forecasts but 
rather later its life similarly for its marketing costs assume they are sales 
but partly because zalando includes personnel costs which

why aren concerned about zalando higher customer 
acquisition costs estimate that for every spent 
marketing asos would have made incremental 
revenue compared with zalando zalando strategy 
become the leading platform europe requires that reaches 
scale faster than competitors competing platforms reached 
scale faster would harder for zalando get brands join 
the marketplace and benefit from network effect natural 
that spends twice the level marketing and advertising 
asos the returns will lower but still scaling faster 
zalando greater scale also allows for greater margins over fixed 
costs and capex and its higher price points lead slightly higher 
gross profit per order the company already achieving 
ebit margin its leading dach region germany austria 
switzerland and returns marketing spend here are likely 
much higher note that zalando includes all costs associated 
with marketing that number whereas asos only includes the 
cost advertising personnel costs for example are not 
included zalando marketplace sales are also included

content are very effective terms driving sales growth 
believe zalando has the potential achieve the highest 
margins can execute successfully the platform expansion our tmt 
conference barcelona last november the company said that marketplace could 
reasonably become gross sales that would imply gmv our 
estimates assuming all incremental forecast revenue falling below the 
window assume revenue take rate with ebit margins moving 
progressively towards every gross merchandise value gmv adds 
the ebit margin this case adds for more details our 
assumptions see our november report zalando platform opportunity 
see risk long term gross profit margins asos from changes duties 
because its low price points many asos customers the and other non 
countries not pay duties this can lead margins that are percentage points 
higher than the where asos customers pay the item cost vat because 
asos likely open new warehouse the its customers will have start 
paying local taxes addition risks having pay import duties which would hit net 
income see our economists recent report given its priority revenue growth over 
margin assume will take the hit however its distribution costs should also 
come down think the impact the contribution margin could neutralised see

the long term margin assumption key driver for valuations and explains why our 
price targets imply higher sales multiple for ynap zalando asos run 
through our assumptions long term margins our previous sections and show the 
sensitivities the value and multiple exhibit exhibit value the three stocks 
using dcf methodology with wacc and long term growth for all three 
use our detailed model through then have explicit forecasts for years and use 
terminal value this results over the value being determined 
forecasts beyond 
why these stocks trade premium ebit most the global 
internet stocks because they have longer runway from growth driven lower 
penetration levels and fragmented industries these stocks have limitation how 
fast they can grow because they take inventory risk within our coverage just eat for

zalando set become leading european fashion platform through its traditional 
online retail site zalando sells active customers holds brands and 
will generate revenue our estimates great starting point off 
which build marketplace fashion amazon has done general retail 
booking hotels and rightmove property not calling zalando the only 
winner for instance amazon likely take meaningful share but market 
the opportunity significant 
expansion into marketplace should drive additional growth adds choice for 
consumers which should help attract new customers and get existing customers buy 
more and removes inventory risk for zalando consensus has net revenue growth 
falling out the corridor the company guides after this partly 
becomes more challenging grow the same pace with increasing scale with the 
addition the company could remain within the growth corridor for longer 
wouldn have adjust its infrastructure account for some the additional growth 
our estimates zalando has share the european online apparel market but 
only the overall market which leaves plenty room for growth 
and boost returns profit contribution lower than under the model but margins 
can depending the level service with limited capex estimate that 
every marketplace sales adds margin and zalando current 
ebit guidance does not incorporate shift from zalando could update 
guidance the capital markets day june 
marketplace could add long term ebit margin guidance our tmt conference

become gross sales that would imply gmv our 
estimates assume revenue take rate with ebit margins moving

ebit margin this case adds for more details our assumptions see 
our report zalando platform opportunity november 
zalando may update its ebit margin guidance its capital markets day june 
the company guided towards margins its capital markets day with 
clear path get there however did not incorporate any changes structure

yoox net porter overweight 
have overweight rating ynap shares believe the current upside 
margins mispriced the growth opportunity reasonably well understood although 
ynap remains under the radar for many investors our view but don think the 
shares reflect ynap likely progression towards double digit ebit margins the shares 
have been weak growth has been held back weakness luxury followed 
europe and top line momentum could remain against consensus adjusts 
estimates for changes perimeter and while will still year transition 
forsee comeback from growth margins should continue move forward 
the company delivers synergies rolls out its omni stock plan and benefits from 
strong operational gearing with superior unit economics the other fashion stocks 
could therefore present good entry point 
key growth drivers 
strong competitive position enables future growth the combination yoox and 
net porter has helped the company forge new relationships with brands including 
prada iwc and tiffany luxury brands keep tight control over inventory which favours 
existing large specialists including ynap our base case assume ynap market 
share luxury remains constant through integrates the business and picks 
slightly from implements the omni stock programme the company targets revenue growth 
attractive strategy drive growth the company targeting extremely important 
people eips more aggressively advertising the programme expanding reach outside 
new york and london and offering experiences rewards these eips are important 
they make customers net porter but sales geographically the 
middle east and asia offer the greatest opportunity given the high concentration eips 
there 
omni stock drive acceleration growth and margin upside from its 
omni stock programme will allow nap customers see stock across all warehouses 
the increase depth inventory should lead greater sales choice tends help 
drive growth should also increase the proportion season sales the ability 
match buyers and sellers should increase 
believe its valuation attractive given its growth runway and margin potential 
the multiple appears high near term but sharp top line growth operational gearing and 
synergies lead forecast ebit growing over the next three years our estimated 
ebit multiple therefore contracts from and 
comparison asos trading calendar and zalando 
although will keep close eye merger execution and the competitive 
environment our price target implies potential upside and are 
overweight ynap however have preference for zalando ynap faces 
higher degree execution risk the merger net porter and yoox has come with 
high profile departures and the need integrate platforms and rebuild the company 
culture the company goes through its integration competitors could take the 
opportunity acquire customers and improve their own offer leaving ynap exposed 
believe the execution timeline tight and ynap offer strong enough both inseason and off season and the kpis have remained healthy far 
consensus needs adjust for the sale shoescribe the corner which likely

this report look the ecommerce stocks relative our internet coverage for

them line with other internet stocks with wacc and growth rate

investors not read much into the changes earnings valuation however 
lay out the key changes below 
asos changes rating upgraded from underweight equal weight price target lifted 
from prior forecasts assumed constant currency revenue growth 
falling whereas now forecast falling 
with greater growth are also more aggressive the ebit margin where 
now forecast rising whereas before the forecast 
was fall from this results eps changes and 
our price target now determined through dcf with growth and 
wacc whereas previously was achieved through the combination residual income 
and dcf wacc long term growth the long term margin assumption was 
prior our current model 
ynap changes rating unchanged overweight the price target raised from 
prior revenue forecasts growth did not incorporate the impact for 
the closure shoe scribe and the corner the impact they also assumed 
cagr the top end company guidance now forecast 
reported revenue growth constant currency and thereafter take 
more conservative approach prior forecasts also assumed that the ebitda margin 
increased guidance and required adjusting for sharper 
depreciation increase this leads eps cuts our detailed margin analysis 
leads believe ebit margins could rise long term assumption 
prior value the business using dcf only with wacc and long term
