the other ecommerce has been strong growth driver for the parcel

parcel volume growth the past decade and now accounting for roughly half 
the domestic ground business however may approaching tipping 
point where ecommerce giants especially amazon but others well make 
initial attempts vertically integrate into the delivery business while 
initially serving support function our analysis conjunction with 
morgan stanley internet analyst brian nowak shows that emerging 
ecommerce logistics network should able least match the last 
mile economics legacy parcel carrier per package dense 
areas though this may limited scope begin with removing the most 
dense volumes could significantly erode the per unit economics for the 
remaining business the parcels the other end the spectrum

very least legacy parcels could see pricing pressure and trimmed growth 
expectations but the worst case scenario the loss

legacy parcels need reinvent either accelerating growth 
shrinking improve returns the current strategy the legacy parcels 
try and offer the best service return for price believe this approach 
could precipitate erosion share the face new competition and the 
resulting overhang could compress valuation believe ups fdx are 
crossroads and should pick one two possible courses for the future they 
can either fend off the competition growing quickly and taking share the 
expense price and returns and valuation they can pivot become

freight transportation february 
morgan stanley research 
ecommerce players globally are looking build their own logistics networks and least partly insource the 
function while headlines have largely focused amazon note that alibaba rakuten and others may 
also pursuing this path together they account for over global ecommerce share focusing 
amzn reports and anecdotal evidence suggests that leveraging its own amazon logistics service make

what does this mean for ups fdx note that amzn

supplement not substitute any existing logistics 
providers especially around peak season highlight

providing added support though note that

analysis also shows that new entrant like amzn 
can competitive existing unit cost 
economics benchmarks 
the crowdsourcing logistics new startups leveraging the shift omni channel retailing 
believe this could greater threat the parcels business than the insourcing ecommerce giants 
because involves virtually all ecommerce outside the giants omni channel retailing refers shift 
buying patterns from predominantly physical store based experience the past multi channel offerings 
store and internet distinct and separate purchasing channels the present omni channel mix and match 
across channels purchase mobile pick store return online for single transaction the future 
bid compete against the ecommerce giants the average retailer big box store think macy best buy 
target looking adapt its retail network for omni channel world 
one way achieve this leveraging the retailer existing brick and mortar network serve micro 
fulfillment centers for ecommerce delivery the customer short you order item from bestbuy 
instead the item shipping from distant distribution center arrive your home days local bestbuy 
store that has the item stock will have your door hours enable this number new startup 
companies like ridesharing providers postmates deliv and others are looking take piece the last mile 
pie which could potentially come the cost legacy parcel carrier which would have completed the end toend delivery before 
the other approach omni channel could for each retailer develop its own ecommerce logistics network 
given the cost and complexity involved believe may make more sense for the retailer leverage 
existing competitor network sort what amzn does with its web services business cloud computing today 
also look the future the last mile business including the potential use drones and autonomous 
delivery robots which may closer commercial implementation than consensus thinks 
but why now ups fdx have faced local competition for years what has changed make this very real 
threat two things our view one ups fdx have highlighted the parcel business has always been about 
achieving the density that makes the economics work and density about scale what new that now 
have companies like amzn that may have the scale and density make the economics work the most 
densely populated areas the the second new development that technology has enabled the local 
players startups gain enough density local level that they can possibly make the economics work 
well 
the road ahead for ups fdx consensus remains largely focused near term execution especially around 
peak season ups fdx and continues view ecommerce growth opportunity however see potential

for growing competition and believe ecommerce could deflationary business for the legacy parcels

believe the legacy parcels should deviate from their current course and follow one two paths dominate 
ecommerce significant price cuts today and keeping new competitors out the market pull back almost

debate how defensible the parcel business really 
consensus view competition non issue given the high barriers entry asset heavy nature the

our view parcel already more competitive business than people realize and believe the competition 
set intensify from here see threats from insourcing ecommerce giants one end and more 
importantly omni channel retailing emerging startups offering local delivery alternatives the other end 
the spectrum together these threats could erode parcel returns over time and act overhang the 
multiple the near term 
the consensus view that parcel not very competitive 
the mains reasons are because there are very few players both the domestic and international markets 
very asset heavy business that requires significant investment the key successful parcel business 
scale and that requires building vast network and likely going very difficult for new player 
come and build operation anywhere close the size ups and fdx quickly this has allowed the legacy

see increased scope for competition ecommerce the insourcing and

ecommerce presents strong opportunity for parcel volume growth but looming competition appears 
threaten how much the upside would flow through the legacy parcel giants ups and fdx while 
competition the entrenched players has been talked about for years particularly the failed attempts 
international entrants and subscale local players the newest threats appear real

legacy parcel companies while recent headlines have largely focused amazon they are not alone this 
endeavor 
what amazon delivery 
amazon has historically been asset light thus far amazon has primarily approached its delivery business 
via asset light model where effectively becomes third party logistics company that contracts local 
shippers couriers for last mile delivery 
but moving toward asset heavy that said recently amzn has been making some asset heavy 
delivery investments these include 
building sortation centers handle last mile shipping high volume areas and support prime now 
same day delivery

morgan stanley research 
the purchasing thousands trailers that could used for extra storage could also attached 
outsourced tractors for transportation between fulfillment and sortation centers 
the reported leasing cargo planes 
drone investments for next generation delivery 
media reports indicating amazon has begun assembling high level executive team develop its own 
transportation network including running its own contracted air freight operation 
amzn offering flex contract drivers the opportunity switch handling standard amzn packages 
previously being limited delivering only prime now orders 
reading into amazon transportation tea leaves the outset note that amazon asset heavy 
logistics efforts are relatively small early stage and that some these initiatives may indeed just

first don see the aws for delivery coming 
amazon made comments about its recent transportation investments its earnings conference call 
cfo brian olsavsky said that amazon needed add more our own logistics supplement our existing 
partners that not meant replace them while amazon may change course may withholding its 
true intentions until later date our view this combined with heavy hiring and investment potential 
difficulty getting retailers trust and use amazon for transportation and enough existing challenges with their 
own volumes recall the fba and shipping issues from makes scenario the least likely for now 
acknowledge amzn does not shy away from investment but building new transportation network may too 
large even for amzn consider the hiring needed ups has drivers roughly equivalent 
amzn total employee work force and ups only delivers portion amzn packages 
with fedex usps and other third party carriers also helping delivery very labor and equipment intensive 
drivers sorters trucks docks etc for now take amzn management its word and not believe the 
company intends build fully competitive delivery network that would likely require grow its 
work force tens thousands 
also don believe scenario wherein amazon would build transportation network entirely 
replace the existing players and deliver all its own packages there value the existing infrastructure and 
manpower place more importantly don think amazon has the delivery volumes route density 
make the mathematics work consider that amazon spent shipping ship

which leaves with scenario these shipping dynamics lead lean toward scenario for now 
see amazon providing support high delivery density areas periods and slowly moving more delivery 
house over time many ways think these investments rising prime customer acquisition costs for 
amazon continue provide frictionless and satisfied customer experience continues scaling and 
accelerating 
prime membership urban areas creates opportunities for house delivery work while 
amzn shipping investments are still their infancy notable that there are times when house delivery 
makes financial sense because while amzn average delivery density may not high enough across its entire 
customer base believe there are likely cases densely populated metro areas and areas with high 
numbers prime subscribers which likely overlap here amazon has enough order velocity 
perform its own shipping economically what pays through the parcel carriers 
indeed our industry conversations indicate that some cases amzn already making 
residential delivery volumes metropolitan residential areas which the high end packages 
would imply packages per driver per day 
this really all predicated higher ordering velocity amazon prime subscriber secret 
but believe amazon prime members spend more than non prime members just look your own amazon 
order history more spending means more packages and deliveries and believe the free delivery associated 
with prime likely causes prime members make more individual item orders which means even more 
frequent deliveries 
mentioned above estimate that amazon average active buyers ordered packages 
each roughly order every weeks but this overall global average and prime members are likely 
materially higher consider that our alphawise data show that prime members are anywhere from 
more likely spend over per year compared all amzn shoppers this combined with the 
likely lower average order size from the convenience prime free shipping our view speaks how not 
unreasonable assume that prime members purchase materially more packages than non prime members

prime members order more frequently per month metropolitan areas which arguably may not stretch

market note however that international domestic only small part ups fdx today

ecommerce itself makes large part parcel revenues appears amzn may relatively small part revenues this morgan stanley estimate neither ups nor fdx disclose revenue customer apart 
from saying single customer accounts for more than revenues amzn were only service its 
own prime customers scenario above this would about hit revenues the legacy parcels 
though taking away the most dense prime business could ruin economics for the rest the amzn business 
amzn were take all its business house network scenario above would revenue hit 
hit the business which could further erode already poor unit economics for the rest 
the business and constrain overall top line growth the parcels cannot count the ecommerce 
business amzn share customer the bigger threat however may the other end the 
ecommerce spectrum

the biggest threat parcels 
while the ecommerce giants look save money and boost service taking selectively business house 
small fragmented retailers are looking startups local operators provide the same level service the 
giants but lower cost than the legacy parcels this means small business opportunity even the 
large national big box retailers are looking local distribution part move omni channel retailing

omni channel retailing refers the concept 
customers being less likely walk into store and 
make the purchase transaction end end physical 
experience instead customers may more likely 
conduct their purchases through other means like the 
phone internet mobile and many cases mix 
different experiences within the same transaction for 
example buy online and pickup store walk into 
store try product and buy mobile this means 
retail chains need prepared service the 
customer through all modes contact and also 
size optimize their distribution able get the 
product the customer soon possible

efficient way this use each retail location 
distribution center and service online mobile 
transactions from the nearest retail location the customer rather than higher level central warehouse this 
gets the product the customer quicker while allowing the store retain the transaction the ceo target 
brian cornell recently said interview with the chicago tribune think about omni channel about 
fulfilling this demand shopping experience recognize that most our guests today shop stores but 
also know particularly the consumer moves back into urban centers happening chicago and 
around the going need have flexible formats and give guests chance shop online but 
opposed having package delivered your front door when you work and missing the delivery 
offer the convenience ordering online and coming one our conveniently located stores pick 
when they want using our stores flexible fulfillment centers are also seeing examples 
retailers going one step further and using delivery services for last mile get the product the customers 
door for truly out the store experience this can done using number local delivery services well 
startup companies that specialize local parcel delivery 
beating back the amazon threat the two main reasons for the rise omni channel retail are the 
customer asking for with the rise ecommerce more consumers are shopping outside stores more 
than ever before this trend only likely accelerate amzn may the only entity that able 
service the customer ask today traditional retail chains need able replicate amzn reach and 
service level risk continuing lose share the tailer the retail giants like macy and best buy probably 
cannot reasonably build logistics network the scale ups fdx even potential amzn their only likely 
options this point would join their competitors try and create new logistics model that can 
effectively leverage their brick and mortar footprint but provides equally good better shopping experience

thoughts omni channel from simeon gutman morgan stanley retail hardlines 
analyst implication for retailers 
retailers are feverishly working optimize their supply chains and fulfillment options for consumers 
they are looking leverage their traditional distribution centers store bases and internet only 
fulfillment centers 
omni channel retail world how order gets fulfilled will ultimately dictated the customer 
thus retailers need equip themselves for whatever form fulfillment the customer wants still 
utilizing their existing assets retailers are gradually reducing fulfillment costs and last mile expenses 
over time this can help their positioning vis vis the shipping companies 
pick from store retailer best option from cost and convenience perspective consumers value 
convenient store for returns recourse and advice the better equipped store providing these 
functions the easier and less costly for retailers this too should give them leverage over time 
the narrative last mile fulfillment still being written and could see big changes here over time 
consider the auto parts retail segment which highly localized product already sitting markets 
stores and warehouses across the country and the companies are already providing last mile delivery 
auto repair facilities given the density their customer base providing last mile delivery cost 
effective service that been embedded the financial models for years often wonder why other 
retailers can begin offer similar services our math costs auto parts retailers less than half 
traditional rates per delivery

for their last mile delivery revenue share such calculated that the parcel carriers earn aggregated 
deliver commerce packages this could turn into revenue opportunities for the crowdsourced 
messengers note that last mile threat could put play the part the current business that 
doesn ecommerce giants which estimate also note that amzn were open 
its network other retailers aws type scenario scenario above this could dovetail with 
the last mile threat and become much revenue headwind the parcels 
how much technology lead the legacy parcels have the legacy parcels especially ups indeed 
have high tech platforms and wide networks but think these may not very high barriers for three reasons 
insourcing ecommerce giants can build scale quickly amazon the largest online retailer the 
country shipping billion units year million customers worldwide which pay per year 
prime members scale not issue for them while amazon may probably never able get their 
delivery costs down usps even ups fdx levels the rural hinterland dense urban areas could 
accessible break even better economics

the entire point insourcing and crowdsourcing packaging logistics enable delivery 
local level that eliminates the need for big high tech national network the ecommerce giants are not 
trying build another ups fdx that may virtually impossible instead they are looking get their goods 
from their warehouse seller the customer quickly and cheaply possible which means trying minimize 
the distance between those two end points the chain this means building the best local regional not 
national network 
lot the technology may not very hard replicate take orion for instance ups proprietary 
system that uses algorithms take much the decision making out the hands the driver and provides the 
driver with the most efficient route and truck loading system orion tells the driver the most efficient route 
take for given delivery load maximize efficiency and minimize downtime idling time while the orion 
system indeed impressive believe any large connected network vehicles that rely crowdsourcing 
information fleet third party owned ride sharing cars apple google taxis for instance should able 
replicate many the features orion add the fact that some ridesharing companies are reported 
developing their own mapping system with high level local detail for its autonomous vehicle fleet 
surprisingly feature that orion does not appear have believe ride sharing companies may end 
with system more detailed and intelligent than orion with relatively little effort ups also resorting 
package bundling increase density for delivery something amazon already does with great efficiency 
longer term structural threats also abound the volume growth have seen the last 
years has come despite increasing digitization and miniaturization whether from physical cds replaced 
virtual files and the same happening documents photos and virtually all media even physical 
items reducing size the size and weight packages not going going forward this trend likely 
continue with added level risk from printing the legacy parcels have sought tackle this moving 
dimweight pricing which considers both the size and weight the parcel but they cannot contest customer 
who chooses stream movie online instead buying physical dvd 
but wait isn this all zero sum game between and 
anticipate some pushback here does matter the legacy parcels lose the last mile startups omnichannel after all even the case omni channel retail the incremental item being purchased needs get 
the store the first place long consumer spending the case could made that the parcels 
should fine fact given the poor economics last mile can good for the parcels give last mile 
favor ecommerce business the issue that lot that distribution does not through the 
parcel companies business but largely through private truck fleets belonging the large retailers 
ltl carriers including ups fdx freight businesses this means omni channel world the wealth 
created growing ecommerce delivery would likely shifted from the parcels the ltl carriers 
retained the retailer using private truck fleet 
the dark horse usps 
while the parcels may have prepare for challenges both ends the spectrum they have 
freight transportation february 
morgan stanley research 
while already competing against relatively powerful incumbent the united states postal service 
see the postal service usps real competitor the market one that has lower unit delivery 
costs than either ups fdx while usps service may not good ups fdx the government operated 
network can still affect the parcel market pricing with occasional aggressive moves for example september 
cut for some parcel shipments while there are efforts get congress improve financial 
transparency usps this may take time deliver the meanwhile usps continues remain competitive 
and making investments its network 
where could wrong entirely possible that are being too negative our assessment 
competitive developments possible that ecommerce entrants may not able compete 
delivery either low high density which could cede the economics this fast growing end 
market permanently the parcel companies there could also conceivably scenario like the 
theory outlined earlier where the build out house ecommerce logistics networks well 
last mile startup competitors only serves offset inefficiencies the current system 
especially around peak season and the industry finds the perfect equilibrium cost and service 
this would beneficial the legacy parcels terms their ability balance growth and returns 
the business however barring the scenario where industry finds its perfect equilibrium new 
entrants could mean competitive headwinds for legacy parcels 
freight transportation february 
morgan stanley research 
debate how can the legacy parcels fight back 
consensus view consensus sees little long term risk the parcels and thus little need for them reinvent 
our view the parcels take the competitive threat seriously while the parcels are responding with operational 
adjustments today like last mile partnerships bundling packages increase density their longer term success 
could depend their ability either crowd the competition out the market early focus higher quality 
business 
the environment that outline debate will not happen overnight and will 
likely take least few years play out 
note that our conversations with both ups and fdx both management teams recognize and 
acknowledge the changes the ecommerce space and are not dismissive its impact their business they 
deserve credit for this and would wrong count out their ability adapt respond also important 
note that change already underway while may the second third inning ecommerce 
revolution the parcel space are also the first inning competitive response from the legacy parcels 
this challenge the response today arguably aimed improving the unit economics and quality service 
the business rather than trying head off amazon from building its own network taking ridesharing 
companies this effort needed because unit economics for are lower than today with taking 
growing share volumes believe the legacy parcels would need improve economics prevent 
mix erosion 
the legacy parcels are using three main strategies improve competitiveness new entrants and improve 
their own productivity 
technology initiatives improve service the best outcome for the legacy parcels provide higher 
level service that will hopefully result higher prices and share ups orion system and mychoice 
together with fedex delivery manager and rewards programs seek just that these systems allow the 
parcels maximize delivery efficiency while also giving the customers maximum flexibility with their delivery 
options 
teaming with usps and local players for last 
mile delivery given the tough economics last mile 
delivery the legacy parcels have teamed with usps 
share the burden ups surepost and fdx 
smartpost both use their respective networks for 
sortation and linehaul but rely usps take the 
parcel the customer door this win win for both 
parties allows the parcels retain the economies 
scale and operating efficiency business and 
gives the struggling usps more delivery volumes 
network that servicing anyway however ups fdx 
also have the technology ensure that 
surepost smartpost package can more cost 
effectively delivered via their own network another 
delivery scheduled for the same nearby address 
they can dynamically route the package 
exhibit fdx smartpost and ups surepost 
model 
rce rgan stan ley research 
bundling packages increase density 
attempt close the gap number packages per delivery between and ups has started initiative 
bundle packages being delivered the same address from multiple sources this done speeding 
freight transportation february 
morgan stanley research 
even slightly delaying deliveries that may going the same address within certain window time try 
and improve density and per package economics 
these techniques might help boost the economics but each has its own disadvantages 
noted debate the technology initiatives are not rocket science think most retail giants even 
startups with the ability crowdsource data should able close the technology gap the legacy peers 
relatively quickly 
moving away from last mile delivery curious strategy represents the secret sauce the legacy parcels 
our view ups and fdx each have delivery trucks and ups has invested several years and significant 
resources the orion system given these dynamics would they really want hand the package over the 
usps for final delivery also revenue per package could lower given the usps connection 
the bundling strategy probably works well for power users but the carriers have careful avoid service 
issues 
the fork the road where next from here 
believe the legacy parcels are faced with fundamental problem ecommerce and will likely continue 
represent the bulk their growth but will also likely get significantly more competitive eroding already poor 
unit economics not believe the legacy parcels can continue the current path should provide the 
best service and get paid for it believe fundamental inflection strategy required deliver the returns 
that they have historically delivered and investors have now come expect them thereby justifying their 
trading multiple 
believe makes sense for fdx ups adopt one two approaches 
the scenario take share slashing pricing and crowd out new competitors 
the scenario cede share new competitors but pull back focus premium profitable business 
path the scenario 
deploying price weapon one way crowd out competitors would make the business 
challenging for them possible ups fdx would likely claim that what they are doing today using 
technology and service but not think this sufficient believe the legacy parcels success 
dissuading commerce giants from vertically integrating while keeping new startups out the 
market and usps bay will come down one thing price with this approach believe they would 
need cut price aggressively try and take market share 
advantages this approach ups fdx have the scale this while argue that the parcel 
business more competitive than seems for industry where two players have nearly the market 
that scale gives them the ability play the pricing game and win ups particular with its operating 
margin net leverage and roic has enough room its operating metrics pull off pricing strategy 
that the government run usps smaller startups may not have the financial wherewithal match given the 
investment required build out house logistics network the legacy parcels can present enticing 
package economics the ecommerce giants may hard pressed justify investments building out their 
own system 
successful they could build competitive beach head especially ups this tactic works the 
legacy parcels should able generate quicker revenue growth and buy themselves some breathing room 
improve returns over time ups early lead the ground game should give particularly strong hand 
disadvantages this approach this would probably erode the parcels premium operating metrics 
while revenue growth should accelerate this would come cost most other operating metrics including 
freight transportation february 
morgan stanley research 
margin pricing and cash flow would see erosion these metrics close toward freight transportation average 
investors would likely derate parcel multiples toward the average well keep mind that the nature 
dilutive operating metrics anyway this also assumes that aggressive growth doesn detract from 
growth the business either from strategic operational resource allocation perspective however 
believe this approach better than keeping the status quo where the constant overhang competition could 
erode the multiple much lower levels anyway 
they will have continue investments capacity keep with volumes this could further 
erode returns the legacy parcels already struggle keep with peak period volumes and the need handle 
higher volumes and likely peakier peaks 
not clear that this strategy can sustainable unclear the legacy parcels can sustainably reduce 
their price level that will keep amazon and others bay mostly because don have economics from 
the ecommerce players our assumed math last mile economics even remotely correct ups fdx would 
have dramatically cut price remain competitive 
path the scenario 
what this involves the opposite approach could focus growing and maximizing the part the 
business while stopping the chase this would involve only focusing the most profitable parts the 
business and effectively exiting ecommerce the economics are not meaningful while primarily investing 
the business 
advantages this approach 
operating metrics would improve would probably the multiple given the superior economics 
the business operating income could equal higher than the current approach even the legacy 
parcels were give large chunk ecommerce revenues given the higher barriers entry and higher 
returns the market would likely reward the parcels with higher valuation well 
the legacy parcels could give the shippers chance try alternatives like insourcing using 
local players hope the shippers don succeed and come back them the parcels default pushback 
the threat ecommerce insourcing new startup competitors state that the business package delivery 
rather complex and building network with the scope and efficiency their own nearly impossible 
replicate this may true and there probably better way prove that than see the 
competitors customers try build their networks and fail the legacy parcels are likely have significantly 
higher pricing power and operating flexibility when these customers return this scenario 
ups fdx can play their strengths while the legacy parcels may deploying new tools improve the 
business despite facing growing competition they run strong stable businesses giving would 
allow them focus doing what they best 
disadvantages this approach 
growth would restricted with ecommerce driving over domestic volume growth the 
parcels least ups the past decade and with that contribution expected rise the coming years will 
take some forward looking vision effectively abandon this segment and settle into slower normalized 
growth rate 
allowing your customer leave hoping they will come back obviously risky strategy the 
approach may allow the parcel customers competitors try and make their own and hope they don 
succeed but allowing customers walk away and try alternative vendors models could risky approach 
focusing could lead increased competition with the ltls this double edged sword 
the parcels can benefit from ltl technology gains see our separate trucking note however the ltl space 
not exactly seen blue chip investors and ltl stocks trade significant discount the parcels today
