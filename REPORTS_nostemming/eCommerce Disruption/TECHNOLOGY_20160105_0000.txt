growth cash card and ecommerce mean electronic payments structural 
growth market however believe processing its most basic will 
commoditise order avoid this commoditisation believe scale 
platform and innovation are key ideally payments companies will combine 
modern scale platform with high levels innovation they become partners 
pure processors companies with scale and modern platforms will able 
process lower cost and gain volumes they can add innovation this 
mix they will able deliver more services their merchants this will 
make them stickier and able command higher pricing

attractive growth higher however think pure processors need 
work harder add value managing risk improving acceptance rates 
opening more markets payment methods etc traditionally have 
differentiated between pure processors psps and acquirers who take the 
risk that merchant will not deliver the goods services however think 
this too simplistic vendor only covering one level functionality will 
struggle our view and all vendors need expand the services they offer 
prefer acquirers psps but the holy grail acquirer that can also 
solve the complexity online payments payment partner other words

has room improve our innovation theme drive more value for its 
merchants also like wirecard for its high level online exposure 
integrated model and several major innovative initiatives that should see 
become more payment partner paysafe our other higher risk 
but potentially higher reward play think the market applying 
outsize discount for the risks the company taking believe the company 
can narrow this gap over time 
where see more balanced for now elsewhere are neutral 
worldline and ingenico worldline see structurally lower growth and 
lower pure payments revenues and believe the current discount the

wirecard fast growth but concerns cash flow 
why overweight 
view wirecard leader the fast growing online payment space view the integrated 
acquirer processor model one the most sustainable models the sector long term given its repeating 
transaction based nature and vertically integrated approach wirecard has outgrown the broader commerce 
market for the last several years accelerating low organic growth the first nine months 
through combination outright share gains cross selling and acquisitions higher growth markets 
expect this continue 
are also positive wirecard for the innovations that the company has introduced for customers real time 
and settlement services checkout portal for customers wire transfers and mobile payment platforms 
initiatives are focused omnichannel priority for merchants and while not all these will succeed 
think they position wirecard more payment partner than commodity play recognise market 
concerns cash flow but believe that these can addressed with improved disclosure where management 
shows increasing focus with upside our initiate with 
key debate how sustainable growth faster than the market 
our view think the market habitually 
underprices long term high growth assets with 
high levels recurring revenue think there 
scope for wirecard continue growing faster 
than the broader commerce market through 
combination share gains cross selling and 
integrating acquisitions high growth markets 
wirecard should more than warrant its high 
multiple assuming can convert revenue growth 
cash conversion 
market view think the shares are pricing 
revenue growth out assuming 
cash conversion the adjusted rate this 
would broadly line with the european ecommerce market sell side estimates are higher 
though the market appears discount these 
the outer years the dcf 
impact valuation think each point added short and long term volume growth has 
impact fair value assuming longer term cash conversion wirecard management guides 
for outperformance typical european commerce market growth through combination 
the factors highlight above view this feasible and even conservative relative recent 
growth think with this level revenue growth our forecast operating leverage 
should achievable for business with limited incremental transaction cost the impact margin 
value our for every percentage point net revenue gross revenue our bull 
case fair value reflects longer continuation growth the level reached the first nine months 
and growth remaining over the medium term our bear case reflects growth line

key debate has wirecard strategy added value 
our view believe wirecard acquisitions fast growing emerging markets with focus 
omnichannel services are the sweet spot and 
faster growth should vindicate the high multiples 
paid the strategy still work progress 
some extent but has been consistent believe 
acquisitions have contributed around 
ebitda less than the group total for acquisition spend 
market view the bull view that higher 
emerging market exposure should kicker 
growth sustaining revenue growth above for 
the foreseeable future however there some 
skepticism from investors around the 
diversification into lower margin services 
risky markets 
impact valuation forecast wirecard organic revenue growth over while 
this would substantial outperformance the european commerce market growing low mid teens 
our estimates believe this should achievable even without major contribution from 
acquisitions the next years from market share gains and cross selling acquiring services our 
fair value does not include major contribution from acquisitions our view though clearly these will 
ultimately play part whether revenue growth above can sustained and whether the business 
shows operating leverage longer term 
key debate how justified are market concerns cash flow 
our view have spent significant time with 
management discussing market concerns cash 
flow principal view wirecard different 
from other acquiring businesses presenting 
cash flow excluding transitory balances though 
believe some elements disclosure could 
improve some lag ifrs cash conversion 
reflects investments new businesses and 
capitalisation while this needs 
monitoring are broadly comfortable with the 
cash profile the business 
market view bears have focused the 
discrepancy between ifrs and adjusted cash flow 
excluding transitory acquiring balances and 
complex structures around acquisitions there has 
also been focus the economics third party 
acquiring arrangements bin sponsorship 
markets where wirecard cannot operate 
banking counterparty 
impact valuation the difference between adjusted and ifrs cash conversion has been meaningful 
between around adjusted basis and ifrs basis think much these 
explained transitory amounts and third party acquiring business where wirecard required 
place prudential capital with third party banks believe disclosure around transitory items could 
improve but see management methodology fundamentally sound reflect company adjusted 
rates cash conversion our base case ifrs rates our bear case continue monitor both

paysafe high risk high reward 
why overweight 
think paysafe recent acquisitions have significantly improved its revenue mix like paysafe growing 
exposure wallets and prepaid they are higher margin higher barrier entry businesses than 
processing also view the declining proportion revenue coming from the high risk asia gateway service 
catalyst for potentially substantial rating however the negative side paysafe remains high risk 
payment service provider which heavily reliant online gambling and exposed the associated 
regulatory risks using wacc mid term topline growth and terminal growth rate 
arrive our base case per share upside the current share price paysafe currently trades 
sbc and fcfe yield which and discount its european 
payments peers and respectively after the acquisition skrill believe the size this 
discount longer justified given the highest risk elements paysafe operations have been significantly 
diluted and fcf growth expected faster therefore see significant upside and position paysafe 
overweight within our payment software coverage 
key debates summary 
key debate how would paysafe look without the asia gateway service 
our view the asia gateway service represents 
the outsourcing processing chinese online 
gambling payments party given that 
online gambling largely prohibited china this 
activity has substantial risks attached with the 
potential for the loss all asia gateway revenues 
due the acquisitions the share revenue 
coming from the asia gateway service has come 
down and will represent under 
consolidated group revenue our view 
the market yet fully price paysafe lower 
risk profile after the dilution the asia gateway 
market view the market appears 
attaching negative multiple the asia gateway 
business due the high financial and reputational 
risks associated with assume the paysafe 
business excluding the asia gateway would trade 
the sector average ebitda multiple 
estimate the asia gateway being valued ebitda 
impact valuation incorporate the loss the asia gateway service into our bear case 
model this regulatory crackdown china leading additional headwind growth 
and which equates the loss the full revenue stream our base case think 
would reasonable for the asia gateway service valued positive low single digit ebitda 
compared the negative multiple currently implied

key debate what the potential growth profile the combined group 
our view expect double digit growth will 
continue each division albeit slower pace 
stored value the increasing penetration ewallets payment medium and the acquisition 
the skrill wallet should drive increasing 
volumes and reduce pricing pressure stp 
expect volume growth line with the global 
ecommerce market with headwinds coming from 
the expected flatlining asia gateway revenue 
and pressure take rates prepaid see 
strong growth new markets and increasing 
penetration but with overall growth slowing the 
low teens mature markets represent 
increasing proportion revenue key factor 
across all three will the growth the online 
gambling market which expect 
annually the longer term whether paysafe can 
achieve scale outside its core verticals 
gaming gambling will important factor 
market view consensus estimates see growth 
slowing the high single digits one 
thing this may imply that the market expects 
paysafe products stop taking share online 
gambling and gaming transactions may also 
reflect lower expectations for online gambling 
growth and global ecommerce growth 
impact valuation overall expect the increasing share transactions going via wallets mid 
teens ecommerce market growth and online gambling growth drive double digit topline 
growth the medium term our base case our bear case incorporate the 
possibility significantly lower growth under the mid term which also removes the margin 
improvement from greater operating leverage seen our base case 
key debate can high take rates and fees sustained 
our view payment processing increasingly 
becoming commodity business with declining 
gross take rates but with pockets value still 
found niche markets and cross selling 
higher value services contrast prepaid cards 
experience less competition that conventional 
payment methods merchant fees and have 
scope negotiate down distribution costs 
volumes increase across the group paysafe high 
take rates are large part symptom taking 
higher risk therefore paysafe can continue 
manage this risk successfully should able 
maintain pricing power its niche markets 
market view paysafe high take rates are 
mainly viewed compensation for taking 
higher merchant regulatory and consumer risks 
however across the wider industry pressure 
gross take rates expected continue and 
paysafe unlikely entirely immune from 
this 
impact valuation the stp business expect the declining share revenue from the high take 
rate asia gateway service and increasing competition create annual decline stp take rates 
this represents annual headwind stp revenues our base case contrast our bull 
case not see declining take rates with asia gateway service maintaining its current 
proportion the stp revenue mix 
technology payments january 
morgan stanley research 
key debate can paysafe diversify out gambling and gaming 
our view paysafe wallets are the dominant 
players the online gambling stored value 
market given the relatively low penetration 
online gambling globally and the potential for 
further regulation key markets this should put 
paysafe good position the medium term 
however gambling both one the slower 
growing online verticals and one the higher risk 
therefore the long term double digit revenue 
growth likely rely achieving scale outside 
the gambling market particularly 
ecommerce the long term prepaid 
paysafecards face similar questions but more 
relation expanding the merchant network and 
turn the addressable customer base outside 
gambling and gaming overall think 
diversification would help facilitate higher growth 
and lower the groups risk profile however are 
sceptical how successful paysafe current 
prepaid and stored value products can outside 
their niche verticals 
market view relatively low consensus growth 
forecasts and high discount peers suggests 
the market currently sees little chance that paysafe 
will transition into successful conventional 
ecommerce player 
impact valuation our base case see paysafe wallet and prepaid businesses 
starting converge the overall online gambling market growth rate paysafe 
successfully transitions into new verticals could sustain mid teens growth rates for much longer 
period however are sceptical paysafe chance success and even our bull case 
not incorporate significant additional growth from expanding the wallet and paysafecards into 
new markets

worldline jack all payment processes 
why equal weight 
like worldline exposure the transactional merchant acquiring both online offline they expose the 
company structurally growing areas the payments landscape however the company exposure the 
more lumpy project based mobility etransactional services together with softer areas the payments 
landscape such terminals and white label cards obscure these otherwise strong growth trends additionally 
these areas expose the company structurally lower profitability than pure payment processing using 
wacc mid term topline growth and terminal growth rate arrive our base case

key debate payment transformation opportunity threat 
our view the most successful payment 
providers need combine the best elements 
technology leaders with the security scale 
processor the main disruption have seen 
date has come from technology led companies 
offering innovation where incumbents have been 
slow however even here the disruption 
has been limited not believe these tech 
led companies have been able add scale 
processing the innovation believe worldline 
has broadly been able keep with innovation 
the payments universe adding functionality 
and compatibility where required however given 
the high exposure pure processing based 
services acquiring merchant relationship 
there often less opportunity showcase 
this innovation differentiator 
market view given aggregate valuation 
payments point premium the market 
believe the market broadly appreciates the 
resiliency the current payments infrastructure 
however still see lot confusion the 
actual impact payment innovation such apple 
pay where often distinction needs made 
what simply front end innovation and what 
actually changing the back end infrastructure 
impact valuation across the payments coverage see the disruption the party payments 
model highly unlikely additionally highlight the worldline project based mobility 
business that should relatively immune payments disruption for the acquiring business 
believe worldline broadly has the assets place maintain the relationships and continue add value 
without risk disruption commoditisation this leaves the pure processing businesses where 
believe there less opportunity showcase innovation the customer bank who only wants the 
pure processing capability the merchant who may require additional services partnering here 
believe there little the company can other than add scale offset the pricing pressure our bear 
case per share showcase the effects accelerated commoditisation and pricing pressure 
our base case per share 
key debate how realistic are the equens synergy targets

unique dynamic the shared interest between 
equens and worldline deliver the synergies 
coupled with the majority synergies being

introduction the payments market 
complex and fast moving market 
the nature the payments market drives very solid business models our view structural growth 
cash moves card highly recurring revenues the past merchants may have seen acquiring 
processing utility service simply mechanism take card payments store the rapid growth 
online ecommerce mobile payments and new alternative payment methods driving significant 
change merchants are faced with increasing complexity they try manage these changes believe 
that merchants which can make the payment process easy for consumers maintain high acceptance 
rates and low fraud and use analytics their advantage will gain competitive advantage the new 
world result payments providers need technology leaders well reliable processors 
key points 
payments business models highly attractive our view high recurring revenues 
structural growth relatively high barriers entry 
payment complexity rising rapidly the market has evolved from simply processing 
store card payments integrating online payments with offline accepting 
growing number alternative payment methods keeping high click through rates 
with consumers and high acceptance rates with card schemes issuers 
merchants need manage the complexity thrive believe merchants are 
struggling cope with the increasing complexity and looking payments much 
more strategically than the past 
payment providers that can partner with merchants help them transition will the 
winners our view believe the payments winners will combine technology 
leadership with best class processing 
the key roles the payments market 
the structure the payments market varies across countries types transaction and payment mediums 
however all payments markets will incorporate some all the following key functions 
merchant acquirer deals with clearing settlement and reconciliation transaction proceeds 
between merchants issuing banks and card networks primary role providing acceptance 
services merchants and accepts the risk that the merchant will remain solvent 
merchant processor provides authorization data transmission data security settlement and 
connectivity payment networks outsourced service for the majority offline 
transactions acquirers and processors are the same entity for online business processors 
have evolved separately from acquiring 
card issuers typically banks marketing card based products consumers generating 
transaction fees interchange nuisance fees late fees and net interest margin 
card association payment networks connect and switch transactions between acquiring 
and issuing banks enable electronic payment authorization clearing and settlement

payment market growth and dynamics 
key drivers 
the payments market undergoing number structural changes which are shaping the competitive 
environment 
structural shift electronic payments there are numerous drivers behind the growth electronic 
payments market these include migration from cash payments card payments the retail environment 
well broader growth ecommerce addition the market underlying structural growth the provision 
value added merchant services present another opportunity for processors and acquirers grow revenues 
these include analytics products that allow merchants benchmark their acceptance rates online and offline 
and conversion rates online versus peers and omnichannel services that allow merchants manage 
payments and refunds across online and offline channels 
growing complexity transaction and technology the role the acquirer becoming more pivotal 
the payments landscape believe increasingly merchants are expected handle wider variety payment 
types than ever before these include wide range national card schemes china unionpay well 
alternative payment types paypal alipay etc both online and offline environments these come alongside 
greater number customers seeking transact internationally remotely using mobile device 
from the merchant side this means that the process ensuring particular transaction not fraudulent while 
maintaining high acceptance rate and not turning away business unnecessarily has become increasingly 
fraught furthermore there increasing expectation the part consumers that they will able 
undertake different parts the same transaction purchase returns refunds across different channels this 
presents logistical and financial complexity and must managed alongside increasing regulatory complexity 
across multiple markets 
the rise alternative payment methods wallets mobile and other bank transactions are experiencing 
rapid growth and are expected make payments from expect ewallets such paysafe neteller service make the majority the growth alternative payments 
new technology and the potential for disruption over the last years there has been growing focus

minds and online payment providers have sought innovate and disrupt traditional payments players the

data capture and transmission from the merchant terminal the point sale pos also involves fraud 
protection and monitoring the acquiring function largely relates clearing and settlement payment and 
management chargebacks this stems largely from the historical origin many acquirers within banks 
which needed develop systems handle card payments 
the online model has traditionally been more fragmented between processing and acquiring payment service 
providers psps online payment gateways have managed data capture and transmission while banks and 
other bank like acquirers have performed the acquiring function however see this model evolving the 
psp market commoditises and the pure processors look add acquiring and other value added services 
protect their pricing and margins there small but growing number acquirers consolidate both 
functions 
the exhibit below illustrates the economics the traditional payments value chain which summarise 
follows for offline transactions 
merchant rings transaction for 
acquirer captures details the transaction merchant details card details transaction value and 
runs fraud checks 
acquirer requests the transaction amount from the issuing bank via the card network 
issuer debits consumer account the value the goods and remits the value less
