labor market japan recent years the number working women this age bracket 
has been the rise and growing proportion are working full time japan working 
hours full time employees are generally longer than those part time temporary 
workers seems likely that women their and will have fewer leisure 
hours than the past and that the need for online shopping convenience will continue
