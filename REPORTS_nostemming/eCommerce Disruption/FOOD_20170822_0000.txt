alphawise survey shows people have tried online 
grocery mostly driven grocers websites however physical 
stores still matter food retail underscoring amzn logic 
behind wfm omni channel becomes the norm investments 
likely pressure margins for brick and mortar grocers 
brandon hoffman 
people have tried online grocery mostly through traditional 
grocers websites our latest alphawise data show that people have 
ordered groceries online least once the last months adoption date has 
been driven more traditional grocers websites people than thirdparty platforms people likely part due the online only players 
more limited footprints note that these adoption figures don capture 
frequency share wallet which believe materially lower low single 
digit overall category penetration 
why amzn attempting acquire wfm brick and mortar matters 
grocery amazonfresh the leading online only player with adoption but 
that still relatively modest that said our survey speaks the rationale for 
amzn proposed acquisition wfm people who don buy 
groceries online say they prefer see and physically choose the items such 
wfm store footprint with the population within miles wfm 
likely accelerate amzn grocery gains the fact that say prices being 
too high holds them back from shopping wfm further speaks amzn 
opportunity reduce prices and drive grocery market share 
within food retail ecommerce expansion could pressure margins for brick and 
mortar operators just industry sales online grocery penetration 
remains low however expect the segment grow with food retailers 
increasingly focusing the online channel light amazon whole foods 
consumer resistance online grocery decreasing with consumers very 
unlikely purchase food online down from two years ago detailed 
where food retail stocks from here the combination price 
competition and omni channel investments likely pressures margins across the 
sector while see kroger best positioned our coverage with its pickup store infrastructure margin headwinds keep overall with 
consumers average shopping stores for their grocery needs continue 
see place for both brick and mortar and online operators within the food

food retailers opportunities and risks 
despite barriers expect the online segment grow from the current 
industry sales with potential acceleration spurred amzn wfm online grocery 
does face barriers convenient store locations and sensory purchasing experience can 
limit the attractiveness online grocery consumers and the mix perishable high 
weight and low dollar value items can limit profitability for delivery operators despite 
these barriers believe amazon whole foods could the first entity with the right 
combination brand strength and operational capacity meaningfully grow online 
grocery sales over time incumbent retailers will likely increase their omni channel 
capabilities way mitigate the amazon threat such while off low base 
now see greater potential for ramp overall grocery ecommerce growth

see food retail winner take all industry shown exhibit average 
consumers shop stores for their grocery needs believe this generally consists 
mix conventional specialty discount and club mass retailers only 
consumers report doing all their grocery shopping just single store down from
