flipkart acquired myntra may and jabong total

our view amazon likely entering the right time that said 
several hurdles exist success india 
first amazon does not have first mover advantage and 
chasing the top two players who have conditioned the market 
expect aggressive promotions drive growth outside 
india consumers who have traveled lived abroad amazon 
lacks brand equity that could position pass leaders 
second even more than china mom and pop shops 
rather than national global brands dominate consumer 
spend fact modern retail accounts for only the 
market india and only the top cities this 
creates much more fragmented market that likely move 
online slower than mature markets like the where 
strong retail brands exist third customers expect free 
shipping despite delivery costs that can run around 
sales flipkart via partner ekart invested last mile delivery 
that potentially gives edge outside the largest cities 
where infrastructure investments lag adding aggressive 
promotions and high shipping costs believe margin 
potential india lags other markets despite the dominance 
marketplaces which typically carries higher margins 
our view emerging ecommerce markets such china 
and india are more likely start strong markets but 
over time shift balanced market online buyers 
become more savvy and look for benefits including 
faster shipping while this trend stands benefit amazon 
markets like europe may difficult model translate
