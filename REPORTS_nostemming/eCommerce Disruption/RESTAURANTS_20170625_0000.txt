what you need know from this report 
what did five key takeaways from our alphawise survey 
april conjunction with morgan stanley alphawise conducted the second wave the online survey nearly 
consumers including respondents who had dined out restaurant and who had food delivered 
the past months the sample representative the population terms age gender and region the margin error 
the total sample confidence level asked consumers about their preferences with regard delivery 
general well about their specific experiences and preferences with respect certain restaurant brands and food 
delivery aggregators services where applicable findings are compared the survey 
from our findings highlight five the most important takeaways below 
more consumers have reported ordering food for delivery the past six months this year versus last versus 
share orders placed online through delivery service website app versus last year 
awareness and usage trended across all food delivery aggregator platforms grub still the leader awareness but 
competitors are catching and amzn raced into the lead for usage grub note amzn restaurants not 
tested last year 
consumers who ordered food for delivery say replaces meal restaurant from suggesting 
incremental cannibalization dine meals 
consumer interest food delivery across restaurant brands tested with the greatest incremental interest coffee 
and burger chains 
key insights from this report 
the total addressable market for digital delivery larger than we 
mcd have recently made delivery key part their strategy and are 
previously estimated now see the total long term tam for 
the process rolling out delivery nationally and globally qsr 
delivery the restaurant industry versus our 
proximity consumers the population mcd top five 
previous assumption just the key difference between 
markets lives within three miles restaurant increases access and 
the two forecasts according our alphawise survey consumers 
shortens delivery times see delivery pricing key driving 
now indicate higher intent order delivery from traditional fast food 
factor for adoption rates most consumer are only willing pay 
players see section how big can digital delivery and how fast 
encouraged see delivery pricing begin moderate 
will grow later this report and are also now seeing the 
key players roll out lower prices flat pricing instead distance 
number fast food brands offering delivery expanding rapidly 
based service fees and subscription models but lower end user 
had previously assumed that the fast food market was not 
delivery prices may also mean that restaurants absorb some that 
addressable near term due the high percentage already consumed 
cost order stimulate demand dfd 
the and availability has improved major qsr chains such

the risk delivery cannibalizing dine sales rising core tenet 
many full service restaurants where profitability not just margins 
restaurants embrace digital delivery and key selling point for 
but actual dollars begins decline this driven the high take 
aggregators and digital couriers the restaurants that 
rates which are commissions for sourcing customers and part 
represents incremental sales and while delivery sales are balance 
the cost associated with delivering the food the consumer take 
incremental our work suggests that the risk cannibalization 
rates can run the food order price range the lower 
dine sales rising today delivery users report that the 
end for fast food higher end for full service even take rates for 
delivery occasion replaces meal eaten restaurant versus 
chain restaurants are likely negotiated down given the ability 
year ago more important than the absolute level reported 
provide scale restaurants may need also help some delivery 
cannibalization consumers could answer the question what 
partners subsidize the delivery fee charged the consumer our 
delivery replaces with multiple responses directionally this not 
work suggests that the majority consumers are will only willing 
positive for restaurants particular full service restaurants

aggregators doesn stop margins placing order through 
restaurants will seek source their own orders simple delivery 
aggregator means the restaurant longer knows the identity its 
orders sourced through restaurant own assets represents 
customer aggregators generally don share customer data with 
significant savings commissions take rates shown above 
the chains and will lose access that rich database consumer 
and some third party software service providers are facilitating

restaurant orders with available delivery partners nominal per 
best price loyalty program perhaps better pricing delivery

longer term restaurants may attempt create their own delivery 
consumers far seem moving toward aggregators favoring 
networks but face many obstacles including limited house 
market place where greater food choice available consumers 
knowledge high initial startup costs challenges reaching break even

how digital delivery works brief primer 
aggregators delivery partners and selfdelivery how all works 
pizza most commonly will use third party delivery part fill 
that order common delivery partners include specialists like 
doordash postmates and host other smaller regional services 
the consumer pays some fee for that delivery plus often tip 
find the world digital delivery confusing investors with 
delivery fees for restaurant self delivery run typically delivery 
digital delivery players and restaurants serving often different 
partners couriers like doordash postmates regionals usually 
roles here try simplify how the process works both from the 
charge more depending the existence partnership agreement 
perspective the consumer and restaurant 
between the restaurant and the courier service and pricing structure 
varies widely partner and city depending the competitive 
from consumer standpoint the consumer now has essentially 
intensity route density etc some couriers add service fees 
two choices for food delivery order directly from restaurants 
addition delivery fees and some cases restaurants buy down 
either via phone internet their app order from food delivery 
delivery fees paying portion the cost the courier order 
aggregator 
keep delivery fees low and drive greater demand 
ordering directly from the restaurant still the most common 
ordering through aggregator allows the consumer browse 
practice the consumer knows what they want simple and 
marketplace options maybe you don know what you want for 
there certain confidence that the order will right directly 
dinner what available aggregators allow the consumer 
from the restaurant our survey suggests that direct delivery orders 
browse selection read reviews etc from there the aggregator will 
the restaurants make approximately three quarters all 
either send the order the restaurant some cases there 
delivery orders roughly half delivery orders are still placed 
not pre existing arrangement with the restaurant actually 
phone suggesting that digital penetration still early days pizza 
person and place the order the restaurant and wait for 
the exception where digital orders now make orders 
prepared will pass the order the restaurant and let the 
the restaurant then decides whether will deliver its own order 
restaurant itself deliver the food

from restaurant perspective the choices and trade offs between 
moving faster than the companies ability execute brands that 
using aggregators delivery partners self delivery complex 
have are testing self delivery outside pizza are limited pnra 
date many are still testing have adopted some form hybrid 
certain private operations notably jimmy john sandwiches and 
model that uses combination these models adding the 
blmn with self delivery stores 
confusion aggregators and delivery partners have different roles 
depending the circumstances sometimes aggregator like 
source orders themselves and rely third party partners 
ubereats for example sources orders through its own app and 
execute delivery this increasingly preferred method for many 
fulfills the orders while other times simply provides the delivery 
chain restaurants minimizes aggregator fees much 
logistics with corresponding lower fee often borne the 
take rates many are employing dispatch models pioneered olo 
consumer 
private company that provides the back end for restaurant app 
and links the delivery order available delivery partners the area 
here are the choices and trade offs restaurants face see them 
ubereats doordash for this service olo takes nominal 
per order fee plus monthly subscription fee per restaurant 
build internal delivery capabilities scale this clearly the most 
for use its software this saves restaurants time and money 
profitable option for the restaurant but has several drawbacks most 
avoiding the need create the systems necessary link mobile 
notably delivery volume has high leverage the added fixed 
order their own internal systems the consumer would pay the 
costs adding delivery staff while pnra was able reach break 
delivery fee the delivery partner part the app web 
even per week many others the industry suggest they 
transaction theory this appears ideal middle way for 
think their delivery break even would need much higher 
restaurants preserving their relationship with the consumer they 
much that lot volume and this early days 
can build their own crm and keep record who ordered and when 
lot risk take for that investment second consideration 
but dependent keeping the coalition delivery partners 
know how which isn currently house competency most 
the network unclear these delivery partners ultimately 
restaurants pizza hiring that expertise has gotten expensive 
strive own the customers and thereby pick the rich commission 
talent being bid third consideration finding available drivers 
fees that they would earn aggregators 
given tight labor markets and thanks uber finally there speed 
market even possible assembling delivery infrastructure takes 
rely aggregators source and deliver orders this the least 
time and speed market critical consumers preferences are 
profitable proposition for restaurant but the orders are truly

incremental would not have gotten the order had the consumer 
restaurants one for each the aggregators where orders come 
not visited the aggregator site then may worth the short 
and often have manually keyed into the restaurant own pos 
run estimate that hypothetical aggregator order with 
system this decreases accuracy and consumes time some 
full take rate the restaurants will left with profits 
aggregators still not provide consolidated chain wide views 
addition the pure economics there are other challenges first the 
their system the chain would have tally themselves the 
restaurant loses control its customers these aggregators 
aggregator driven sales from each location get accurate view 
currently don share the customer information with the restaurant

key insights for restaurants delivery 
grows does risk cannibalization and 
disintermediation 
delivery represents near term top line driver but 
cannibalization dine sales key hidden threat 
especially full service restaurants what the 
cost benefit using aggregators 
more than absolute and importantly delivery substitute for 
dine grew faster than other substitutes delivery still small 
portion restaurant sales excluding pizza but take this 
important piece evidence that consumer behavior changing and 
the risk cannibalization restaurant dine sales rising 
with consumers rapidly embracing food delivery and host 
third party order aggregators and delivery partners networks 
exhibit 
aggressively expanding think chain restaurants have 
consumers say that delivery meals are increasingly replacing dine 
choice but embrace this new sales channel some way but 
occasions faster rate than eating home take out 
how restaurants approach this new channel will have long term 
food delivery replaces 
profit and strategic implications relying too heavily aggregators 
meal eaten home 
source orders for example could have significant negative 
implications for profitability and risks loss control the 
meal eaten restaurant 
consumer going alone and creating proprietary delivery network 
has its own costs including front investments and slower speed 
market 
here tackle the following questions are delivery sales 
incremental cannibalistic existing sales what are the 
economics the aggregator model and are hybrid models viable

how realistic for restaurant build its own delivery network 
and will digital delivery impact the underlying economics cdr 
cannibalization more pronounced full service restaurants our 
and qsr stocks equally 
survey data suggests that brand casual dining full service 
restaurants more vulnerable this than fast food per exhibit 
delivery incremental cannibalistic that the key 
below this compounded the fact that dine sales already run 
question that investors need understand delivery begins 
sales full service contrast that fast food qsrs 
grow top line importance not surprisingly most restaurants view 
where not only the consumer reported cannibalization rates lower 
delivery incremental but when pressed there not lot hard 
than full service but much lower percent sales typically 
data yet support that view don think there easy answer 
are already consumed off premise think that from the 
and consumer behavior shifting rapidly however according our 
perspective incrementality lack thereof fast food better 
survey consumers while delivery still balance 
position relative full service restaurants and could see some 
incremental cannibalization rates are increasing from just year ago 
benefits from incremental sales without least with less risk of 
our survey suggests that consumers say delivery has 
commensurate loss dine sales

fast food largely already off premise business relative casual 
and the possibility hybrid solutions the economics delivery

restaurant chains are not yet well understood investors our 
meals eaten off premise 
view delivery today still small portion sales and the profit 
impact not yet visible margins earnings however one 
scenario one where most orders are sourced from aggregator increased delivery will have some adverse impact margins and 
worst case scenarios could actually lower profit dollars the 
majority delivery order become substitute for dining this 
particularly true full service restaurants want clear that 
restaurants are cognizant those risks and attempting mitigate 
them but consumers will ultimately the ones making the choice 
casual dining customers

traditional qsr customers 
this most dire scenario may remind some retailers rush 
commerce which hasn ended particularly well restaurants 
aren nearly risk retailers from disintermediation 
restaurants remain part the value chain and efforts far 
create vertically integrated food prep and delivery have not 
succeeded nor are the costs for digital delivery has high for 
commerce warehouses inventory for example but similar 
retailers they could end with lower margins and less 
productive assets over time due this potentially seismic shift

scenario delivery sales sourced and delivered 
through aggregator 
begin fall dine cannibalization reaches think this 
math should sound alarm bells for any public company that 
currently solely reliant aggregators source orders currently 
arguably the easiest implement but most adverse margins the

aggregator model has the advantage restaurant quickly

largely works with independents ubereats amazon 
chains are remain with aggregators source orders will 
restaurants sources the order via its app website and then

typically also delivers the food charging the restaurant 
typically run and maximize the number orders through 
commission take rate and charing the consumer delivery fee 
their own digital assets opposed receiving orders that are 
and these orders prove truly incremental the low margins 
sourced through aggregators note that the aggregators 
may worth the price but the example below illustrates profit 
including possible large entrants such amazon will trying 
margins and ultimately profit dollars quickly erode

partner model still provides poor visibility the restaurants the 
customer who ordering their food result alternative 
version this model has arisen dispatch model which allows 
restaurants source some its orders from its now digital assets 
web app and using third party intermediary notably one called 
olo dispatch which then routes the orders the available delivery 
couriers the market the restaurant pays this dispatch service 
the case olo per order fee for this service but pay other 
commissions and therefore much more profitable model the 
consumers bear the full price delivery this model which could

can restaurants build their own delivery networks while 
where are today but margin erosion can occur 
with increased delivery cannibalization

having some obvious benefits better margins than aggregator 
delivery partner models better control food quality speed 
customer etc very few chain restaurants outside pizza have 
decided establish their own networks notable exceptions being 
scenario delivery sales using partners doordash 
pnra blmn and private company jimmy johns there are several 
postmates take and fill restaurants orders 
reasons for this including start cost lack house 
expertise and increasing cost hiring external expertise

embraced delivery sales driver the context chronically 
declining industry traffic delivery proves less incremental than 
initially thought and margins are pressured casual dining stocks will 
come under additional pressure our view 
fast food stocks could benefit from delivery relative basis for 
several reasons cannibalization less risk given the much larger 
portion sales already consumed off premise commission rates 
charged fast food delivery services tend lower firm 
level margins are not nearly risk given most qsrs are largely 
franchised franchisee margins may feel some incremental pressure 
however and any amount incremental sales likely will drive 
higher sss and there high correlation between sss increases and 
multiple expansion restaurant stocks especially there are 
adverse margin implications

holding back grubhub ability sustainable increase its margins

and profitability scales that this new base case more 
bull case and grub bear case where would expect higher 
competitive world expect amazon main impact grub 
amazon restaurant adoption see exhibit and materially lower 
higher customer acquisition cost see all players the 
grub profitability due increased marketing spend and lower 
group needing compete harder and spend more for incremental 
commission rates see exhibit and this underpins our new 
user growth this particularly true given the high loyalty rates 
grub bear case 
prime subscribers because amazon able scale its restaurant 
selection the loyalty prime subs will make them more difficult 
acquire for any competitors the irony this business isn likely 
large standalone basis for amazon gmv

grubhub already has among the lowest delivery fees the
