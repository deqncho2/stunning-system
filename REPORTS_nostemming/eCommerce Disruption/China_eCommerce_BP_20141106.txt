key industry debates issues 
global investors are grappling with many uncertainties when 
investing the internet sector given the rapid changes the 
industry and technological advancements believe the 
following are the key questions that investors are examining 
social commerce opportunity threat 
verticalization will verticals take material market share 
from platforms and the dominant ecommerce force 
china 
which ecommerce model works for china long term 
the principal direct sales consignment 
marketplace commission advertisement 
should ecommerce platforms build their own warehouse 
infrastructure 
should ecommerce platforms operate the last mile 
delivery network 
global investors and the street opinions remain split 
many these questions and admittedly still too early 
the industry development have the right answers 
such throughout this report seek enhance the debates 
providing incremental insights that the street has yet 
discount and examine how the china model will evolve 
ultimately recommend investors compare the 
ecommerce companies absolute gross profits earned over 
time and more important the level returns and value 
created from the profits reinvested 
ecommerce global trend but the right business 
model needs localized 
address the above questions believe investors should 
also aware the structural differences between china and 
the they are different many ways unlike other 
internet sub sectors with similar business models replicated 
globally the right ecommerce business model for any country 
needs tweaked for the local market similar physical 
goods retailing offline 
one size fits all approach unlikely work specifically 
consumption habits the maturity offline retailing and the 
complexity fragmentation wholesale and retail distribution 
are critical factors shaping online digital commerce dynamics 
additionally china internet sector regulated enabling 
domestic incumbents grow without much foreign 
competition potential deregulation the internet industry 
long term could also change the competitive dynamic over

better affordability rise mass consumption 
the overall consumption share gdp china remains 
relatively low owing multiple factors explanation 
which beyond the scope the report but our simplified 
view that china consumption growth has been impeded 
two major factors 
for instance alibaba publishes monthly online shopping 
price index aspi core based fixed basket theory that 
tracks the price changes core products services 
from taobao and tmall the aspi core suggests yoy price 
decline online purchases online versus china cpi data 
published nbs that suggests continuous inflation 
over the past year 
pressure prices over the medium term trend already 
happening 
poor retail infrastructure and fragmentation unlike 
the which has developed reit industry with the top 
three commercial real estate developers representing 
the market china fragmented with the majority 
developers residential focused that lack retail 
management expertise also lax zoning regulations and 
mixed used centric projects result uneven project 
quality strata selling and relatively high rental costs 
especially high tier cities 
worth noting that the weighting applied the basket 
components the two indices aspi core and cpi are 
different which may cause the great difference between the 
two readings the aspi core weights given food products 
and clothing are and respectively much lower 
than the and the official cpi statistics 
more broadly ecommerce becomes sizeable part 
incremental consumption growth the industry could become 
one the key contributors price deflation china this 
could key headwind for producers margins the 
medium term the other hand the chinese consumers are 
likely benefit most from greater affordability and potentially 
consume more helping china become consumption led 
economy

weibo which are aggregators users leveraging their 
traffic the platforms and other service providers 
koudaitong connect directly indirectly the users with 
sellers traditional verticals media and offline retailers 
the platforms could place native advertisements throughout 
the users themselves could recommend products services 
their social circles some intermediary service providers 
like weidian and kuaidian even give percentage sales 
commissions users incentives these types business 
models could potentially decentralize the way sellers and 
buyers shop mobile china but change will likely very

potential incremental time spend and diversification 
time spend social app important consider

june wechat china largest social app with 
mau that month from minutes january 
according iresearch the best case scenario that 
offering shopping option social app jd access wechat and mobile will incrementally 
add time spend per user the worst case scenario 
that additional options would divert the limited time spend 
per user think will likely both 
lack strong verticals for now discussed 
china unlike the where there are online and offline 
verticals that are category killers and that are willing

clear and its ability generate better conversion key 
its business model whereas wechat like shopping mall 
which traffic rather than conversion the top priority 
inside wechat there are many functions that are primarily 
social related that increase time spent and shopping just 
part the experience similarly shopping malls also offer 
many options for social activities among friends and families 
with physical goods shopping being just part the experience 
diversifying the limited time spent result 
more important just shopping malls need anchors 
wechat platforms also signed anchors such

key question which ecommerce model works for china the 
principal marketplace 
morgan stanley blue paper 
our view works better for china china 
fragmentation the entire transaction value chain from multilayer wholesale distribution for most consumer categories 
landlord driven offline channels and mostly franchised 
logistic networks make more difficult for the ecommerce 
model gain substantial market share except more 
standardized product categories 
marketplace business model preferred given 
china retail fragmentation and multi layered 
distribution for most consumer categories 
believe the overall online gmv split direct sales 
consignment and commission advertisement 
country reflects the mainstream principal versus 
marketplace business models adopted offline the landlord 
marketplace format the dominant and more profitable 
format china the key profit growth driver for most online 
platforms broadly speaking the asset light marketplace 
will thrive china long its wholesale and retail 
landscape remains fragmented below are three key reasons 
retail fragmentation weaker offline online 
marketplace preferred department stores are the major 
offline channel for apparel and footwear categories unlike 
the china department stores are landlords receiving 
percentage sales generated from suppliers free 
inventory risk and staff costs that are similar the 
marketplace business model online since large national 
retailers like wal mart and macy not exist china the 
apparel and footwear categories are better placed adopt 
the marketplace business model 
multi layer wholesale and retail distributors 
abundant online sellers staples and consumable 
products face similar threats the modern channel such 
hypermarkets and supermarkets represent only the 
offline market for most staple brands the remainder the 
market served the regional distributors and subdistributors likewise these distributors have been selling 
similar products lower prices online sellers both 
and similar characteristics apply the home 
appliance category though the offline channel more 
concentrated few leading offline players this makes 
necessary for adopt the business model compete 
consumer electronics pure marketplace such 
tmall also has sizeable business due abundance 
distributors selling the platform and brands adoption 
the online channel 
china status the factory the world thriving 
marketplace given that china remains the major 
exporter most consumer products online sellers have 
natural advantage sourcing products alibaba 
platform also helps small and medium sized 
sellers source and then sell into its retail marketplaces 
making proliferation white label brands this extends the 
long tail supply that makes the marketplace thrive and 
more attractive 
but the ecommerce sector becoming more 
dynamic with existence pure and mixed 
players given their value proposition 
china offline retail will likely fragmented for extended 
period however changes consumer preference higher 
costs and flattening distribution layers for standardized 
categories are driving the coexistence few large 
platforms given their social and economic value they are 
leading china retail consolidation different ways below 
are our initial thoughts these developing trends 
model flatten distribution layers and ensure higher 
quality price longer the sole consideration when 
purchasing online chinese shoppers are demanding better 
quality with greater convenience becoming one the 
largest retailers with direct sales contributing gmv 
which consumer electronics large 
platform such has greater purchasing scale than 
smaller sellers similar brands products and this 
helping flatten the distribution layers especially for 
standardized categories home appliances and infant 
formula given potentially better prices quality assurance 
and better customer service large platforms are likely 
take share from smaller sellers distributors and retailers 
platforms similarly vips flash sales discount model helps 
brands effectively clear inventories large quantities 
unavailable large scale offline currently 
model wholesale centric brands transition online 
broaden revenue potential pure marketplaces such 
taobao and tmall help wholesale centric brands establish 
faster speed market given their large scale and broad 
morgan stanley research 
november 
china internet 
reach online platforms this can help brands build 
morgan stanley blue paper 
awareness and introduce new products the lower tier cities 
that are under served and under penetrated physical 
retailers 
given the wholesale centric brands lack online and offline 
retail expertise taobao and tmall also have taobao 
partners the ecosystem that are service providers that 
help manage brands online businesses and flagship stores 
for instance estee lauder has commissioned uco partly 
invested alibaba its online distributor design and 
manage its tmall flagship store similarly apple and nike 
have also hired service provider manage their tmall 
flagship stores these wholesale centric brands increase 
their allocation advertising dollar online they should

key question should ecommerce platforms build their own 
warehouse network 
morgan stanley blue paper 
our view yes believe most ecommerce platforms will 
self operate network owned and leased warehouses 
providing data centric and automated warehouse 
management service strategically important the long 
term increase and maintain suppliers stickiness and 
improve inventory management efficiency the method 
ownership off balance sheet the key debate 
prefer the off balance sheet approach but recognize that 
balance sheet approach may able scale faster 
national warehouse solution necessary not 
merely optional for large players 
all major ecommerce platforms believe combination 
building and leasing national fulfillment infrastructure 
important the platforms that control the real time inventory 
flow the sellers will stickier than competitors and will 
have the ability improve the customer experience cost 
effective difm warehouse solution for retailers would become 
one the key differentiating factors among leading platforms 
the online platforms need play critical role given their 
large customer base comprehensive demand data and 
greater financial resources alibaba and vips are key 
domestic platforms with plans build and connect national 
warehousing infrastructures that feature prediction based

infrastructure critical the development ecommerce 
china also capital intensive and therefore less 
attractive investors the key debate really about the 
ownership method and the speed with which the infrastructure

key question should ecommerce platforms operate the last 
mile delivery network 
morgan stanley blue paper 
alibaba market leadership makes expanding its 
virtual economy the top priority 
alibaba dominates china virtual economy with 
ecommerce market share china aggregates the 
massive supply and demand sellers and buyers this 
virtuous loop will continue long the virtual economy 
grows enough demand fulfill supply result alibaba 
needs invest its profits expand the market size 
maintain leadership and entice sellers engage digital 
commerce mainly its ecosystem 
alibaba combined china retail marketplaces generated 
gmv this translated packages 
alibaba carrying out self operated last mile would 
not make sense all else equal would need least 
delivery persons dedicated delivering its 
orders when its gmv potentially doubles 
delivery persons required fulfill all taobao orders assuming 
utilization

alibaba has the vision the resources and the responsibility 
further advance china ecommerce focusing 
accelerating digital commerce under penetrated and rural 
markets forecast alibaba gmv reach 
trillion the asset light approach allows the 
company and its affiliates invest and form alliances the 
private and public sectors tackle such enormous 
challenge this necessary approach maintaining the 
health its virtual economy and create employment adding 
value the industry and the society 
exhibit 
and vips are each building national warehouse network 
with integrated last mile logistics services the enhanced 
customer experience helps them gain greater repeat 
purchases our view long term integrated last mile 
logistics network could help these companies engage 
new opportunities such demand services they can 
also spin off sell the logistics business the future when 
china infrastructure matures adding value the company 
and long term shareholders 
based our forecast believe its china retail gmv will 
double and assuming efficiency gains order 
bundling smart warehousing better route management and 
higher government supports its logistics partners will 
need have least delivery persons 
dedicated delivering alibaba china orders this does not 
include potential returns goods therefore alibaba were 
operate its own last mile logistics operation would 
very costly and this makes little sense 
why both approaches have merits 
delivered parcels china overall 
number that higher than ups global deliveries 
our view both the asset light and asset heavy 
approaches last mile delivery have their own merits 
each business model adds value shareholders partners 
and customers differently prefer the asset light 
approach alibaba but the long term option value jd 
and vips last mile delivery operations cannot ignored

its importance sellers allows the company impose rules 
and consumer based rating systems force sellers 
improve service and value for the consumers this the 
approach will take incentivize better delivery service 
the companies based our understanding from the 
china smart logistics team the taobao platform will 
ultimately allow consumers choose the delivery 
companies rather than the sellers option currently making 
available peer ratings companies consumers that 
want pay for faster trustworthy and better quality delivery 
service can therefore logistics companies with 
improved services will get more orders theoretically 
while other smaller leading platforms could

organ stanley blue paper 
think does make sense for the smaller platforms such 
and vips engage part the last mile

china last mile logistics highly fragmented with cut throat 
pricing and increasing costs this had led 
poor service quality china has logistics 
companies with few companies providing consistent service 
nationally and attractive cost companies that offer 
cost effective prices are volume driven with little incentive 
improve delivery service quality high ticket and fragile 
merchandise vulnerable damage when delivery services 
are uneven

longer delivery time cross regional deliveries especially 
lower tier cities are more costly per order given the regional

damaged goods 
given companies spend about marketing 
per active customer poor delivery and aftermarket customer

strategically sound for them control the customer

are better placed than those with customers narrower age

more defensive they are the long term 
city tier exposure believe greater exposure 
consumers lower tier cities better given slower adoption 
new technology arguably platforms verticals with little 
exposure lower tier cities currently could have greater 
upside penetration however these platforms would also 
incur higher acquisition costs being late movers and 
potentially lower order sizes initially they penetrate into 
lower tier cities 
however most large ecommerce platforms such alibaba 
have already invested engaged these new avenues 
capture future growth opportunities disruptions from 
technology and channel shifts any would likely affect the 
smaller verticals platforms that either have smaller

this offset market share gains from alibaba 
tmall marketplace the market share decline 
sellers due many factors including rising advertising 
and service costs increased competition due low entry 
barriers lack product differentiation for many 
operators and cleansing counterfeit products online

not consumer consumer but rather small businesses 
consumer these small businesses become

morgan stanley blue paper 
quantitative assessment 
conclusion monetization the result execution and 
dominance the factors previously discussed profits and 
cash flow generated could reinvested into the business 
increase company economic moat and thereby gain wallet 
share from customers virtuous loop 
generally speaking the direct sales business model 
enjoys higher gross margins with the exception the lowmargin category but carries inventory risks the 
marketplace model free inventory risk but likely has lower 
gross margins given their landlord business model sellers 
inside marketplaces pay combination fixed rental 
percentage sales commission from sellers and 
variable fees advertisements for traffic generate sales 
both models have positives and negatives which 
not elaborate this section 
therefore favor business models that have sustainable 
market share expansion coupled with higher earnings growth 
though this rare combination any young industry 
among the chinese ecommerce players alibaba likely the 
only company enjoying this combination 
ultimately gross profits generated could allocated based 
these companies strategy grow their businesses

qualitative assessment 
morgan stanley blue paper 
alibaba alibaba has the strongest monetization capability 
among ecommerce players given its asset light business 
model inventory and small sales force its dominant 
market share measured gmv and active users makes 
the platform engage tailing small and large 
retailers brands china though has the lowest blended 
gross margin when compared with other players note 
that most its sellers not pay advertisements 
commissions when selling its taobao platform 
gmv generated these non paying sellers excluded its 
gross margin percentage gmv would likely much 
higher 
but absolute basis alibaba gross profits 
would still well above the other companies

alibaba has substantial operating leverage given minimal 
fulfillment expenses payment service fees charged its 
sister company alipay while its sellers bear the delivery 
costs most its gross profits are spent marketing and 
technology investments the two largest expenses required 
for asset light platforms improve the user experience 
nevertheless its marketing expense ratio also the lowest 
among comparison peers given high repeat purchases from 
existing customers well vibrancy its advertising 
affiliate network absolute level estimate alibaba 
outspends the next player adjust alibaba 
marketing spend including traffic acquisition costs tac 
from cost sales amount likely unrivaled its 
competitors near term

alibaba china retail marketplaces generate lower 
blended gross margin excluding gmv nonpaying sellers its take rate would higher 
gpm blended comparison 
vip shop vips the largest online discounter china 
and adopts quasi platform model with most products sold 
based consignment sales rather than direct sales with 
inventory risk its higher gross margin justified 
given its value proposition its suppliers there sizeable 
clearance brands inventories multiple skus with small 
quantities limited time frame typically vips clears 
about inventories for its suppliers per flash sales event 
that runs for days around its gmv the higher 
margin apparel and accessories category that could 
marked down deep discount with suppliers still making 
profits 
according the company its suppliers have begun 
introduce newer products its platform making vips 
another channel similar tmall and the apparel and 
accessories categories the flash sales plus consignment 
model allows the company highly cash flow generative 
with relatively long payable days and short inventory days 
although believe vips has room improve its payable 
days the company engages suppliers financing and 
warehousing services its cash flow generation likely 
continue the foreseeable future put this context jd 
gross profits were those vips but jd operating cash 
flow only higher vips key risk better and faster 
deployment cash generated increase its economic moat

the industry the company biggest expense item its 
fulfillment expense yet relative its competitors its fulfillment 
expense ratio the lower end given jumei bears fulfillment

distinctive marketing content that resonates with younger 
consumers and their wallet share 
purely looking the numbers ranks worst 
monetization the group with its total operating expense 
ratio the highest for extended periods forecast will not

net margin with guarantee profitability the 
medium term however its failure monetize strategic 
rather than significant weakness its business model

rmb ipo proceeds and given its strong cash flow 
generation rmb operating cash flow per year 
investing most the cash flow back into the business 
compete with taobao and tmall its fulfilment cost its 
single largest operating expense manages its own last 
mile delivery team differentiate its customer service from 
taobao sellers this costly proposition that prevents 
from enjoying higher operating margin than other platforms 
although believe its last mile delivery service could 
enhance its future mcommerce demand services and 
could profitable profitability from these new businesses 
will likely take time 
also stepping marketing spending 
higher than gross profit growth bear mind that 
this marketing spend does not include the potential revenue 
generation from tencent wechat shopping entrance 
under the strategic cooperation agreement with tencent 
march estimate additional 
marketing spending five year period has not been 
accounted for our estimate this could provide upside 
support our revenue forecast emphasize that

strong competitive moat the key driver china and global 
ecommerce gmv growth may slower than peers given 
established new rules clean incomplete transactions 
its ecosystem its slowing market share and its 
large absolute gmv scale larger than the next player 
china expect the tmall marketplace add 
greater incremental gmv per year versus the incremental 
gmv the rest the listed players combined put another 
way for the months ended june tmall generated 
gmv rmb versus jd month gmv 
effect creating another two ecommerce 
companies the size its scale will likely unrivaled 
medium term 
vipshop has profitable and sustainable monetization 
model capturing market share from the two slowing channels 
online and offline department stores the company 
flash sales discount model adds value suppliers such 
expect industry leading gmv and gross profit growth 
profile versus peers its gross margin likely 
remain stable until potentially expanding beyond vips 
plans invest more technology and mobile traffic but that 
unlikely put much pressure its earning profile given its 
strong top line growth believe its lefeng acquisition will 
likely break even next year and provide margin support 
long term beyond rank lower than 
given its more limited potential customer reach 
likely one the long term winners the china 
ecommerce industry ranked second based our five 
framework the company highly cash flow generative and 
well funded given the recent ipo such expect 
accelerating investments marketing technology and 
fulfillment capabilities compete with alibaba taobao 
tmall aggregate basis expect spend 
sales marketing the next five years 
including through the tencent partnership 
alibaba spending the same period adding value 
investors differentiating its services and has invested 
new areas such cloud demand service and 
internet finance that will increase its economic moat over time 
not expect the company become profitable until 
but expect margin improvement 
valuations and high street expectations its social 
commerce contribution could weigh the near term share
