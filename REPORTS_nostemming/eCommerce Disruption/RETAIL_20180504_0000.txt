waiting for differentiation 
differentiation between reits portfolio yields all time 
lows while stocks have derated similar way are not 
bullish but argue that the relative performance these 
stocks exposed wide range asset quality could change 
materially when more transactional evidence emerges 
reported rental growth remains strong investor sentiment towards shopping 
centre reits has deteriorated materially recent years yet show that likefor like rental growth reported most the main listed companies remains 
line with longer term averages france sweden has been improving 
spain italy netherlands see rental growth not weakening far 
and relatively tightly bunched but this still reliable figure the gap 
between the like for like rental growth reported the top and bottom 
performers our sample towards the lower end the historical range 
exhibit other words are yet see material divergence between 
different companies reported like for like rental growth despite significant 
perceived differences strategy around portfolio optimisation and asset quality 
admittedly don know how much companies are upping investment their 
assets sustain such growth disclosure this remains limited therefore 
wonder what extent rental growth effectively acquired per 
goodhart law has become clear target and therefore less useful measure 
historically low differentiation property yields what matters more 
believe that our analysis also shows how for the main reits the spread 
basis points between the highest and lowest yielding portfolios year 
lows and for those who argue this because absolute yields have tightened 
show how this spread divided the average yield also near all time lows 
exhibit other words these companies portfolios are valued yields with 
minimal differentiation compared history 
while stocks have all rated similar way addition show lack 
differentiation between stock valuation trends the main stocks nav valuation 
has been eroded broadly similar way during the last three years exhibit 
widening bid offer spread shopping centre transactional evidence even 
scarcer than usual suggesting widening bid offer spread exhibit 
higher property yields ahead key debate what extent shopping centre 
yields could should adjust reflect changing fundamental outlook this 
matters given the significant nav sensitivity estimate uptick yield 
reduces nav around for most all else equal remain far from bullish 
this sub sector but stock performance could less bunched coming years 
with those companies with better quality portfolios set start outperform 
peers this note not set explicit order preference but reference 
our work retail quality which hammerson comes out well

consistent with lack differentiation yield levels 
shopping centre yields most countries listed reits offer exposure are below 
previous lows show this below for the and france the two largest markets for

key takeaway lack differentiation yields but what arguably more interesting 
that for the main reits the spread basis points between the highest and lowest 
yielding portfolios year lows and for those who argue this because yields 
have tightened show how this spread divided the average yield equally near all

what included like for like rental growth 
breaking down the rental growth drivers all companies disclose this number but 
typically disclosure the underlying components may vary the main components are 
indexation for continental portfolios uplift lettings and renewals and 
other which comprises variety factors such turnover linked revenues specialty 
leasing digital marketing and movement the allowance for doubtful accounts 
indexation likely set increase the reduction inflation across europe has reduced 
like for like rental growth for continental european assets significantly all else equal 
but indexation has started showing upward trend 
could lead more differentiation klepierre management highlighted recently how 
targeting around growth aggregate irrespective the underlying components 
while other companies unibail rodamco have placed more emphasis the growth 
over and above indexation 
the uplift lettings and renewals could come under pressure most listed shopping 
centre reits portfolios remain reversionary there are material differences wereldhave portfolio has been broadly market rented for three years while several 
peers eurocommercial klepierre and unibail rodamco report double digit reversionary 
potential but note that balance have been witnessing upward trend 
reversionary potential this suggests companies have been able drive market rents 
more than the annual indexation argue this could become increasingly challenging 
lastly the other component more challenging model but any concern about 
retailer health would suggest higher risk for increase the allowance for doubtful 
accounts which another key indicator focus note that some the 
companies with the best disclosure this such unibail rodamco showed increases 
provisions around which had material impact like for like rental 
growth 
reliability reported numbers what don know however how much companies 
are upping investment their assets sustain rental growth disclosure this 
remains limited therefore wonder what extent rental growth effectively 
acquired and per goodhart law has become less relevant measure 
what think matters indicators for potential issues focus more attention and 
changes reversionary potential and any commentary about rise the 
allowance for doubtful accounts affecting like for like rental growth which think are 
better early indicators for potential asset price corrections rather than change likefor like rental growth itself reversionary potential could come under pressure and 
would key indicator for downturn asset pricing argue even material 
reduction reversions say average reversion going from zero would not 
necessarily have material impact like for like rental growth given the likely uptick 
inflation estimate that uptick indexation offsets drop reversion all 
else equal

widening bid offer spread 
wide bid offer spread these companies portfolios are valued external appraisers 
who make assumptions but ultimately tend make limited changes the way down 
without evidence that values are falling shopping centre transaction volumes have 
been falling last year there was still billion shopping centres that changed 
hands but are witnessing material reduction liquidity and there have not been 
many high profile deals recently instead there are several potential transactions which 
have been suggested the press but which not seem materialise high profile 
examples are 
bluewater stakes october last year press articles costar october 
suggested that lendlease stake had teamed with gic stake formally 
launch the sale their stakes bluewater shopping centre kent for million 
reflecting yield since then there has been variety suggested buyers but 
nothing has materialised none the parties mentioned commented the articles 
unibail rodamco dutch malls bloomberg suggested september that unibailrodamco was set sell stadshart amstelveen retail units million annual 
visitors and stadshart zoetermeer retail units million annual visitors for 
million total this was also suggested variety other news sources but yet
