evidence cloud inflection enterprises jumping board 
improved aws security capabilities and the notion that enterprises are winding down sweating data 
center assets are two additional factors driving aws adoption addition increased aws product 
functionality and expanding partner ecosystem these additional catalysts specifically point toward 
increasing adoption the enterprise our calls with resellers consultants customers and systems integrators 
well our analysis the aws invent speakers over time and our historical morgan stanley cio survey data 
trends all support this thesis 
security longer headwind and now potentially tailwind concerns around security are often 
cited inhibitor broad adoption iaas paas services particularly due data protection and privacy 
concerns however noticed tone change our customer conversations with the majority customers 
highlighting security not inhibitor but potential driver cloud adoption this supported view 
that amazon will have better security capabilities due its scale and level investment than any one 
enterprise could provide its own data center aws operates least data centers worldwide with several 
more the works including one the this allows customers deploy aws services the location 
their choice which allows better control over where their content stored and allows enterprises meet 
country specific data protection and privacy regulations 
while security key consideration for aws adoption aws does not offer extensive list security services 
that customers can purchase directly from aws the idea more robust security aws around the 
technology and processes used within the aws data centers not security services offered stand alone 
solutions and charged directly the customer likely indirectly embedded the compute cost most the 
direct security services offered aws today include services around identity management encryption key 
management and web application firewalls for web apps hosted aws relatively small subsector the 
broader security market 
exhibit customers cite more favorable view security within aws however the direct security 
offerings from aws are fairly limited 
rce rgan stan ley research amazo services 
more opportunity than direct impact security vendors today while aws sells very limited portfolio 
its own security functionality many security vendors such palo alto networks barracuda and fortinet 
offer virtualized versions their solutions aws the aws marketplace lists security solutions offered 
from parties for use aws with options allowing for bring your own license see these 
opportunities largely additive the near term for security vendors enterprises secure new workloads 
aws but continue invest securing its own network endpoints and premise infrastructure addition 
virtualized offerings aws will have margin benefits for most security vendors spending shifts from 
traditional models that include hardware plus perpetual licenses software only subscription models 
aws announced several new security offerings this fall including web application firewall waf which 
similar offerings from imperva and networks while this product announcement immediately raised 
questions the potential disruption these security vendors would note that aws waf applicable 
only web applications hosted aws given most enterprises have workloads aws and premise aws 
solution isn comprehensive for most enterprises needs this compares solution like imperva waf which 
global technology november 
can deployed premises aws addition believe that security area technology where rich 
security domain expertise and focus rewarded therefore believe security vendors will able capitalize 
new workloads moving aws 
sweat the assets then move workloads public cloud believe part the decision move 
workloads the public cloud based company depreciation schedule its data center assets for 
example the significant drop server unit growth rates over the last several years can attributed part 
cios sweating data center assets waiting for equipment that was purchased during the high data center 
growth years depreciate our checks indicate that cios think about equipment becoming 
eligible for replacement only after the assets are depreciated after equipment reaches this point replacement 
the cost benefits shifting the public cloud become real avoiding heavy upfront capital expenditures 
purchase new data center equipment adopting the public cloud and enjoying smaller monthly operating 
expenses according idc the total number installed internal data centers are declining every year 
through the growth rate new internal data center builds negative and decreasing while new service 
provider including public cloud data center capacity expected grow cagr through 
this further supports the notion that cios are allowing their existing data center equipment age 
favor moving existing workloads off premise aws gains scale see fewer server replacements after 
year useful file while benefited from uptick server shipments due the intel grantley

innovation aws accelerates with new products since the depth and breadth tools available 
aws customers impressive that regard with many configuration options available for the seemingly

large budgets and the resources navigate the complexity benefit the most from aws eliminating legacy 
software hardware favor the vast aws public cloud toolset best class security and compliance 
features further strengthen aws position the top enterprise public cloud solution see exhibit

potential risks growth 
aws leading position allows generate revenues today and the public cloud market growth 
prospects remain strong however there are several considerations that may serve roadblock the ongoing 
growth story 
amazon ability balance shareholders tolerance for fcf burn with ongoing aws growth public 
cloud offerings require large capital expenditures maintain the farm short lived servers despite low cost 
access servers amazon not immune these requirements the last publicly disclosed split aws 
spending aws capex made its revenues resulting fcf from operations defined ebitda less 
capex while this positive fcf may provide some consolation for shareholders aws also held 
estimated capital leases which makes the fcf picture less attractive when factoring these 
aws burned fcf our estimates see this trend extending past which may test the 
patience shareholders

what aws 
amazon web services aws infrastructure service iaas platform launched amazon aws 
offers customers broad range functionality service used run applications pay you grow 
model requiring little capex front 
aws began internal only service that amazon created support its amazon ecommerce website 
amzn began roll out aws cloud based compute and storage services external customers for the 
first time leveraging the internal web scale infrastructure the company created for itself over the next nine 
years aws product range has expanded include over functionalities over that time aws has grown 
into revenue run rate business supporting application workloads for hundreds thousands 
businesses more than countries ranging from netflix pinterest general electric 
why does aws matter 
customers can eliminate the need own and maintain house servers and data centers outsourcing 
aws this reduces the need for specialized staff and continuously upgrading the server technology 
applying retail economics cloud computing aws has disrupted the industry both technology and 
business model amazon uses distribution methodology and targets margin profiles more line with 
ecommerce organization than the vendors with which aws competes 
what differentiates aws from competitors 
scale estimate amazon runs over half million servers affording economies scale that the majority 
its customers cannot reach their own scale benefits start ups and smbs most directly small companies 
cannot purchase run data center nearly efficiently aws yet large enterprises can often run workloads 
themselves comparable lower cost than utilizing aws 
elasticity automated compute elasticity for example streaming video platform might experience spikes 
usage around friday sunday night buying compute capacity from aws allows for provisioning based around 
average usage the platform rather than over provisioning for peak demand yielding significant cost savings 
compared the costs running infrastructure premise purchasing compute resources 
needed basis the customer avoids both the overhead too much capacity and the risk under provisioning 
their applications such uneven spiky workloads can burst into public cloud environment when 
demand for computing capacity surges 
agility agile easy scaling another primary benefit using iaas purchasing additional capacity from aws 
significantly faster than procuring and deploying company own infrastructure 
price advantage due its scale and retail economics aws able price aggressively aws has offered 
customers price cuts date across its entire product line

about group revenues expect some negative impact data center aws utilization reduces 
the need for smaller scale enterprise microservers the effects shift from enterprise servers towards onpremise private clouds middle ground between location based servers and public cloud could also reduce
