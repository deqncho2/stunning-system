incorporating ssg value base case per share and

from implying upside potential our 
eps estimates are above consensus expect the 
earnings turnaround its online channel and the solid performance 
its other new channels lift consensus estimates note 
mart strong position online grocery with its superior merchandising capability logistics infrastructure and well known brand

retailing channel and gives full credit its online business similarly 
ssg value has materially lifted our price target for shinsegae 
base case per share from 
implying upside potential raise our earnings estimates for 
owing better performance its duty free business 
however because its incheon site will close earlier than had anticipated rather than per the company cut our earnings estimates for and for but this more 
timing issue with the earlier than expected site closing our 
view and not expect this have much impact our longterm estimates from 
where could wrong 
ssg funding deal does not push through investor 
sentiment the and thus both companies would turn 
negative note that our base case scenario ssg 
does not include any potential synergies from the expected 
funding 
for their other operations any sudden deterioration the 
overall consumption and competitive landscape could result 
slower earnings growth than expect our base case 
scenario not expect any meaningful recovery sssg 
for hypermarkets mart flat yoy and department 
stores shinsegae flattish 
weaker than expected consumption substantially drags 
down sssg below our expectations this would cause earnings downside risks 
also the competitive landscape for hypermarkets and 
department stores has far been stable major players 
focusing profitability thus intensifying competition 
price promotion increases could hinder margin expansion
