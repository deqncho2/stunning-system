what new our channel checks highlight how retailers are increasingly signing 
logistics leases directly with landlords and subsequently outsourcing the 
operations third party logistics provider rather than signing contract 
with that covers warehousing and logistics operations 
why does this matter for logistics landlords this has material implications all 
which suggest that least part the compression logistics property yields 
driven structural change rather than interest rates and here stay 
longer duration income the typical logistics operations contract three 
years and such many cases require break options embedded 
leases this new trend increasing income duration all else equal and therefore 
increases the multiple investment markets are willing pay such assets 
more diversified tenant base this trend should allow logistics landlords 
increasingly diversify the tenant base reducing the risk key tenant failures and 
increasing earnings security all else equal again increasing the multiple 
investment markets are willing pay such assets 
underscores the strategic significance well located logistics assets 
arguably the most important takeaway from this trend that confirms the 
strategic significance retailers are attributing having access well located 
logistics assets retail environment that increasingly multi channel 
how does this affect scale geography and balance sheets matter large 
contract logistics players like dpdhl and kuehne nagel have attractive 
portfolios and balance sheets invest adaptation navigating macro

disintermediation likely both from companies potentially establishing direct 
relationships with asset owners and from technology start ups exhibit noted 
above companies seeking warehousing may pursue direct agreements with property 
owners strategic locations and outsource the management facilities lower 
margin logistics companies alternatively price sensitive customers who lack the 
global scale command large discounts may choose start players who aggregate 
warehouse capacity availability online and allow online booking comparison space 
lower costs than major today that said most disintermediators are focused the 
road based and forwarding networks rather than warehousing fulfillment which

think disruption most likely smaller scale players that operate smaller 
geographic footprints lack capital invest and build expertise key locations and 
sector verticals and specialise warehousing contract logistics specifically doing 
business globally more complex and requires increased regional and local market 
expertise managing transportation and warehousing and adhering governmental 
regulations these increases supply chain complexity have driven many companies 
enlist the help logistics and regulatory specialists turn with expertise 
international transportation management and warehousing and distribution are 
providing economies with the operational backbone supporting global trade 
contract logistics margins major have improved recent 
years 
for most listed contract logistics solutions divisions have delivered lacklustre 
margins and returns recent decades they have tended underperform asset heavy 
areas like parcel express well air sea forwarding which notably higher margin 
and higher return typically the warehousing component contract logistics operates 
under multi year contracts which the systems and staff take over responsibility 
for critical logistics functions traditionally this segment asset based the 
take long term lease contracts for the facilities and equipment and certain 
locations are required take fte unionised workforces which limits flexibility 
thus when macro industry customer trends have weakened have often been 
left with cost structures that are longer supported consistent revenue streams 
the major have significantly overhauled their solutions business units the 
past few years this involved addressing underperforming contracts updating 
warehousing portfolios and customer vertical focus more toward commerce exhibit 
and investing technology reduce headcount needs they have also expanded 
their portfolio services beyond traditional out warehousing management include 
inventory management optimizing warehousing operations managing transportation 
routes and providers whether inbound outbound dealing with aftermarket returns 
kitting and sequencing unassembled parts providing support during manufacturing 
picking and packing finished goods and providing quality control and other value added 
services these investments have helped accelerate top line growth but also notably 
improve ebit margins from their solutions divisions over the past few years despite 
global market volatility exhibit

valuation methodology and risks 
sgro 
valuation methodology for our segro set our price target based 
nav valuation start from average base discount level which the level 
think reits trade across the cycle while not have long term data series for 
reits this tax structure was only introduced use dutch reits 
proxy over the last years dutch reits have average traded around nav 
discount narrow this reflect the fact the fundamentals for the logistic 
property market are strong stock specific basis adjust the base discount 
for segro development exposure such set our price target premium 
our estimated nav which gives our rounded target 
risks achieving price target think key upside risk further squeeze logistics 
rents significantly greater than expected demand more than offsets supply levels 
driving returns that are materially better than consensus assumes also demand for 
logistics and industrial space very much linked economic growth any major macro 
shock could undermine this and would therefore impact the shares performance
