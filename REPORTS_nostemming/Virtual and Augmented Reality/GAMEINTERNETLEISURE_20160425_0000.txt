forecast growth for gaming companies due the emergence 
online gaming select stocks evaluating ability migrate 
recurring businesses our top placed company based the 
outlook for overall game demand sony capcom well 
positioned among publishers 
estimate overall demand for game content will rise the 
previous cycle with the current console cycle generating fullfledged earnings from and extending least until the game 
industry growing appeal estimate the game market the current 
cycle will worth total hardware software 
with the scale contents over the full cycle our new 
game market model also was created with input from our gaming team 
online usage playstation network xboxlive through consoles will 
accelerate from and believe that result overall gaming demand 
will drive market expansion the online services provided for consoles 
have particularly high expectations game microtransactions and following 
that the businesses full downloads and subscriptions such game 
companies have likely lessened the risk earnings volatility stagnation 
down cycles and have made possible secure stable sales profits 
potential for valuation multiples change result higher quality 
growth the game market not sufficiently priced believe the 
stock market views the game business cyclical and concerned that game 
company earnings will suffer the other hand new 
monetization methods centering online console gaming use should offset 
any attenuation the hardware market thereby enabling continued growth 
the overall game market there are number sources growth for the 
overall game market and each firm period and scope earnings generation 
has expanded thus see potential for bear case valuation multiples climb 
for firms with higher exposure online console gaming 
positioning each firm based distribution value for online 
console gaming have categorized the game companies into the groups 
below tied this theme however japanese publishers have global market 
share only few percent and the scale their market smaller than for 
the american european companies thus their market shares are 
fragmented and there are strong winners result rather than the scale 
share the online console gaming market the focus for our analysis 
how the firm can change its earnings structure raising exposure online

reduced risk earnings volatility over the game console cycle 
envision shift the game console business from primary focus the game consoles competition for 
added value such contents and peripheral business due changes all levels the industry including 
demand development and distribution thus expect growing monetization opportunities from contents and 
more stable monetization cycle anticipate less earnings volatility risk platform companies and 
content suppliers with each change the generation game machines also think the new conditions 
should help prevent the type user migration that occurs for each game cycle and which has been issue for 
the overall game market 
game internet leisure and other contents april 
for sony particular yearly sell volumes appear falling more gradually than the previous cycle 
sell through volumes end march reached units our estimate expect annual sell volumes 
peak then decline and attribute these more stable 
yearly hardware sales volumes than previous cycles the increased usage downloadable content and 
streaming services playstation now flat rate playstation plus users and paying playstation network users 
addition see strong potential for the development non game content through video streaming services 
such vue and launch the playstation october broaden the user base this factor well 
should differentiate the market penetration from earlier game consoles 
foresee the following benefits for the overall industry from more stable and longer monetization cycle 
improved hardware profitability 
stronger content pipeline 
more online console additional stage for game software sales 
higher average customer spending due peripheral device additions 
online distribution non game contents 
just focusing the size the hardware cycle mainly game consoles does not address the full 
opportunity investors need fundamentally alter their view game consoles due the change 
console positioning 
expect the game hardware market excluding mobile games hold steady around roughly 
the previous cycle rapid adoption nintendo wii console and broadening user 
scope contributed substantially the increase cycle size also think strategies that differed from the 
existing path for game consoles lifted the cycle cyclical growth such the effort move beyond the 
console and emphasis maximizing the user experience bolstering the network project 
growth the game content market value basis compared the previous cycle due shift addedvalue competition 
review hardware generation changes through the xbox wii cycle reveals that hardware sales volume 
steadily increased from the previous cycle each time and game consoles fueled gains the hardware cycle size 
nintendo success broadening the definition game consoles contributed expansion the user segment 
the previous wii cycle expect decline the overall peak for sales volume the current 
console cycle previous cycle though this can mainly attributed the wiiu struggle after nintendo hit 
with the wii from value perspective meanwhile see steady growth the core game market due

superior capacity all other consoles developed date and was compatible with sophisticated graphics and 
high speed movement however think market penetration underperformed company expectations too 
much attention was paid originality and was not necessarily software developer friendly sony match 
for nintendo its ability develop consoles based enhanced house software development capability 
because electronics company such sony does not have the same ethos game specialty company like 
nintendo the ratio house software rarely exceeds sony which remains dependent third party

concept ultimately game console think sony based its strategy core user retention also 
sony corporate strategy hinges expanding recurring business above all prioritizes user retention

emerging from virtual reality 
year one the era 
three major game consoles are slated hit the market playstation htc vive and oculus rift 
with prices and launch schedules already announced though none the companies have offered official press 
releases they were increasingly offer services like mini movies that could allow users stream 
content then would likely see significant upside potential the content space japanese game software 
developers are pursuing into and beginning show demo versions software but concrete 
product launch schedules have yet emerge think many companies are taking wait and see approach 
until the penetration prospects for hardware products become clearer more than game developers and 
publishers have signed work products for the playstation including bandai namco konami 
capcom and square enix aside from demos bandai namco has already announced compatible product 
for the 
common use games will probably take time given the total spending required enjoy 
expect the market limited core gamers and early adopters near term 
given high hardware prices and the costs high spec pcs and other peripheral equipment expect 
games will catch first with early adopters but take while spread into common use comparing the three 
forthcoming hardware systems playstation probably has the advantage from price perspective the price 
the main box lower than the htc vive and the oculus rift and while the platforms used for both the other 
two systems require high spec the platform for the playstation compatible with the playstation 
which expect there are already machines use the end mar the take will probably 
fastest among existing owners 
terms content many different types developers are working games for the various platforms ranging 
from small indies the major developers console games and still not clear what kind line will 
see for each console from the announcements far however expect reasonable range titles for all the 
systems the question will really boil down quality addition sony development arm sie world wide 
studios major developers including ubisoft and bandai namco have already announced titles under 
development for the playstation with its own development studio and tie ups with third party 
developers sony has created environment that could easily give rise exclusive major titles more than 
playstation titles are development and the company plans release more than this year meanwhile 
the first the consoles the prototype stage was the oculus rift and also likely benefit 
from substantial line mainly from indie game developers with more than titles slated for release this 
year htc has not disclosed info such how many developers are working games for the vive but 
understand plans release titles when the hardware launches games for the vive are being jointly 
developed valve which game developer and operates the steam software platform think there

sony extended console life due online game market 
growth raises support multiples the field for our sotp analysis 
investment summary 
the growth the online console game market will positive for the valuation sony share price this 
because the lengthening the life cycle for consoles will lead directly more profit generating opportunities 
during the console lifecycle moreover the scope the contents that can provided will not limited 
games but will also expand include other earnings sources such movies and music thus think there 
will less earnings volatility compared the business model centered package type software our price 
target for sony uses sum the parts sotp analysis for the ebitda for the game network field 
employ the avg multiple for game software companies however think there will more opportunities for 
this valuation rise for the following reasons the firm will avoid sharp drop the valuation when the 
console generation peaks out and the division will take more the characteristics recurring type 
business 
playstation offers upside potential playstation which will launched oct priced 
which reasonable compared with competing products furthermore mar assume that the 
playstation will connectable with the which has penetration rate units thus see the 
playstation with the highest growth potential terms sales volume the other hand was reported 
that the time the launch playstation there will software titles available that can serve 
source earnings however the software prices were not released thus present cannot adjust our 
earnings model reflect this impact there strong probability that the playstation will make full scale 
contribution earnings from and have positioned this providing upside potential over the

forecast for sony volume key points for preparation our long term forecast were when the

smartphones difference with the generation that achieved major success however the 
surpassed units cumulative sales faster pace than the since its release november 
despite the current environment and reached units jan 
reason for upbeat sales attribute upbeat sales thus far narrowing the competitive field 
microsoft xboxone considering weak sales volume for successor wii after the wii console passed its sales 
peak cheaper pricing than xboxone from the outset the release and success 
sustaining sales shares even after follow price reduction xboxone due robust title supply because 
its realization vertical sales ramp and sudden rise sales volume that lifted the priority 
software development third party firms 
peak sales volume set peak sales volume for the units while reached units 
year the peak for and generations not find sufficient justification for use the past peak 
level due widespread use smartphone games explained above 
lifespan our main scenario applies lifespan for the that matches the length this stance takes 
into account improved satisfaction with console technology upgrades robust software title offerings and 
room for price reduction console specification shortfalls such graphics speed have largely disappeared 
and title volume network compatibility and pricing are wielding larger influence expect third party title 
volume reach peak later 
large cost savings room and extension the lifespan the attained profitability the gross profit 
level soon after the release and sony expanded sales volume further with price reduction october 
expect healthy progress hardware cost savings due economies scale from rising sales volume plus 
savings from new amd chip generations think these benefits should expand sony options such

understand nintendo planning for the and nintendo lead expansion its game

think that wants establish platform that allows for unique accounts centering nintendo the 
platform will accommodate all devices including smart devices and nintendo can approach wide variety 
users the value the platform likely recognized even third party developers establish 
nintendo platform and change its earnings structure believe nintendo will need see some hit 
game apps through its partnership with dena attract users smart devices with the top priority being 
securing user base not monetization and offer some attractive software for the which will prove 
earnings driver 
focus immediate purpose smart device apps expand nintendo unique users rather than 
generate profits 
nintendo plans launch new game apps excl miitomo the end however has not released 
any details such the ips that will used when the apps will available believe that the firm has lot 
ips that can used create new ways playing games such smash brothers and animal crossing but 
think that strategically more important over the short term that the firm increase its contact points with 
users visits the existing business than make profits from smart devices this because nintendo has 
already recognized from its experience with the game market the past that the contact points with users are 
cut with each console cycle even the game provider has the largest market share the console cycle for 
many years has already tried provide services for the game machine unit and the individual customer but 
these efforts have not been hugely successful 
regarding applications the first come out miitomo started japan mar and globally mar 
and the number downloads broke through the mark there believed high degree 
correlation between the number downloads and users valuation mobile game thus the expansion 
downloads can viewed positive for the share price the case miitomo the main elements for which

square enix raise turn bullish needs outline 
how will achieve profit levels beyond market expectations 
investment summary 
previously set our price target for square enix shares discount our estimated fair value our base 
case fair value given that much the outlook the company was riding what management ultimately 
would decide terms the details its medium term plan divulged may full year reporting leaving 
potential for projected profit levels fluctuate based the analysis this report however believe square 
enix faces less risk now earnings volatility thanks its growing exposure online gaming such now 
set our price target line with our base case fair value with our price target climbing from 
that said remain equal weight the stock become more bullish still requires the type new business 
plan that can propel earnings sustainably above market expectations that sense will watching what 
type info the company discloses full year reporting next month 
believe the following factors have already been discounted quite degree pipeline made 
leading titles and derivative titles and the construction new earnings pillar from the development 
leading for smart devices resulting stable sales over billion and over the medium term the 
potential for reach level within few years conditions for becoming bullish would include 
construction stable earnings base for mobile games china and mobile games north america 
now when looks like new record profits are longer goal come out with new numerical targets 
stronger investor rewards will watching full term results may for some kind update deus 
final fantasy from final fantasy vii remake kingdom hearts iii dragon quest etc also 
expect continued growth dlc sales 
full fledged monetization from steady growth stock with limited earnings downside 
square enix aims for balanced asset portfolio between mmo smart devices and hdd categories but our 
understanding that the company continues invest major hdd titles order maintain value 
square enix launched three major titles but and beyond the company has already 
announced that plans launch major new titles its main franchises from its japanese development studio 
including final fantasy and dragon quest and expect high degree pipeline transparency and high sales 
volume levels for game software dragon quest has its anniversary and final fantasy its 
anniversary and enthusiasm for the franchises themselves should act factor propelling sales 
growth expect square enix release final fantasy september and dragon quest 
will also watching for remakes old titles going forward including final fantasy vii remake 
addition due repeat sales major titles from expect continued growth dlc sales with 
improved profit margins the hdd game business titles from european and studios particular including 
deus are aimed european and markets with high downloaded sales ratios and expect sales 
contributions from downloads immediately from launch square enix launched just cause which 
has driven download sales the company sells hitman episodic distribution format and with capcom 
the company actively diversifying sales formats using downloads 
expect guidance for record profits the range given the possibility 
writedowns expect toward the top guidance but with neutral stock price impact 
expect toward the top guidance our estimate company guidance given 
real values the core business ought possible exceed the upper limit guidance comfortably but

bandai namco unique presence with business model growth engine 
different from other publishers new earnings contributions from asia catalyst 
investment summary 
like steady asian expansion growth area and the benefits the company earnings structure which 
stems from its licensing business model continue expect earnings growth medium term toy and 
game app expansion asia catalyst for the share price and maintain our rating short term risk 
factors include guidance that might start below market expectations but believe that this has been 
largely discounted the share price 
bandai namco business domain not console consumer games 
bandai namco does not have strategy investing large amounts console games and thus hard for the 
company benefit from increased earnings momentum the game market overall due the monetization 
phase the current console cycle believe the most important valuation axes for bandai namco are 
licensing model that makes use leading and increased sales the asian region over the medium term 
business development the early stage but asia the that bandai namco handles already has high 
profile and the environment place make marketing straightforward there are more and more examples 
titles such dragonball xenoverse and naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm that are hits overseas 
apr the company launched dark souls overseas markets 
using the european and sales networks atari which bandai namco purchased previously third party title 
sales are healthy and driving earnings the console game business expect game software sales 
the current cycle grow ahead and there increase inquiries for third party titles the company 
should benefit meanwhile believe dlc sales are growing but earnings contributions are still limited

for download times being developed rental service with fixed rates and subscription service 
month for three months there are currently more than games available play including 
more than that are exclusively for the the library gradually expanding and the company plans 
add and games over the long term cloud game services become more popular some software 
developers may able monetize their back libraries furthermore there may more sales opportunities for
