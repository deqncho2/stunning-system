smart glasses gain momentum 
smart glasses may take off over the past two years venture capital 
investments augmented reality and virtual reality startups have accelerated 
global platforms such google microsoft facebook apple sony 
and htc are either acquiring teams have plans commence smart headset 
production these microsoft hololens has the most mature

overweight 
himax well positioned strategic supplier key smart 
glasses oems our view acceleration the space should favor himax 
given its strength micro projector technology supported lcos chip 
that features small form factor and low power consumption notably himax 
has won projects from microsoft hololens and google glass the two most 
established smart glasses developers forecast that smart glass related 
sales will contribute himax revenues jumping from 
estimate that every increment lcos chip shipments generates 
revenue and eps interest smart glasses 
blooms think himax could significantly rate our bull case 
the street views himax lcd driver business drag earnings 
but view valuable asset himax generated its revenues 
from the lcd driver business this business buffeted weak 
and smartphone demand however expect himax usher 
new product cycle for this legacy business introducing its amoled driver 
and tddi products more importantly think the stable cash flow and 
customer base this business can help support the lcos business 
where could wrong the key downside risk our call potential 
project delay given the complexity smart glasses for example the 
hololens involves dozens customized components and the product 
assembly yield rate could low also remains seen when google will

key debates 
how big will the smart glasses market coming years 
market view the market divided this smart glasses are still emerging trend bears argue 
that even technology giant google was unsuccessful its first google glass project suggesting smart 
glasses will not proliferate bulls believe himax could benefit from the broad application microprojectors not only smart glasses but also automobiles and pico projectors smartphones 
our view believe that the emergence killer app for smart glasses would lead secular 
growth smart glasses demand have witnessed significant improvement hardware and 
software recent years such microsoft hololens particular see the potential for smart 
glasses used gaming applications xbox the future hololens needs two micro projectors 
lcos per box estimate himax will ship units lcos and units for 
hololens 
where could wrong inability the ecosystem does not grow fast expect 
persistently high prices devices make himax unable meet demand and unable ship many 
lcos expect 
microsoft hololens may leverage windows and xbox ecosystem microsoft views all its devices 
extension windows and part the windows ecosystem devices the windows ecosystem 
including the hololens are partly means showcase windows and better monetize windows 
microsoft ceo satya nadella expects the hololens will initially used enterprise commercial applications 
however believe microsoft will leverage its gaming ecosystem and xbox grow hololens sales the 
majority consumers will likely use hololens for gaming purposes and view the million active xbox 
users significant installed base for hololens 
while himax lcos capacity plan suggests million units hololens himax built quarterly 
capacity lcos chips two years ago but currently poorly utilized given its maximum 
capacity per year himax indicated may have expand capacity depending orders from key 
customer microsoft and forecast total units lcos will shipped manufacturers 
which will for microsoft hololens addition investment activity increasing these support 
our base case assumption smart glasses forecast around smart glasses 
our expectation that google will launch google glass himax set benefit from the 
launch microsoft hololens and google glass estimate himax ship lcos units and 
units 
what the bull case for himax other oems also introduce smart glasses products costs become 
more affordable the emergence killer app for daily life consumer devices would lead significant 
product cycle for the tech industry according himax has more than just two projects its pipeline

himax driver business cash cow 
market view himax revenue still comes from the lcd driver business which becoming 
commodity and facing more intense competition this business will continue suffer from margin 
pressure and become drag profits amid weak demand 
our view also think that himax lcd driver business seeing margin pressure however 
also expect himax continue develop new products such tddi and amoled driver ics thus 
believe that himax will outperform peers this business despite margin pressure 
where could wrong heavier than expected margin pressure from competition delayed 
demand tddi amoled driver and market share loss the driver business 
himax technology inc november 
himax well positioned compared with its peers expect himax leverage its relationships with local 
panel makers positioning well versus peers such novatek further its acquisition chinese driver 
company vsm march could benefit himax china local supply policy 
new products like amoled driver ics fuel the revenue growth momentum himax supplies samsung 
and chinese customers with small and medium driver ics for smartphone use with the introduction its own 
amoled driver august himax will start supplying samsung with this new product from 
expect this have benign impact himax margin amoled usually used high end smartphones 
which require higher specs and represent high barriers entry 
overall even with margin pressure and weak near term demand think himax can sustain its lcd driver 
margin around and grow least line with the industry view the lcd driver business 
valuable asset because offers stable cash flow and customer base develop himax lcos business

investment positives and concerns 
investment positives 
secular growth smart glasses believe will killer app for smart glasses and that will 
lead secular growth smart glasses demand based our expectation that microsoft and google will launch 
new smart glasses assume units smart glasses with around unit 
cagr given their large user base 
himax lcos solution competitive micro projector technology wearable devices texas 
instruments dlp technology another competing technology but himax lcos more ideal for wearables 
given lower power consumption and the smaller space needed among lcos vendors himax the only one 
that has reached scale production which believe the reason why microsoft and google chose himax 
key partner for micro projectors 
new product cycle smartphone driver ics the company started ship small volume tddi 
products late ahead competitors boe himax key customer for tddi amoled driver ics require 
more complicated design and himax will start supplying samsung with amoled driver ics 
believe himax amoled driver shipments will ramp along with samsung expansion its 
amoled panel shipments the chinese market 
strong position china panel makers himax has early mover advantage supplying china panel 
makers with driver ics currently himax major supplier boe believe himax can benefit from china 
panel makers aggressive capacity expansion plans 
investment concerns 
potential project delays from key customers the key downside risk our call the potential for project 
delays given the complexity smart glasses for example the hololens involves dozens customized 
components and the product assembly yield rate could low further google has not officially announced 
when will launch google glass 
margin pressure lcd driver ics the lcd driver design being commoditized and pricing appears 
the only factor differentiating key players like novatek fitipower and focal tech the same time 
china panel makers continue pressure vendors lower their prices expect lcd driver gross margins 
decline and 
customer concentration smartphone driver ics samsung accounted for himax revenue 
given samsung the process migrating its smartphone displays amoled with adoption now 
himax smartphone driver revenue dropped significantly such samsung accounted for 
revenue 
cis business facing strong competition industry leader sony global market share terms 
value dominates the high end cis business above while himax facing intense competition 
the market from omnivision samsung semi and toshiba addition most himax peers 
operate their own fabs and can thus compete price 
himax technology inc november 
earnings outlook 
lcd driver business mild recovery forecast lcd driver revenue decline yoy 
due weak panel demand and expect himax lose market share samsung for look for 
large panel driver demand recover with yoy revenue growth for smartphone ddi forecast 
yoy revenue growth amoled and tddi products gain traction see upside potential the 
company shows better execution the development new products 
lcos and wlo businesses strong surge expect himax win projects from microsoft hololens 
and google glass and estimate ship units lcos asp 
also expect the company increase production wlo products which act motion sensors smart glasses 
look for smart glass related revenue contribute himax revenue well above its 
revenue contribution 
gross margin stabilize while operating margin improve thanks larger revenue expect 
mild decline gross margin mainly dragged driver ics but expect gross margin recover 
new product lines tddi and amoled will carry higher margins himax operating margin was steady 
however forecast decline given the revenue shortfall its lcd 
driver business along with margin erosion with margin stabilization and better utilization lcos

appendix micro projector technology smart glasses 
micro projectors are used smart glasses project holograms onto the glass lens dlp and lcos are reflective 
micro projector technologies while lcd transmissive micro projector technology himax lcos more 
ideal projection technology for wearable devices our view given lower cost and space required 
lcos reflective projection 
lcos technology projects images via reflective lcos panels through light engines utilizes several dichronic 
mirrors that filter white light into red blue and green beams three lcos chips the three chips then control 
the liquid crystal small units reflect the needed light back lcos image quality better than lcds which 
use lcd chips because lcos circuitry behind the liquid crystal layer while lcds electronics surround the 
liquid crystals 
companies that use lcos technology include himax syndiant forth dimension displays sony holoeye 
systems epson and jvc today only himax has material lcos volume shipments because its strong liquid 
crystal know how well competitive costs comparison jvc lcos can provide high resolution images 
but this not key feature required smart glasses for meta information display 
dlp reflective projection 
dlp was developed texas instruments mems technology that modulates light using dmd 
each micromirror dmd represents pixel the screen and tilts two ways control whether not the 
beam will pass through texas instruments the only chip maker with dlp technology its dlp chipset supports 
full resolution 
shown exhibit below many companies have been developing lcos technology whereas texas 
instruments remains the sole supplier dlp technology such dlps asp remains relatively high compared 
with that lcos given this trend believe lcos can better adapt consumer products while dlp could 
used more industrial settings such head displays cars

according our microsoft analyst hololens will initially focus commercial use such design 
construction healthcare and enterprise collaboration applications however note that its minecraft demo 
the press conference caught people attention for its gaming consumer potential 
himax technology inc november 
the evolution from google glass microsoft hololens 
the industry first attempt smart glasses the google glass was not successful and the project was 
halted january although hololens has not yet hit the consumer market believe hololens could 
more successful than google glass given the following 
level the major difference between google glass and microsoft hololens the user connection 
the real world the level user interaction with reality google glass used more for information checking 
checking messages user location believe this because hololens computing power and dual lens 
design although trade off could higher costs 
more user friendly interface microsoft hololens gesture controller more intuitive than google voice 
command and touch pad hololens projects hologram that can manipulated different ways either 
gestures voice command most inputs google glass are from voice command and touch pad mounted 
the glass 
more mature ecosystem mentioned the developers are growing microsoft hololens 
demonstrates can used not only for gaming purposes but also business transforming how companies 
designers and creators work with three dimensional data bring products and information life addition 
when hololens ready microsoft can leverage its xbox gaming businesses where google does not have 
niche 
such think himax product cycle coming from microsoft hololens could stronger than that 
from the first generation google glass
