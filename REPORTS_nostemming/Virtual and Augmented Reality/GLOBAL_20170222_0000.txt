with mobile sensing opportunities appearing more certain 
and bigger than expected look size initial profit 
potential identify potential supply chain and give context for 
what early applications could 
sensing coming handset near you this fall looking likelier valuations 
across companies with sensing exposure have risen significantly the past 
few weeks following commentary from ceo alan lowe lumentum 
earnings call mentioning could imagine quarters million growing 
over billion related sensing this combined with commentary from 
other vendors the optical supply chain around revenue potential and 
large customer prepayment viavi the previous quarter have 
increased confidence that sensing will feature least one flagship 
device this fall with more come either this year the future 
profitability opportunity likely larger than originally estimated least 
initially december sized the market size the sensing opportunity 
high end smartphones for viavi and lumentum annually using 
combined asp split value between lite viav based the 
channel checks our china hardware team published last week where the entire 
sensing system could have asp higher once camera included 
think our original estimate appropriate our does not include the image 
sensor while feel like had tam sized correctly were likely more 
conservative with profitability given lite component should carry more semi like 
margins and viav has given more updated commentary have expanded our 
assumptions around profitability and asps within this note estimating that 
sensing could have eps impact lite annually and impact 
viav see exhibits within this report for eps sensitivity around 
asp margin share 
those with previous experience should leadership position but not 
without challengers the most popular volume application sensing 
technology date has been the microsoft kinect for the xbox jdsu provided 
the light source and filter for microsoft leaving the split jdsu viavi lumentum 
position proven technology providers believe viavi has more 
around their filter and expected able maintain share applications 
generations technology evolve given the number laser competitors talking 
about investments sensing and fab capacity think that share 
opportunity will tend eventually split over number vendors fnsr iivi 
have both been vocal matter what early share allocations are 
use cases give rise lots additional possibilities but still early days

gesture face recognition biometrics improved and video images body measurement 
well autonomous driving while not known exactly what upcoming 
smartphone releases will use sensing for lenovo tango phone utilized sensing 
for augmented reality purposes gaming digital modeling purposes additionally 
given that sensing can used for facial recognition the technology could also 
used for security purposes though would note that facial scan would likely take 
longer than fingerprint read slowing the unlocking process the phone would 
also note that apple recent purchase realface casts doubt whether facial 
recognition capability would available releases this year the below exhibit shows

high end smartphones sold annually around these phones are 
apple iphones initially believe that sensing features will limited high end 
smartphones very processor intensive application the lenovo phab pro ran 
specially designed qualcomm snapdragon with reviewers noting the tango

opportunity shown below are the accretion stock prices since the beginning the 
year while names like viavi had begun accrue value starting last year around this 
opportunity the steepest moves have been made post the most recent earnings period 
just looking the recent run these names these names had accrued 
market cap around sensing enthusiasm this about equal the opportunity 
around sensing high end smartphone applications with some very generous 
profitability assumptions see exhibit below this also foots lite comments that 
they could imagine quarters revenue given the annual 
opportunity think there are for vcsel high end smartphones 
maintain belief that viavi has better position around its filter and therefore 
better position maintain share margins future generations phones think the 
vcsel market more competitive lite iivi fnsr all having similar capabilities making 
outsized share profitability more difficult maintain future generations 
opportunities beyond smartphones not appear built yet however given the

what questions have before getting more positive reflecting future 
opportunities while acknowledge that sensing could large opportunity 
with variety use cases would like know the following before turning more 
positive 
will all high end phones have this technology just larger screen devices where 
gaming applications would more interactive this technology just large 
screen devices initially could represent downside what expectations today 
will smartphones outside the high end have the processing power accommodate 
this technology meaningful expansion opportunity can all phones but 
early lenovo tango phone use case gives confidence that technology will 
limited high end phones near term 
will use cases compelling enough keep customers engaged many use 
cases outside pokemon have had limited traction date given the 
technology has been slow glitchy this were continue may slow 
widespread adoption 
how fast will other applications developed was noted that handset vendors 
have been working sensing opportunities for upwards years and 
finally turning real opportunity they expected similar timelines for alternative 
applications many which are only year into development could leave 
window between handset and more general adoption 
how competitive will vcsel market following the commentary from finisar 
their last earnings call the vcsel can more interchangable than typical 
semiconductor technologies result think that margins while good will 
settle more competitors get capacity just with smartphones changes 
shares margin could make difference eps potential for lumentum alone 
will viavi able hold dominant share viavi has touted their advantage the 
filter marketplace many times given will largely determine whether the eps 
opportunity initiatially would like see more around ability 
protect positioning before turning more positive 
impact lite viav please see accompanying price target change notes for lite and 
viav for more detail are raising the lite from and viav 
from remain lite and viav are increasing the eps contribution 
attributable the upcoming mobile opportunity for lite and for 
viav explained the accompanying notes while first run opportunities could 
larger for mobile opportunities think these eps contributions represent reasonable 
medium term expectations 
impact himax himax expect their business doe diffractive optical elements 
which made from wlo wafer level optics technology will ramp early 
the company didn confirm whether related apple iphone this year despite 
preparing new capacity for the potential demand don think wlo unique 
technology because cmos image sensor vendors for example omnivision has 
developed its cameracubechip which applies semiconductor stacking methodology 
fabricate wafer level optical elements layers wafer structure some cmos 
wafer foundries such tsmc also possesses wafer level optics know how there 
are dedicated optical solution venders such heptagon and anteryon who provide 
wafer level optics some value adds from wlo could come from the equipments 
and don hear any shortage wlo equipment 
therefore think there should certain level competition himax doe 
business even the potential market size will large coming years our view that 
the doe should the key wild card for himax revenue and and are 
assuming shipment units and units respectively based asp 
however given the likely margin pressure and opex increase maintain our 
eps estimates similar and keep our rating 
impact innotek believe that sensing features will limited the iphone 
oled this year for the company more expensive processor intensive 
application lgi the main assembler modules with implied share based 
what management expects achieve assuming our estimate for the entire 
module including camera forecast revenue opportunity for 
lgi this year and estimate that sensing could have impact lgi 
the upside could faster eventual deployment all iphone models and other 
android high end smartphones given the company only involved the assembly 
the module operating margin could the range mid high single digits 
impact other related supply chain asia vcsel cmos sensor designs are 
dominated europe leading players but expect manufacturing work could 
potentially allocated asia once the adoption increases for production efficiency and 
cost benefits the related supply chain includes win semi and truelight for chip 
processing elaser for testing tong hsing for cmos sensor wafer restructuring and 
chroma for related testing equipment any near term contribution not likely 
meaningful but believe could long term business driver assuming sensing 
adoption expands from smartphones automotive iot etc believe tong hsing will 
one the beneficiaries this year and epistar with vcsel exposure could benefit

leaders next generation consumer electronics virtual and augmented reality well the automobile industry are looking laser based sensing enhance capabilities and 
enable new applications 
while not significant second quarter revenue our third quarter guidance shipped our first revenue into what believe high volume mobile device application 
sensing related 
far longer term sensing been talking about mobile devices for probably three years and are looking forward that actually turning into revenue think 
kind that same range automobiles taking that kind time been working with automobile manufacturers for the better part year now and probably couple years out 
before anything meaningful contributes our revenue onthat application 
would say that the market multiple times bigger than the kinect business and could imagine quarters million plus type marketplace growing over billion would 
expect get into multiple mobile devices and multiple customers with mobile devices 
would say that lumentum competitive advantage that have been the consumer electronics space shipping sensing products for the last eight years have figured out 
how make sure design product and test accordingly make sure don have any defective parts would say that are the only one the world that has track record 
understanding sensing and the reliability requirements associated with that the other side there enough demand for more than one supplier per application and would 
say fact there probably need for more than one supplier per application just because the sheer volume these devices and not disappointed that competing 
well possible some these sensing projects could turn into revenue and particularly the second half but think there lot uncertainty that goes with any 
them terms consumer products and which ones they will introduce and what features and whatnot anyway think the numbers are incredibly exciting but think and 
think good enough bet that are spending lot money facility expansion spending money hire people are ramping production our production capability and 
think that there are number places where this sensing going exciting consumer application 
margins related sensing think there are likely some that are going above the company average think possible there may some that are slightly below 
don know what the average margin for that product line going just tell you that think going accretive very nicely profitable and potentially there lot 
leverage because comes from fixed cost facility big fab 
sensing something that been working for years have had number smaller customers and really hasn moved the needle much terms revenue but over 
the last year maybe months discussions number consumer based industries have really heated and result think that there likely significant revenue and 
upside for next calendar year for sure 
question whether sensing could achieve gross margins think there are some applications that are like that but the consumer industry such that volumes are high the 
negotiations are tough and expectations are that and many these cases the oems are trying make sure that they have specifications that are interchangeable between 
suppliers that that many cases the packages are the same the outputs are the same the configurations are the same you can have multiple sources for drop product and 
that little different than lot the industry where you and try spec your chip into slot design but once you have won that design win then very difficult get you 
out and almost nobody else the industry has exactly the same pin out that you requires design change replace you even bring second source you have have 
second board design anyway think that most these consumer companies are trying make sure that they have designed from the beginning that they have multiple suppliers and 
interchangeable suppliers think there reason believe that the sky high margins the industry might not possible these consumer applications but think the margins 
will quite good and think the business will quite profitable 
finally are adding capacity over the next couple quarters our vcsel laser fab allen texas this will enable pursue several new consumer applications for sensing

timing shipments let just talk about timing timing for the beginning shipments the second half calendar least that what understand kind all 
indicators now and have worked with lot customers the potential that sensing potentially has whole wide variety applications and consequently because also 
don control the launch dates are not really speculating what think the initial applications will 
most the vcsels that sell sell bare die and would say that our advantages include world class design team ability understand and translate customer requirements 
quickly into set products and form factors that are required them and then able scale and ramp the volumes meet their requirements 
believe that there considerable interest and commitment add functionalities that require semiconductor lasers and the plan that running hard anticipates beginning 
realize the opportunity the back half the calendar year are really excited about the opportunity that lies before can continue invest equipment facilities new 
employees and the development the technology your point earlier just come back straight yes are adding considerable amount capital equipment both enable 
have the targeted capacity that can fully utilize the other assets that have 
obviously mentioned earlier into high volume production for the type filters takes capital investment the reactors and some the back end the line processing 
not going and spend money like drunken sailors and build factory hoping they will come have very strong intellectual property differentiation and industry 
have believe the best technology the market and our customers recognize and more partnership with our customers saying hey will ahead and implement 
capacity and will deploy for you 
regaring timing said have been this business particular with the ramps the mobile devices for quite bit previous jobs and there always flippage schedules 
prudent did not really hype communicate that this point but think are getting closer the point where the production ramp will start materialize and would just 
say that second half this calendar year where looking and will depend the customer readiness other vendors whether comes sooner later the second 
half said get closer the beginning our june quarter will communicating more color these opportunities they get closer into our gunsight 
sensing major new market for high value sensing where see ams unique position play significant role going forward sensing umbrella term which consists 
broad range applications visible today this includes augmented reality and virtual reality gesture face recognition biometrics improved and video images body measurement 
well autonomous driving also firmly believe that the availability consumer devices will breed new applications and apps similar what happened accelerometers and 
gyro the non consumer area expect follow the second step particularly industrial iot and automotive applications 
there are three key technologies for sensing first structured light second time flight and third stereoscopic cameras structured light incorporates the infrared illumination 
object gain information here the accuracy the illumination key the quality sensing time flight comprises two key approaches the called spad technology based 
avalanche diodes the itof based phase difference sensing for both dedicated illumination again high importance achieve sensing performance stereoscopic cameras 
also need specific illumination the object for high quality sensing results looking ams now see ourselves broadly involved across all these sensing technologies which are 
beginning shape into existing applications 
you remember said will have significant revenue growth the second half this year now being three months further ahead can more precise and that why 
can confirm that strongly believe the full earn out will achievable 
profitability think little bit early make that call but said you look our business that performed with about roughly ebit margin adjusted and said 
going accretive you can expect substantial contribution the second half this year

let try differentiate wlo against depth then wlo has many applications mentioned obviously sensing one them but other 
types machine vision and obviously guide application for our for devices being also among the major applications one should not 
necessarily connect wlo directly with and only with depth sensing 
offer total solution working just mentioned the previous working with semiconductor soc platform player where basically 
provide total solution covering the projector side use our wlo technology make the optics most specifically how call our diffractive 
optical element doe that the optics then from third parties and have and they require extremely high level precision line the 
optics and together also have development partners for that that also unique technology for that together the laser with 
alignment the optics that forms the projector with the protector you basically project and invisible image the surroundings the image the 
object gets bounced back then you have the sensor the side receive 
have outstanding performance the sensor well where believe are the number one the world speak with optical 
performance good twice our competitors you have the protector and you have the receiver then now you need the algorithm 
calculation figure out the best the best map your surroundings are working with our partner also developed chip for the 
algorithm you put the protector and the sensor sensor and the algorithm you put them together and then you have total solution such 
depth sensing 
everything goes planned will see revenue and bottom line contributions from the new wlo investment starting the second half
