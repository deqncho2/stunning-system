overall vertical growth drivers remain muted but forecast 
returning industry revenue growth next year still 
prefer semicaps over semis for now and have enthusiasm for 
emerging growth themes adas but expect the focus 
remain post consolidation improvements cash flow 
the last two years have seen transformation the global semiconductor 
industry despite industry growth either the lack 
growth amid rising capital intensity accelerated unprecedented wave 
consolidation that think reaching the later innings competition abated 
and many companies turned inward great effect looking for opportunities 
improve governance cutting costs raising prices driving economies scale 
exiting poor businesses and returning more cash shareholders our view 
better governance drove significant semiconductor stock outperformance despite 
the lack growth 
and yet the significant growth albeit from small base the embryonic 
market for artificial intelligence particularly machine learning seems likely 
provide accelerant other green shoots that were already starting 
flourish areas such internet things and automotive driver assistance which 
rely heavily the analysis visual data that machine learning handles well 
should take step forward this year the centralization cloud spending 
creates potential for competition and experimentations into alternative 
ecosystems markets that have until recently started stagnate 
still see this primarily value group and favor many the stocks that 
are beneficiaries historic consolidation such avago analog devices 
beneficiaries traditional cyclical drivers such tsmc global memory and 
global semiconductor capital equipment don really see iot adas 
dramatically changing the near term growth prospects for industry 
but are increasingly focused how better job capturing growth 
from those new areas well 
key semiconductor issues focus for 
emerging secular growth drivers for semis artificial intelligence nvda 
xlnx autonomous driving internet things mchp and 
virtual augmented reality himax nvda 
expect fundamentals remain positive for dram and semicap 
and lrcx

investment summary region 
global semis 
overall after two flat revenue years see industry growth returning 
mostly function slightly easier comparisons early the year and the ongoing 
rebound memory markets with much easier memory comparisons 
outside memory still see cyclical volatility being held mostly bay with 
continued low lead times relatively good product availability broader markets with 
tactical quarter quarter volatility but not the extended boom bust lead time cycles 
the past 
see memory markets stronger but the strength commodity 
semiconductors does present some risk larger vertical markets overall dram 
nand and flat panel prices rise does the incentive for customers hold more 
inventory strong dollar and rising commodity prices also drive end market price 
inflation emerging markets which could impact demand believe that saw 
some accumulation the channel inventories were extremely lean mid 
year then recovered around commodity stability 
globally continue prefer semicaps over semis given the benefits that accrue from 
better memory markets continued sovereign spending drivers china and ongoing 
capital intensity pressures would highlight that have moved asml the top 
the global preference list semicaps given the impending viability euv and the 
peaking sequential shipments the semicap vendors 
within semis our global large cap preferences lean tsmc memory vendors samsung 
hynix and micron and beneficiaries asml applied materials and lam research post 
restructuring values avago and analog devices and looking the automotive 
recovery renesas 
japan semis 
globally forecast the semiconductor industry grow and prefer semi 
caps over semis however within japan remain highly selective semi and semi cap 
stocks due individual factors for wfe names expect tel benefit from 
aggressive nand capex but whether the company can further gain share 
etchers and deposition equipment remains unclear and thus keep our rating our 
top pick within japan semis renesas key semi name anticipation the age 
autonomous driving renesas design amount the automotive field has been 
recovering after bottoming takes four five years for products from 
design mass production this field the sales impact design ins may still not 
very visible however with recovery from the impact the kumamoto 
earthquake and the consolidation intersil would expect upturn sales 
and steady earnings while numerous companies are proactively investing automotive 
semis anticipation adas and autonomous driving believe renesas can maintain 
its solid position with its competitive edge automotive control related products 
korean semis 
industry conditions have improved sharply since for both memory and display 
panels due supply constraints reflecting extended period under investment 
higher content per device and very inventory levels while remain upbeat the 
coming quarters expect display panels reach cyclical peak terms yoy 
revenue growth towards late and for memory given that the market tends 
focus mainly inflection points for these cyclical industries would look take 
profit valuations move past mid cycle levels near term however currency tail winds 
and the earnings revision breadth inflecting since the last quarter suggest consensus 
estimates remain relatively low for earnings and the sectors are likely continue 
outperform further upward revisions eps expect more stability 
the mobile device market growth matures and move past samsung note recall 
which should benefit high end markets platform loyalty becomes more important 
demand have recovered price elasticity and promotions but expect thougher 
comparisons into late panel cost pressures and the lack any major sport events 
uefa champions league and rio summer olympics demand recovery emerging 
markets also seems less robust given weaker local currencies 
strong product cycles include oled amoled adoption has surpassed the 
global smartphone display market this year share unit terms with samsung 
taking share samsung expects its oled revenues grow more than 
from over this year with broadening amoled samsung mid low end 
smartphones chinese smartphone and iphone adoption rising global 
adoption amoled mobile panels mainly driven the technology enabling form 
factor versatility for smartphone makers looking differentiate their products along 
with lower power consumption ltps screens and thinner form factor the 
absence backlight chinese japanese competition remains challenged due very 
low yield and estimate samsung will maintain over share the global mobile 
oled panel market and see limited capital allocation leaving display 
unlikely respond quickly see the adoption flexible oled display widening and 
potential for smartphones with foldable displays drive new growth cycle 
for the market expect oled penetration the lcd market accelerate 
production scales drive costs reach attractive price points 
our stock picking strategy maintain sector exposure through stock specific 
opportunities feel most comfortable owning samsung electronics the 
stock offers attractive growth compelling valuation with several potential upside 
opportunities roe improvement headroom meaningful higher capital returns and 
potential group restructuring believe the company has room surprise the 
margin and forecast eps growth and this due 
stronger pricing memory accelerating top line growth cost efficiencies are coming 
through and operating leverage improving for samsung trades eps and 
which would view undemanding also continue recommend 
hynix memory pure play the continued tightness dram industry supply 
that see where could wrong the stock more correlated 
dram prices could see the cyclical growth momentum pace peak cash 
return expectations are high for samsung and iii samsung risk has strong systematic 
component that goes along with its large concentration relative korean equity 
portfolios 
greater china semis 
logic foundries are well positioned tsmc the key enabler for the higher 
performance semiconductors and autonomous driving our view the 
company set goal delivering sales cagr for believe 
tsmc can reach another high bar off very strong likely addition intact leading edge business development 
our recent checks with equipment vendors suggest that tsmc may further increase

the volume growth finger print adoption smartphone significant grow thanks 
mobile payment trend prefer technology leader egis 
nanya tech niche player for dram upcycle nanya stock has lagged global dram 
industry peers year date given its lower leverage commodity dram prices 
however have reviewed nanya potential earnings upside and the long term 
competition risk and now think the stock risk reward looks favorable the key 
upside our earnings forecast that specialty dram prices have moved recently 
given the ongoing shortage overall dram supply nanya tech guided that its 
dram asp could increase around but think increase likely and 
that this upward price trend likely last into chinese dram competition 
discussed the later section remains the long term concern but this still remote 
exhibit leading edge foundry process roadmap

european semis 
europe stay highly selective semiconductor stocks and believe equipment 
player asml could benefit more from the big drivers coming years stemming from 
cloud artificial intelligence autonomous driving european semiconductor companies are 
highly geared towards automotive but not the main beneficiary the trend towards 
autonomous due limited product exposure mostly radar meanwhile the 
automotive market has been extensively driven cheap credit recent years which has 
benefited the european semis names materially and see risk both estimates and 
valuation when the cycle turns 
infineon our key underweight and regard peak earnings and peak valuation 
risky combination for cyclical business acknowledge that the automotive semis 
industry has been strong recent years automotive financing has provided clear 
support for end demand both terms units but more importantly mix history 
repeats itself and turn towards normalization autos see material impact 
profitability and cash generation for infineon which still highly cyclical company 
our view 
asml our preferred pick semi capital equipment being the main driver moore 
law among equipment players and the prerequisite for artificial intelligence and big data 
deployed scale asml new euv tools will drive the next major technology 
transition semiconductors and required shrink the next transistor nodes 
and below asml currently ramping euv orders and believe could 
inflection point with additional volume purchase agreements among key customers 
intel already signed vpa back given the ramp euv forecast earnings per 
share treble between and the company extends its market leadership 
with euv with close market share leading edge nodes 
semis 
have generally been surprised the continued outperformance semiconductor 
stocks lackluster growth environment there are still few growth drivers 
aggregate for our big cap stocks with the exception surge specialty gaming 
nvda portions intel amd and stronger memory trends after weaker 
which has been major theme should less prevalent going forward the asset 
combinations simply seem less likely going forward see continued strength the 
machine learning and memory themes and think that the enthusiasm for machine 
learning will broaden out names such xilinx 
semi cap equipment 
have attractive industry view the semicap space and have overweight 
rating both lam research and applied materials though acknowledge tug 
war between quarterly fundamentals that are likely peaking only because there 
are much business falling into that quarter that going tough repeat not 
because expect industry deterioration thereafter still think these stocks offer 
better growth prospects than semis over the next three years given increasing capital 
intensity arms race both foundry and nand memory and share gains for both 
stocks their served markets both grow faster than the market overall see 
semicaps primary beneficiary the china sovereign semiconductor development 
whatever form that ultimately takes also see valuations discount peers 
while acknowledge the trade off higher quarter quarter unpredictability 
think that higher risk profile ultimately pays off higher rewards 
key semi stock calls 
overweight 
global memory samsung hynix micron nanya remain convinced that dram will 
remain tight through even capital spending reaccelerates nand will bit 
more mixed with price declines needed some point stimulate demand 
for micron specifically see the story combination commodity strength and 
company specific turnaround believe that the aggressive migration nand from 
planar costing the company cents quarterly eps which should lead 
substantial leverage those costs fade over the course 
samsung electronics expect samsung continue 
outperform despite the rally the stock ytd and the thesis our 
positive view include one the fastest earnings growth story for 
mega cap stock roe improvement headroom meaningful significantly 
higher cash returns holdco optionality which could lead substantial rating 
and given upward revisions eps the stock likely continue outperform 
for samsung trades eps and with roe out 
this would and which would view 
undemanding our eps estimates are higher than consensus and factor 
stronger memory business which adds incremental revenue and profits 
and display upside revenues and profits mainly from amoled 
pricing power appears everywhere for the incrementally more robust memory 
business due supply constraints for dram and nand transition challenges 
not expect dram supply catch demand any time soon the industry 
remains underinvested due diminishing benefits from technology migration inventory 
depletion for both producers and customers and continuous increase density per 
device samsung remains ahead all competitors with production seen 
total output and fourth generation layer nand contributing the 
mix the end stronger pricing memory accelerating top line growth cost 
efficiencies are coming through and operating leverage improving 
hynix remain constructive hynix the 
dram outlook has improved sharply with demand growth continuing into from all 
applications including mobile and server while supply growth remains tight and 
limited continued technology migration finer geometry management continues 
focus profitability over market share gains with bit growth guidance below 
migration continues ramp smoothly with output year end and this provides higher cost reduction and together with higher bit and asp 
growth forecast dram operating margin surpass but well below 
levels seen the peak the company nand outlook has improved new 
smartphone launches and higher density growth continues drive demand while emcp 
revenue also historical highs with demand coming from china meanwhile limited 
supply growth planar nand and uncertainties around nand mass production 
should boost asp and margins while model nand bit growth 
based management guidance see upside based the ramp nand 
fab converted from planer nand and the second floor expect nand 
margins slightly over break even despite reductions due uncertainties 
production 
gobal semicaps asml asml lam research lrcx applied 
materials amat see upside for intrinsic valuation despite fading 
quarterly momentum memory strength the key driver see significant upside for 
eps expect memory stays strong quarterly momentum likely peaks 
which can challenge for stocks for the year but only because 
convergence strong shipment activity not because fundamental 
deterioration one key dynamic are watching globally the validation asml euv 
technology think that the ramp euv challenge for the competitors 
the and beyond time frame higher share spending shifts back towards 
lithography result rank asml above the other two stocks from here 
various stages have preferred amat lrcx the last months while amat 
and lrcx should have strong product offerings that benefit from euv 
inescapable conclusion that litho regains share spend our view 
analog devices adi view setting for breakout year for adi 
the pending and highly synergistic acquisition lltc adds already strong 
organic growth story importantly see the narrative the stock evolving reach 
broader set investors following the footsteps texas instruments the 
combination adi lltc screens very favorably relative the top 
oms and more than the fcf generation estimate that linear will add 
run rate eps representing accretion furthermore view the 
targeted savings conservative bar represents only combined costs 
most semi deals the range and doesn include potential savings from 
potential manufacturing footprint consolidation lastly our accretion analysis doesn 
include any contribution from cross selling opportunities linear strongest small 
and medium sized customers and power management relative adi stronger 
traction with larger customers and data converters highlight that every 
incremental growth would add eps 
broadcom avgo think the biggest debate for the stock the 
valuation multiple where see optionality rate higher the median 
semiconductor stock multiple expansion was compared for avgo 
broadcom viewed strong operator and savvy acquirer although sentiment has 
evolved that the company consolidation cost reduction play that needs find the 
next big deal move the needle our view this has weighed the stock valuation 
multiple further compounded the perception avgo having high wireless exposure 
even though that market represents only sales today down from peak 
nearly the other hand the company dominant lead networking and 
wireless and duopoly businesses many parts storage and cable set top boxes 
does not appear appropriately priced into the stock leaving bullish the 
opportunity avgo from here 
microchip technology mchp following very strong for the stock the 
pace outperformance could bit more measured from here that said are 
sticking with our overweight call our eps estimates are above the street 
more continue see opportunity for microchip build its strong track 
record key driver enhancing shareholder returns the company 
should benefit from inflection the iot market sales leveraging 
strong portfolio key building blocks such mcus connectivity security and analog 
also think the company analog business annual run rate the size 
linear tech under appreciated microchip ranked our recent survey 
design engineers for cross selling analog along with mcus management has 
identified attach rate opportunity for analog atmel mcu business which 
could help extend the strong eps accretion that deal the coming years

tel stock has made ground for the and

small cap growth stories ambarella amba cavium cavm and 
inphi iphi continue see multiple expansion for companies with clear 
growth drivers and expect such growth drivers emerge for all three companies 
for ambarella will see the introduction computer vision chips that 
meaningfully change the strategic value the company and for cavium and inphi 
see series new growth products with primary exposure new markets enabled 
the cloud 
xilinx xlnx moving year ago the focus some xilinx bulls was 
the high strategic value the company franchise the context consolidating 
industry the stock has modestly underperformed the substantial semiconductor rally 
since then activity has focused other subsectors and yet the fundamental 
outlook for the company has improved think for reasons machine learning 
continues evolve see the market for inference moving away from 
microprocessors and towards specialty solutions including xilinx fpgas well 
graphics and other specialty chips potential for share gains improving have 
seen the company stretch its lead over intel altera the two most recent 
manufacturing nodes and generally see the overall growth fpgas modestly 
improving base stations fade importance and new technologies start penetrate 
autos factories and data centers 
underweight 
intel intc consensus comes down for the growth rate data center 
which has been our area concern are leaning towards being less cautious but 
like see the company lower its data center long term targets its february 
analyst day lower while buy side sentiment already setting higher 
targets has consistently disrupted expectations for the stock and possibly set the 
wrong incentives for the organization see intel having challenging year data 
center least qualitatively see early penetration from amd with zen and nvidia 
continuing build its deep learning ecosystem 
skyworks solutions swks reiterate our underweight swks modeling 
below average growth relative peers qrvo and avgo skyworks lack premium 
baw fbar filters places the company competitive disadvantage avgo and 
qrvo who are much better position capture the next growth cycle carrier 
aggregation addition decelerating pace growth skyworks slowing 
smartphone units growth and oem pressures reduce component costs could cap 
gms modest miss experienced and ultimately lead erosion also stress 
that skyworks underspending qrvo and avgo percent sales 
for peers which presents longer term risk gms and could also explain 
some the early signs slower growth relative basis 
infineon ifxgn infineon will continue have volatile earnings profile 
coming years due exposure cyclical end markets believe the automotive 
market close its peak after several years credit fuelled expansion meanwhile 
other material segments such smartphones and chip cards are maturing while 
infineon has benefitted from the recent growth the underlying market there has been 
lack operational leverage and thus margins have remained mid cycle levels 
around and margins will likely contract rapidly the cycle turns believe the 
main reason for lack margin expansion due continuous price pressure the 
concentrated customer base combined with the structurally high capex rate the 
company which double that peers and limits the companies cash generation 
infineon trades peak valuation multiples sales ebitda and 
which incorporates significant risk due the cyclical nature the company 
maxim mxim remain underweight mxim relative our coverage 
universe although are less negative following substantial underperformance the 
stock ytd the sox and median gain our universe the 
company has done good job reducing opex and expanding gms improved from 
but growth remains elusive namely the drag for its 
consumer business company sales holding back growth from other markets 
like autos sales this important uptick overall growth likely 
needed drive further margin expansion from here 
mxim has been subject potential takeout chatter rapidly consolidating 
semiconductor industry which remains wildcard for the stock the company recent 
capital allocation strategy has been centered increasing its dividend 
cagr and opportunistic buybacks while maxim has completed number tuck 
deals volterra genasic sensordynamics and phyworks doesn have much show 
for these efforts and remains seen the company will pursue larger ideals 
headlines this summer suggested had looked intersil who agreed acquired 
renesas for 
advantest jpy remain underweight advantest expect 
soc testers decelerate next year increase production soc devices for 
chinese smartphones has led the lengthening test time and increase soc tester 
demand our asia team expects growth chinese smartphones slow down 
for devices the next volume zone for soc testers think the volume 
ramp and the relevant soc tester demand lengthening test time will not emerge 
until while expect upside nand testers amid aggressive nand capex 
don see sufficient offset the decline for soc testers which the 
company focus product and yields high margins 
revisited fundamentals and stock performance 
fundamentals were slightly below our expectations entering the year but 
strengthened the year went had projected revenue growth for the year 
but through the first months the year per sia numbers that have been reported 
revenues have declined and project roughly flat revenues for the year for 
the second consecutive year this reflects broader based markets such analog and 
microcontrollers growing low mid single digits offset declines commodity 
memory mostly reflecting tougher conditions the first half the year 
for the larger companies similarly saw eps performance relatively unsurprising 
with significant exceptions applied materials and nvidia were the standout 
performers from eps side with eps upside from both though nvidia saw 
expansion rising estimates while amat saw mild compression consistent with the 
cyclicality the revenue stream exhibit and exhibit addition broadcom 
continued deliver consistent eps upside and microchip posted strong eps upside 
the back the atmel deal 
generally multiplies climbed across the board more than the broader market which 
different from prior years where semiconductor expansion mirrored the broader 
market attribute this ongoing which has generally not always benefitted 
both the acquired and acquiring companies the emergence new growth drivers 
learning autonomous driving and strength gaming hardware improved business 
momentum over the course and the recovery memory which drives increased 
capital spending well this all retrospective rationalization fairness did not 
project another year multiple expansion particularly relative the market and 
does raise the broader risk profile going forward

semis there were two primary surprises 
the emergence deep learning important trend nvidia explosion sales 
graphics engines into hyperscale cloud customers ranks one the bigger surprises 
this year even with constructive backdrop that opportunity did not foresee 
hundreds millions incremental revenue coming from that opportunity this year 
each passing week saw new indications the importance these trends and 
emerged the key workload for markets divergent autonomous vehicles 
facebook photo tagging and visual search see this continuing throughout with 
nvidia remaining the drivers seat for training technology see year 
where specialized inference chips start become sold and expect nvidia and 
xilinx establish the early momentum that segment though see intel 
beneficiary inference spending well 
the recovery memory upgraded global memory stocks early 
after several years neutral cautious views the sector but even were 
surprised the sharp upward revisions commodity parts the second half the 
year always put hours into analytical models supply demand analysis but the 
one factor that remains the most important particularly around inflections the 
changes customer inventory behavior overall capital spendign ended only slightly 
higher than where started the year but dram was lower and nand higher the 
strategic nature the nand transition siphoned off dram cash flow result 
see decelerating dram supply growth which should favorable lead 
indicator 
the end year like examine our forecast coming into the year for important 
divergences from our estimates exhibit shows this data for our forecast actuals 
note that our forecast would likely have been considered optimistic memory 
most 
overall the industry was flat our forecast growth the biggest factor 
dampening growth global gdp was pricing pressure particularly memory areas 
where top line growth most reflect economic growth such analog kept pace with 
nominal growth logic declined slightly the ongoing decline asics offset 
substantial growth graphics slight growth microcontrollers and flattish year 
microprocessors 
ironically memory qualifies both the biggest positive qualitative surprise above but 
drove quantitative shortfall price declines the first half were more substantial 
than had thought with nice recovery and note also that much the 
qualitative commentary around better pricing tends the margins and takes time 
become pervasive stickier segments mobile tier one oem

semiconductor and semicap forecast 
while see the group returning growth after basically two flat years 
hard escape the conclusion that semis remain sector where growth going 
oscillate around gdp growth rates for the next several years note that the last 
year cagr has been barely outpacing the growth rate inflation over that time and this five year period included the growth smartphones into dominant 
computing form factor which unlikely provide the same tailwind going forward 
and tactically with inventory replenishment bigger vertical markets pcs 
smartphones late there some risk inventory reduction headwinds 
exacerbated stronger dollar driving price increases emerging markets the first 
half 
later this report highlight several growth drivers adding those already place 
internet things artificial intelligence automotive driver assistance are excited 
about all them but practically speaking none them provides much acceleration 
industry with several headwinds place also add that industry 
consolidation likely does add growth somewhat have seen several instances 
companies raising prices where competition less factor however this offset 
the return competition segments that have not seen for while such 
microprocessors 
there are couple reasons that see return growth 
ongoing improvement memory with particularly easy comparisons 
our growth comes from memory with the biggest outperformance coming 
early the year see dram remaining tight all year though undoubtedly spot prices 
will not rise every day through the year have seen the last months nand 
unlikely remain tight while less worried than consensus about supply 
growth looking for supply growth remain about the trend line but 
demand unlikely grow without price declines some point and price 
declines will likely lead inventory reduction have seen historically 
see overall memory returning declines though still expect good 
earnings year for memory 
easier comparisons broader markets see analog growing high single digits 
start compare against mild emerging market correction early 
similarly data center markets see easy comparison after weakness cloud 
spending 
the offset could mild inventory reduction with rise commodity pricing 
memory have seen greater willingness from customers hold inventory the 
risk shifts towards not holding enough and the cost depreciating inventory mild 
think that companies the highest volume verticals pcs and phones are likely 
incented carry bit more inventory than they were when commodity prices were 
falling and typically this helps both commodity and non commodity components 
secular growth accelerators will not add much industry growth though they 
will again create stock opportunities are very enthused about ongoing growth 
trends such machine learning autonomous driving and internet things but 
caution that those trends will have very limited impact the macro outlook for 
industry iot mildly additive growth over long period time but uses largely 
existing silicon driver assistance driving growth year year but true autonomy still 
many years away and while machine learning additive overall growth still 
small revenue tam and gpu chips used for training are extremely high price gross 
margin meaning that they not fill fabs

issue what are the key growth drivers for semi from here 
see artificial intelligence workloads training inference 
mostly incremental semiconductor tam 
saw sharp migration towards and deep learning techniques for solving both 
new and traditional problems machine learning program exposed large amount 
data and trained learn about that data its own and recursively build that 
knowledge over time deep learning approach solving such problems 
developers build tightly interwoven database based loosely how human brain 
works called neural network this emerged the last couple years significant 
breakthrough solving many compute problems particularly with highly visual data 
the building the neural network database normally happens offline not real 
time environment this called training 
from semiconductor standpoint one the big surprises least and 
most investors talk was the rapid adoption graphics chips from nvidia for 
this training application training hugely computationally intensive and traditional 
linear microprocessors aren optimal for solving those types computations the 
world best microprocessors which are still the best solution the vast majority 
computing problems are limited when comes building neural nets recursively 
graphics chips are more efficient for that narrow application set and nvidia has been 
investing aggressively for decade believing this opportunity use cases exploded 
nvidia grew its data center business which understates deep learning 
growth given that they started the year with most revenues coming from high 
performance compute exhibit new use cases are emerging literally weekly 
move through the year and nvidia appears have the dominant training solution for 
least the next couple years 
exhibit nvidia data center business quarterly pace has increased over the last years 
source company data morgan stanley research 
once the neural network trained that network accessed real time sometimes 
the cloud sometimes device and eventually autonomous vehicle this 
called inference that being done almost entirely intel microprocessors 
but even intel expects broad range accelerators used computationally 
more sophisticated inference tasks come market will see the first use cases 
specialized inference hardware good lead indicator for the next years this 
certainly orders magnitude larger than the training opportunity unit terms albeit 
much lower price points but ultimately the best inference engine going 
many places including the heart the autonomous vehicle 
the inference market going remain highly fragmented there are high precision 
inference tasks and simpler inference tasks compared training there typically 
much less computational intensity but more focus low power and low latency since 
inference real time 
still very important market that could eventually bigger than training given 
critical applications such automobiles think that will critical year for 
the formation these multiyear growth trajectories 
see several classes potential solutions this computation problem 
microprocessors microprocessors generally lack the parallelism theoretically 
the most efficient inference engines but they have the practical advantage that they are 
already place incumbency matters for simpler inference tasks the cloud such 
movie recommendations utilizing neural net there simply isn enough computational 
complexity justify inserting another architecture into the mix 
field programmable chips called fpgas field programmable gate arrays primarily 
from altera now part intel and xilinx are emerging theory the best solutions 
for many applications there are many academic papers showing the benefits fpgas 
over other chips due their low latency lower power consumption graphics 
microprocessors and higher degree flexibility 
the challenge that fpgas are very difficult use properly optimally requiring circuit 
designers who aren usually employed cloud vendors departments think 
what has happen make this relevant going set abstraction 
layers that shield the user from that complexity while still allowing users benefit 
from the optimal parallel compute capabilities 
graphics chips from nvidia intel and amd with dominant role training 
nvidia has built significant leadership and software over the last decade recently 
launched second generation inference solutions while graphics someways 
suboptimal for inference applications due high precision data overkill for some use 
cases high power consumption and higher latency fpgas the ease use could 
long way and inference workloads increase complexity graphics could become 
optimal solution 
custom chips over time see most machine vision types chips moving 
neural network inference approach and there will many applications with wide 
range complexity both graphics chips and fpgas were originally designed for other 
functions and bring great deal unneeded overhead cost and power for the task 
there least theoretical basis that stripping away that overhead with dedicated 
inference chips going most efficient intel nervana acquisition aimed these 
opportunities are specialty chips from companies such ambarella google made

what happens 
expect all these approaches find usage but think that where sit 
today the biggest surprise will forward motion fpgas the tools for 
inference for broad range cloud applications the theoretical basis there for that 
today but the complexity layer limits adoption far have seen microsoft 
aggressively using altera fpgas accelerate search and last week saw aws 
offering xilinx fpgas for the use its enterprise customers see only small revenue 
encroachment this year not earnings driver but would expect see 
enough evidence cloud traction get investors more excited for what has been 
lackluster fpga growth environment 
further counter consensus see xilinx increasingly strong position get 
business sitting alongside intel microprocessors despite altera alignment with intel 
discussions with customers indicate that delays altera and parts give 
xilinx solid performance lead intel altera copackaged part seems getting less 
traction pooled fpga approach and xilinx decisions have simpler bit dsp 
cores better suited inference applications xilinx has talked about this being 
opportunity for them driving about their projected growth for 
revenue company and recent industry conversations make think that they could 
hit that milestone year two earlier 
impact stocks 
nvidia line with consensus nvidia going the biggest semiconductor 
beneficiary machine learning leadership training seems unassailable the 
intermediate term and the ease use and integration ensures them seat the table 
high end inference expect the stock continue work though gaming the 
bigger earnings driver see nvidia secular position data center and autos 
continuing strengthen 
amd see amd role inference somewhat limited least until vega comes out 
next year recent wins alibaba and google were related vdi not machine learning 
still the clear higher value graphics these opportunities certainly opens 
opportunities here but see those priced 
xilinx are warming the xilinx story this opportunity comes into view 
emphasize that revenue dollars for are going small early for this 
opportunity but the narrative here should strong the company has already press 
released relationships with baidu and aws and has traction with several other top 
cloud vendors and could even see traction within the leader fpga usage microsoft 
alterative altera some applications xilinx has meaningfully underperformed 
late industry consolidation has focused elsewhere 
intel see positive for intel earnings many these spending projects are 
new and incremental existing spend the use case for unaccelerated cpus for 
inference theoretically unappealing but practically the path least resistance 
those microprocessors are already there far accelerators the company 
positioned with the broadest array solutions with products all categories but 
they don have the best graphics building blocks date the best fpga building 
blocks and nervana gives them interesting but untested building block see

issue remain bullish dram which should flow through 
another strong capital spending year 
see strong dram pricing environment persisting throughout albeit not 
robust are seeing our normal assumption that peak 
operating cash flow memory vendors spent capital spending and saw that 
play out however looking our bottom spending numbers and more 
significantly looking semiconductor production equipment sales into memory 
markets are very clearly seeing dram cash flows being siphoned off subsidize 
nand spending this isn that surprising given the strategic nature the nand 
transition every market participant including the three that are both markets that 
spending decline should lead slower supply growth next year 
think that suppliers build inventory the first half customers reduced and then 
customers rebuilt inventories the back half the year when producers depleted 
because producer inventories were drawn down near zero the last few months the 
effective supply meaning production plus product shipped out inventory should 
lower customers may also draw down inventory which would negatively 
impact demand but dram prices stay stable don see that having enough impact 
disrupt supply demand balance 
are less bullish nand for though still expect solid full year 
fundamentals and profitability not see the sequential momentum seen 
and persist through the year expect supply remain roughly trend line 
which more optimistic than consensus but think that the demand surge the most 
transactional parts the market primarily client solid state drives has occurred 
largely because price declines which occurred addition significant content 
growth phones that occurred with this year iphone launch which likely leads 
higher content android phones well 
the challenge through that prices have now risen for two consecutive quarters 
the ssd market through which likely dampen content growth the 
subsequent quarters still expect good fundamentals for the year but think 
that need meaningful price declines continue driving elasticity 
from semicap perspective see quarterly memory spending peaking early but still expect solid year generally assess our forecast for memory capital 
spending assessing memory cash flows which allowed stay constructive 
semicaps even memory collapsed there was still solid cash flow coverage for 
current spending our constructive bias memory fundamentals should therefore also 
helpful for semicaps well 
having said that the completion multiple major projects should drive 
quarterly peak shipments for memory that should the high watermark for while 
the peak isn because any fundamental deterioration simply the timing large 
projects that happen fall into the same quarter 
also see intel innovation driving potential motivation spend from foundry 
competitors while haven seen the fanfare for yet that saw for intel 
introduction finfet years ago think that intel will advance 
performance state the art significant margin which could have the effect that 
prior intel innovations high metal gate finfet have had driving wave spending 
from intel logic competitors see intel non nand spending remaining relatively 
constrained given the elongated node transition cycle but are more optimistic 
about overall logic and foundry spending 
chinese dram competition still long term concerns for memory and source 
upside for semicaps the possible impact from china changxin fab dram supply 
could start even still unclear when another china memory 
company ysrt will begin its planned dram project while fujian jin hua integrated 
circuit company also working with umc specialty dram think nanya tech will 
directly face competition from china given its market exposure stb low end 
smartphone etc 
response this nanya tech announced november planned issue ecbs worth 
speed its production more capex should pulled into 
from the company should start see chip output and that 
should start improve nanya tech chip cost believe will take least several 
quarters not year before chinese competition materializes and begins have 
impact nanya profitability 
globally remain cyclically bullish memory and the memory supply chain 
including semicaps are positive samsung hynix micron and nanya the 
memory side and asml applied materials and lam research the equipment side 
are not the its different this time camp still see cyclical and wouldn 
rule out taking money off the table some point stocks continue rally 
despite our constructive fundamental view 
memory supply demand updates 
changes estimates looking memory results raise our supply estimates for

largely reflect customers restocking from below normal levels inventory normal 
level nand have seen higher planar growth rates from samsung and hynix
