goggles supplies acoustic related components and aims for further

reflects short term volatility apple orders and lack visibility other new

view himax the best proxy asian tech for 
the first year production for devices this initial stage think himax the best play the 
emerging trend has supplied display solutions key brands oculus rift htc vive microsoft 
hololens the company also enjoys high content per box supplying micro projectors oled display 
solutions and depth sensing components 
himax exposure top brands himax has earned wins with several key headset brands such 
oculus rift and htc vive himax provides oled display driver total solutions these customers because 
offers complete technology oled driver ics timing controllers and power ics estimate that himax can 
generate revenue per headset more than when these brands start mass production 
the company also dominating the see through display market for smart glasses himax provides the key 
hardware components micro projectors and sensing cameras smart glasses and project that can 
generate revenue per box have expected that some smart glass customers such 
odg could showcase their products using himax lcos solution 
forecast that sales related smart glass will contribute himax revenues jumping from 
preliminary numbers track better than guidance january himax released preliminary 
sales and data 
sales million were increase and were better than the guidance 
thanks strength display driver ics from market share gain and customer 
additions 
preliminary gross margin was line with the guidance flat slightly from 
the better was attributed higher nre income from project 
engagements 
gaap earnings per diluted ads were higher than the previously guided

contributor 
despite weak fundamentals htc share price has been holding well over the past two months amid rising 
hope for its newly developed product htc vive which investors are treating play the story htc 
vive virtual reality product that allows users interact simulated virtual world for better gaming 
experience htc vive consists three elements the vive headset providing the virtual world pair 
location sensing base stations tracking one location within area feet and two control sticks 
sensing body movement 
htc vive pre transitional product between the original version and the final one the final version 
expected hit the market april this year compared with oculus rift facebook product htc vive has 
similar specs both have oled display resolution refresh rate and degree field view 
see exhibit below 
consumers can start pre ordering the oculus rift which priced march htc has not yet 
officially announced the price for htc vive 
not think htc vive can reverse the fortunes for htc for three reasons 
total volumes might too small and pricing remains the key swing factor 
margins might not high enough drive earnings owing high bom costs and lack 
economies scale 
value added more content software than hardware where competition likely 
emerge quickly when the market takes off potential competitors include oculus rift

rce data 
goertek update 
acoustic 
short term negative impact from apple 
believe goertek also affected weakness our checks suggest lower pricing 
dec further volume adjustment also affects utilization rate however believe highly customized 
nature with less fixed cost should enable acoustic players maintain relatively higher margin compared with 
other supply chain players 
value content upgrade 
our checks suggest apple should upgrade acoustic content both iphone and ipad implying yoy value content increase believe aac and goertek will continue dominant suppliers dynamic 
components 
competition luxshare also aiming penetrate the market 
have seen from luxshare proposal acquire merry that luxshare aims tap into the acoustic 
market while earpod should use lightning connector our checks also suggest that luxshare aims 
greater china technology january 
morgan stanley research 
penetrate earpod assembly though luxshare should start with small share allocation goertek and 
foster are currently the two earpod assemblers each with share however also believe apple will 
gradually develop earpod key smartphone accessory that could enable more function hence goertek should 
see continuing value content upgrade beyond 
share allocation oculus and sony 
our checks suggest that goertek currently has share allocation for oculus and sony headset 
assembly goertek also supplies acoustic components and some structure parts goertek aims tap into lens 
supply next step currently forecast contribute revenue mainly due initially high 
pricing and thus lower volume profit contribution single digit percentage total due lower margin than 
corporate blended gpm faster than expected development lower pricing for next generation more 
volume from chinese internet players for gaming purposes etc would present upside risks our estimate 
beyond other products pipeline 
goertek raised the end mainly for antenna the funds headsets 
total funds and big audio estimate goertek generate merely revenue 
hence has ample upside for development goertek acquired external personnel from amphenol etc 
develop the business goertek also aims develop haptics business and will start from chinese oems with 
value content still far lower than iphone goertek develops haptics from internal believe 
these businesses will remain small and could gradually grow beyond
