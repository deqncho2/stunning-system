everyday smartphone users create and experience rich 
images video with the special effects professional film 
this has the potential revolutionize applications 
including social media search gaming and ecommerce 
right both smartphone upgrades and mobile app revenues should accelerate 
what the impact the technology market see bull case 
adding our smartphone device and services revenue 
forecasts over the next three years accelerating device upgrades 
push smartphone shipment revenue cagr from 
our current base case representing incremental revenue over the three years believe mobile app revenue growth 
will accelerate much like after lte and large screen smartphone

the lead but the android ecosystem isn far behind apple arkit 
starting fall with the release ios the pace which 
for developers launched june and google arcore launched 
smartphone competitors follow apple adding dual camera and

android based technology adoption unfold and dual 
ios the first thirty days post release compared low single

key inflection point which forecast should happen further see meaningful commitments from mobile gaming and

google was the first create platform with the laptop 
why that operating system with installed base 
smartphone portable music players and smart speakers apple 
over billion devices can only muster minor adoption 
rarely the first market with emerging technology fact three

years ago google introduced the tango platform which promotes

izing motion tracking area learning and depth perception however

tango the lenovo phab pro and the asus zenfone relatively 
compatible with the hardware the hardware and software vendors 
unknown phones many consumers 
need perfectly sync with their latest updates however this 
doesn appear the case according bloomberg report from 
august there are seven different versions android running mobile devices and only android devices are running 
the latest version android therefore widespread adoption

why mobile important 
believe mobile augmented reality has the potential 
revolutionary technology trend and reignite 
smartphone growth similar the app store and 
new larger smartphone displays see the potential for drive multi year period accelerated smartphone shipment growth consumers upgrade mobile 
capable hardware why because view 
allowing consumers create view and share content 
rather than context believe that combining 
sensors and greater processing power the new 
iphone along with apple arkit platform ios mobile 
app development will increase exponential pace 
unlocking new use cases and new wave iphone 
upgrades supercycle while view apple the first 
mover don expect the android ecosystem stand 
still similar the introduction google play after the 
apple app store google recently launched arcore similar development platform apple arkit our supply 
chain conversations suggest that other leading smartphone vendors including samsung and huawei will incorporate sensors new smartphones during 
following apple introduction the technology september 
augmented reality the killer app that can help accelerate smartphone shipment growth 
applications have the potential unlock widespread adoption 
mobile believe commercial use cases could unlock even more 
value long term for example the smartphone can become the primary tool used real estate agents showing new properties architects 
designing 
homes 
technologists 
designing 
hardware 
cinematographers creating content and many more this would dramatically change the landscape the smartphone market commercially focused smartphones could become just common 
computer office and with increased commercial adoption 
comes additional investment which would likely lead broadening use cases over time other words while see the potential for mobile accelerate consumer smartphone upgrades 
believe widespread commercial adoption could lead considerable expansion the device market

app store that really kick started smartphone 
annual iphone shipments growth 
growth while games ecommerce and entertainment focused 
generation iphone introduced simple user friendly

commercial use cases are potential upside unlocking 
penetration this was because the app store allowed 
users consume and create information and 
entertainment way that was optimized for small 
handheld form factor accessible result the

dramatically and drove exponential increase 
demand the five quarters prior the launch the 
apple app store apple averaged iphone shipments 
per quarter yet the first quarter after the app store 
launched apple sold iphones more than all the 
prior five quarters combined believe the introduction 
augmented reality mobile phones could have 
similar effect accelerating the pace upgrades 
bringing new users into the market and gaining share 
against competitors that lag adopting technology

demand for mobile technology extends iphone supercycle beyond iphone units grow 
after growth services demand better than expected and investors 
focus platform valuation iphone supercycle extends into units grow off much 
larger base and services growth accelerates the back increased demand for new arcentric applications gross margins move closer due more beneficial iphone and services 
revenue mix investors focus monetization apple and growing device base and value 
apple closer that platform company assume multiple net cash 
eps which approx turn above the market multiple and turn below the average 
large cap platform companies such coke alphabet nike etc which believe 
warranted given the extended iphone growth expanding device installed base increasing high margin 
services mix and larger cash balance additional upside could also come from repatriation leading

bear case eps 
iphone growth disappoints due limited oled supply weak demand and trade war with 
china with slower than expected eps growth protectionist measures and oled availability 
only the high end the iphone line limits revenue growth apple continues invest future
