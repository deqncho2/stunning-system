sharp correction may have further smart glasses have been the key 
reason why himax stock has carried premium lcd driver peers like 
novatek however himax has corrected since september 
for the nasdaq composite cite the disappointing outlook for its related 
components given weaker demand for hololens and worse than 
expected preliminary results yet think the stock may rate further 
its leading position micro displays gets challenged 
amid rising risk himax lcos business now see further threats the 
dominance micro display technology lcos liquid crystal silicon vuzix 
one the leading vendors smart glasses won the ces innovation awards 
for its blade and which incorporates dlp technology from texas 
instruments see exhibit dlp generally has the disadvantage bigger form 
factor lcos yet our read from vuzix press release suggests that this has 
been overcome addition microvision the solutions provider for laser mems 
micro display technology became one vuzix key suppliers starting from 
existing customer microsoft shipments are lower than expected according 
idc total smart glasses shipments were only units compared 
himax hololens shipments units based our forecast see 
potentially massive lcos and wlo component inventories therefore expect 
very slow wlo and lcos business since microsoft the only big 
customer see risk the company recent press release comment regarding

himax micro display dominance may face challenge 
with its lcos himax the dominant micro display technology provider 
our previous report indicated that key partner microsoft had turned its focus 
headsets rather than smart glasses thought the demand for himax 
lcos wlo components would minimal 
were equal weight not underweight because thought that the smart 
glasses market were take off himax should remain the key beneficiary given its 
leadership micro display technology believed himax lcos technology was most 
suitable for smart glasses given its low power consumption and smaller form factor 
also himax was the only lcos micro display vendor that could mass produce the 
products 
exhibit different types micro display 
source technology system research ltd himax 
the other hand recent developments smart glasses suggest 
otherwise 
the consumer electronics show just month ago the ces innovation awards 
for headsets went vuzix blade and whuch use dlp digital light 
processing technology from texas instruments besides vuzix financial report 
have also noticed that using another laser mems solution vendor microvision 
exhibit vuzix blade smart sunglasses

exhibit microvision mems micro display technology

lcos dominance appears challenged 
dlp was developed texas instruments mems technology that 
modulates light using dmd digital micromirror device didn think dlp 
technology would threat given its larger form factor and heavy power 
consumption vuzix product announcement however appears that dlp solutions 
have broken through the power consumption and form factor issue also didn think 
could viable solution before because the laser light source could harm human 
eyes but that technology also used vuzix commercial products 
therefore think himax could face market share loss micro display technology 
because its dominance may threatened even when the end market takes off new 
smart glasses makers may utilize new designs with different micro display technologies 
dlp mems 
and believe this yet priced himax stock may rate further from its 
average one year forward its leading technology position 
micro displays diminishes smart glasses have been the key reason why the stock has 
carried premium lcd driver peers like novatek one year forward 
our view therefore see downside risk management comments the preliminary 
announcement early the second half the year may see significant business 
progress contributing both the top and bottom lines out these non driver areas 
the near term elevated existing projects inventories may put pressure 
margin 
based the updated sell through data points for smart glasses believe himax 
customers may need more time digest the components that himax had shipped 
according idc total shipments smart glasses were only units 
compared himax hololens shipments units based our forecast 
other news flow incisive media inquirer net january microsoft revealed 
that its hololens augmented reality headset has sold only thousands units since 
went sale november himax needs write off the obsolescent inventories 
margin may face further downside 
refocusing core driver business but should tough 
grow there 
our concerns about the smart glasses business come true himax would depend 
heavily its legacy lcd driver business the coming two years and that tough 
place 
the near term the entire chinese smartphone supply chain faces inventory correction 
and smartphone ddi has been the component that thought was overbooked 
therefore expect himax revenue decline 
the long term himax small medium driver business eroded bythe amoled 
display trend within lcd displays driver ics appear getting commoditized with 
competition from other asian vendors like novatek raydiant focal tech fitipower and
