investment summary 
this report focus the impact growing trends 
mobile augmented reality and mobile virtual reality 
our asia hardware tech coverage see upside 
potential demand for key tech hardware components 
such chipsets memory displays power integrated circuits cameras haptics and data center equipment 
although some industry developments are still the early

recommend investors position ahead specific events 
pok mon roll outs other countries google 
daydream mobile platform launch 
pok mon mobile gaming app developed for ios and android 
mobile more available and has low cost applications while the 
level entertainment high contrast consumers would need 
pay additional costs own mobile ready device and less 
convenient than mobile however mobile can offer much better mobility than wired with lower costs the swing factor for 
mobile whether other killer apps similar pok mon the 
mobile field will emerge see potential for this happen given 
the apps consumer reception 
virtual penetrating our real life now 
starting with pok mon 
devices strict definition not but rather more location based service similar google maps the true should 
combining the virtual world with real life becoming new trend 
able embed those created images information seamlessly with 
smartphone applications apple inc ceo tim cook said the 
the real scene leveraging artificial intelligence technology

our view the popularity pok mon increases consumer aware 
important the phone becomes your assistant terms and

pok mon was released july the australia and new

pok mon comes with battery saver feature that lessens the

wristband and smartphone the lowest power solution nintendo 
linked pok mon according the ministry land infra

countries 
also offer lower power variants such and for

competition the mobile gaming market could more intense 
asia than other regions our view where similar apps were 
launched immediately after pok mon release citymon 
which currently tops the china ios app store download rankings
