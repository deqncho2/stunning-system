our view 
think shares are entering bull market and set end 
shanghai composite target believe the drivers this bull 
market view 
there are consensus concerns over the sustainability china economic 
recovery and the overhang stock purchased the intervention 
market will follows return eps growth expect yoy 
multiple expansion from prior peak driven domestic 
investor asset reallocation from property equities and continued easy 
domestic monetary conditions and tightening exchange controls 
agree that china growth will slow but only from the second half 
the year calculate government stock intervention holdings are around 
and expect them sold slowly into the market 
our rationale for resumption the bull market china 
raised our end shanghai composite index target november 
from this was derived marking our earnings growth for 
previously and the exit trailing multiple versus current trailing 
and peak multiple mid think domestic portfolio flows will move 
back into equities from property property control measures bite harder assume 
base case that there are significant trade conflicts between china and the new 
administration however the threat such conflicts and the still relatively early 
stage the chinese recovery will keep overall domestic monetary conditions easy 
meanwhile tightening measures aimed the property sector specifically 
second and third home purchases are likely prompt wealthy individuals reallocate 
towards the equity market this environment which the near term outlook for 
corporate earnings reasonably buoyant 
overall expect more extended and subdued share bull market period than last 
time lessons have been learned the regulator relation margin trading and 
futures trading and policing ipo activity risks our view would center earlier 
downturn china macroeconomic cycle and whether government holdings stock 
from the intervention are released into the market too aggressively

the likelihood bull market resuming now increased the fact that stock 
suspensions have returned normal levels recent months and are currently running 
around total names listed meanwhile new investor account openings are rising 
rapidly again and running well above those and similar what was seen 
the beginning the last bull market leg however futures trading unlikely play the 
same role driving rapid bull market was the case this because the 
much higher initial margin requirements which remain place today versus those 
place the end

the government holdings chinese equities and the strategy for these holdings our 
base case that the government holds around currently versus total 
market capitalisation with estimated free float slightly below 
this significant but not overwhelming and will not seek rapidly reduce these 
holdings but will gradually and placement basis into rallying market

our view 
think the value shares more function the growth outlook for 
cash flows and earnings rather than transient fall the risk free rate 
not think investors are demanding lower return from shares thereby 
increasing their current value just because bond yields have fallen sharply 
that said indian equities are trading the same multiple are long bonds 
which their best level relative value since the global financial crisis 
market view 
fall the risk free rate makes shares more valuable the secular fall long 
bond yields india implies higher multiple put differently lower 
long bond yields make shares more valuable india long bond yield 
multi month lows and falling while world yields are rising investors 
are arguing that this has reduced the discount rate for stocks and hence 
increased their value 
shift equities 
equities are junior claim company cash flows and arguably its value equal 
the future cash flows equity shareholders dividends discounted the expected 
rate return theory the expected rate return taken the risk free rate plus 
the equity risk premium desired investors the risk free rate falls therefore the 
value the equity share rises 
however practice this not how share prices behave why that firstly the actual 
expected return not equal the risk free rate plus the equity risk premium using the 
risk free rate driver the expected return market participants aggregate 
simplified assumption depending risk appetite market participants have different 
hurdle rates that are anchored the risk free rate but are still different the hurdle 
rate depends each investor ability handle risk potential drawdown share 
prices and therefore the equity risk premium varies significantly the variance could 
large that changes the risk free rate can become irrelevant 
the second reason for practice different from theory that equities are the 
longest duration asset class and hence are unlikely sensitive temporary 
fluctuations the risk free rate even the risk free rate the asset class competing 
with equity investors for capital spreadsheets the value the equity share 
invariably rises with fall the risk free rate where analysts miss the trick that 
long bond yields are falling because growth expectations are falling the effect the 
value shares neutralized investors and analysts must therefore lower the hurdle 
rate spreadsheets only the fall the risk free rate treasury yields permanent 
leading compression expected returns from shares and they must 
simultaneously take hard look the growth forecasts their models which may also 
need cut the net result little effect the value equity stock 
our view that the value shares more function the numerator the growth 
cash flows dividends rather than transient changes the risk free rate that said 
the relative valuation between bonds and equities excellent timing tool for 
investors choosing between these asset classes forecasting future cash flows equities 
always challenging task compared with that for bonds which have fixed coupon 
rate however the cash flow from equities usually exceeds the duration bonds 
especially the indian context although cannot prescient about annual earnings 
dividends from equities for growing economy such india can say with some 
margin safety that eventually these cash flow streams will grow therefore 
equity index trading par with the bond terms earnings multiples good 
case for equity investors this where the indian equity market today going back 
years save for two episodes extreme growth pessimism and the 
equity multiple has not been lower than the bond multiple than today 
implications 
the exhibit below underpins the case buy equities think stocks that offer growth 
reasonable price will likely the best when equities regain their premium 
multiple over bonds this would also mean that pure quality stocks that trade rich 
valuations would likely lag the market and that cyclical stocks could outperform 
defensive stocks from sector perspective this means investors should overweight 
consumer discretionary and financials and underweight consumer staples telecoms and 
utilities our view

property machinery materials revisiting lower tier cities report prefer machinery and 
materials over property november the team broader forecast for

november the national development and reform commission has already achieved the 
target capacity closures with more come the final weeks the

believes steel mills will gain more pricing power and higher margins 
iron ore market outlook should these dynamics china steel industry play out iron

our view 
market view 
recent improvement inflation has been driven another round debt 
the region has managed lift itself out disinflationary cycle and this will 
lead improvement debt gdp ratios 
build capital productivity has not improved and excess capacity 
challenges remain implying disinflationary pressures still exist 
debt build and persistent deflation producer prices 
debt gdp ratios for the region had risen from trough 
estimated facing collapse external demand after the credit crisis 
policymakers turned loose monetary and fiscal policies boost investment policy 
makers maintained high investment gdp ratios for prolonged period time they 
continued target relatively high rates gdp growth and exports did not recover 
the pre crisis rates growth the combination these factors has led the 
emergence the related challenges excess capacity and deflationary pressures 
indeed producer prices moved into deflation territory from march starting 
china and eventually covering nine out the economies that track 
inflation has been improving recent months 
recent months producer price inflation has been improving particular producer 
prices china exited deflationary territory september after consecutive 
months deflation ppi china has been positive for the past two months and now 
only five the economies have ppi deflation leading questions whether the region 
has now left the debt disinflation cycle behind 
can the recent tick inflation sustained 
the improvement the producer price index has been predominantly driven uptick commodity related segments the improvement producer prices electronic 
products which typically account for around about one third the non commodity 
producer price index has also contributed the upturn inflation this has occurred 
alongside upturn exports these items our view the improvement the 
inflation cycle the region has been brought another round debt build 
debt growth has accelerated from the trough averaging the first three 
quarters from the effects the debt growth boosted 
demand led stronger demand for commodities which spilled over into noncommodity related items the near term still expect producer prices improve 
the translation effects from higher commodity prices well the pass through from 
commodity prices into higher input costs for the non commodity related segments will 
continue feed through headline producer prices beyond that the levels 
capacity utilization will the key factor that will influence whether the improvement 
producer prices continues considering that utilization ratios are post crisis lows for 
number economies the region most prominently korea this will likely constrain 
the improvement producer prices 
will debt gdp ratios improve following the improvement inflation 
far this cycle persistent disinflationary pressures have meant that nominal gdp 
growth has been weak against this backdrop even though debt growth has decelerated 
from its peak still outpacing nominal growth leading rise 
debt gdp ratios stands there still significant gap between debt growth and 
nominal gdp growth hence even though the improvement producer price 
dynamics will lead pick nominal gdp growth next year estimated 
from the gap between debt and nominal gdp growth unlikely narrow 
significantly which will mean that debt gdp ratios will continue rise more 
fundamentally improvement productivity will needed for improvement 
debt ratios not expect this happen over our forecast horizon and hence expect 
debt gdp the region continue rise

our view 
market view 
the cyclical growth strength the expense structural imbalance and 
some observers believe recent growth momentum the beginning 
sustainable growth upturn and growth china can remain around 
double the country gdp 
thus view another policy driven mini cycle upturn similar the cycle growth trajectory beyond the near term will weighed down 
structural headwinds 
the cyclical strength that started has continued for more than one year mschex growth was yoy july october slightly stronger than the average 
growth yoy meanwhile the official manufacturing purchasing managers 
index rose two year high november with broad based improvement across subindices suggesting that the growth momentum can hold keeping full year 
gdp growth our view the growth upturn has been largely driven strong 
fiscal support and credit expansion particular recent growth drivers are continued 
fiscal support infrastructure projects front loaded auto demand and still robust 
housing sector the back rapid increases household mortgages 
however the growth upturn has been the expense structural imbalance despite 
the strong cyclical momentum recent months are concerned about the 
deteriorating quality growth specifically there are three key symptoms 
increased structural imbalance 
rapid build debt suggests deteriorating return capital employed growth 
total social financing including net government debt issuance remained elevated 
around its two year high yoy over the past six months more than twice 
high nominal gdp growth the credit driven recovery has led continued build 
leverage currently from moreover the debt overhang 
problem has spread from the corporate sector the household sector driven 
rapid rise new mortgages amid the housing market rally the continued build 
leverage has led weaker return capital employed reflected sharp increase 
the incremental debt incremental gdp ratio from and 
growth led public investment with lower profitability and higher debt burden fixed 
asset investment growth has been led soes far this year while private investment 
growth has remained subdued the government deploys state enterprises 
economic stimulus efforts however widely recognized that soes china generally 
operate less efficiently than private companies reflected the weaker return 
assets and higher debt asset ratios soes than the private sector the continued 
boost soe investment thus reflects lack progress soe reform and loss 
efficiency the economy our view 
the state planned capacity cut has caused distortion the market taking the coal 
industry example response the persistent excess capacity issue policymakers 
imposed production day cap working days the industry february 
however the production limit was implemented all companies the industry which 
means companies that are more profitable and less vulnerable excess capacity are 
affected just much those with obsolete capacity and weak profitability meanwhile 
state planned capacity control policies distorted the market reaction demand 
changes leading surge coal prices since the end july suppliers 
have not been able respond with more production meet higher demand from the 
winter heating season recent months 
growth trajectory weighed down structural headwinds growth will likely peak 
and moderate estimate result slowdown the 
housing and automobile markets that said the growth deceleration will remain 
mild growth stability remains policy priority before the political reshuffle late 
however the growth trajectory beyond the near term will weighed down 
structural headwinds expect growth decelerate further

our view 
market view 
think the effect asean economies from better growth the and 
fed tightening will lie somewhere between what was during the and 
cycles 
the market concerned about the effect prospective fed hikes and usd 
strength asean economies 
the effect asean economies growth and fed tightening has varied 
significantly 
the election outcome has led expectations reflationary fiscal stimulus and 
yields have risen the market believes the fed will undertake further normalization 
the combination better growth and fed tightening had significantly different 
implications for asean economies fed rate hikes and fed tapering 
think further fed normalization likely result outcome which lies 
somewhere between what was seen the and cycles 
the fed tightening cycle was very benign one for asean the fed raised 
rates and continued until the economy was growing households 
had levered the final demand provided consumers plus the ascension 
china the wto and the production supply chain that brought forth asia 
enabled asean economies ride the global export cycle which helped keep gdp 
growth upward trajectory current account surpluses asean mostly rose 
the current account deficit widened addition asean economies had also cleaned 
their domestic demand excesses and delevered their balance sheets after the 
asian financial crisis the better investment returns from stronger growth and cleaner 
balance sheets attracted more capital inflows which together with the improving 
current account balances put further wind the sails asean currencies the usd 
depreciated 
but the fed tapering was different ball game the fed tapering had 
different implications then consumer deleveraging meant the economy was 
longer able provide the same degree export support had before the global 
financial crisis gfc also china was and still dealing with excess capacity and 
needed rebalancing from investment led growth strategy consumption led one 
which less import intensive these factors meant asia japan export momentum was 
notch weaker than was before the gfc indeed instead exports growth asean 
economies had come the back the export liquidity from extraordinarily loose 
fed policies and there had been sizable debt build economies such thailand 
singapore and malaysia when tapering happened growth payback was the works 
past debt excesses had digested 
addition current account balances had weakened and dipped into deficit territory for 
thailand because debt build domestic demand and indonesia lower commodity 
prices this also meant that when tapering reversed the carry trade created liquidity 
squeeze for these economies which were dependent external funding and 
undermined the currencies central banks such bank indonesia have had 
undertake pro cyclical tightening restore macro stability which put abrupt brake 
domestic demand momentum 
what will mean for asean growth gets better and the fed normalizes 
think the effect from better growth and further fed normalization 
likely lie somewhere between what was the case and indeed the 
funding squeeze unlikely bad but the growth spillover also 
unlikely positive 
what are the implications rising yields for asean the pace the rise 
yields will important watch accelerated rise yields would create funding 
challenges for some asean economies and malaysia and indonesia face more risks than 
other economies the region however all else equal the improvement macro 
fundamentals means that asean economies are mostly better positioned today than 
indeed the slowing domestic demand and the resulting import compression 
mean that current account balances are generally higher today than forex 
reserve buffers measured against short term external debt and imports are also 
mostly better and together with higher real rate differentials versus the form better 
protection against capital volatility 
what are the implications from fiscal stimulus for asean spillovers from 
fiscal stimulus would benefit the export oriented economies most such malaysia 
thailand and singapore however unlike the cycle when the asian export 
growth cycle was supported the leveraging consumers the positive spillover 
from fiscal stimulus likely smaller this because the spillover benefits 
would hampered uncertainty over trade protectionism well tighter financial 
conditions additionally the economies that benefit most from fiscal stimulus would 
also those affected most trade protectionism policies the combination 
stimulus and protectionist policies and the sequencing the implementation these 
policies will matter for growth asean

that yields are recovering strongly the negative effect from last year 
nino drought transitioning estimate supply growth will rebound 
against consumption growth just and cpo prices will fall 
result oversupply the last time such significant oversupply 
happened cpo prices fell yoy 
investors are feeling more confident forecasting improved first half 
earnings for the asean plantation industry following the rally spot cpo 
prices ringgit terms and dollar terms during november the 
cpo forward curve relatively flat despite the uncertainty over 
production and prices 
optimistic first half outlook line with the rally spot cpo november 
investors bid shares the group especially for names leveraged upstream pricing 
such equal weight rated golden agri which was much during the 
month additionally investors uncertainty over the sustainability prices and earnings 
through appears sanguine given the flattish shape the month cpo futures 
price the december price just below current spot prices 
what the price calculate that stock prices for the group are implying eps 
estimates that are about above our estimates for example golden agri stock 
price implies eps using historical average multiple this 
nearly above our estimate golden agri delivered earnings above 
only when cpo prices were nearer per ton the other hand 
wilmar share price implies eps just using historical average 
multiple although wilmar earnings had been hovering around since 
its earnings are recovering wilmar earnings potential around share and 
estimate eps will reach 
reiterate cautious industry view have cautious industry view because

our view 
expect further policy fine tuning rationalize domestic production 
market view 
producers are reluctant raise production keep prices high 
believe the coal price rally has been driven artificially constrained 
supply this has resulted surge coal imports which turn drove 
chinese and seaborne prices higher with the availability spare capacity 
believe the government will continue relax production 
production cuts have effectively pushed coal prices higher this year 
therefore the market view that miners will continue maintain low 
production levels however china coal industry fragmented with 
companies think unlikely that price coordination via supply 
discipline can achieved indeed slow supply response coal 
companies has been due the time needed for staff and equipment 
arrangements 
supply remains excess despite capacity cuts 
more than coal capacity has been shut amid the government supplyside reforms this exceeded government targets planned cuts the 
five year plan were achieved the first year 
however believe the market underappreciates supply from new capacity among 
total new capacity tons the pipeline estimate have received 
different stages government approval following the coal price rally expect the 
government continue relax its view partially approved projects rationalize 
domestic supply our view producers should bringing out their shovels now when 
approvals and regulations are easier believe coal miners will try implement new 
capacity quickly possible before the regulations tighten again 
coal prices remain high believe the government will extend the relaxation the 
day production control policy after winter the key this the government focus 
lowering the power tariff order pump prime the economy against the 
average bohai rim steam coal price index ton see ton 
key level that the government will maintain avoid the need for power tariff hikes 
therefore believe new mines together with increased production from existing 
mines should reverse the tightness the coal market and balance the supply demand 
gap 
shenhua our only overweight rated stock for the industry 
result our caution about coal price correction shenhua our only 
overweight while yanzhou our key underweight believe shenhua the key

with sign yet demand recovery china and the possibility higher

pricing power 
the past five years pricing power has formed important part earnings

consumption volume growth stay lukewarm during china economic adjustment 
phase illustrated below 
strong pricing power reflects the following factors better supply demand the 
industry the high competitive capability the companies with better channel 
management leading position their respective product lines balanced product 
portfolios and more diversified raw material base better operating leverage 
higher channel margins which provide better margin buffer defend market position

continued slower industrial capacity expansion relative end demand 
expect the second year which industrial investment growth will 
lagging growth end demand more than five percentage points this combined with 
better than expected overcapacity reduction will change the supply and demand 
dynamic meaningfully our analysis indicates that the level real overcapacity 
around for some the industries with the most severe overcapacity issues 
most industries not need reach capacity utilization make money this 
new supply and demand dynamic will mean less npl pressure even economic growth 
slows bit from and actually see better industrial sector profits long 
economic growth can outpace notably the industrial investment growth 
also china economic structure has changed fundamentally services and consumption

our view 
curtailment will not improve next year view structural power oversupply 
market view 
the market has been optimistic about improvement wind curtailment 
nationwide and lack incentive for local governments execute the 
minimum utilization hours policy given conflicts interest between local 
coal power companies which are big tax revenue contributors and wind 
operators many which are exempt from tax the policy has generally not 
been adopted local governments far this year and expect the 
situation continue especially the most curtailed regions view 
the low utilization rate some the existing ultra high voltage uhv 
lines not expect the problem ease with new uhv lines the 
bottleneck lies power oversupply nationwide not insufficient transmission 
facilities 
since the release the minimum utilization hours policy the beginning 
this year believed that local governments would start implement the 
policy early mid the beginning the latest the 
market believes that local government preference for coal over renewables 
will lessen planned generation volume declines and new uhv 
lines commissioned will also ease wind curtailment 
power oversupply the key bottleneck for easing wind curtailment may 
persist throughout our view 
exhibit power capacity supply growth above power demand 
growth throughout 
view the weak power demand growth and 
rebound partly because hot weather during 
summertime and stabilization the economy expect full year 
power demand growth estimate growth 
excluding the effect from extreme hot weather the 
supply side based existing power units under construction 
expect power capacity growth remain high during 
before slowing around

wind curtailment highly concentrated few provinces thus 
whether wind curtailment could improve next year depends 
the execution policy these regions but see economic 
incentive for these provincial governments execute the 
minimum utilization hours policy which essentially means 
protecting wind operators interests squeezing other local 
power providers 
take gansu for example gansu power system september 
had power capacity compared with peak demand 
this year yet still plans start construction new 
power plants with capacity the gansu 
government has indicated that wind farms should not 
guaranteed irr implementation the policy nor 
should power grids coal ipps compensate wind farms tackle 
severe power oversupply yunnan and sichuan adopted marketdriven approaches yunnan rolled out wind tariff cut and sichuan introduced more 
market power trading volume balance the interests various renewable energies 
hydro wind solar showing preference for wind over other power types for 
details please refer our reports yunnan visit wind tariff cut and one more 
province cut renewable tariff sichuan

our view 
because the tightening cycle this time focused just cities 
versus nationwide the past the cities account for about 
nationwide sales and starts volume terms since the tightening measures 
october sales outside those cities have remained stable mom 
and are yoy also after two years falling construction starts 
lower tier cities because lower prices see inventory returning 
more healthy level which has resulted pick average selling prices 
this should motivate developers accelerate construction 
market view 
yes because tightening measures and high inventory lower tier cities 
the consensus view that most lower tier cities have high inventories which 
could continue put pressure average selling prices and new starts 
time play the recovery lower tier cities 
think now the time look lower tier cities this tightening cycle cityfocused rather than nationwide after two years falling construction starts inventory 
has returned healthier levels leading pick average selling prices lowertier cities expect the asp increase lower tier cities translate pick 
construction new starts least for the healthier lower tier cities first lower tier cities 
account for nationwide starts and estimate new starts lower tier cities will 
grow this would more than offset our estimation for decline new

rachel zhang morganstanley 
our view 
supply side reforms are working capacity cuts part supply side 
market view 
supply side reforms are not working steel production still increasing 
reforms are removing idle capacity and capacity with low utilization 
removing this capacity does not have equivalent effect output steel 
producers may increase utilization rates margins are good however 
removing idle capacity does improve the industry utilization rate which 
results higher pricing power 
suggesting that supply side reforms are not working the price 
increase steel just recovery for other commodities and not due 
the reforms 
and current capacity cuts are permanent unlike the past steelmakers 
are required demolish their blast furnaces this time receive subsidies 
from the central government thus the target closure steel 
capacity will permanent the paper industry good 
reference capacity closures resulted material margin expansion 
and restarts producers were required demolish equipment receive 
government funding 
and current capacity cuts are temporary the past steel capacity 
reopened when margins recovered this time capacity cuts may also 
temporary 
further capacity cuts will smaller steel capacity cuts have 
mostly come from idle capacity that not useful this low hanging fruit 
and future capacity cuts will smaller 
supply side reform will continue full speed permanently 
removing capacity helps there will less supply increase when margins 
recover estimate closures were effective capacity 
the government supply side reforms will continue and the china iron and 
steel association indicates the closure target may achieved 
ahead the deadline that means capacity cuts will 
remain high and include more effective capacity 
expect government efforts supply side reforms continue see 
strong momentum permanent capacity closures which point improved 
fundamentals years key stocks that may benefit include angang steel 
maanshan iron steel and baosteel 
this time different the past china has tried curb capacity without success this 
time different because the following factors there funding 
support closures and employee relocation with this available reward mills 
that exceed targets and there open acceptance layoffs the very top levels 
government this our view will help local governments and soes more easily 
enforce closures and deal with labor issues are seeing job cuts from multiple soes 
which something have not experienced before addition the merger between 
baosteel and wuhan well the announcement regional consolidation plans 
shows that the industry continues consolidate 
permanent shutdown leads fundamental improvement steelmakers are required 
demolish blast furnaces receive subsidies from the central government this 
repeat paper supply reforms when the dongguan government subsidized 
capacity closures and asked for the dismantling equipment precondition paper 
prices and margins recovered materially later and there were restarts 
what left after supply side reforms will healthier capacity after the supply side 
reforms the remaining capacity will more market driven and will exit when demand 
slows saw the end believe most the voluntary shutdown 
was effective capacity this confirmed the continuous decline national 
blast furnace utilization and tangshan blast furnace utilization rates the end 
according our tracker the closed steel capacity more than 
remained closed during despite notable recovery steel prices this may due 
high restart costs and rising raw material prices and funding difficulties policies 
had tightened 
reforms affect long products more than flat products our findings suggest that 
more than the shutdowns relates long products and flat 
products long products are mostly commodity products with low entry barriers lower 
pricing power and slimmer margins while producers tend non soes believe 
more long capacity will targeted for closure because higher risk being 
excessive also there are many small firms the field the risk environmental 
noncompliance higher for long products than for flat products

geopolitical uncertainties remain but are largely the price 
external factors such terrorist attacks political tension and clampdowns lowpriced package tours have been the main challenge for outbound travel our 
view cannot predict negative external events but think concerns such events 
are largely priced based share price declines this year the effects external 
events vary terms time but some have proven short lived for instance the

cny will continue depreciate against usd but will either appreciate versus jpy 
krw stable versus thb sgd 
outbound destinations will become more diversified 
china outbound travel market becomes more mature believe demand will 
become more diversified therefore the growth rates for bigger destinations will 
decelerate while those for smaller destinations will accelerate thailand japan and 
south korea are the top three destinations tier one markets our definition terms 
the number chinese visitors receiving over chinese visitors each 
expect the growth rate these markets slow from and

timing right for hong kong developers monetize their land banks 
china land prices have more than doubled the past months have 
land costs may decline because restrictions recent tightening measures 
not observed any significant drop land prices especially higher tier cities 
following recent tightening measures 
hong kong developers can sell their quality land banks net margins 
even they are sold discount prevailing land auction prices land 
will drive land prices down and lower the selling prices the properties the 
market will cool down and local developers will not bid for land 
aggressively before hong kong developers are not selling their assets 
china most developers want keep growth options china intact they 
also have consider business continuity china the chance for asset 
disposals slim 
banks china are currently valued investors net margin 
because high land appreciation taxes capital recycled can reinvested 
hong kong take advantage better margins and keep assets the 
usd linked hkd some hong kong developers have sold their projects 
local peers attractive margins the past 
attractive set for hong kong developers sell their land banks china see 
strong possibility hong kong developers achieving higher margins and higher irrs 
selling their land banks rather than developing them since land prices have spiked the 
timing good because chinese developers need replenish land banks after strong 
sell through and land prices have remained resilient despite recent cooling 
measures historically companies such new world development henderson land 
and sino land have sold their land banks china 
hong kong developers land banks china are not properly valued hong 
kong chinese developers have historically made net margins any residential 
development because high land appreciation tax and our current nav estimates 
drive valuation based that margin believe that hong kong developers were 
decide dispose their high quality land banks even discount the current 
prevailing prices the nav and cash flow effect could significant 
unlocking nav and improving cash flow meaningfully believe that sell instead 
build approach could add overall nav our base case selling only 
tier one land banks tier two and tier three and discount 
and our bull case the value companies such property and new 
world developement property could have cash yield while new world 
development could get its market cap 
timing land disposal still appropriate land prices are unlikely fall 
significantly our view land prices should supported continued average 
selling price upcycle because healthy inventory land prices have more than doubled 
the past months and prices have not come down despite recent cooling measures 
based our study tianjin land auction prices have remained high after tightening 
measures even land prices drop discount current prevailing auction prices

our view 
valuations are reasonable but stocks are not pricing any regulatory risks 
prefer stocks with company specific tailwinds tech mahindra and

peers with superior earnings growth from margin tailwinds for 
infosys believe expectations are low and company specific challenges 
will recede the next quarters hcl technologies too dependent 
infra services for growth while wipro growth has consistently lagged peers 
justifying valuation discount 
market view 
investors are getting tactically constructive the large caps because 
positive gdp growth estimate revisions and reasonable valuations 
valuations have corrected and are lower than historical averages for the first 
time the past several quarters gdp growth estimate revisions are 
positive and yields are rising apart from infosys stocks such hcl 
technologies tech mahindra and wipro are finding investor attention 
market optimism driven macro factors and valuation but stocks not pricing 
regulatory risks 
optimism appears building for large cap stocks because positive economic 
data points and year date underperformance november our economics 
team raised its gdp growth forecast for from year yields 
have been rising and historical trends indicate the india index has positive correlation 
with rising yields also multiples for some the large cap stocks are off 
historical average levels however believe any risk from potential change visa 
norms not fully the price stocks retraced closer pre election levels after the 
november reaction 
with this background like stocks with company specific tailwinds low consensus 
expectations and reasonable valuations rather than the entire group 
tech mahindra telecom vertical revenues has started turning around and will 
reflected better revenue growth estimate after lagging for two years 
organic revenue growth will line better than peers the company has 
margin tailwind from one time expenses and the improving profitability subsidiary 
companies such lcc that should help grow earnings faster than peers can 
similarly for infosys decline consulting and the gradual reduction efforts leading 
complete closure the contract for royal bank scotland dragged earnings 
growth but these issues will behind within the next two quarters revenue 
growth expectations are low for infosys and valuations are closer trough levels

our view 
secured dividend and high ebitda growth will drive stock outperformance 
believe the combination ebitda growth the highest 
among peers and dividend yield will drive stock outperformance 
although the opening wynn palace has been lukewarm the 
company has taken several initiatives build its customer database 
optimize tables between properties extend promotions and participate the 
cotai strip bus program ensure steady growth its properties gearing 
remains below the threshold total debt bond ebitda and the 
company could continue pay more dividend per share per 
annum estimate 
market view 
cautious because slow growth wynn palace wynn palace may 
structurally challenged because design that suited vips and the 
premium mass segment while the growing grind mass business 
completely ignored the growth this property will slow because poor 
accessibility because disruption created the construction light rail

hold our non consensus positive view epistar because the following 
factors improved industry capacity expansion stability and discipline 
the company strategic shift towards profit focused strategy and 
substantial profit recovery from increasing contribution from red leds 
believe the market underestimating epistar ability mitigate pricing 
compression for commodity nitride leds and the growth potential red 
leds which generate gross margins excess versus for 
nitride leds consensus expectations are for negative operating profit margin 
risk reward scenarios 
bear case 
base case 
bull case 
macro uncertainties lead weaker end demand 
limiting epistar restructuring benefits further 
intensifying competition and asp declines

limited contribution and epistar returns

restructuring efforts continue emerge leading 
favorable mix shift nitride blue leds and

accelerated full scale benefits from

margin recovers closer with operating 
profit margin above led better nitride led 
pricing environment and accelerated red led 
contribution 
earnings sensitivity shows red leds the key profit turnaround 
estimate red leds will contribute epistar revenue from 
because rising demand for fine pitch outdoor display and infrared sensors 
since the beginning expect tight capacity and the more complex production 
required for red leds drive higher average selling prices and therefore greater margin 
contribution from 
our earnings sensitivity analysis indicates that every increase red led revenue will 
increase epistar profit assuming gross margin stays the same also suggests 
every gross margin increase for red leds will add operating profit assuming 
revenue unchanged this implies epistar red led business growth and profit upside 
potential highly correlated 
best positioned and good proxy for augmented virtual reality iot and industry 
because technological patent barriers prefer upstream suppliers with the 
capability and key patents such epistar they tend have higher margins than 
downstream packagers under supply and demand equilibrium 
estimate the global infra red led market cagr from

design wins for these new chips are early indicators mediatek asp and margin

the targets the even smartphone segment above

easily price the chip undercutting qualcomm high asp chip this means the chip margin should higher than for the chip because its 
asp higher while its cost only more are confident that mediatek will 
have more customers than has had for because the chip 
competitive performance and power consumption these factors together with benign 
competition the low end segment and mediatek cost optimization chip redesign 
second source vendors lead believe the company has chance recover margins 
rather early for the potential margin recovery story given attractive riskreward 
the cost structure improvement mediatek smartphone chip would more 
significant and also more structural this because the company will adopt the 
new modem architecture mid range and low end chips estimate the 
company can least improve the chip margin that why the company has 
the confidence guide its margin higher although bears continue argue that 
the price competition will severe 
our positive thesis mediatek centers its margin recovery and new product cycle

upside surprise the company can also deliver better new business development
