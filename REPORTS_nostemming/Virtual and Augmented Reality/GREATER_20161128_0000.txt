expect egis expand its share rapidly with samsung and

china starting from given its most competitive pricing across 
smartphones the easiest way unlock smartphone with high 
the street despite being latecomer smartphone fingerprint tech 
level security and gradually becoming required mobile pay 
nology with its robust algorithm sensor design and unique inac 
ment apps are more bullish than the street penetration 
tive capacitive sensor technology egis could provide competitive 
assumptions because see the potential for cost reductions and 
pricing without sacrificing performance estimate egis solution 
sufficient wafer module capacity and see evidence that samsung 
can reduce the sensor cost and the module cost 
will aggressively adopt fingerprint sensor technology low end 
excluding the sensor compared with the current main 
smartphone models well

prices aggressively compete with egis mid low end smart 
implications for supply chain 
phones given the cost disadvantage and its current strategy focusing high end fingerprint technology and non fingerprint products 
within the supply chain think investment fingerprint sensor 
lift its gross margin also believe concerns about goodix 
companies may offer good long term returns because think the 
petition china and samsung house threat are overdone 
application could proliferate other consumer electronics such 
both would find hard catch terms cost the next two 
notebook pcs smart cards and wearable devices also believe

key debate how fast will fingerprint 
technology penetrate into mid low end 
smartphones 
market view fingerprint technology still feature 
mid high end smartphones because costs per 
module also module capacity and inch wafer capacity 
will issue that constrains penetration possible 
that fingerprint penetration non apple smartphones 
will increase versus 
samsung followed suit further pushing fingerprint penetration 
mid low end egis low cost solution seems the best 
september samsung launched samsung pay support its 
mid high end models such the galaxy series the key difference 
from apple pay that samsung pay also supports mst magnetic 
secure transmission through traditional magnetic card terminals 
our view believe non apple penetration will reach 
which could also applied emerging countries with low 
with around more fingerprint sensor shipments than consen 
installed rate nfc terminals based our industry checks 
sus our industry checks about fingerprint sensor vendors and global 
think that samsung key objective for samsung pay development 
payment companies suggest fingerprint sensor necessary 
launch probably compete with apple the high end smart 
ponent for smartphone oems develop mobile payment business 
phones while also differentiating itself the mid low end thus 
samsung pay egis would benefit from the aggressive adoption 
believe samsung will accelerate its fingerprint penetration the 
fingerprint sensors samsung with egis low cost solution 
mid low end smartphones series which are mainly sold 
believe samsung overall sensor cost could cut more than 
emerging countries such india thailand and indonesia with the 
while estimate fingerprint penetration could 
aim promoting usage its samsung pay and more significantly 
increase more than percentage points think pene 
push its smartphone unit shipments the same time along 
tration china smartphones will outpace market expectations due 
with samsung long term target growing its payment users 
stronger growth the third party payment market led alipay 
billion believe egis well positioned become samsung key 
yoy growth also our module capacity and 
fingerprint vendor mid low end smartphones given its cost 
inch wafer capacity analysis suggests there will not supply con 
competitiveness 
straints 
with egis low cost solution believe samsung overall sensor 
key analysis and conclusion 
cost could cut more than while estimate fingerprint penetration increase more than percentage points 
apple where all begins 
this mainly driven egis increasing fingerprint penetration 
the mid low end estimate more than samsung 
apple was the pioneer fingerprint sensors for smartphones with 
its iphone launch september that time the purpose 
the fingerprint was mainly unlock the smartphone september 
apple launched its apple pay the and the followed 
china and europe with apple pay users can pay their 
mobile with secure fingerprint authentication via nfc near field 
communication apply pay available the iphone and 
above then september samsung and google launched samsung pay and android pay respectively 
mid low end smartphones will adopt fingerprint sensors

discussion biometric recognition what 
after fingerprint sensors 
think smartphone fingerprint sensors will the biggest growth driver for both egis and goodix the coming 
two years but also expect small contributions from 
other applications the longer term like the potential 
biometric recognition technology the future humanmachine interface and see potential upside from the 
non smartphone segment both egis and goodix are 
investing future technology investment 
fpc mentioned its earnings call that saw lot market 
activity for fingerprint technology around smart cards but may 
take time before has developed into mass market starting from 
since will require both new products and new approaches 
non smartphone value chains for the smart card opportunity 
credit cards with fingerprint sensor our industry checks suggest 
the key roadblock the battery life the fingerprint sensor the 
credit card given that the life cycle credit card two years versus 
the battery life one year for now remains seen whether 
addition smartphones pcs represent near term opportu 
there will technological breakthrough the next two years with 
nity for fingerprint technology 
improvement the semiconductor manufacturing process further development battery free smart cards 
apple newly launched macbook pro added the feature fingerprint recognition and the industry peer fpc commented its recent 
fingerprint technology smartphone the beginning not the 
earnings call that pcs represent obvious opportunity the near 
end 
future another industry peer synaptics also indicated its 
earning call that its securepad and fingerprint solutions have 
from broader perspective fingerprint sensors are just one type 
demand from notebook customers lenovo customer for the 
biometric recognition the legacy fingerprint face iris vein voice 
now for the yoga series and revenue seems likely continue 
and dna recognition systems have been applied industrial gov 
increase because pcs are smaller end market than smart 
ernmental security systems for years but those technologies 
phones the tam smaller for fingerprint sensors our view how 
migrate consumer electronics new type human interface 
ever penetration today probably less than based our esti 
would require different skill sets and different supply chain 
mates 
have seen samsung innovation which allowed adopt iris 
sensor for its galaxy note again think this will niche market 
while smart cards may server the new growth driver starting 
the coming two years given unclear applications but also sug
