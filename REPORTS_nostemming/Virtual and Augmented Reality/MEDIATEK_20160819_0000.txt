our positive thesis has been that mediatek will raise its margin along 
with higher chipset asp and mobile apps could fuel the trend 
pokemon mobile trigger for asp rise low end handset chipsets 
estimate mediatek still has shipments from feature phones 
ultra low end smartphones with the display resolution wvga wide video 
graphics array that mediatek total mobile phone chipset 
shipments now their asp only versus corporate average 
more handset users want play the pokemon like apps they need 
upgrade the smartphone chipset mediatek low end smartphone chipset 
with asp estimate every units low end 
handsets upgraded pokemon ready smartphones will create about 
extra revenue eps upside with the operating leverage offset 
lower gross margin 
coming google daydream new selling point for new high end chipset 
google expects launch its android this fall there specific time yet 
with new daydream feature play the daydream properly expect 
some mediatek high end helio chipsets would need migrate its new 
helio based our survey current mobile ready smartphones nexus 
zte axon and samsung galaxy and the antutu chipset performance 
comparison think the new helio chipset probably will sell 
the current helio series asp around estimate every units 
current helio chipset shipments that migrate would create 
least revenue upside eps upside via operating leverage 
remain believe our margin recovery thesis will continue play out 
margin pressure has stabilized given strong demand from chinese 
customers and the chipset asp increase driven growing high end chipset 
helio shipments think the proliferating mobile apps will make the 
chipset asp rising trend more sustainable the recent taiwan dollar appreciation 
and tight supply amoled displays have limited the revenue upside but 
think the negative impact could offset potential mobile phone chipset 
asp upside with asp rises and key catalysts 
pokemon and mobile proliferation google daydream launch 
september october improving margin and chipset asp mediatek

investment summary 
the market has been aware the sales upside 
think mediatek recent price hike since mainly driven better sales demand 
outlook medaitek revenue upside come from both market share gain and real 
demand improvement with upbeat guidance for revenue growth 
mediatek indicated that some other smartphone chipset vendors also face tight supply 
but mediatek shortage more severe implying that overall smartphone demand 
should better than planned year date the higher market share key chinese 
smartphone brands which are gaining global market share the reason why could 
outgrow industry peers 
however the market still bearish margin trend while hold counter consensus 
view and see mediatek margin could improve 
market view gross margin historical low also the earnings 
meeting the management said the margin won improve this year 
our view first the margin was the guidance provided four months ago 
not new news also remember june july that management tone was still that 
margin could decline further and now said margins are stabilizing things 
are getting better not worse from the exhibit gross margin chart the company 
margin should bottom the company chipset asp has also turned since 
overall would suggest that investors see the forest margin improving asp 
increase not the trees rough estimate opex hike margin 
our eps estimate higher than the street because expect mediatek gross 
margin recover from its trough and increase its chipset asps the mobile 
trend will act key tailwind and increase asps for its low end and high end 
chipsets not think its share price factoring this
