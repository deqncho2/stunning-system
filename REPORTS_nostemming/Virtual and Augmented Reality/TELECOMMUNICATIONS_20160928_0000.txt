pok mon may come but 
data growth here stay 
pok mon just start see augmented reality 
generating incremental data volume revenues for telcos 
the future more than iot has done however video remains 
the key catalyst for mobile data volume growth 
pok mon the first augmented reality hit this app has seen the 
fastest take any mobile app from standing start exhibit although 
early days the pok mon app triggers only moderate data volumes per user youtube mobile exhibit but note that total data 
volumes are significant all users while individual usage increases over time 
although difficult quantify the pok mon app triggers usage from new mobile 
subscribers children borrowing their parents phone this app primarily 
mobile although does have fixed applications bolt ons implying variable 
revenues for telcos rising accordance with usage 
see new apps emerge key question whether pok mon will prove 
temporary phenomenon for augmented reality like icebucket 
challenge movies etc note the emergence many other augmented 
reality apps such wikitude exhibit often with sophisticated features 
such functionality interactive maps and commerce links these 
features should drive significant data usage believe apps can also 
used for advertising marketing and training purposes 
video will the main driver data volume growth vodafone europe data 
volumes have grown over the past two years smartphone and 
penetration has increased interestingly vodafone europe smartphone 
penetration remains just suggesting further upside potential going forward 
cisco expects data volumes grow with video 
increasing from the mobile data pie today 
telcos not the way play iot many chips tiny arpu believe that may 
ultimately have greater positive bearing telcos than iot while iot device 
and turnover growth has been very strong for telcos this off very low base 
while arpus per chip remain very low estimate that iot will account for just 
vodafone services revenues exhibit contrast note that 
the very first mass market virtual reality app has triggered very significant data 
usage therefore see the likes microchip and nxp better ways play 
the iot theme rather than telcos 
prefer telcos europe asia globally remain more constructive telco 
services europe asia while are more cautious the americas have 
line industry views japan eemea australia most preferred names are tmobile usa china unicom vodafone orange chunghwa and vocus comm

the pok mon phenomenon 
backdrop very quickly out the blocks 
pok mon augmented reality game played mobile phones the game was 
created internet startup called niantic inc internal google start 
association with nintendo pok mon objective search for pok mon characters 
across the real world using geolocation data the game primarily mobile although 
does have fixed line applications 
pok mon was released july the australia new zealand and 
subsequently launched europe july 
take pok mon has been explosive

first sight low data volumes per user 
telco mobile operators claim that data usage from pok mon remains relatively 
modest 
pok mon usage equates just mobile data per hour per user this 
compares with per hour for downloading mobile video for 
downstream video outlined exhibit below 
indeed this view has been backed vodafone group pok mon you 
are interested unfortunately the average utilisation data one hour you 
chasing the monsters only per hour pok mon will not change the 
future vodafone but are all very amused this thing vodafone ceo vittorio colao july note that these vodafone comments were made 
just days after the pok mon app was launched europe 
exhibit video drives considerably higher data usage than gaming 
source vodafone group american tower verizon vodafone morgan stanley research 
but other factors consider which will drive usage spike 
however note that mitigating factors that suggest pok mon driven usage could end 
compounding 
take the application continues rise significantly 
sticky application some out people that use pok mon return use 
the application the following day 
bringing new non mobile users board believe that pok mon has been 
particularly successful with children teenagers users that did not previously 
own mobile device essentially much existing pok mon usage and associated 
data volume for telco derived from new source 
other applications believe that pok mon triggers considerable other mobile 
usage facebook youtube tweets etc and also fixed usage 
pok mon data volumes will boost low base europe the average smartphone 
user one vodafone big businesses germany italy spain consumes 
per month essentially just five monthly visits pok mon hour 
each would boost monthly data usage 
pok mon come and 
key question whether pok mon usage will sustainable may prove 
temporary phenomenon along the lines icebucket challenge summer 
near term believe that take and usage pok mon will continue rise 
notably further functionality added 
over the long term would expect this usage pok mon subside however 
believe this usage will likely replaced new applications usage

applications will inevitably extend beyond gaming and entertainment towards 
commercial and educational applications

internet things iot happening but less important telcos 
background 
back published report highlighting the impact the internet things 
and the potential for telcos add another leg growth read the internet things 
now connecting the real economy however also pointed out that iot 
opportunity could take time materialise and telco operators could struggle 
monetise this phenomenon 
the excitement builds over the internet things likely that telecom 
investors will have have patience before they see material revenue opportunities 
develop while the number potential devices huge many will not even connect 
existing carrier networks and even they may use very little capacity 
very sharp rise connections 
have seen sharp rise the number connections across europe 
particular highlight that 
penetration high connections contribute now total 
mobile sims across many operators notably vodafone orange proximus sfr

but low iot monetisation telcos 
however iot has failed reach meaningful scale for telecom operators have 
identified two key reasons for this 
connected devices low data usage note that most connected devices have 
low data usage statistics for instance smart meter can use 
month which compares average mobile subscriber the consumer 
segment across europe 
exposure competitive enterprise segment and iot are enterprise driven 
segment which remains very competitive across europe 
exhibit smart meters exhibit usage profile that are fraction 
mobile subscriber 
exhibit enterprise trends remain challenging across european 
telecoms 
source smart meter awareness morgan stanley research 
note data for vodafone and 
source company data morgan stanley research 
telcos not the best way play iot 
outlined our recent research global insight survey shows internet things 
moving from hype reality aug see increased evidence that iot adoption 
finally happening 
alphawise survey our alphawise work found that the designers surveyed are 
adding iot connectivity products surveyed key decision makers responsible for the 
engines the iot 
softbank proposed acquisition arm injects long term strategic capital into iot 
the price huge premium sales for most semiconductor 
deals ceo masayoshi son seen visionary was early alibaba investor and 
has indicated doubling headcount mostly arm the within years 
see this ringing endorsement iot which combined with the overwhelming 
positive survey feedback points coming wave connectivity deployment 
remain overweight microchip iot boost and upside growth increasing 
traction for its portfolio suite cross selling approach and also nxp share gains 
bit the fastest growing segment mcus are equal weight texas 
instruments valuation only mcu exposure microchip nxp 
are covered craig hettenbach txn joseph moore 
the vodafone example iot growing but arpu per chip very small 
first sight iot would appear large scale business for vodafone group 
vodafone had iot connections the end march yoy some 
the sim base 
indeed vodafone enjoys market share iot traffic and associated 
revenues 
vodafone iot revenue base has been growing consistent clip 
yoy basis 
back estimate that iot accounted enterprise revenues 
vodafone group see exhibit below while enterprise represented 
total group revenues these facts suggest that accounted for total 
vodafone group turnover back 
vodafone group targeting growth rate for its iot revenues streams 
essentially estimate that while iot revenues will have more than trebled 
the base which very impressive feat iot will still represent just 
vodafone group revenues 
exhibit iot revenues contribute very little vodafone group estimate this still 
represent group revenues
