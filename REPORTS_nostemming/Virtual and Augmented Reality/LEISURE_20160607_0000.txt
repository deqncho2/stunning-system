truly one kind experience that could game changer for our 
company john duffey president and ceo six flags entertainment corp 
this report explain the latest concept hit amusement parks 
virtual reality roller coasters have spoken with the main operators 
rides merlin entertainments six flags europa park parques reunidos 
well the two main technology providers and list our conclusions 
have also undertaken the arduous task riding the world first fullyintegrated coaster galactica alton towers see our video here 
what virtual reality roller coaster traditional roller coaster 
equipped with cutting edge technology allow riders wear wireless 
headset riders are transported into detailed virtual world that makes them 
feel like they have entered real life video game galactica blasts you deep 
into outer space futuristic spaceship undiscovered galaxies the hard bit 
sychronise the feel the physical ride with the visuals the virtual 
world experts reckon the combination mental and physical stimulation 
increases the thrill factor would not disagree the concept 
its infancy with only coasters globally non coasters but early 
feedback promising and executives very excited 
what are the benefits park operators improve guest experience 
coasters are the first real park innovation for many years cannot replicated 
home and could boost admissions reduce capital needs parks are 
capital intensive and usually need new rides stimulate volumes but retrofitting can reinvigorate older ride and boost irrs show 
personalisation the virtual world can easily interchanged 
offer something new with themes based the season even 
personalised extension into other rides and augmented reality 
potential issues include motion sickness sanitation rider throughput and 
labour costs but none these seem major obstacles 
implications for valuations amusement parks with high exposure 
capital consumptive rides tend valued below large led parks run 
vertically integrated operators such disney universal traditional parks 
can use boost attendance and move lower capex model this could 
lead reassessment how they are valued parques and merlin each have 
roller coasters but this disproportionately more parques profits

how does work all the rides have looked use samsung gear headsets powered oculus rift 
these are essentially large goggles into which smartphone fitted the goal the hardware create what 
appears life size virtual environment headsets use two feeds sent one lcd display and the 
lenses the goggles focus and reshape the picture for each eye create stereoscopic image angling 
the two images mimic how each our two eyes views the world see here one important way 
headsets can increase immersion increase the field view how wide the picture degree 
display would too expensive and unnecessary most high end headsets make with degree field 
view which wide enough trick the brain for the resulting picture all convincing minimum 
frame rate around frames per second needed avoid stuttering users feeling sick say experts the 
current range headsets beyond this head tracking means that when you wear headset the 
picture front you shifts you look down and side side angle your head finally headphones can 
used increase the sense immersion

how does work rollercoaster the hard bit about roller coaster integrating the feel the 
physical ride with the visuals the virtual world bear mind that any point time the people the front 
the coaster are having very different physical experience those the back thus every person display 
needs slightly different this also needs done safe way and without impacting guest throughput 
staff costs too much there seem two different main operating systems 
vector this figment productions motion synchronisation and control platform for 
virtual reality and used alton towers vector fixes each seat galactica with 
control pack that includes accelerometer gyroscope and bluetooth and 
controllers the system communicates exact positional data the rider headset allowing 
render perfectly synchronized content real time the system also allows the ride 
operators make adjustments the riders experience route for example message 
remove the headset using tablet device the headset tethered the coaster riders 
put when they board cleaned between each ride and charged continuously this 
reduces the need for multiple headsets and staff this system seems safe risk the 
headset being dropped while the ride motion relatively low cost one headset per seat 
but does mean there slightly longer gap between each ride for guests taking the 
headset and off and for cleaning meaning guest throughput lower than for standard 
roller coaster the vector headset also includes sound for more immersive experience 
coaster between mack the roller coaster producer that also owns europa park 
and some technology developers being used six flags parques reunidos and cedar 
fair this can equip any roller coaster with hardware consisting position sensor and the 
coaster black box which synchronizes with the real ride there are cables 
onboard hardware needed cheaper system than vector the headset put 
before the ride and cleaned and charged after the guest gets off the ride this should mean 
higher guest throughput riders can get used the headset while the queue and less 
hygiene perception issue each headset not continual use and can dry fully 
between cleaning however this means more headsets are required and potentially more 
manpower needed carry them back and forth cleaned and charged also 
understand that the position sensor linked the revolution the wheels but that these 
can slip spin potentially impacting sychronisation finally the headset not necessarily 
tethered the ride there potentially risk dropped while the ride motion 
comparing the two systems would describe the main advantages the vector system higher 
level immersion theming the entire coaster includes sound and potentially higher safety standard 
headsets tethered its disadvantages are hygiene perception you are clearly using the previous rider 
headset and the sanitation wipe can leave residue for one minute and higher cost estimate low 
single digit million would describe the coaster system easier retrofit cables hardware etc 
leisure and hotels june 
morgan stanley research 
cheaper run low digit figure with fewer sanitation issues but the disadvantages are many more 
headsets are needed albeit often supported hardware sponsorship and higher staff costs should noted 
that are not technology roller coaster experts and have only personally visited galactica our 
comparisons may simplistic the main point though that both systems seem work well and amusement 
park operators have choice technology

what like sadly weren able record our reaction whilst riding galactica but the word exhilarating 
would not exaggeration see our video after the event here wouldn disagree with sam rhodes six 
flags corporate director design who said that combining the virtual reality experience with the physical 
sensations the roller coaster increases the thrill factor times psychologists believe that roller 
coasters achieve this effect activating certain areas person brain more than typical roller coaster 
virtual reality experience alone would combining already novel exciting event roller coaster and putting 
top another exciting novel event virtual reality creates additive rather than cancelling effect and 
course new and exciting events trigger the release dopamine you come off the ride natural high 
independent feedback far still early days most rides have only been operating few months 
however have spoken the main operators the technology providers and looked review sites 
merlin says that galactica scoring well has exceeded internal expectations and that proud 
have created the world first fully integrated virtual reality coaster its throughput also where 
expected 
six flags says that has received very positive guest feedback and rave reviews from numerous 
media outlets including usa today cnn the times and respected industry publications 
however early days initially the parks only opened briefly for spring break before closing 
again and the peak summer season will the real test 
parques reunidos says that mount mara ride has been very well received guests that does not 
think just flash the pan and that the impact has been akin adding new ride 
europa park say has seen very strong feedback alpenexpress with surveys rating 
scale and increased interest the park overall 
what are the benefits amusement parks 
improve the overall experience until now rollercoasters have competed superlatives for example the 
world fastest ferrari rossa abu dhabi the world tallest kingda the there 
have been few really innovative new rides for many years and industry advances have generally been left the 
global leaders disney and universal using their movie and concepts with virtual reality though amusement 
parks have the ability offer something that genuinely new cannot replicated home with the potential 
leisure and hotels june 
morgan stanley research 
combine physical thrills with visual excitement can effectively convert older ride the experience 
newly built ride for early movers such merlin and six flags there could also added benefit other 
operators have them their markets and this could help them sell more tickets and season passes 
reduce capital needs amusement parks are very capital intensive with recurrent capex running high 
sales industry average funded attractive ebitda margins the average park does not 
enjoy the strong vertically integrated majors disney and universal and usually falls back new rides 
stimulate admissions thrill rides such roller coasters are particularly capital consumptive with new roller 
coaster costing anywhere ridership and returns generally dwindle over time excitement 
diminishes and the ride dates however sam rhodes six flags corporate director design says 
have the opportunity take coaster that been our system for several years and give completely 
new life without having build giant multimillion dollar steel structure 
the average life span steel roller coaster years but can often lot longer the oldest over 
years old depending more modern designs and the safety record retrofitting onto older ride 
can cost well under though the more extensive fit like galactica makes figure more realistic 
look the rides the table above the average age the coasters the years and europaparks flagship alpen express years old however adding can boost throughput with refresh

getting closer customers the virtual world can easily interchanged offer something new guests 
during various times the season for example park could build library themes such hallowe 
ghouls and change the flick the switch customers can choose different visuals they can even 
personalised perhaps using the queue get customers submit preferences for what sort ride they 
want this should allow theme parks get closer their customers 
extending and other rides merlin already extending other concepts for example derren 
brown ghost train thorpe park the void madame tussauds new york can added many 
rides and technology progresses and riders get used think could become big point 
differentiation with home entertainment augmented reality likely come next whereas virtual reality 
completely obstructs your view the real world with whatever video shown the screen strapped 
across your eyes augmented reality does not block your entire view whatever around you but uses clear 
partial screens impose computer generated video imagery into whatever you see example this means 
riders could combine the benefit seeing the heights and scenery real world roller coaster with virtual 
reality technology still needs advance further this given the blurring created when when motion 
but theme parks seems inevitable one day 
potential issues and risks the issues below are generally not insurmountable but they happen enough 
times can cause delays increase queue times impact guest satisfaction and reduce throughput 
motion sickness major issue with motion sickness generally resulting from cue 
conflict the nauseous disconnect felt when the visual cues from the virtual world don 
match the natural signals from your body sensory system however roller coaster riders 
should move sync with what they are seeing and faster computers and displays have 
reduced the latency meaning nausea actually more likely when using while stationary 
sanitation riders share headsets and these therefore need cleaned between each 
ride the coaster system changes headsets for each rider while they are cleaned and 
recharged the vector system used galactica cannot swap the headsets they are 
tethered the ride attendants wipe all parts the headset that touch rider face and 
head with anti bacterial wipes however the wipe can take minute dry the next 
rider may see the residue and worse mistake for perspiration hygiene issues have 
come across far seem more perception over reality but operators may need work 
educating the public their procedures 
throughput interval loaders like roller coasters are already poor terms ride capacity 
averaging riders per hour the best park rides are capable putting through more 
than this throughout reduced adding ride given the additional time 
needed take headsets and off get used the ride clean the headsets and 
example understand alton towers was prepared reduce galactica throughput 
leisure and hotels june 
morgan stanley research 
from when was branded air and that having started below this 
above this level already another example parques mount mara where guests have sit 
alone rather than side side during ride which effectively halves throughput think 
throughput drop fine the ride worth the wait but there clearly balance 
delays and queues there are many small issues which can cause short delay 
complaint about hygiene difficulty putting the headset fear about putting what 
effectively blindfold any these can cause delay which affects the entire queue and 
thus everyone ride experience 
labour costs coasters require additional staff deal with the headsets coupled with 
lower throughput and capex this can quickly change the economics the ride 
expectation management some riders generally those who have not read and 
come the ride open minded can blown away like but others particularly those 
who have researched experienced roller coasters who prefer the pure ride can have too 
high expectations for example disappointment with the screen door effect seeing the fine 
pixels the screen 
safety there risk the headset falls off and injures someone for rides where the headset 
not tethered even for those rides where the headset secured with three straps one around 
the head one over the head and chinstrap who stop guest taking the headset off 
watch their neighbour the ride and who can say that headset won accidentally 
dropped onto visitor below 
cannot work all rides headsets need relatively smooth ride too much headshaking impacts the visual experience therefore can necessarily retro fitted onto all 
coasters 
implications for amusement park valuations older outdoor amusement parks with limited and exposed 
capital consumptive rides tend valued lower multiple than indoor entertainment centres the 
large led parks run disney universal traditional parks can use boost attendance and move 
slightly lower capex model this could lead reassessment how they are valued parques and merlin each 
have roller coasters but this disproportionately more parques profitability see table below 
rate both merlin entertainments operates galactica and parques reunidos operates mount 
mara overweight think merlin the quality operator with strong global roll out story led its 
strong lego and midway and good track record however this already reflected its year targets and 
our forecasts and contrast parques seems have more potential improve its existing parks through 
projects and extensions where returns could higher and safer can deliver its targets addition 
think parques should have stronger year for organic sales growth spain enjoying strong year for 
incoming tourists whereas merlin has high exposure the weak london market parques trades

comment our technology analyst brian nowak 
believe that while the development virtual reality still the very early innings has 
immense potential all immersive and engaging user experience facebook has noted that 
over the long term has the potential change the way that live work and communicate 
and that going the next big computing platform this year has marked significant 
milestones the development with the release oculus rift march and announcements 
facebook conference introducing oculus touch adaptive streaming and designs the 
surround camera for perspective over million hours video have been watched the 
gear platform alone 
however view the opportunity and product development multi year decade time 
horizon facebook has stated this early and going take long time and the 
kind thing that are investing year time horizon 
relates leisure companies provides the opportunity reinvigorate older rides with new 
and immersive experiences relatively low costs this value proposition will only continue 
improve technology develops for example most the rides mentioned above utilize 
samsung gear which contains optical lens that allows degree field view compare that 
with the recently released oculus rift which boasts degree field view addition two 
integrated oled displays clearer images and smoother refresh rates expect greater 
proliferation the product experience continues improve and the price comes downs 
higher end headsets for oculus rift gear
