cycle driving accelerating unit growth the second half the year which should 
benefit not only apple but component suppliers with increased content the new 
devices second believe cloud computing inflection point growth that 
should accelerate original device manufacture odm server and storage share gains 
well benefit cloud providers that can move the stack offer services like machine 
learning and artificial intelligence and lastly see new computing platforms such 
augmented and virtual reality the internet things machine learning and artificial

positioning ahead the next computing cycle 
portfolio manager summary mobile computing drove earnings and share price 
outperformance relative the for technology leaders over the past decade but 
growth mobile penetration slows investors question whether the next computing 
cycle can contribute meaningful outperformance our view that new sources data 
will proliferate opening the potential for new computing platforms such 
autonomous cars artificial intelligence internet things and virtual augmented reality 
however meaningful realization these markets may years away the meantime 
smartphone product cycles matter does the growth inflection see cloud 
computing 
every years new computing cycle emerges that the size the prior cycle 
mobile computing measured billions units from millions installed units 
during the mainframe cycle the along the way computing has been centralized 
the company level followed the department level and more recently distributed 
every employee and consumer the mobile era this sets high bar for what comes 
next remain the historical path the next computing cycle must drive tens 
billions units well above global population billion our view that sensors tied 
both people and objects automobiles industrial and medical equipment retail 
inventory homes component parts etc will create computing network allowing for 
new data sources and insights turn long discussed trends like autonomous cars 
artificial intelligence and augmented virtual reality will come fruition

quarterly quantitative stock rankings 
september morgan stanley launched global quantitative stock selection 
model called most which ranks stocks based combination heuristics that have 
proven effective predicting three month forward stock returns over nearly three 
decades history unlike fundamental analysis which provides price target and thus 
absolute return prediction for each stock our quantitative model aims identifying 
stocks that are likely out underperform relative their peers thus most 
used rank stocks into quintiles top bottom relative their regional peers the 
rankings are purely data driven with discretionary element from the global quant 
team quantitative equity investing has been and remains substantially effective 
especially markets that are less mature and efficient that note our model has 
performed especially well europe and emerging markets addition our research has 
shown that fundamental analyst ratings and most rankings are more effective 
predicting stock returns when combined than when used isolation quantitative and 
fundamental analysis offer different and complementary perspectives using both 
likely leads better rank ordering the stock universe 
the model was built using extensive historical database global stocks 
including stocks that belong the hardware gics industry group which 
have dozens metrics factors quant lingo that use for predicting purposes 
those include number fundamental ratios roe long term debt equity etc 
valuation multiples ebitda next month trends stock price 
earnings estimates month price momentum down eps revisions ratio and 
others when building the model started identifying which metrics have been 
effective historically various sectors industries and regions however order 
guard against excessive data mining our approach also includes reviews the 
academic literature and input from fundamental analysts shown exhibit 
order confident that the factors identify will exhibit sustained predictive power 
going forward critical understand why factor predictive and the academic 
literature helps provide theoretical rationales explain the predictive power factors 
most theoretical explanations are either risk based factor returns are compensation for 
risk taken rooted behavioral finance furthermore since most our factors are 
based fundamental data the input from fundamental analysts helps ensure are 
using factors that make sense given industry sector

our global stock universe segmented along regional and industry lines divide the 
world into north america europe japan and asia japan and emerging markets apxj 
and given the large differences between regions particular differences 
accounting standards compare stocks their regional peers our model rankings 
are region relative addition our model treats fundamental and valuation metrics 
differently from momentum metrics revisions and price momentum while 
fundamental metrics are most useful when comparing stocks their industry sector 
peers momentum metrics are most effective when comparing stocks their country 
regional peers trend following investors typically pay less attention industry 
specific considerations their stock selection process result our final stock 
selection model combination fundamental component which segments the 
universe industry groups sectors and momentum component which 
segmented geography 
the momentum component the most model north america and europe 
near mix price momentum month price momentum excluding the most 
recent month and earnings revisions down revisions ratio don use the 
momentum component japan since those factors have not been effective there 
historically apxj the down revisions factor included the 
fundamental component and the momentum component only the month price 
momentum factor price momentum not predictive everywhere within apxj 
use the factor only countries brazil mexico chile south africa india china 
australia and new zealand 
the fundamental component most made valuation and fundamental 
metrics the set metrics and their mix vary across industry groups developed 
markets and across sectors given the more limited sample size apxj exhibit 
shows the factors and corresponding weights that make the fundamental 
component for technology stocks developed and emerging markets the weights 
were determined running regressions predicting three month forward stock returns 
based data from note that use the same fundamental valuation 
metrics both software and hardware fundamental metrics and valuations which rely 
trailing reported data have historically been less predictive fast growing industries 
than more traditional ones result momentum metrics which way 
represent the judgment analysts and investors have larger relative importance 
growth oriented industry groups like hardware within the global most model further 
analysis shows that momentum metrics tend more effective growth than 
value industries 
our historical analysis has shown that deep value factors long term measures 
valuation like price book the shiller are generally not effective within 
technology this not surprising given that many tech companies are fast growing and 
have relatively short history compared companies more mature sectors besides 
the book value doesn take into account intangibles and especially the cumulative value 
efforts over time since mostly treated expense contrast priceto operating cash flow has historically been effective both hardware and software 
cumulative market cap has also been quite effective throughout the 
technology sector developed markets note that don use this factor apxj

prevent proper testing the factor effectiveness define cumulative the

apple aapl overweight 
portfolio manager summary see apple benefitting from iphone supercycle 
the supercycle driven new oled displays and battery technology that along with 
form factor change will unlock pent demand particularly china additionally 
view increasing services mix providing improved earnings and gross margin stability going 
forward with potential tax reform another catalyst both terms accelerated share 
repurchases and lower structural tax rate shares typically trade during 
strong iphone cycle which drives our price target with our bull case more 
likely iphone growth hits supply chain targets the range 
innovation drives iphone supercycle while remain conservative iphone growth 
unit shipments off low base think that apple will introduce 
revolutionary new iphones late the year that will offer flexible amoled displays 
with front and back glass cover new more power efficient application 
processor and fast wireless charging that potentially extends the beam forming 
technology introduced the airpods chip this year believe this will have twofold effect first belive this anniversary iphone will drive meaningful upgrade 
cycle given that battery life has been the biggest complaint among smartphone users 
for some time our alphawise smartphone survey before the iphone 
users noted that longer battery life was the source dissatisfaction with their 
phone this compares only that said larger screen size was their primary source 
dissatisfaction fast forward and longer battery life remains the top criteria 
for purchasing smartphone respondents while only respondents 
attribute screen size with the possible additional benefit fast and wireless 
charging believe that the new iphone will have the technological horsepower 
drive significant upgrade cycle however note possible that only one third 
the new product portfolio could include all these new technology features due 
yields the cost build and supply constraints while this could limit demand price 
segmentation can improve asps and profitability 
new form factor should unlock pent demand china china smartphone users are 
more sensitive form factor changes the market hasn experienced significant 
upgrades since iphone launched late result smartphone replacement 
cycle lengthened from months months consumers deferred purchases 
until more revolutionary form factor smartphone hits the market the meantime 
chinese consumers have gone far purchasing makeover kits fake camera stickers 
and headphone jack plugs give their old phones the appearance the newest 
iphone without actually upgrading their device this speaks how important new form 
factors and features are this large customer base and the pent demand that 
revolutionary iphone could unlock forecast smartphone growth china

charging our check suggests apple could adopt wireless charging for the new iphone 
and luxshare could one the suppliers coil handset and after market 
wireless charging docks 
lightning cable overcapacity but adapter increases value content iphone usb type 
upgrade android camp presents opportunity luxshare currently has 
share within apple both iphone and ipad with the remainder shared hon hai 
fit and foxlink the new comes with lightning adapter which 
believe also supplied luxshare adapter pricing slightly higher than 
lightning cable pricing luxshare has increased its share the value content the 
new iphone though acknowledge that the adapter could merely serve 
transitional product with limited life cycle for type connector expect gradual 
upgrade process with revenue contribution expect brands 
first adopt usb type connector nbs pcs then some tvs followed 
smartphones and estimate overall revenue cagr during 
expect luxshare control share though this likely gradually 
decline 
new business including antenna and acoustic for apple lift blended gpm 
total gross profit expect luxshare start supplying wifi antennas 
ipads and leverage its partnership with merry further penetrate into apple 
acoustic business both products should carry higher gpm than current 
connector cable business though luxshare can only recognize part the 
acoustic profit since the business run under with merry 
potential adoption wireless charging apple the next iphone could present 
further upside our estimate our checks suggest apple could adopt wireless charging 
the new iphone while the plan isn finalized yet new iphone handsets could 
equipped with wireless charging module and apple could offer wireless charging 
docks the after market luxshare could become the supplier wireless charging 
docks but haven yet factored this into our model believe pricing share 
allocation etc for wireless charging hasn been finalized yet comparison samsung

expanding its product portfolio from servers only full rack solutions server storage 
switch the average asp server storage switch even higher than the server 
only rack solution currently makes quanta total data center hardware and

which was sign slower than expected sell through both smartphones and htc 
vive our view looking into expect htc own brand smartphone lose share 
given severe competition while oled display shortage could cap its upside for both 
smartphone and shipments that casts high uncertainty the likelihood solid 
turnaround next year current valuation looks stretched with significant 
turnaround insight and reducing cash position 
stay are skeptical sustainable turnaround the coming year 
see that remains challenging for the htc smartphone business turn 
profitable given fierce competition its own brand smartphone business and limited 
contribution from google pixel even though htc has partnered with google for its 
high asp pixel smartphone believe the volume relatively small and the valueadded htc limited ems its partnership with google ems projects like 
pixel allows the company lift its utilization rate but the value shifts ems unlikely 
rate the stock volume might not grow until google changes its channel strategy and 
that remains seen 
expect htc vive remain loss making product owing its small scale with 
oled supply tightness serves swing factor upside htc vive monthly run rate 
has slowed and now expect its total shipments barely hit units below our 
original target its second generation virtual reality offering won 
unveiled until early next year meanwhile oled panel supply tightness 
well expected the market view another uncertainty cap upside 
shipments samsung should prioritize its allocation smartphone with bigger 
volume lower mix than next year are aware that gaming titles contents

far below bull side expectations the range units

samsung sdi underweight 
portfolio manager summary expect sdi operating losses continue 
battery related losses further weigh the company overall profitability see earnings 
downside risks stemming from market share loss the small sized battery business 
competition remains fierce and higher pricing pressure for batteries given rising excess 
supply from chinese new entrants electronic materials business the only strong link 
but not enough offset the weakness the battery business segment 
our underweight call driven structurally negative electric vehicle battery 
returns while stay positive the long term growth outlook the global 
battery industry believe battery cell the worst place the value chain given low 
entry barriers and excess capacity builds especially from china such believe sdi 
position the market may not translate into profits from the rising theme 
furthermore higher regulatory risks china battery supply chain poses further 
downside risks sdi battery business and ability gain share globally regulatory 
hurdles include qualification for china approved vendor list and the chinese 
government recent increase minimum capacity expect the related 
business grow accounting for the total revenue 
from but margins remain the red near 
relatively stable small size battery should see muted margin recovery due 
competition estimate the small size battery business account for roughly 
the total revenue with operating margin negative lowsingle digits the business more stable but see downside earnings risks this 
business well resulting from continued intensified competition with chinese 
players and potential market share loss post the note battery related incidents 
electronic materials provide the only source profits but not share price driver

fih mobile underweight 
portfolio manager summary stay fih spite more attractive valuation 
cite lack strong positive catalysts and though fundamentals are improving they 
are still challenging india currency replacement program remains negative for 
sentiment despite ytd share price underperformance 
the decline handset sales resulting from india currency replacement 
program could short term payment disruption rather than structural demand 
issue tend believe that the impact temporary and likely push demand out 
even the sales fall off likely will still drag fih sales and 
margins hurt low utilization rates estimate that sales from india account for 
fih total sales our initial assessment points overall bottom line impact just 
around fih this year but this remains negative sentiment despite ytd share 
price underperformance 
market share reshuffle among chinese oems appears not benefit fih customer 
sony still suffers from share loss with total shipment units shipped 
and shipments were barely hitting units while moto had even fewer based 
huawei and xiaomi shipments total shipments are expected reach and 
unit respectively and down yoy the magnitude growth 
decelerates from previous years expect fih assembly business have limited 
growth than oppo and vivo who largely source house expand their market share 
metal casing adoption rate continues increase but this largely offset 
asp decline stemming from cheaper solution less processing time cnc hybrid 
solution for cnc stamping while fih also faces strong competition from byde 
everwin and tongda etc aac who offers mechanical solution also another 
emerging competitor the fight for xiaomi casing business redmi pro 
little visibility into ong term earnings drivers fih provides total solutions covering 
both assembly and component for smartphone brands like chinese brands xiaomi 
huawei and gionee india local oems also present another opportunity but saw 
karbonn local smartphone manufacturer who was reportedly expanding its capacity 
for non apple orders become competitor rather than customer fih acquisition

sharp underweight 
portfolio manager summary are underweight sharp because expect that the 
company will miss operating profit guidance the near term plant capacity will peak 
after improving the short term and that medium small sized lcd panels will 
return operating losses with price target see greater than 
downside sharp and maintain our underweight rating 
expect shortfall guidance maintain raise our lcd business estimate 
from operating losses reflecting stronger conviction after 
results capacity utilization improvement for the business result now 
project but still expect miss guidance inch 
our price target from owing our estimate revisions still use 
sotp based ebitda the increase our price target chiefly reflects 
increase our ebitda multiple for the lcd business the high end the

hon hai remain the stock 
lcd earnings outlook display devices sales were digital information 
equipment mainly lcd tvs and lcd business have been put into one segment 
result change segmentation sales were yoy and lcd 
business sales were about sharp gives the breakdown size for 
medium small sized lcds and for large lcds the three major plants 
estimate capacity utilization was flat qoq kameyama rose from 
kameyama and rose from mie for 
operating rates were likely lifted due stable prices for inch panels due 
shortage supply 
plant capacity improve over short term but may peak also believe 
ltps lines were affected change core customers top chinese smartphone 
companies and roughly reduction ltps capacity from oled pilot line 
introduction shipments north american customers will peak line 
capacity utilization will rise but expect operating rates peak expect lcd 
business operating losses improve from estimated 
fueled particular rise capacity utilization project lcd business will 
turn profit however expect medium small sized lcd panels return 
operating losses assuming increase smartphones using oleds sharp 
plans mass produce oleds but not expect that really begin until 
later and there are many uncertainties even after mass production such yields and 
margins 
content hon hai collaboration boost sharp expects profit grow 
from envisioning boosts from sales growth and from 
cost cuts and improvement the mix outweighing dent from lower selling 
prices the company also expects boost from collaboration with hon hai 
this chiefly reflects benefits display business but also advantages terms 
purchasing materials 
expect lcd biz return red due higher depreciation now project 
this not major change from our prior forecast and
