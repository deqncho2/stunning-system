companies will shine 
taiwan hardware tech companies are transforming growth 
slows given high smartphone gearing quanta delta and 
advantech have clear strategies tackle new challenges 
downgrade pegatron due slower growth and adlink 
because eps shortfall 
the drivers the transformation taiwan hardware tech companies have gone 
through and smartphone product cycles and are now entering the internet 
things iot age amid keen competition from china the growth and 
smartphone markets this leading six transformations from high 
volume low variety low volume high variety from high product customer 
concentration low product customer concentration from odm ems 
obm solution provider from organic growth from labor intensive 
automation and from manufacturing edge technology leadership 
expect these lead profound changes business models and earnings 
drivers 
identify four groups amid the transformation companies with core 
businesses that are still uptrend largan ennoconn airtac 
companies that aim become total solution providers quanta delta 
advantech companies that endeavor diversify products and reduce reliance 
pcs and smartphones asustek odms catcher companies that 
combine and hon hai acer wistron 
spotting the potential beneficiaries the transformation not easy task 
the companies face structural and cyclical challenges could lengthy 
process contributions from new earnings drivers will from areas with small 
volumes high customization against core businesses that are high volume low 
customization construct framework help identify those companies that 
could emerge successfully from this transformation prefer companies with 
products that are still uptrend without immediate pressure 
transform largan ennoconn airtac and those that have clear goals strategies 
for transformation quanta delta advantech the latter group goal 
transform into total solution providers can help them better protect margins 
given likely diminishing hardware value system are less positive those 
that rely purely product diversification because this process will long 
their core businesses remain highly reliant pcs smartphones while the iot 
market remains small

investment summary 
taiwan hardware tech companies are crossroads taiwan hardware tech 
companies thrived along with two big product cycles pcs and smartphones the global 
market sales has declined since and smartphone market growth started 
decelerate single digit whereas the iot and augmented reality virtual 
reality should promising the long term but contributions the near term 
most taiwan hardware tech companies will remain small most importantly the 
value hardware could diminishing given the rise many new business models that 
are content driven not mention the threat from burgeoning tech companies china 
therefore how taiwan hardware companies will transform has been top question 
for both companies and investors this report lay out our depth analysis this 
long term theme 
six themes how taiwan hardware tech companies are transforming identify six 
themes for taiwan hardware tech transformation 
from high volume low variety low volume high variety this trend mainly reflects 
the end demand shift from high volume standard pcs and smartphones low 
volume high variety iot and evolving and robot markets which feature higher 
customization match the requirement for fragmented vertical markets 
from high product customer concentration low product customer concentration 
this because the change key players along with the shift from pcs smartphones 
iot and robots dell and apple are the key players pcs smartphones 
while the players are more fragmented the iot world 
from ems odm obm and solution provider this move seek growth and 
help protect margins given the diminishing value hardware the value add 
customers higher for branded business and solutions hardware software 
compared purely hardware manufacturing 
from organic growth taiwan hardware tech companies have relied organic 
growth mainly but becoming more prevalent either from industry consolidation 
overseas firms looking for growth 
from labor intensive automation this move could improve cost structures 
hampered rising labor costs and enhance production efficiency through big data 
analysis 
from manufacturing edge technology leadership many taiwanese companies have 
thrived using cheaper labor china labor costs china rise this business model 
will not sustainable however few companies taiwan have superior technology 
that foreign rivals are unlikely catch with within the next few years largan 
example here 
four groups companies classified how they tackle the challenge 
transformation categorize taiwan hardware tech companies into four groups 
based their strategies about how revive growth 
companies with core businesses that are still uptrend largan ennoconn 
airtac 
companies that aim become total solution providers quanta delta advantech 
companies that endeavor diversify products and reduce reliance pcs and 
smartphones asustek odms catcher 
companies that combine the second and third points above hon hai acer 
wistron adlink 
proprietary evaluation framework identify which companies will shine 
construct framework evaluate the possibility successful transformation for each 
company based three capabilities 
financial capability use net cash position and ebitda volatility measure each 
company cash generation stability support the transformation asustek delta 
quanta stand out here 
execution capability compare each company sales breakdown product and 
customer and also historical performance measure execution reduce reliance 
single customer dell apple and single product and smartphone 
well move better margin business improve delta quanta advantech 
shine 
new business development capability look each company average 
expenses sales ratio and expenses growth evaluate investment 
capability develop new business ipc and automation names outperform 
stock implications our top picks are those with core businesses that still enjoy 
uptrend which should support high sustainable growth largan ennoconn airtac 
next also like companies that have set clear goals strategies for transformation 
quanta delta advantech most them aim transform into total solution 
providers which should help the companies better protect margins hardware value 
diminishes over time the transformation will take time the contributions from new 
earings drivers for most them will from areas with small volume high 
customization against core businesses that are high volume low customization however 
believe this group companies stands out given their clear strategies and strong 
execution the other hand are less positive those focused purely product 
diversification this strategy was quickly employed centric makers they 
diversified from pcs smartphones but they are now facing slowing growth 
smartphones well 
this report based our analysis stay and raise our quanta 
eps from reflecting stronger growth the datacenter hardware 
business propelled acceleration data growth boosted new applications live 
video streaming and quanta customer product portfolio expansion reiterate our 
rating ennoconn and lift our peg from given the 
company multiple growth engines rising outsourcing orders aggressive and 
strong execution and business opportunities with hon hai group support strong 
growth keep advantech and raise our eps from 
higher eps forecasts and valuation rollover 
the other hand downgrade pegatron from with the unchanged 
eps given the fair valuation and lack new growth drivers 
replace the iphone the next years downgrade adlink from and cut 
our eps from due weaker sales growth and margin 
shortfall amid transition which still underestimated the market our reduced eps 
projections are below bloomberg consensus 
where could wrong and smartphone shipments could revive which may 
lead hardware companies hold off from transforming however would view any 
shipment revival temporary given already high penetration both and 
smartphone markets companies with clear transformation strategies could fail 
execute successfully this will take time monitor most transformations are still

hardware tech transformation 
taiwan hardware tech companies are moving away from slowing and smartphone 
markets and seeking new growth engines recognise such transformation must 
for the companies continue grow the medium long term 
our framework evaluates the possibility success 
this report summarize the transformation plan for the taiwanese hardware tech 
companies our coverage universe and provide framework measure the possibility 
success for each company reiterate our positive view largan delta quanta 
and advantech believe they have clear strategies tackle new challenges and 
good execution records 
the framework exhibit comprises six criteria within three groups financial 
capability net cash positions and ebitda volatility execution capability product 
diversification customer diversification and gross margins the past five years and 
new business development capability historical investment conclude that 
delta quanta and advantech lead other hardware tech peers terms 
transformation 
downgrade our rating pegatron equal weight from overweight because 
see lack new growth drivers least the next years offset the slowing 
iphone market well limited room for market share gains iphones 
downgrade our rating adlink underweight from equal weight like adlink 
investment and development new technology and products for fifth generation 
mobile networks and the industrial iot however now expect the company nearterm earnings much lower than had previously forecast because softer topline momentum amid transition top the still loss making new investment

the main end markets are growth 
growth the major global hardware markets including for pcs smartphones and 
tablet pcs started slow because the already high penetration hardware 
devices lukewarm macro conditions and volatile currencies emerging markets 
growth the total shipments pcs smartphones and tablet pcs slowed yoy 
from cagr and total sales pcs smartphones and tablet 
pcs dropped yoy from cagr 
over taiwan hardware tech companies our coverage universe derived more 
than sales from pcs smartphones and tablet pcs also the odms and 
component suppliers are highly exposed few major customers such apple 
dell and lenovo growth which has slowed the past couple years therefore 
noted believe transformation necessary 
looking ahead identify the iot and two potential drivers after saturation 
pcs smartphones but may take time for these segments contribute materially 
they are still initial investment stage build complete eco system 
addition the nature hardware for the iot industry highly diverse given the 
fragmented vertical market thus hardware companies also need change their 
business models from high volume low variety low volume high variety better 
capture the growth opportunities the iot era the business model change one

from manufacturing edge technology leadership many taiwanese companies have 
thrived using cheaper labor china labor costs china rise this business model 
not sustainable however few companies taiwan have superior technology that 
foreign rivals are unlikely catch with within the next few years largan 
example here 
from high volume low variety low volume high variety taiwan benefited from the 
two big technology cycles pcs and smartphones however both are growth iot 
the next big thing the smartphone age products are high volume low variety but 
the iot era the products could low volume high variety therefore this will lead 
change business models 
from high product customer concentration low product customer concentration 
the era the key customers were and dell the smartphone era the key 
customer apple iot world the customers will more fragmented 
from ems odm obm solution provider most the companies taiwan started 
from being odms but since the growth their customers slowing some are pursuing 
own brand solution provider business models delta and hon hai are the examples 
delta aims transform from hardware component supplier solution provider 
areas including industrial automation and power systems hon hai also targets 
expand into obm business after seeing the slowdown ems business like iphone 
assembly 
from organic growth taiwan hardware tech companies have relied organic 
growth mainly but become more prevalent either from industry consolidation 
overseas firms looking for growth more companies view key growth 
strategy including delta advantech adlink and hon hai 
from labor intensive automation amid rising labor costs many companies are 
increasing automation hardware tech automation remains quite low and has lot 
room increase hon hai and pegatron which have been increasing the automation

the transformation 
categorize hardware tech companies under our coverage into four categories based 
their ultimate goals for transformation and their current investments they 
not have concrete goals transformation the four categories are companies that 
have clear aim become total solution providers companies that endeavor 
diversify products and reduce reliance smartphones companies that combine 
and and companies with core businesses that are still long term uptrend 
exhibit 
rank those companies that aim transform into total solution providers the highest 
think total solutions hardware software the ultimate business model for 
hardware companies secure their value the whole supply chain and generate 
decent profits besides the move total solution providers most hardware companies 
have been attempting diversify their product portfolios after seeing saturation the 
market since smartphones and tablet pcs were the two key focus areas the 
past couple years given large volumes and fast growth but demand for these 
products has also slowed since companies now are looking for other new 
opportunities like wearables gaming robots and others 
addition there are some relatively small companies that are well positioned 
industries long term uptrend and are likely enjoy robust growth the next 
years think these companies will focus enhancing their competitiveness 
existing businesses and spend less time resources business transformation 
core businesses that are still long term uptrend 
largan rising dual camera adoption expansion into house vcm and auto lenses 
propel multi year growth are positive largan given the dual camera 
upcycle early stage the beginning the dual camera cycle and

airtac ample share gain potential propel growth airtac the second largest 
pneumatic component maker china with market share sales the 
company generates sales from china and competes mainly with japanese 
players smc the world largest pneumatic component player are positive 
the multi year growth outlook for airtac given mild industry growth china this 
supported ongoing industry upgrades and the increasing prevalence labor cost 
hikes and labor shortages sizable share gain potential smc revenue scale china 
larger than airtac total sales smc total sales are bigger than airtac 
total sales think airtac will continue gain share the expense smc helped 
ongoing new product launches appeal new customers competitive pricing 
lower than smc price and better after sales services and customization and new 
growth engine from electrical products the global electrical component market size 
was around versus airtac revenue scale 
which implies ample room for growth the company able execute well 
ennoconn unique contract manufacturing business model aggressive activity 
cooperation opportunities with hon hai group drive multi year growth ennoconn 
industrial player taiwan specializing contract manufacturing identify 
three key pillars that should support fast growth the next couple years rising 
outsourcing orders from global ipc vendors expect the investment kontron

initially financial support would needed from the existing business thus 
believe companies with strong cash position and stable cash generation capability are

adlink sales shortfall and loss making investment lead 
margin downside the near term wait for new products bear fruit 
downgrade adlink from and lower our price target eps

weakness and the still loss making investment prismtech 
like adlink investment for new products and also the acquisition the 
software company prismtech capture growth opportunities from and industrial 
iot however will take time before the whole infrastructure for and industrial iot 
ready addition the synergy from the acquisition prismtech taking longer
