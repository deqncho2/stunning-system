what cloud gaming 
cloud gaming sometimes referred game streaming relatively new technology for delivering games consumers 
traditionally gamers have had purchase console such xbox order play aaa top quality video games 
this was driven the fact that these titles require powerful dedicated hardware quickly compute and render the game world 
real time however the global internet and cloud computing infrastructures have improved becoming more feasible 
outsource those computational tasks the cloud potentially removing the need for consumers purchase expensive 
console play games cloud gaming could theoretically deliver aaa games any device that can play youtube video 
since all gaming taxing computational tasks would take place remote server which would then send video feed the 
game back the user device the technology does face some unique challenges which have held back widespread adoption 
and commercialization far that said believe that cloud gaming coming and that has important implications for the video 
game industry

relatively new technology for delivering games 
consumers traditionally gamers have had purchase

top quality video games this was driven the fact 
believe the growth subscription pricing models likely only 
the first phase with streaming delivery games cloud gaming 
likely coming over the next years see this broadly similar 
how netflix started dvd subscription service and later 
became streaming video platform once the technology became 
feasible the key difference between traditional and cloud gaming 
whether the game stored computed and rendered locally the 
consumer home remotely the cloud cloud gaming could 
reduce the complexity playing games would not only remove 
the requirement buy expensive console run games but 
could also allow consumers access video games practically any 
internet connected device with screen any device that can 
stream video could theoretically used for cloud gaming with the 
addition inexpensive after market game controller

that these titles require powerful dedicated hardware 
quickly compute and render the game world real time 
however the global internet and cloud computing 
infrastructures have improved becoming more 
feasible outsource those computational tasks the 
cloud potentially removing the need for consumers 
purchase expensive console play games 
cloud gaming could theoretically deliver aaa games 
any device that can play youtube video since all 
gaming taxing computational tasks would take place 
remote server which would then send video feed 
the game back the user device the technology does 
face some unique challenges which have held back 
widespread adoption and commercialization far that 
said believe that cloud gaming coming and that 
has important implications for the video game industry 
cloud gaming could reduce the complexity and cost playing video 
games 
looking the gaming ecosystem today there are commercially 
available subscription offerings such xbox game pass that still 
require consumers own console since the games are run locally 
additionally there are services like nvidia geforce now that allow 
gamers pay for access virtual gaming via streaming and
