faster than the market might imagine

larger than the aggregate all traditional retail businesses 
there any way for traditional car makers well positioned

for china auto yes seen with traditional retailers 
there are still opportunities for traditional auto makers diversify 
the allocation market capital has reshuffled accordingly with only

upstream overcapacity double edged

weakening position for upstream parts makers 
while investors are keyed the opportunities offered 
part the revolution are increasingly cautious 
the oversupplied upstream capacity that will impose 
mounting price and margin pressure the supply chain 
our calculations suggest battery materials supply 
cathodes anodes and separators will that 
power battery demand china therefore 
believe only select component names will negotiate the 
supply risk better cobalt suppliers china molybdenum thanks resource scarcity and top notch battery 
makers guoxuan high tech possessing competitive 
cost structures amid advanced technology upgrades 
lithium rising demand for lithium ion batteries for evs has 
boosted battery prices but there has also been rise new lowcost supply morgan stanley materials team believes electric 
vehicle penetration will insufficient offset new low cost 
lithium supply from chile which will drive down the cost curve and 
challenge higher cost operators china that are also expanding 
could the last year with global lithium market deficit followed significant surpluses emerging from onwards 
cathodes investment ncm has seen material battery capacity 
expansion and incentivized changes according morgan 
stanley chemicals team additional cathode materials including 
nickel manganese cobalt ncm are under development and will 
come online much this capacity will come online 
the bright side pricing pressure components together with 
china battery technology shifts more energy dense materials 
improving battery energy density should lead lower cost curve 
these capacity additions combined with the evolution technology 
and likely advance penetration now look for penetra 
for cathodes toward higher energy density materials less cathode 
tion previously 
but more kwh could have significant impact industry utilization 
and turn drive price deflation refer batteries cathode evo 
batteries leading players will cope better with price cuts

separators overwhelmed china upcoming capacity morgan 
expect lithium iron phosphate lfp battery prices decrease 
stanley predicts that china made over global separator 
while lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide ncm 
capacity dry separator prices fell significantly last year due 
battery prices should relatively resilient due tight supply and 
weak ebus sales and wet separator penetration despite growing 
technology upgrades the chinese government targeting energy 
demand for wet separators for use higher energy density batteries 
density for battery cells and costs below

kwh for battery packs for cells

this year 
better offset cost pressures with technology upgrades guoxuan 
high tech our preferred pick refer our report batteries sub 
but overcapacity does lower the downstream cost curve 
sidy dims but earnings can recharge apr 
upstream overcapacity does help lower battery and costs and
