money hit transactions from just and 
fintech solutions increasingly address the unbanked population 
but the consequences and outlook for macro and markets are mixed 
digitalization should prove disinflationary near term evidenced more 
advanced markets the growth impact will uneven near term but longer term 
see tailwinds for gdp growth better productivity and competitiveness 
labor helping create higher value jobs estimate every increase 
employment growth from digitalization adds gdp growth for markets 
the outlook bittersweet 
bitter because near term are likely see disruption the high roe 
old economy equity market adding earnings risk from fragile 
consumer and sluggish loan growth stay underweight msci indonesia 
sweet because longer term should along with infrastructure and 
bigger market scale driver for increased relevance for foreign 
investors and that good for valuations and confidence earnings 
growth expectations also cannot rule out change index 
composition over time should new economy companies list the local

building blocks are moving into place investment infrastructure including 
roads and phones improving connectivity while even last mile delivery 
challenges are being overcome with digital for example jek riders are 
delivering parcels capital being deployed the startup ecosystem with four 
domestic unicorns already established and investments over the last 
months payment has lagged due prudent regulatory approach but 
cash based solutions are filling the gap for now all expect 
commerce sales comprise retail activity

digital set boom indonesia 
expect commerce sales hit 
the total with money rising 
transactions there are more developed digitalization 
stories the region but with its scale and current 
momentum think indonesia stands one the 
biggest beneficiaries number enabling factors are 
already place 
demographics are and have been supportive 
infrastructure push means transport and 
communication links are being added 
logistics issues are being worked through such using 
ride sharing bikes for last mile delivery 
payment solutions are coming market albeit with 
some regulatory friction 
capital flowing into the ecosystems there are four 
homegrown nicorns already bukalapak jek 
traveloka and tokopedia 
but the macro market and micro outlooks are 
mixed 
macro less inflation near term more growth longer term 
separating out the digitalization contribution our 
economy not possible nonetheless 
recognize digitalization one the important enablers 
for indonesia gdp per capita more than double 
other words expect indonesia move from its 
current lower middle income economy status well within 
the upper middle income economy status that 
said digitalization will pose tailwinds and headwinds for 
growth and inflation over the next years near term 
think the digitalization impact growth likely 
uneven given the creation sharing economy jobs but also 
lowered barriers competition and increased efficiency 
longer term improved competitiveness and productivity 
should help create higher value jobs for inflation examples 
from developed markets suggest benefit near term but 
this less obvious longer term the risk monopolies 
forming arises what tends winner take all 
industry 
markets bittersweet near term the benefits equities 
from digitalization are less obvious brings disruption 
high roe old economy skewed equity market middle man 
margins will squeezed and oligopolistic barriers eroded 
these businesses must adapt risk fading into history 
the same time are still navigating fragile low end 
consumer long lead time the infrastructure dividend 
asset quality drags banks and geopolitical 
overhangs stay underweight msci indonesia with our 
index target implying limited upside but longer term 
digitalization should pull forward the transition upper 
middle income status bringing more confidence growth 
which equity markets favor this should complemented 
growing scale and compounding earnings raising the 
relevance indonesia foreign investors 
size gets attention the compounding effect midteens earnings growth means the jakarta composite 
index jci market cap should rise even multiples 
retrace estimate market cap 
from think this could lift 
average daily traded value par with 
india today and from currently 
the emergence new economy listed entities new 
listings are more complex forecast and blurred 
the case startups such lazada tokopedia and 
traveloka the presence already listed overseas 
strategic shareholders but cannot rule out some 
the startups looking public indonesia for 
example the ride hailing and services app jek has 
said will look list its shares locally some point 
micro navigating the disruptive headwinds think 
consequence digitalization for equity investors will likely 
wider gap between returns for winners and losers 
stock picker market exhibit highlights our analysts views 
the readiness for digitalization well the near and 
long term risks impact for their stocks 
consumer disruption from online retailers already 
happening expect online climb from just 
retail sales and 
initially the bigger impact will felt mid income 
consumer products but expect online 
increasingly target low income products scale 
benefits including logistics materialize for now see 
limited risk for staples including fmcg 
banks regulatory progress date has favored 
prudence but think the end game clear the 
adoption money coming expect money 
account for transactions disruption 
for banks will also likely materialize both deposits 
and lending fintech companies target the 
unbanked population well produce solutions that 
lower usage friction and costs 
real estate brick and mortar assets are typically net 
losers rising online retail environment that said 
not all malls are created equal think wellpositioned malls will include those that migrate their 
mix towards more experience oriented offerings such 
entertainment and food beverage and those 
providing online offline solutions are 
already seeing some disruption the retail space with 
jakarta occupancy year lows although 
this has been exacerbated supply expect growth 
mall rents limited below historical levels 
per year warehouses particularly modern ones 
high ceilings stronger floors wider access will benefit 
both from demand for logistics and data centers 
telecommunications falling equipment prices and 
rising disposable incomes mean smartphone 
penetration track hit and fixed broadband 
household penetration from their 
current and respectively take particularly 
outside java should complemented government 
initiatives improve connectivity across the 
archipelago through the palapa ring project

key risks 
what the government doing 
regulations that restrict market access digitalization has 
already gotten off the ground without much use emoney which currently accounts for just transactions 
the economy regulators are working towards more 
inclusive markets help new entrants address indonesia 
digital challenges well accelerate adoption move 
favor incumbents could slow innovation and progress 
towards our digital estimates 
digital economy vision becoming southeast asia largest digital 
economy the indonesian government aims the largest digital 
intervention lending rates indonesia peer peer 
lending platforms have been pricing loans premium 
bank loans reflect the greater inherent risks that 
borrowers present typical lending rates are wide 
range compared banks similar products 
regulators have been asking banks lower lending 
rates make loans more affordable for businesses the 
past few years regulators were ask lenders 
follow suit this would reduce the effectiveness 
lending platforms the model essence price risks 
appropriately any pricing interventions caps could deter 
informal lenders from converting platforms where 
they would likely prefer remain outside the formal 
banking system 
lack supporting infrastructure and funding commerce 
growth relies continued investments key players 
enhance service quality delivery times return policies 
payment options and product availability commerce 
growth could decline the supporting ecosystem fails 
keep pace with growing demand unfavourable regulatory 
changes such higher taxes restrictions foreign 
investment would also risk though note that the 
government has thus far been supportive its commercerelated policies lastly note that data availability ecommerce poor indonesia and hence estimates from 
various market participants the current market vary from 
however while the absolute number may 
change data improves think it safe conclude that 
growth prospects remain strong for the industry 
economy southeast asia expects digital start ups 
valued emerge over the next few years and sees digital 
transactions the government plans encourage 
creation innovation and invention among the younger generations 
moreover aims provide well defined and accommodative 
regulations the commerce sector through initiatives such 
foreign ownership presidential decree may relaxed 
foreign ownership restrictions allows for foreign ownership 
commerce businesses with minimum investment 
businesses investing less than that are 
subject limit foreign ownership

near term disinflationary longer term less certain 
digitalization likely disinflationary the near term our 
view exhibit some this good disinflation but some 
bad good disinflation would help further perpetuate 
the structural decline capital costs lower lows and lower 
highs have seen indonesia since early see 
disinflationary drivers from the following 
digitalization drives further globalization the rising 
prevalence the internet supports international trade 
goods and services increased globalization helps 
spread the amazon effect and drive disinflation 
increased price transparency competition digital 
platforms improve the price transparency products 
enabling consumers better compare prices this 
turn likely leads increased competition and lower 
margins for retailers driving lower prices and inflation 
the amazon effect additionally digital 
technology can lower the cost entry for new players 
and increase competitive pressures for incumbents 
productivity gains the development digital 
technology improves productivity and efficiency for 
producers which helps lower production costs 
leading lower inflation 
better logistics commerce provides scope for cost 
savings such rental compared the traditional 
brick and mortar distribution channels which can 
turn passed onto consumers 
disinflation from potentially slower aggregate 
demand digitalization may have short term 
disinflationary effects which are less desirable 
digitalization spurs productivity through substitution 
labor through the adoption automation there 
could disinflationary impact from lower aggregate 
demand workers are displaced 
but the impact inflation likely less obvious looking 
further out into the long term the advent the digital 
economy has enabled the rise superstar companies 
these companies have obtained significant funding and may 
engage price wars gain market share rapidly while this 
disinflationary the short term could ultimately lead
