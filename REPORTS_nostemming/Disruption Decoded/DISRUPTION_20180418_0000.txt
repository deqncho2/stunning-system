disruption decoded 
singapore telcos can the 
incumbents challenge the 
disruptor tpg 
rising competition the singapore mobile market has led 
decline profitability and expect this accelerate 
tpg disrupts the market from but think the use 
mvnos defensive strategy will help limit its impact 
starhub most risk without mvno partner 
are experiencing one the largest shake ups the singapore mobile 
market over the past decade there always change the mobile competitive 
landscape but operators who adapt faster and respond with well thought out 
strategies could minimize the negative impact rising competition the greatest 
risk over the next five years market share losses fourth entrant tpg 
telecom singapore has been stable mobile market generating high levels 
profitability for many years however challenger entering the market 
will disrupt the market through higher competition but can the incumbent 
mobile operators challenge this disruptive threat 
this report explore how singapore mobile operators are attempting 
create defensive moat around their existing businesses introducing mvnos 
into the market and accelerating the number value added services offered 
subscribers explore potential earnings valuation implications these 
strategies highlight three key findings 
singapore mobile market conducive for mvnos market size cost 
spectrum level regulation and competition among mobile network operators 
position singapore attractive mvno market 
mvnos are slightly dilutive earnings but are the lesser two evils the 
other being losing market share competitor mature market with limited 
subscriber growth operators will need deploy defensive strategies limit 
market share losses average operators generate ebitda per 
subscriber from postpaid subs but only from mvnos 
starhub most risk the lack mvno partner suggests that starhub 
most risk losing subscribers earnings pressure from declines mobile pay 
and residential broadband segments combined with stretched balance 
sheet puts dividends risk cut starhub dividend from 
singapore remains our least preferred asean telecom market lower 
starhub most risk market share losses given its lack 
mvno strategy declining pay business and stretched balance sheet

discussion can the incumbents challenge the disruptor tpg 
market view unsure the market has seen the rise mobile virtual network 
operators mvnos singapore and views this extra competition resulting 
lower prices eroding market profitability 
our view mvno strategy means incumbents can reduce the impact the 
disruptor tpg our analysis shows that mvnos can used defensive 
strategy and whilst this slightly dilutive earnings the lesser two evils 
the other being losing market share competitor singtel and both have 
employed this defensive strategy but starhub has not hence believe starhub 
most risk losing market share the mobile player tpg when enters 
the market 
base case mvnos act defensive moat for mobile network operators 
mnos limiting the market share losses fourth entrant tpg telecom 
assume subscriber market share loss for singtel for starhub 
and for 
bull case mvnos help evolve subscriber purchasing habits from handset 
subsidy model into one that unlinks mobile plan sim only with handset 
purchase hence subsidies are removed from the cost pool 
where could wrong higher than expected growth mvnos could increase 
pressure near term earnings mvnos tend compete price and value 
mvnos could also fail act defensive moat against fourth operator tpg 
telecom who may decide even more aggressive the singapore mobile 
market 
why are considering this now singapore mature mobile market with limited 
subscriber growth the past mobile network operators managed grow revenue and 
profitability maintaining highly priced mobile plans and bundling fixed mobile 
convergence products increase their subscriber wallet share however are now 
months away from the entry fourth mobile operator tpg telecom into the 
singapore mobile market tpg expected highly aggressive its pricing mobile 
plans similar what has been observed its australian broadband business and will 
likely add pressure highly profitable singapore mobile market 
response these structural shifts the mobile market and anticipated increase 
competition all three mobile operators singtel and starhub have adopted 
defensive strategies retain subscriber market share and reduce subscriber churn 
these strategies include the rise data promotions the introduction mvnos into the 
market and the accelerating number value added subscription based services offered 
subscribers means reduce subscriber churn 
the past months alone have witnessed the launch three mvnos circles life 
zero mobile and singapore whilst mvnos are slightly dilutive earnings 
from the onset should also viewed mechanism for mnos retain their most 
price sensitive subscribers through their mvno partners who tend offer lower priced 
mobile plans the key message here incumbent telcos are employing the right strategy 
challenge the disruptor tpg with their use mvnos unfortunately incumbent 
profitability will continue decline because mvnos are slightly lower 
profitability but this significantly better than outright market share losses 
competitor 
addition mvnos singapore have largely attempted win subscribers through 
price and value higher data allowances instead offering handset subsidies model 
used the incumbent operators mvnos are successful changing subscriber 
purchasing habits from handset subsidy sim only market could see mobile 
margins improve the incumbent handset subsidies get scaled back over time 
thought would interesting investigate what type mobile market 
environment conducive for mvnos what the potential earnings and valuation 
impact having mvnos the singapore mobile market and why think starhub 
most risk 
conclusion front mvnos are way for incumbents challenge the disruptor yes 
they are slightly dilutive earnings but are the lesser two evils the other being 
losing market share competitor the use mvnos and the accelerating number 
value added subscription services introduced network operators are defensive 
strategies aimed reducing subscriber churn into competitors network for the three 
incumbents every subscriber share loss mvno partner network due selfcannibalization has impact earnings however subscriber 
share loss competitor network has impact earnings 
addition every reduction annual postpaid churn has valuation impact 
for singtel for and for starhub 
this report explore three main topics 
the singapore mobile market conducive for mvnos explain what mobile 
virtual network operator mvno what are the attributes high penetration 
mvno market and why believe singapore conducive mobile market for 
mvnos 
investigate mvnos impact earnings and profitability here explore 
circles life case study and how has impacted profitability then 
evaluate scenarios assess the potential ebitda impact coming from 
mvnos the impact handset subsidies incumbent mnos ebitda and the 
sensitivity for every subscriber market share loss partner mvno network 
result self cannibalization share loss competitor average operators 
generate ebitda per subscriber from postpaid subs but only from 
mvnos 
starhub most risk the lack mvno partner suggests that starhub 
most risk losing subscribers earnings pressure from declines mobile pay 
and residential broadband segments combined with stretched balance sheet puts 
dividends risk exhibit cut starhub dividend from 
what are mobile virtual network operators 
mvnos are companies that provide mobile services consumers without owning the 
underlying mobile network rather they rent the network from mobile network 
operator mno singapore the mnos are well known brands like singtel and 
starhub mvnos singapore are smaller niche players that include circles life 
launched may network zero mobile launched singtel 
network and launched singtel network there are currently three 
mvnos the singapore mobile market though several more are expected 
launched including the likes myrepublic 
mvnos value proposition when intermediating traditional mno typically tied 
mvno ability acquire subscribers lower cost when look mobile 
operator cost base broadly break this down into four categories interconnect 
the cost connecting the call between mobile operators subscriber 
acquisition retention cost includes handset subsidies network opex includes 
electricity site maintenance base stations backhaul leases and personnel cost 
includes customer care personnel and staff exhibit

however mvnos that have launched singapore not operator physical stores and 
mainly market and distribute mobile plans online and through smartphone applications 
most mvnos singapore not actively utilize handset subsidies mechanism 
acquire subscribers instead mobile plan flexibility price and value are used attract 
subscribers renting network mvno mno able eliminate subscriber 
acquisition cost handset subsidies which brings down personnel cost much 
and interconnect charges the main cost for mno providing this 
service the network opex incurred which also happens the single largest cost 
for mvno exhibit 
what are the attributes high penetration mvno market 
the emergence the mvno phenomenon characterized the establishment the 
first mvno virgin mobile the united kingdom this spread quickly through 
europe the united states and eventually into asia pacific countries like australia and 
hong kong fact hong kong has one the highest number mvnos the asia 
pacific region with mobile subscribers tied mvno identify market 
characteristics that support mvno business model and shed light reasons why 
mvnos proliferate countries like germany 
after analysis the mvno markets believe there are four key drivers that make 
conducive for the development high penetration mvno markets have included 
south korea hong kong france germany and the united kingdom examples high 
penetration mvno markets with sweden switzerland norway and austria examples 
low penetration mvno markets 
the four key drivers are 
size the mobile network operator mno market gdp 
how high was the cost spectrum license fees spectrum costs 
level regulation the market 
level competition among mnos market measured the herfindahlhirchman index commonly used measure the market consolidation 
the key conclusion here that singapore conducive market for mvnos the size 
the singapore mobile market relative gdp high compared other developed 
markets singapore spectrum auction cost higher than global averages 
supporting mvnos cover spectrum costs there are strict regulations supporting 
prohibiting the establishment mvno the country lastly competition 
singapore rises the mobile competitive landscape will become increasingly conducive 
for mvno participation note not expect singapore mvno penetration rise 
similar levels germany because there regulation supporting mvnos 
exhibit mvno market share germany ranks among the most well penetrated mvno

level regulation the market 
the level regulation key for couple reasons first the mno incentive 
licence mvnos depends how differentiated are the services offered the mvnos 
the services are too similar then the mvno may compete directly against the 
mno turn mnos could price their networks too high and drive the mvno out 
business have found that markets like austria low mvno penetration market 
that there regulatory requirement for mnos open their networks mvnos 
thus allowing mno price discriminate based its own objectives the flip side 
markets like the united kingdom have mandatory sharing networks for operators 
with significant shares germany another example where regulations require operators 
have dedicated network access for mvnos which believe the reason why 
germany mvnos have risen market share the singapore regulator does not 
restrict enforce regulatory requirements for mnos share their network with 
mvnos however mnos singtel and have started offering their networks 
mvnos exhibit the past two years bid defend their market share the 
price sensitive segments the market segment that the operator tpg telecom 
poised compete 
exhibit singtel has partnered with mvno operators zero mobile and zero whilst has 
partnered with circles life starhub does not have mvno partner 
source company data morgan stanley research 
level competition among mnos market 
the level mno competition measured the number mnos per market and 
the herfindahl hirchman index hhi are key determinants the development 
mnvos hhi commonly used measure concentration market with the higher 
the number the lower the level competition have found the greater the number 
mnos per market the higher the potential for mvnos this makes sense because 
mnos can capture the full market value without mvnos when competition less and 
arguably more rational for example our data set the median number mnos 
high penetration markets lower penetration markets exhibit 
singapore has three mnos and only started seeing the launch mvnos 
singapore has hhi score level similar low mvno penetration markets 
but new fourth entrant that will result more competition should lower this score 
and lead the addition more mvnos the market

estimate singapore mvnos account for subscriber market share the 
majority which comes from circles life network think mvnos generate 
per subscriber per month ebitda for their respective mobile network 
operators these returns are lower than those the incumbent existing 
ebitda per postpaid subscriber incl handset subsidies however beyond profitability 
mvnos act direct competitors the fourth entrant tpg telecom price sensitive 
segments that are attracted the lower priced sim only plans mvnos are defensive 
strategy and should viewed tool for incumbents compete the lower price 
segment while retaining and sometimes even winning market share from competitors 
depending the mvno success 
singapore mobile subscriber growth forecast remain flat over the next five years

that over the next five years singapore mobile subscribers will remain relatively flat

than losing subscriber share fourth operator tpg telecom and foregoing the

case study circles life 
circles life entered the singapore mobile market may digital telco 
targeting digitally savvy customers circles life entire registration and distribution 
process conducted via its website and mobile application the mvno partnered with 
leverage the incumbent mobile network offer mobile services customers 
circles life operator that commitment free with contract and significantly 
larger data allowances according circles life management the mvno aiming for 
market share over the next few years 
the key message here that successful mvno can win market share and increase 
competition 
but cannibalization its network partner may more immediate effect 
traditionally network operators have used mvnos target niche segment 
untapped market migrant workers significantly lower price points mvnos have 
historically been able achieve success because lower cost base physical 
stores online marketing handset subsidies network operators subsequently look 
upsell mvno subscribers into higher tiered mobile plans however this assumes that 
the market still has meaningful untapped portion which not the case for singapore 
singapore viewed the mobile operator for the price sensitive subscriber and 
believe circles life partnership with has led some self cannibalization 
circles life leverages the mobile network network coverage both circles life 
and very similar with circles life plans priced similarly however 
circles life now offering higher value subscribers more data allowances which 
has led some churn subscribers into circles life 
circles life success double edged sword for network partner 
the good has shown postpaid subscriber growth likely driven mvno partner 
circles life exhibit this has helped gain subscriber market share from 
exhibit however estimate circles life has gained 
market share implying that the mvno subscribers have churned out into 
circles life and the other coming from singtel and starhub 
the bad ebitda margin the wholesale agreement with circles life likely 
higher estimate mobile ebitda margin but the wholesale 
prices these contracts are likely per subscriber postpaid arpu 
this means that absolute ebitda generated from mvno contract would 
lower than that organically generated subscriber 
see this emerging self cannibalization risk customers churn down the

mvnos create defensive moat that limits market share losses 
the introduction mvnos singapore has led higher competition and immediate 
near term impact incumbent ebitda demonstrated the circles life case 
study above however mvnos help compete the price sensitive segments the 
market where the operator tpg telecom will active our base case mvnos 
should viewed defensive strategy for incumbents protect their market shares 
bull case consider three scenarios where mvnos have the potential 
longer term positive for the industry 
traditional postpaid plans include substantial amount handset subsidies 
mvnos successfully change subscriber purchasing habits shift sim only type 
postpaid market could significantly improve ebitda margins 
retaining subscriber market share with lower ebitda contributions better than 
losing subscriber market share mobile market that not growing its subscriber 
base 
competition has led more bundling products reduce churn incumbent 
operators have innovated more the past months with mobile data 
promotions subsidies bundling value added services the introduction 
mvnos and explored new revenue opportunities enterprise and iot compared 
the prior five years 
scenario mobile ebitda incl handset subsidies and wholesale ebitda 
are similar 
mvnos have slightly negative impact mno ebitda though the net effect 
would better than losing subscribers operator tpg telecom find the 
impact ebitda work down from blended postpaid arpu ebitda net 
handset subsidies this approach shows that mvnos are ebitda dilutive selfcannibalization takes place but any incremental market share wins from competitor 
mnos and reduction market share losses the operator could positive 
the key message here that market share losses have far greater impact earnings 
and valuation than self cannibalization 
the first approach think mobile network operators singapore generated 
between monthly arpu net handset subsidies these estimates 
assume that industry postpaid revenues are able capture ebitda margin 
incl handset subsidies exhibit

next took look the revenue and cost structure mvno conversations with

including top services like additional data and voice the average mvno

the ebitda margin amaysim listed mvno australia since most mvno mobile 
plans singapore are digitally sold and distributed attribute the cost

network wholesale price paid the mvno the mno the wholesale price 
estimated per subscriber per month revenue mnos and generates 
ebitda margin this generates ebitda for mnos lower than

note that the wholesale costs could actually higher than per month which 
would obviously mean more ebitda for the incumbent telcos however this would also

successful mvno market singapore defensive strategy for incumbent 
operators mvno help create defensive moat against the fourth operator tpg 
telecom shown the exhibits earlier the discussion ebitda per subscriber lower cannibalized mvno the same network but has significant 
impact earnings market share lost competitors singapore currently has three 
mvnos namely circles life network zero mobile singtel network and zero 
singtel network with myrepublic likely become the fourth mvno 
not think that singapore will stop four mvnos fact believe that incumbent 
operators are incentivized support many mvnos possible order crowd 
out competitors like tpg telecom and prevent market share losses existing 
operators and their partner mvnos currently the biggest loser likely starhub 
announced mvno partner 
this section highlight that starhub and are most risk realizing significant 
downside eps for every market share loss tpg and competitors 
outside its network this respect has made the first move partnering with 
mvno leader circles life while starhub has yet announce mvno partner 
while singtel will affected market share losses the impact will less 
pronounced due its broad range telecommunication assets across the region with 
singapore consumers accounting for group ebitda note that myrepublic 
could theory become mvno partner for starhub hence will watching this

scenario mvnos are one several innovative mechanisms telcos use 
reduce churn the other mechanism being the bundling value added 
services 
the past two years have seen the incumbent operators attempt win 
subscribers and reduce churn introducing wave innovative products increase 
the stickiness subscribers since march incumbents have introduced data addon packages unlimited data plans partnered with mvnos and begun bundling telecom 
products with other subscription based value added services through partnerships 
the concept bundling products reduce churn not new telecom operators 
globally have commonly used triple play bundling broadband and mobile 
increase subscriber wallet share expand their addressable markets and reduce churn 
however competition the singapore market has led accelerating number 
value added services offered the incumbents over the past two years exhibit 
show that singtel has launched partnership with netflix and launched wallet 
dash starhub has launched video streaming service and partnering local 
electricity retailer bundle electricity and has mixture netflix music content

value added services and the bundling product generates value for mobile 
operator reducing churn discussed earlier the concept bundling products 
not new the telecom industry with mobile operators all around the world adopting 
fixed mobile convergence strategies likewise singapore mobile operators have long 
been doing this via broadband pay and mobile offerings bundling has resulted 
average postpaid churn rate exhibit lower than most other 
developed market operators 
the bundling additional value added services like netflix magazines wallets and 
other subscription based products into mobile plans can used churn reduction 
tool these endeavors have been proven increase customer retention improve 
margins reducing retention costs and reduce churn report analysys 
mason leading third party telecom research and consultancy firm survey indicates 
that subscribers intention churn europe and the usa decreased from for 
customers standalone fixed offers for double play for triple play and 
for quadruple play customers this evidence why mobile operators singapore 
are trying and will continue pursue bundling strategy reduce mobile subscriber 
churn 
this strategy reducing churn will increase the barriers for tpg win over 
subscribers from the incumbents when launches believe tpg telecom 
will likely able offer mobile and fixed broadband bundles their subscribers 
however each additional value added service added onto incumbent subscriber 
package will create more inertia for existing subscribers churn out the network 
this turn reduces the competitive pressure from new entrant especially retaining 
high value subscribers the incumbent network

starhub and are similar positions with rising leverage and plan combo 
tpg launch the end the year that bundling strategy from starhub and 
strong mvno for however our view because this rising leverage think 
starhub will cut its dividend from starhub fcf coverage its 
dividend over estimate this means starhub net 
debt ebitda will rise from note starhub comfort 
level addition starhub falling dividend implies that the stock can trade

this fair considering that starhub traded dividend yield during
