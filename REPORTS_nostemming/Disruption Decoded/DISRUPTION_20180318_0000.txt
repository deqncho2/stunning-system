would expected the administration could signal its ambivalence about complying with the results their review temporary 
tit for tat could also ensue did with china auto tariffs response the obama tire actions that tension could certainly 
abate over time through combination face saving solutions cosmetic changes and wto adjudications was the case with 
both bush and obama administration actions effectively returning the status quo nevertheless the process could 
justifiably spark market concern about rising probability tit for tat trade conflict with key partners and hard exit from 
nafta 
the administration acts tariff opportunity and follows this with demonstrative signals broader protectionist push this 
could the form subsequent tariff actions and more definitive statements actions nafta negotiations such the

approach markets could reflect meaningfully higher probability this approach and all its economic implications

the policy actions compared the currently announced

congress may also counter the president recent 
protectionist measures against japan the the 
measures amending repealing current trade laws 
stepped voice their concerns with the 
discussing targeted tariffs imports response 
reagan administration began implement series 
including legislation that grants the executive branch the 
protectionist policies against japan starting from 
power raise tariffs however this would probably 
primarily targeting its auto exports and later 
require majority vote count prevent the president 
semiconductors these include voluntary export restraints

and tariffs

protectionist measures against japan the the
