zhong share price has fallen more than since its ipo perceptions that too 
reliant key shareholders but believe the company has diversified its distribution 
partners and focused long tail marketing important new initiative tech services 
also taking shape 
mix shift well executed longer reliant shareholder business the market viewpoint zhong still being influenced the perception that still very reliant business related shareholder alibaba while the company did indeed start out offering 
shipping return insurance within alibaba taobao ecosystem has quickly evolved into 
independent online insurer focused selling health auto and credit insurance through long 
list smaller online partners its shareholder related business accounted for less than 
premiums months ago demonstrating strong execution since its 
september ipo 
more tech company than insurer while zhong one the few licensed online 
insurers china its focus and ambitions are substantially different from traditional 
insurers firstly has built its cloud based core insurance system capable high frequency 
real time transactions and reporting internally traditional insurers typically contract 
external software companies build and maintain core systems which are often outdated 
and incapable handling large volumes online queries and transactions secondly with 
more than half its staff roles the company focuses providing end end online 
insurance sales and settlement lower cost thirdly zhong an value also lies its large 
accurate and rich database customers over which could lead more personalised competitive pricing even the mainstream insurance market and finally its insurance 
operation provides real business environment which can design pragmatic tech solutions that can then exported other insurers and partners marginal cost these 
tech services have now been given high strategic priority and are positioned key future 
revenue source 
addressable markets for insurance and tech support valuation while zhong 
not yet profitable estimate the business can generate premiums more than 
which equates share china market the company also tapping into tech services the asia pacific region which has annual tech spending budget 
share this market would bring service fees over annually

although still scenario based has changed from relying few 
dominant ecosystems partnership model with many small and

zhong better control its distribution costs but also helps avoid
