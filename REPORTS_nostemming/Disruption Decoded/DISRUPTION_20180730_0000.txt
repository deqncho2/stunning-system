australia consumer primed for 
amazon what next 
amazon impact australian retail date has been minimal 
but expect accelerate quickly post the prime launch 
and likely sku expansion analyse population density 
delivery costs courier competition and prime adoption across 
countries update our thoughts the amazon impact 
australian delivery costs aren onerous for amazon per parcel basis 
estimate amazon delivery costs are only slightly higher australia the 
but lower than canada the relatively high population concentration within the 
top cities helps australia compared the and 
canada strong australian courier competition drives down delivery costs our 
view which partially offsets low major city population density australia 
per sqkm canada and high minimum wage costs australia 
canada think prime will compelling for 
australians delivery costs aren prohibitively high 
australia has attractive population demographics for amazon too analysis 
compiled our internet team led brian nowak amazon prime 
penetration income bracket shows amazon success the pper middle 
income bracket since australia has flatter income distribution the 
think supports prime penetration 
amazon party pricing very competitive major retailers update our 
pricing analysis which shows that party resellers remain uncompetitive but 
amazon party pricing either the same price cheaper leading retailers 
estimate that amazon currently selling sku books cds vinyl 
and clothes and shoes party and expect this could expand post 
the impending sydney distribution centre launch 
but amazon has advantages the that won enjoy australia pay 
tax equal bricks and mortar stores from day retailer consolidated gives 
leading retailers australia more pricing power and iii suppliers may 
reluctant comply with amazon demands given their experience the 
amazon impact most underappreciated wesfarmers our view australia 
largest non food retailer generates operating profit across 
bunnings kmart target and officeworks think the market underappreciates 
how impacted will given high existing operating margins

key conclusions 
near term amazon impact likely minimal despite much anticipation think 
amazon impact australian retail largely confined forcing retailers increase 
spend their internet platforms and delivery terms rather than via loss revenue 
the near term online retail sales growth has accelerated recently part driven 
amazon but also acceleration online sales the leading store based retailers 
which think reflects their recent investments trim our amazon australia sales 
forecasts reflect more muted impact near term 
but the long term amazon impact could significant our view think australia 
well suited for amazon given relatively low delivery costs relative other 
developed countries the high concentration the population iii the relatively flat 
income distribution relatively high incomes and amazon prime offer that 
priced succeed continue believe that amazon will successful australia 
longer term which will minimum depress retailers multiples relative their 
history 
when the amazon impact likely felt think some retailers have already 
been impacted amazon arrival during delivered lfl sales growth 
sales growth yet operating profit growth woolworths supermarkets 
delivered lfl sales growth sales growth but only operating profit 
growth think both are examples retailers that are proactively investing digital 
initiatives amazon arrives retailers that think are particularly exposed amazon 
across our coverage are kmart target wes relatively weak online platforms with 
exposed department store category big wow exposed category bunnings wes 
online store despite attractive category rebel sport sul exposed category and 
harvey norman hvn relatively weak online platform exposed category believe 
exposed retailers earnings will progressively disappoint they increase spend

competition amongst australian couriers high amazon 
should benefit from this 
think competition amongst australian couriers high and this has driven down 
delivery costs levels broadly line with the think local couriers will 
compete hard win amazon business region region basis our comparison 
shows australia has much higher labour costs peers and the lowest population 
density largest cities while fuel costs look mid range and think amazon 
delivery capabilities the are likely more efficient than current australian operators 
despite this when compare australian delivery charges find they are line with 
those the think this indication that the australian market quite 
competitive dynamic expect benefit amazon 
why amazon may receive better delivery rates australia despite its relatively small 
size 
australia has relatively fragmented national delivery network while australia post 
the clear leader parcels new players leveraging technology are winning share 
note that all major competitors with the exception allied express are owned 
controlled large offshore organisations which means they are not required 
disclose operating metrics profitability for australian operations this means that 
they can invest loss lead build business platform for the long term doing 
think that these operators may induced offer amazon very competitive rates 
knowing the success that has had other markets believe that singapore post 
deutsche post and japan post would already have commercial relationship with 
amazon today 
should one national courier network offer amazon attractive rates the others may feel 
compelled partner with longer term thus driving down delivery rates further 
additionally think that local more specialised courier networks may look increase 
their base load volume also pushing down prices delivery costs all rely drops per 
hour the more drops there are the lower the cost pricing can reduce quickly 
improve the drop rate

why think jbh and sul are less exposed 
they will keep taking share from smaller less organised retailers though sul and 
jbh operate with significant share they still have considerable opportunity take 
share from independent retailers that are often supported buying groups 
independent buying groups don buy with the same scale large chained retailers 
their buying terms are usually inferior 
they will keep taking share from the department stores sul and jbh offer 
specialised product with far more range than the department stores the department 
stores continue focus more apparel and move away from specialised categories 
like auto electronics and sports equipment think share will continue shift the 
specialists 
category specialists are more likely receive exclusive products not sold 
amazon commoditised products tend sell better online while suppliers are likely 
offer this amazon believe that when suppliers are looking distribute market 
leading innovative products they are likely partner with specialist given the 
service and positioning that category specialist can provide they are more likely 
receive high end products that provide differentiated offering 
some products don ship easily not all non food products ship easily for instance 
flat panel tvs oils auto parts further think products that have high monetary 
value require advice before buying are more likely purchased store 
opposed online

appendix sales tax analysis 
sales tax background 
sales tax the extremely complex with the tax foundation estimating there 
sales jurisdictions with varying rates sales tax payable across the 
the differences between state sales taxes cause consumers avoid high tax areas and 
make purchases low tax areas with the tax foundation citing the chicago area 
example where consumers make purchases neighbouring states due chicago 
relatively high sales tax rates see exhibit 
the states cannot legally force sales tax collection vendors who not have 
physical presence the state 
the ruling quill corp north dakota has meant that the states cannot 
legally force sales tax collection vendors who not have physical presence the 
state which the sale made this means that retailers like amazon could avoid 
collecting sales taxes from consumers purchases made states where they did not 
have physical presence such warehouse the time 
states have taken matters into their own hands 
despite this according the tax foundation states with sales tax have 
already expanded their state tax collection authority sellers with physical 
presence the state fiscal fact march the tax foundation south 
dakota one such state passing such law 
the legality which currently being tested 
the supreme court late june ruled the case south dakota wayfair inc 
that states can compel retailers collect sales taxes despite not having physical assets 
the state effectively overturning the quill ruling additionally according the tax 
foundation congress may act before the court does the proposed remote 
transactions parity act rtpa sponsored rep kristi noem would authorize 
states collect sales taxes internet purchases made their residents fiscal fact

amazon now collects taxes estimated its business 
brian nowak take amazon and state sales taxes 
with physical presence nearly all states and territories believe amzn 
collecting sales tax transactions the business but not transactions 
note too that other online marketplaces ebay etsy etc without direct inventory are 
also leaving sellers charge state taxes with some state level expectations 
such washington state and pennsylvania state which have mandated 
marketplaces collect taxes 
the prospect more uniform state sales tax enforcement and collection system 
very much investors minds given the two bills the table washington 
well the supreme court case wayfair south dakota that began april 
however the direct sales tax impact commerce volumes not certain and 
potentially somewhat mitigated for four reasons discussed herein retailers 
essentially would the same tax playing field platform loyalty and product 
elasticity would key this isn new for amzn and anything this bigger risk 
ebay and third party sellers 
what the biggest risk amzn need reduce prices offset income tax impacts 
ends being larger than expected which leads lower overall gross profit and 
profitability
