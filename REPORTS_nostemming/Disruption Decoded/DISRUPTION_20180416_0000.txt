opportunity for fintech payment and lending and bank 
reaction will key potential roe risk ranges from 
growing vigorously the number fintech startups indonesia

evolving for more upside fintechs can help promote financial 
business models the deposit and fee side through their payment 
inclusion only indonesians have bank accounts and the loan

society only current transactions are cashless efficiency 
aging their ecosystems areas like transportation and commerce 
and competition major indonesian fintechs appear trying 
grow their payment platforms their control over the floats 
replicate the models alibaba and tencent modified for local fac 
these payment accounts essentially cuts the banks direct access 
tors this means that more product and market share upside may 
end customers which will eventually raise the banks cost funds 
the way their business models evolve 
and compress their fee income banks lower costs assets through 
will the banks compete evolve collaborate banks can impede 
wider use technology could alleviate some the downside how 
fintechs entry into the market optimizing the national payment 
ever our bear base bull case simulations suggest that fintech dis 
gateway developing similar products aggressively securing more 
ruption could impact banks roe 
merchants alternatively they can collaborate with fintechs get 
this corresponds our fintech float size estimates 
the most upside for both with banks focusing the back end given 
their stability and reliance and fintechs focusing the front end 
and lending fintechs can also cause banks lose lending oppor 
given their flexibility and innovation now bca and bni appear

penetration according statista there are more than credit 
cards circulation the population around meanwhile china cashless society appeared just few years back due

alternative lending including side opportunity loss for 
banks loan growth although alternative lending less likely 
seize banks current debtors alternative lending expansion 
essentially opportunity loss for the banks for the parts 
the micro and sme segment they could have expanded 
payment side additional costs and reduced fees for banks 
into with banks risk aversion and lack proper credit anal 
fintech growing reach among customers through payment 
ysis tools for this segment alternative lending likely 
systems means the banks lose some control over those cus 
expand swiftly and gain scale this opportunity loss would 
tomers money floats when these floats are controlled 
wipe away potential roe improvements that the banks could 
fintechs zero deposit cost fintechs can leverage this bar 
have had seizing the market 
gain for interest income from banks this would mean additional cost funds for banks diluting nims and roes 
compared cases where the banks have direct access 
those customers concurrently banks would lose the ability 
charge deposit administration fees their depositors 
which they have been doing they follow the practice 
adopted fintechs and global banks 
the other hand banks could lower their cost asset ratios 
via the wider use technology yet expect this very 
gradual considering indonesian banks low inclination

fintech banks three likely outcomes 
expect the overlaps between fintech and banks businesses will continue increase each side has its own 
strengths and challenges and their dynamics will shape 
indonesia financial industry the future 
banks 
strengths 
huge scale and strong balance sheets this enables banks 
fintech 
provide cheaper lending rates attracting bigger and better 
quality customers 
strengths 
established system especially with recently enhanced con 
nectivity among banks via the national payment gateway 
promoting financial inclusion alternative channels lending 
npg banks can work together and lower charges cus 
the unbankable population while payment fintech helps 
tomers this can raise the barriers entry for fintechs 
people open deposit accounts for the first time banks have 
huge potential further optimize data banks with their 
not been very interested this space due the low imme 
large customer bases and long term operations possess big 
diate margins 
data that they can optimize further they also have more 
accelerating conversion cashless society fintech innova 
tion and convenience could drive the initiative faster than 
banks 
ammunition secure merchants than fintechs 
reliable and highly regulated this provides greater sense 
security customers 
ample investment phase with higher tolerance losses 
unlike banks fintechs are not under pressure show imme 
challenges 
diate profits their investors are willing support longerterm goals 
less flexible core system most big banks are unable over 
bigger business scope fintechs can into financial and non 
haul their core banking system without significant invest 
financial businesses and synergize them whereas banks are 
ment however their systems are less date than 
limited financial businesses regulation 
fintech agile architecture deploy digital banking products banks are likely apply patches their core system 
challenges 
which can reduce response time 
limited ability sacrifice profitability big banks are listed 
stability and scale the trade off for flexibility usually sta 
bility fintechs also have much smaller scale than banks 
investment like most fintechs can 
real banking license the regulators cannot grant full banking 
slower response financial inclusion and cashless society 
licenses fintechs given their inadequate capital and lack 
regulators could skew towards the fintech side can show 
standardized systems and experienced banking executives 
meaningful progress these areas considering the less sig 
this limits fintechs developing end end business 
nificant progress banks have made 
models the financial space particularly their inability 
gather deposits from public only banks and cooperatives are 
legally allowed gather public deposits 
managing credit risks might not easy alternative 
lending fintechs think banks have experienced various credit 
cycles that strengthened their risk management alternative 
lending fintechs might not have these levels prudence 
expertise while big data processing for risk management 
appears promising has not been tested against real credit 
cycles 
companies and cannot afford heavy periods subsidized 
three possible scenarios 
foundation 
fintech drives the financial industry 
fintech successfully adopts overseas models strategic 
envisage three main scenarios fintechs and banks boost their 
investors like alibaba and tencent can play big roles that 
strengths and mitigate their challenges 
part however the biggest challenge customize those 
models for indonesia unique environment for instance 
banks hinder fintech before they can grow meaningfully 
indonesian regulators the moment not provide licenses 
for fintechs direct lending alibaba does china 
indonesian banks have won against other financial players the past 
fintech gains regulators favor given their contributions 
like consumer finance and insurance companies this can consid 
society and eventually economic growth regulators can cus 
ered unique indonesia these businesses are not necessarily 
tomize regulations and provide more scope for fintech 
weaker than banks other countries 
grow 
digital infrastructure continues improve internet connec 
the banks have the chance replicate this past success against the 
tion quality and the availability low priced smartphones 
new contenders and continue dominate the financial industry 
favor fintech expansion 
some conditions that could lead this scenario 
faster adoption older generations younger generations 
could skew towards fintech due its flexibility and friendly 
banks collaborate with each other they can utilize the npg 
interfaces but fintech would also benefit older genera 
and other infrastructure expand coverage before fintech 
tions which typically have more wealth adopt the tech 
can grab the market banks can combine more infrastructure 
nology faster 
and coordinate avoid overlapping infrastructure investments lower costs would enable banks lower charges 
stalemate banks collaborate with fintech 
almost free for some customers 
develop same products accelerated pace banks gener 
regulators status quo and differentiate the scope between 
ally have more resources which theoretically enables them 
banks and fintech this would leave banks continuing dom 
create new products and deploy them with huge impact 
inate the back end and loan origination and give fintech scope 
however some banks may need align their internal struc 
grow the front end 
tures and business practices respond faster 
banks have limited flexibility change their systems and 
secure more merchants faster banks have the upper hand 
find better partner with fintech most banks already have 
over fintechs securing merchants they can bundle with 
deep rooted organizational cultures this can hinder man 
cash management sme lending ensure merchant loy 
agement efforts evolve business models and systems 
alty again this would require synergies within the banks 
themselves 
banks open fintechs and create stickiness with their ser 
vices banks can channel some loans through fintechs 
expand lending lower tiers banks have been avoiding 
diverting fintechs from the urge find their own funding 
debtors with less than straightforward risk profiles which 
the chance for fintechs forge their own path would 
unfortunately are the profiles most micro and sme mar 
smaller they are dependent the banks for funding 
kets they discover ways manage risks properly this 
would leave little room for fintechs enter

what matters for regulators 
directions from regulators can heavily influence how fintechs evolve bank indonesia and otoritas jasa keuangan 
have issued various regulations that are relevant fintechs and their products see appendix relevant fintech regulations for new initiatives the regulators apply 
regulatory sandbox approach for review and monitoring 
before the relevant regulations are issued 
non banks the programs were launched and respectively banks have been participating the initiatives but there 
ample room for fintechs champion them further 
cashless society

very low there are many benefits from cashless society 
from security accountability cashless can drive the efficiency and 
there are several key points that are essential from the regulators
