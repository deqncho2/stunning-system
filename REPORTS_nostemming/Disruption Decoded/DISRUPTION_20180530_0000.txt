modern format retail will rise the next three years

nestl india infant nutrition contrary market expectations our detailed analysis suggests that this trend more 
structural with reasonably high penetration relevant households instant noodles this category markedly smaller and 
competitors have successfully altered the market equilibrium terms market share following the food safety scare with 
brand maggi dairy homegrown players with reasonably strong brands continue offer better price value consumers
