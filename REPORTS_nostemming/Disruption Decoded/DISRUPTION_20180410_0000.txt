why kaufland entering australia 
how kaufland different aldi 
think that there are number reasons why kaufland has come 
see number differences between the aldi australian stores 
australia some that are factors that would attract any interna 
and kaufland likely format australia 
tional supermarket chain but also some specific factors for kaufland 
range far wider aldi stocks products even with modest 
australia relatively high growth income population thus gro 
increase skus post its refurbishment program which compares 
cery spend market 
the products that kaufland stocks 
existing margin structures are high global standards refer 
formats differ kaufland operates number different formats 
exhibit despite the rebase woolworths margin the past 
which likely means able rollout stores more quickly than aldi 
five years 
since has flexible store format comparison aldi takes cookie 
cutter approach with all stores broadly the same dimensions 
discount penetration low global standards which indicates 
opportunity take share from traditional formats 
national brands are more prominent aldi would generate 
sales from its private label range which compares kaufland 
and the specific factors for kaufland 
which much more inline with existing supermarkets with 
the majority the products that sells national international 
existing markets that were targeted for expansion russia ukraine 
brands 
have experienced significant political turmoil making foreign investment less palatable 
fresh food stronger focus its first years australia aldi 
gave fresh food little priority instead looked build its price cre 
sister company lidl less than successful entry the food 
dentials and localised offer fresh only became focus the past 
retailers lidl view pictures hard discount feb 
years consumer preferences changed and aldi wanted take 
has freed budgets invest other regions 
greater share the supermarket basket kaufland has much 
greater focus fresh food very low prices such that product turns 
kaufland schwarz group has closely watched the aldi format historically has followed aldi into new markets with success 
schwarz group already has established businesses across nearly all 
large developed supermarket industries globally australia was one 
the few large profitable developed markets where doesn have 
operations 
quickly ensuring that product quality high 
the fresh food market will become far 
more competitive 
given kaufland strong focus fresh food think its 
fresh offer will considerably better than aldi that 
relatively limited range albeit improving rapidly australia consumer aldi game changer sep 
more competitive fresh food industry obviously 
makes more difficult for the majors win share 
show the exhibits below coles and woolworths have 
gained little share since within the dry grocery market 
expect that trend continue ahead aldi and costco 
roll out stores and kaufland enters put simply the soft 
underbelly the supermarket industry has shrunk 
rapidly thus less opportunity going forward

the kaufland australia store rollout 
probably the single largest barrier for any foreign retailer 
entering australia finding suitable store sites australia 
highly mall based shopping culture means that owning all 
stores opposed renting difficult how quickly 
can kaufland open stores 
australia has significant amount bulky good space coming 
market online sales expand existing retailers are rethinking their 
store roll out needs given virtually all retail space australia 
leased retailers need think long and hard before committing 
long term store lease demand for bulky good style space and 
will continue reduce our view think that this makes easier 
stores launch based our understanding the market 
for kaufland find appropriate sites looking forward 
and precedents estimate that kaufland may targeting 
opening stores when launches australia either late 
kaufland will likely lease some stores the last international large 
early media reports note that kaufland has already purchased 
format retailer enter australia was costco which has only rolled 
sites adelaide australia consumer kaufland enters aus 
out stores the past years costco australia refer exhibit 
tralia what next oct and dandenong melbourne 
for detailed analysis operates with rent sales just 
possible that kaufland has taken options buy other sites that 
owns nearly all its property clearly owned property strategy will 
will execute over the coming months 
take longer execute compared with part leased part owned 
strategy which think kaufland will adopt 
the masters store closure program has freed lot space 
kaufland largest size store sqm literally the same size 
kaufland flexible store format approach should enable faster 
masters stores that were closed december the time 
rollout since kaufland operates stores from sqm think 
closure masters operated stores with further development 
that will more easily find appropriate sites compared with aldi and 
sites masters property portfolio was acquired home consortium 
costco that have more cookie cutter approach store rollout 
that has begun repurposing the sites and letting out think that 
number these masters sites would ideal for kaufland home 
department stores are looking reduce footprints australia 
consortium indicates that focuses three different retail offer 
has per capita basis the most department store space per capita 
ings daily retail needs kaufland would suit this very well lei 
amongst major developed economies australia consumer the 
sure lifestyle and iii homewares and electrical date april 
amazon effect australia may over the coming 
home consortium has only leased eight centres and bunnings has

reportedly bunnings swoops masters sites drive major expan

where could wrong 
result woolworths and coles market share 
higher than our base case with metcash higher 
there are two main upside risks our base case scenario see 
with woolworths growing its market share coles holding and met 
kaufland may decide postpone cancel its entry australia 
cash continues lose market share but slower rate 
and strong supermarket industry growth could return driven 
food inflation and strong macroeconomic growth our alternative 
woolworths margins are higher coles and metcash 
upside scenario assume kaufland cancels its entry and the aus 
than our base case wow food ebit margins reach 
tralian supermarket industry grows 
and coles operating leverage and food inflation 
drive margin expansion these margins are still well below wool

group eps higher than base case and think mulmarket growth base case food inflation and 
tiples can increase between the group level wow 
strong underlying economic conditions see the australian super 
and metcash feel the greatest impact better food business per 
market industry return the growth rate achieved across 
formance given the higher proportion earnings derived from this 
business wow base case and mts wes 
wesfarmers group earnings are impacted lesser extent think 
sales growth for woolworths and coles faster than our 
should this alternative upside scenario play out the australian 
base case across food sales growth for woolworths 
supermarket industry wow could trade earnings and 
reaches between higher than our base case growth the 
the coles business could also trade earnings meaning wes 
coles food business grows with the market kaufland fails 
farmers would trade earnings all else equal these

why too much debt could industry problem observing the 
supermarket industry from afar for the past years gives 
reasonable understanding what can happen when supermarket 
operates with too much debt when supermarket viewed its 
competitors having much debt that can afford invest 
price becomes rational for competitors invest price because 
they know there can retaliation the between 
the discounters invested heavily price they knew that the major 
supermarket chains had stretched balance sheets which sped 
market share gains for the discounters and exacerbated issues for the 
market

majors post this the major supermarkets have degeared balance 
sheets cutting back dividends and divesting non core offshore 
businesses supermarkets operate with far higher property own 
coles could have much debt coles has indicated 
ership compared with australian supermarkets order 
that would look operate with fixed charges cover since 
minimise financial leverage 
this calculation based off the minimum operating lease cost 
excludes sales linked rent implies based morgan stanley 
elevated multiples imply significant further margin expan 
estimates and incremental head office costs debt could 
sion and limited disruptive influence from discounters our 
over this compares with woolworths group which had just 
view
