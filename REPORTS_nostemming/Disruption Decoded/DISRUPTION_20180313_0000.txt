discussion what cargurus launches australia 
market view don believe the market has considered this possibility 
our view occurs yes would see cargurus entry into australia 
incremental negative for car shares whilst car has long and successful track 
record seeing off new competitors and would starting from position 
great strength the arrival serious new global competitor with 
differentiated offer for consumers has three potential impacts our view 
will prompt rise car opex and capex particularly the areas 
advertising brand awareness and software development 
negative impact car revenues price increases dealer products 
could more difficult achieve less expensive alternative and some 
dealers could lost the competitor and 
negative car multiple impact from equity valuation perspective 
expect investors would place either lower ebitda fcf multiple 
future earnings and higher wacc applied future cash flows 
reflect higher risk 
where could wrong possible that cargurus never expands into 
australia challenge car fact this our base case scenario 
what the trigger for writing this report 
are always alert for potential new competitors car online marketplace 
technology constantly changing and substitutes and new products continually 
emerging there shortage examples based technology companies 
disrupting longstanding incumbents this market ranging from google and facebook 
winning adspend from traditional australia media companies netflix winning viewers 
from australian broadcast pay companies and amazon disrupting australian 
retailers this case the specific trigger was our reading cargurus sec documentation 
for its nasdaq listing back october thought was interesting investigate 
because this unique business model which has clearly resonated with 
consumers and car dealers and the company has publicly stated its global expansion 
plans already moving outside the into the and germany and announcing more 
markets will follow thus believe followers car should alert 
long term followers car will recall the last time faced new competitive threat 
back when the australian online car classifieds site carsguide 
undertook significant relaunch with the backing media company news limited and 
consortium car dealers exhibit below illustrates the one month after the 
news carsguide revamp was announced car share price declined 
absolute terms over four month horizon car shares fell much most 
the negative impact came result significant multiple rating exhibit 
ultimately car successfully fended off the carsguide competitive threat with only 
minimal and short term impact its earnings the shares were significantly positively 
rated over the competitive threat diminished and the usual earnings growth 
trajectory returned looking back with perspective that period was only blip 
car long term growth story but the time was big issue and weighed negatively 
the shares the event itself serves precedent what can potentially happen 
car shares another perceived significant competitor were surface thus the 
purpose this report explore one such way this could potentially play out the 
based cargurus were launch local australian business 
clear cargurus have made public comments plans expand australia 
has stated intends add international markets but has not announced which

basic understanding the carsgurus business 
founded the one the founders tripadvisor cargurus global online 
automotive marketplace connects buyers and sellers new and used cars

market cap thus terms market capitalisation 
approximately the size car consensus expectations thomson reuters are for 
cargurus generate revenue increasing cagr 
and ebitda increasing 
what different about the cargurus product 
investigating the cargurus site found the key point difference other sites such 
car the significantly higher use data and analytics coincidence this site 
shares the same founder tripadvisor can see similar architecture design and 
consumer front end with the use algorithms and analytics cargurus aims provide 
consumers with lot data and insight each individual car sale price and dealer 
reputation most notable our view for used vehicles the site calculates fair retail 
price based detailed analysis comparable current and previous car listings 
each given market factoring make model trim year mileage options location and 
maintenance history this estimate value updated daily 
each listed vehicle has its asking price compared cargurus own estimate value 
and each individual vehicle dealer also assigned rating based reputation and past 
results 
finally each specific used car deal then rated either great good fair high 
overpriced the consumer search results are ranked algorithms with the best deals 
top not based the how much the listing dealer might pay 
cargurus business model car 
cargurus subscription service for car dealers dealers can fact list all their 
inventory the cargurus site for free but they must paying subscribers order

similarities 
both are pure online car classifieds sites both companies only operate the auto 
vertical cargurus has revenue derived from online listings display 
car who similarly derives the bulk its revenues rev coming from dealer 
private display and remainder from finance tyre sales 
both have expanded outside their home market car started life

differences 
cargurus site more heavily data based discussed section this report 
the cargurus site carries features such proprietary estimate intrinsic value 
for each listing plus significantly more data reviews such explicit valuation 
comparisons and forced rankings the individual attractiveness each deal for 
buyers there also appears notable difference the annual capex sales 
ratios the two companies with cargurus investing car plausibly 
cargurus greater investment related its wider use data products 
and also likely its start investment into new international markets 
business models for the relationship with dealers are different discussed 
earlier car business model for auto dealers based leads generation 
cargurus which freemium model free list inventory but subscription 
based for value added services for dealers 
car generates higher its traffic organically and less through paid search 
based similiar web estimates cargurus traffic came direct and 
via search organic paid feb comparison car received 
direct and from search organic paid thus would argue car has 
relatively stronger position making less vulnerable new competitors they 
emerge such cargurus 
cargurus has significantly lower ebitda margins this stage its lifecycle 
appears more focused top line growth forecast car ebitda margin 
cargurus consensus ebitda margin for 
contrasting strategies for international expansion organic growth acquisition 
whilst car strategy for acquisition existing local online auto businesses 
acquiring encar for and then eventually moving 
that business acquiring the other for contrast 
cargurus develops its international businesses from scratch electing launch its 
own businesses using its proprietary technology each market 
different international market focuses cargurus presence canada

minority investment the south east asian markets icar asia malaysia

cargurus has estimated active dealers its network the total

take all market ceo cars may cargurus has close competitors 
this compares carsales who has more dominant lead australia with audience share and the dealer penetration carsguide this 
may account for the higher margin forecast carsales than cargurus

case study how did cargurus become the market 
think this fascinating story because anyone who has followed online classified 
advertising businesses closely knows rare for the player vertical ever 
toppled once established why because the network advantages are very significant 
most cases after gaining the position traffic that will typically underwrite the 
position terms revenues generated which leads having the most dollar funds 
spend both further product enhancements and more advertising marketing 
the site which thereafter typically creates circular reference because that 
promotes more traffic the site the competitor and sites which turn again 
creates more revenues and provide more dollars for innovation and marketing and 
thus the cycle goes and thus the player traffic commonly cemented 
that position for the foreseeable future 
recently cargurus was the player the online car classified 
advertising market with monthly uvs that time auto trader had 
monthly uvs see exhibit auto trader had the uvs cargurus and the 
cars had uvs many cargurus 
but today cargurus clear across all the key metrics monthly uvs average 
daily visitors time site and total page impressions exhibit exhibit 
what happened how did cargurus move from player three years 
course are just outsiders looking the industry but there appear three 
key aspects the strategy cargurus built differentiated site heavy data which 
consumers gravitated towards cargurus also provided dealers with lot 
additional data and attracted their initial take with cost option for dealers 
sign and finally having reached leadership traffic and dealer inventory 
cargurus has now turned monetisation its margins are much lower than peers but 
are rising look each those points turn

disruptor build very different site the competition 
and present superior consumer experience 
easier said than done but from simple inspection the major sites the clear 
cargurus very different mentioned earlier has look and feel not dissimilar 
tripadvisor the philosophy being present consumers car buyers with the most 
information and greatest transparency for example cargurus has substantially more 
data and reviews dealer reviews its peers the site not cluttered with third 
party display advertising our view the major unique features appear 
the estimate market value for each vehicle listed for sale 
the classification each listed vehicle either great good fair high

the individual dealer reviews 
deeper engagement with users what interesting that whilst cargurus only 
relatively recently overtook its rivals become terms total monthly uvs 
well before that the cargurus site had deeper engagement with its users shown 
exhibit below terms average minutes per user cargurus was actually the 
leader amongst its peers back minutes per visit back and for the period 
cargurus achieved the time site its major competitors 
having established how cargurus has differentiated itself with consumers the

the other side applies car dealers the cargurus business model has 
unique structure which believe has been important taking leadership 
position listings too 
there are three main products for dealers 
basic listings costs dealers nothing put their listings the site the 
attraction for dealers obviously getting access cargurus monthly uvs 
the downside dealers the free version has limited services interested 
buyers can only contact the dealer via cargurus there direct contact 
enhanced listings this version dealers are able contact interested buyers 
directly via email text chat phone dealers can also promote their dealership 
the original online listing including link back their own site 
featured listings this premium version dealers can promote their inventory 
great good fair high overpriced featured listings also have all the 
communication features enhanced direct email phone chat plus addition 
feature the top slot 
see exhibit for product summary 
think the basic listings function critical because cost dealers nothing least 
add their listing the site there downside for them moreover 
contrast pay per lead model car employs australia dealers are 
incentivised place their inventory the site creates additional cost for 
them this structure has been effective capturing car dealers exhibit illustrates 
three years ago cargurus had dealers the signed this had 
increased dec the company advised this had further increased 
which estimate represents penetration the total estimated car dealers 
the 
why would car dealer pay doesn the free basic listing the job cargurus 
states that its data points the switch from free paid enhanced product 
generates increase leads and increase transactions closed the 
company advised its car dealer customers were using more than just the basic 
listings service the end dec from june 
having established how cargurus has created unique product which has managed 
over the last three years rise and capture the position consumers looking for

its rise the position the used cars classifieds vertical building 
differentiated and data rich site attract mass consumer audience whilst offering 
free basic listings attract the largest collection inventory from dealers were 
conspicuous and critical but another important aspect which believe has driven 
cargurus success disruptor its price dealers significantly lower than the 
other major players result cargurus profitable today and increasingly but 
less than its peers 
maximising near term profitability appears not have been the primary focus the last 
three years attaining leadership position has been think this paramount 
important for disruptor clear cargurus has comfortably exceeded its own 
guidance since listing but put its near term profitability into perspective 
consensus expectations are for cargurus ebitda margin for its 
peers ebitda margins and car ebitda margin 
looking forward cargurus has publicly stated its focus for continue 
increase its audience and continue convert more dealers paying customers 
content less profitable than its peers near term comments from founder and 
ceo march will take the opportunity say something that often say which 
are not rush really drive unit pricing quickly are this for the long term 
and want build large installed base dealers and large audience and started 
low price point and are going very measured how bring that 
what you are not going see rushing drive pricing the near term 
believe this important point make and why cargurus has the potential 
serious disruptor new geographic markets which enters ever did launch 
would with differentiated and uniquely data rich site for consumers and likely

what the potential earnings and valuation impact for car 
new competition 
car has not publicly commented the topic these are our own thoughts 
summarise for any new entrant have negative impact car shares need not 
necessarily become the player not all the following analysis highlights 
disruptor invokes car spend more opex capex and causes lower revenue 
growth trajectory that will likely sufficient have some impact 
negative earnings impact 
see four main areas potential negative impact under our bear case scenario 
revenue impact negative for dealer revenues total revenues car 
leads based business model and competitor emerges challenge car this 
could cause car generate fewer leads for dealers with new competitor the 
market car may also find difficult put through any increases price per lead 
charged car dealers for example hypothetically fall car dealer 
revenues would prima facie see fall revenues and eps impact 
based our estimates see matrix different potential outcomes below 
exhibit eps impact lower car dealer revenues 
source morgan stanley research estimates 
revenue impact negative for display revenues total revenues there 
were fall overall uvs the car site apps and fall time site for 
example hypothetically fall car display revenues would prima facie 
see fall revenues and eps impact based our 
estimates see matrix different potential outcomes below 
exhibit eps impact lower car display revenues 
source morgan stanley research estimates 
under our bear case whilst see the two main potential revenue impacts dealer and 
display addition there could smaller negative impact car private seller 
revenues total revenues 
similarly there would potentially minimal impact car financial services 
stratton and ancillary businesses tyresales 
think there would minimal impact dealer data services total 
revenues 
believe car ownership the most widely used dealer management system 
dms for car dealers across australia autogate datamotive important barrier 
for any new competitor this would challenge for cargurus when talk 
industry contacts there consistent feedback that dealers only wish integrate and 
rely single dms and whilst car keeps the largest share inventory and listings 
for the foreseeable future and keeps investing further improve autogate datamotive 
this significant barrier any new competitors 
advertising marketing costs potentially increase total costs 
think plausible key word and search engine optimisation costs would likely 
increase with another competitor the australian market car would likely 
increase its budget for traditional media adspend aswell radio billboards etc 
increase its brand leadership position with australian consumers car 
disclosed spent sales and marketing increase 
for example hypothetically increase car display 
revenues would prima facie see increase operating expenses and eps impact based our estimates see matrix different potential 
outcomes below 
exhibit eps impact higher car advertising marketing expenses 
source morgan stanley research estimates 
software development potentially increase estimate car currently 
invests annual sales into capex relatively low compared peers sek and 
rea the event competitor with differentiated data rich site entering 
the australian market think plausible car could prompted step its 
investment both opex and capex discuss the section potential strategic 
counter response believe car could emulate number the features 
the cargurus site such dealer reviews proprietary estimates each car 
intrinsic value but that would require additional opex and capex which could 
weigh negatively near term earnings estimate each capex sales 
impact eps impact dcf value car were increase 
capex par with rea sek this would eps impact and impact our dcf value 
pulling all together what could the combined impact 
car earnings and valuation 
below add the percentage eps impact from the aforementioned four potential 
negatives revenue impacts cost capex all equates potential 
negative eps impact let say apply this our base case estimate car 
eps that equates shaving per share off eps expressed another 
way means that the stock current prices actually trading one year 
forward the multiple implied our current forecasts exhibit 
but highlighted before not just the eps that could impacted new 
competition saw when new competition the form carsguide was 
announced car shares rated sharply from one year forward multiple 
down exhibit 
therefore exhibit highlight range potential car share price outcomes 
based upon the sensitivity different eps impacts combined and different potential 
multiple ratings for example the matrix shows hypothetical scenario where 
competition impacts all four areas resulting negative eps impact plus 
multiple rating back the level where the shares traded this 
would imply share price lower than today even car had impact 
its eps highlight like back the threat competition could still see derating and see the price down double digits 
clear such scenario not factored our base case earnings valuation 
continue overweight with share but feel this analysis helps 
answer one the most common questions are asked investors which what 
would the catalyst becoming very bearish car shares the answer which 
step change the competitive environment the carsguide example 
relevant historical precedent the market reaction perceived changes 
competition thus think prudent investors remain alert the potential for new 
entrants this space and the impact they could have the stock performance 
factor such scenario into our bear case see risk reward framework page

potential car strategic counter response what has occurred 
the market 
interestingly when speak our internet colleague andrea ferraz who covers 
the equivalent car being auto trader auto trader group plc reality 
check sep she provides good insight what auto trader has done limit 
the impact that market shortly after the launch cargurus the 
auto trader replicated the dealer reviews 
auto trader replicated the car price value tools and value ratings system 
result cargurus consumer proposition the not materially different auto 
trader result auto trader has maintained its clear leadership position 
terms monthly uvs and time site see exhibit below 
this seems strategically astute and result andrea assessment that cargurus 
has had limited impact auto trader earnings and share price similarly 
investigating cargurus other international expansion markets canada and germany 
appears whilst has achieved gains building listings inventory has not been 
able overtake the players those markets terms consumer use traffic 
separate financial results for these markets have not been disclosed still early 
days but this stage difficult judge the expansion has been success like the 
market appears that cargurus playing long term game 
thus ultimately auto trader successful defence the could car best 
defence australia car equally dominant position the australian market may 
prove deterrent cargurus investing australia likely there are larger and less 
competitive international markets where new entrant could gain traction more quickly 
and easily but cargurus were ever invest australia think likely car would 
follow similar response auto trader thus there would additional costs incurred 
car develop new software and additional advertising marketing search engine 
optimisation costs likely putting some downward pressure ebitda margins and 
epsg but our view lesser evil than the alternative making easy for the 
disruptor cargurus win significant mindshare and audience share away from car

conclusion cargurus ever launches australia would see 
negative for car shares 
bottom line have positive fundamental view car and continue rate the 
shares overweight our bear case for car shares has always centred the 
emergence new strong competitor this report what different identify 
such potential new entrant this should ever occur would see 
incremental negative for car shares why future price increases would more 
difficult achieve thus consensus revenue forecasts would likely have revised 
lower addition extra costs would likely incurred particularly the areas 
advertising marketing and also software development combat product differences 
top these negative earnings impact would also expect rating car 
trading multiple reflect investors added uncertainty about future earnings 
expect car would keep its position and continue achieve long term earnings 
growth this view based the experience where the incumbent autotrader has 
been successful maintaining its leadership position audiences and revenues post 
cargurus arrival car shares lot similar characteristics autotrader with 
equally dominant market position but from equity valuation perspective this 
development would likely negative with stronger particularly one with 
differentiated offering pricing discount order attract dealers inventory and 
prepared incur startup losses and take long term view profitability 
clear there has been comment from cargurus that intends enter the 
australian market thus have not factored such scenario into our car base case 
earnings and valuation have instead factored this into our bear case scenario 
think risk the shares which investors need mindful our bear case 
scenario which unchanged produces value for car share current 
share lower expect the market would factor part this 
immediately upon any entry the australian market but likely wait for evidence 
see cargurus indeed able gain traction with dealers discussed above car 
would confronting competitive threat from very strong existing position the best 
comparable auto trader where shares have fallen since cargurus entry 
into the market late gain for the ftse index likely mostly 
due economic uncertainly brexit but some part due cargurus entry 
why are overweight car shares because the fundamental story and outlook 
know today remains positive highlight the entry competitor such 
cargurus risk for investors alert but the fast changing technology 
world there are new competitive risks emerging constantly for every stock our 
media internet coverage universe there are comparable risks for each car closest
