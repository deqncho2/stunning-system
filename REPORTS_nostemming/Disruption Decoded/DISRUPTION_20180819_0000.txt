important aspects the story have changed foxtel earnings outlook has

that asset are too high and need rebase further nwsa capital position has 
weakened after consolidation foxtel debt which for the time being means less 
opportunity support the shares 
are more bearish than consensus

and ebitda take out nwsa stake rea valued

decreases valuation book publishing coupons australian 
newspapers and australian cable satellite foxtel the flip side consider 
rea excellent business and are more positive than consensus that asset 
rate overweight but encourage investors own rea direct rather than 
via the nwsa holding company point out that since the nwsa spinout 
nwsa shares are rea shares 
see nwsa capital position weaker now the end nwsa net 
cash position decreased from only over the last five years 
nwsa has kept net cash balance this has supported the shares 
provided buffer the event the newspaper businesses deteriorated faster than 
expected and allowed nwsa undertake market share buybacks 
support the share price and undertake accretive acquisitions harlequin 
but following the consolidation foxtel own net debt since nwsa 
the controlling shareholder foxtel now expect supportive 
foxtel debt plausible that foxtel may require more capital from nwsa and 
shareholders think nwsa may consider asset sales strengthen its position 
are more bearish foxtel valuation reduced was

hypothetically what the new fox sports ott streaming service 
priced only per month 
market view unsure don believe the market has considered this topic 
our view nwsa has publicly stated that foxtel preparing for launch 
new dedicated sports over the top ott service australia the end 
impossible outsider looking understand the specific economics 
programming costs and individual programming contract rights etc but what 
strongly believe that bold foxtel strategy price this product very 
aggressively order attract the largest possible number new subscribers 
would potentially have meaningful long term upside there has been speculation 
that the new product may priced the range per month 
terms content assume this will for the universe fox sports channels 
currently available foxtel now see exhibit this report explore the 
pros and cons more aggressive per month offer from nwsa foxtel 
why because even this likely means greater near term churn foxtel 
traditional cable satellite service and therein larger falls profits the next 
few years the medium long term believe this will prove the correct 
strategy 
the upside for foxtel valuation potentially very significant can create 
large and dominant sports ott service australia our bull case scenario 
estimate with subs equates penetration current 
for foxtel traditional cable satellite service standalone for the new fox 
sports streaming product that significant because stands 
today our estimated for the traditional foxtel satellite cable business 
our view the existing business the mature declining stage its 
life cycle have lowered our earnings estimates valuation four times over the 
last two years thus strategically interesting that potentially this one service 
could worth almost much the whole current business based valuation 
benchmarks other ott services such netflix course there are significant 
execution risks this strategy which why incorporated our bull case 
rather than our base case for nwsa shares 
where could wrong perhaps our suggested month does not resonate 
with consumers perhaps unlike general entertainment netflix consumers 
prefer watch live sports traditional fta cable satellite rather 
than take the risk buffering with streaming service perhaps month 
too inexpensive and proves impossible for foxtel ever reach profitability for 
this standalone service perhaps there are limitations the streaming rights 
which foxtel owns over its portfolio sports rights perhaps not all the 
sports games events available for subscribers foxtel now are permissible for 
standalone streaming service 
why are considering this topic now 
the foxtel cable satellite paytv business crossroads the just released 
results show sharp decline profitability for the business predominantly because 
higher costs but also lack subscriber growth and still elevated churn guidance for 
further material increase both opex and capex 
say crossroads because our time covering the australian media industry have 
observed several other traditional media companies similar point when 
dramatic change consumer behaviour confronts historically highly profitable 
business the newspaper magazine industry decade ago happening 
viewership patterns right now evidenced the rapid take netflix australia 
penetration just three years 
commonly this situation observe that the traditional leaders have focused mostly 
protecting their legacy profit pools rather than investing aggressively become the 
leader the new technology even that action accelerates the fall their own 
back book customers and profits 
given structural changes viewing habits and the growth streaming products the 
timing may right for foxtel consider bold strategies with its new streaming 
offering with aim become the leader this new category general 
entertainment the opportunity has likely already passed but streaming sports 
the opportunity still there 
what has nwsa said this topic 
here what the company said the topic new streaming service for sports the 
august earnings call 
for foxtel are confident that the current phase investment rights and technology 
should drive increased subscriptions and value for our investors the new team acutely 
aware the importance improving the user interface and customer service and the need 
innovate such the introduction over the top streaming service later this year 
give more australians easier access premium sports nwsa ceo 
anticipate the launch only sports offering the second quarter 
and are also actively considering other non sports only products targeted specific 
demographics nwsa cfo 
what has telstra said this topic 
nwsa owns foxtel here what telstra the other shareholder foxtel 
stated its august earnings call 
media increasing importance for customers telecommunications companies 
our fixed broadband customers example are active users media either through 
telstra from foxte and you look telecommunication companies around the 
world many them have looked buy media companies way incorporate 
exclusive media into their offerings customers think have the best all worlds 
the sense that have very strong partnership with foxtel reduced our foxtel 
investment have reduced our economic exposure obviously the 
disruption that the media sector going through because going through its own 
challenges but the same time retained our partnership and retained access 
very expect exciting and exclusive content right away across the board and think that 
really does put the best both worlds you can deduce from that very 
committed our long term partnership with foxtel have been prepared and said 
quite publicly prepared dilute our investment down support potential listing 
foxtel that becomes appropriate some point the future think continuing 
grow give foxtel access capital and really pleased with what patrick and his team 
are doing foxtel transition the business because like any traditional media 
company obviously facing the challenges over the top streaming services and 
other competitive dynamics but remember has far the blue chip sporting content 
that all the best rights shows movies got very very good stable content 
assets and continuing invest delivering those both digitally but also through 
traditional broadcast services you saw they just announced the launch and 
enables them big screen delivering very difficult that frankly over 
network just because the volume data and work partnership with foxtel and 
have our own rights well have all the afl the nrl the net mobile digital 
streaming rights and have telstra and other arrangements well can 
continue deliver and distribute more media services but predominantly our focus 
our partnership with foxtel and they have the best content telstra ceo 
explore three topics this report 
why makes sense for nwsa have foxtel launch dedicated sports 
streaming service australia consumer behaviour changing the rapid 
success netflix demonstrates reaching subs penetration and 
viewers only three years since its local launch see pages 
what the potential revenue ebitda for fox sports ott streaming service 
make assessment the number addressable households exploring the 
penetration rate believe pure sports ott service could achieve australia 
conclude that penetration possible priced competitively consider 
range outcomes for revenues costs and ebitda see pages 
thoughts valuation there are two main debates 
what could standalone fox sports ott service worth 
and what would the negative impact the traditional foxtel cable satellite 
business 
explore range outcomes one observation that the resultant sports ott 
business will have significant size and scale order offset the 
degradation earnings the traditional satellite cable business the key 
debate becomes whether makes strategic and financial sense for foxtel 
effectively disrupt itself think does see pages 
why think makes strategic sense for foxtel launch 
sports streaming service australia 
this section explore the positives and negatives foxtel unbundling fox sports 
and selling new streaming ott over the top service australia clear 
are proposing the ott service includes all fox sports digital rights including marquee 
sports such cricket nrl and afl currently available part the foxtel now 
bundle but independent and standalone cost per month 
positives 
consumer behaviour changing completely standalone ott dedicated sports 
service will cater for this consumers are increasingly watching video over the 
internet services such netflix stan and youtube these services have grown 
rapidly australia with netflix achieving subs exhibit and stan reaching over 
after three years some the consumer benefits ott services include allowing 
users consume regularly updated content when they want demand 
relatively low price point per month and iii availability various devices 
tablet etc the flip side believe traditional cable satellite pay audiences 
have peaked australia foxtel subs due its high cost arpu 
and lowest entry point and the inability unbundle channels 
consumers are paying for multiple channels they don watch addition highlight 
that overall fta audiences are also decline exhibit below with live sport 
remaining one the few drawing cards for pulling large audiences the changing 
viewing habits are most prevalent younger audiences where there accelerated 
shift ott services 
strategically also believe dedicated streaming ott service would position foxtel 
take audience share and ultimately revenue share from australia fta 
broadcasters more and more consumers choose access their sport this way

have wide catalogues shows and movies including netflix stan and amazon 
prime with several other services expected launch the next few years however 
none these services offer sport consumers currently watch sport fta which 
lacks coverage through foxtel cheapest bundle with sport per month 
traditional foxtel foxtel now therefore believe dedicated sports ott

negatives 
cannibalization foxtel existing cable satellite pay business will happen 
the only question how severe this clearly the most significant risk put into 
perspective foxtel generated ebitda this profit pool risk 
consumers have the option unbundle sports how expect will drive higher 
foxtel pay churn and downward pressure foxtel pay arpu 
technology risk bad consumer experience there are several examples australia 
where streaming services have not met consumer expectations because complications 
with technology notably during the fifa world cup optus was forced allow 
fta operator sbs broadcast significant portion the games because many 
consumers experienced dropouts buffering complete failure optus streaming 
service assume each addressable has access fast broadband which may not 
the case until the end when the nbn rollout complete 
competition from global tech platforms for streaming sport will eventually arrive 
australia facebook amazon youtube etc were noticeably absent from the latest 
round bidding for australian digital sports rights cricket and tennis however 
believe that the long term remains likely that the global tech platforms will bid 
for major sports rights this will likely lead higher sports content costs loss 
exclusive content exactly another reason why foxtel should strategically aiming 
build the dominant streaming sports business australia 
declining sports audiences the fragmentation audiences from ott services now

thoughts valuation dedicated fox sports ott service 
for nwsa investors believe considering the likely impact from the launch new 
unbundled fox sports ott service requires two part discussion 
what could the new standalone ott service worth 
what impact could the ott service have foxtel existing cable satellite 
business and our overall foxtel fox sports valuation our current estimate 
for the existing business see our report march 
for more detail background 
the section below first outline how possible that the fox sports ott service 
itself could worth consisting subscription revenue sub 
methodology revenue revenue that big number 
clear there substantial execution risk which why this factors into our nwsa bull 
case scenario rather than our base case 
second the flip side expect the cannibalisation deflationary impact from the ott 
service foxtel traditional cable satellite business will negative and potentially 
significantly our existing estimate without any sports ott 
service the scenarios have modeled can envisage existing ebitda falling 
sharply why estimate total foxtel cable satellite customers today 
include foxsports their subscription thus the ability take standalone 
subscription fox sports existed expect some would take this option and may drop 
sports from their existing foxtel cable satellite package drop foxtel cable satellite 
altogether thus foxtel would likely face both subscriber losses and arpu declines 
exploring standalone valuation for new fox sports ott service 
conclusion front below derive potential valuation the range for unbundled and standalone fox sports australia ott service consists 
for its subscription revenues exhibit and additional for its 
advertising revenues exhibit course caution that this very preliminary the 
service has not even been confirmed launched yet and such none this 
factored into our base case nwsa foxtel earnings estimates valuation more 
importantly the objective our analysis was explore foxtel could build ott 
sports service with scale think the answer yes the potential there 
think the best approach value the ott subscription revenue component using 
sub methodology can benchmarked listed peers like netflix which 
are purely subscription revenue based and the ott advertising revenue component 
separately valued using alternative revenue methodology rather than sub 
ott subscription revenue valuation 
what appropriate benchmark for fox sports subscription revenue our 
view netflix nflx appropriate benchmark since considered the leading 
ott service globally upfront acknowledge that some level discount 
needs applied nflx multiples derive valuation for the fox sports ott 
service because nflx has global scale allowing amortize content costs over 
much larger subscriber base significantly larger tam because operates 
many countries and considerable catalogue proprietary content driving 
subs growth and cost control other ott services such hulu espn and stan 
would also appropriate benchmarks but they are not publicly traded their 
multiples are not publicly observable 
what multiples does netflix trade sub assuming nflx share price 
total subs growing from 
nflx trades sub and 
revenue assuming nflx share price total 
revenue growing from nflx trades 
revenue and 
fox sports ott valuing the subscription component derive valuation 
use sub discount nflx which implies 
average lifetime years per customer applying this multiple our 
fox ott subs estimate results valuation note then

bringing both components together subscription advertising can envisage 
estimate foxtel can create standalone ott service dedicated 
sports importantly with subs penetration total australian 
households acknowledge that practice achieving this scale would challenging 
and carry significant execution risk along the way that why include this our bull 
case scenario for nwsa shares rather than our base case

exploring the likely negative impact fox sports ott foxtel 
existing cable satellite pay business 
discussed earlier the equally critical part any valuation discussion what impact 
could standalone streaming service reaching subs have the traditional 
foxtel business the new sports ott priced competitively say 
believe inevitable there will negative knock impact foxtel subscribers and 
arpu and therefore meaningful negative impact the earnings and valuation 
that business 
key sensitivities 
cable satellite subscriber losses forecast fox sports ott service 
successful ultimately securing subscribers the key question how many 
those will churn off the foxtel cable satellite service altogether what 
percentage foxtel existing subscribers only take that service for the sports 
programming all else equal estimate 
say foxtel existing subscribers were leave the negative revenue impact 
would and assuming cut through the ebitda impact would 
negative 
foxtel existing subscribers leave the negative impact twice the above 
and ebitda impact 
cable satellite arpu declines expect arpu trends will move line with 
subscriber trends thus there significant subscriber churn expect 
likelihood that foxtel arpu will also fall 
cable satellite arpu declines say per month all else equal the impact total 
foxtel revenue and ebitda 
cable satellite arpu declines say per month all else equal the impact total 
foxtel revenue estimated and ebitda 
acknowledge the above sensitivity analysis simplistic that because reality 
fox sports ott does become very significant success its own right foxtel would 
course also able allocate significant percentage its programming costs the 
ott business and therein improve the profitability per sub the traditional 
cable satellite business notwithstanding that total cable satellite subs will likely 
decline 
bottom line complex situation and not easy model outsider but 
what can say with conviction the more competitively priced the standalone fox 
sports ott service and the larger the take consumers then the more 
detrimental the impact will cable satellite subscriber earnings foxtel earnings 
over the next years are very sensitive decisions made pricing the new ott 
service therein lies the conundrum for nwsa strategically taking year view 
believe pricing fox sports ott aggressively makes strategic sense and will ultimately 
make financial sense too they stand create very substantial new business but 
the flip side this aggressive would likely result meaningfully lower rebasing foxtel profits for the next years 
conclusion see scope for foxtel disrupt itself one option 
price its new fox sports ott service aggressively riskier 
but think makes long term strategic sense 
three key points from this report 
foxtel existing and traditional cable satellite paytv business the declining 
phase its life cycle have lowered estimates multiple times the last few 
years and again after the results consumer behaviour changing and 
foxtel longer enjoys monopoly selling multi channel australians the 
take netflix australia evidence change has achieved 
penetration australian households years contrast foxtel after years 
operation peaked only penetration and has stalled 
its advantage foxtel appears have uniquely strong set streaming rights 
for sports australia difficult outsider looking have clarity 
every set rights but based the foxtel now sports package which streamed 
though bundled with general entertainment this includes rights major 
australian sports afl nrl cricket and international sports well 
locally produced content fox sports news channel fox footy channel 
other player has access such extensive set rights thus believe 
makes strategic sense for foxtel launch new standalone sports ott service 
what the best strategy for fox sports ott think foxtel the crossroads 
right now dilemma that many other traditional media companies have faced 
the choice between defending its existing cable satellite paytv profit pool 
investing aggressively build entirely new ott business even means 
accelerating the decline its traditional business ultimately believe 
aggressive launch phase build fox sports ott will prove the correct strategy for 
shareholders over the long term 
thus given its headstart with content foxtel could price its new fox sports ott 
aggressively say and pursue sub growth and scale priority yes 
presents risk near term foxtel and nwsa earnings and one factor our move

valuation 
our valuation share was 
prima facie nwsa high relative the australian market 
elect strip out nwsa investment rea why because rea publicly listed 
company nwsa owns whilst nwsa consolidates this company its reported 
earnings for valuation purposes prefer use the public value after deducting 
estimate tax payable the event sale and remove its contribution from nwsa 
earnings the rea investment has current market value more 
conservative remove estimated tax equating share take 
off the numerator and balance this adjustment must also deduct the estimated 
contribution off rea eps 
after making these adjustments estimate that nwsa print australian pay stub 
represents implied multiple for the current share price
