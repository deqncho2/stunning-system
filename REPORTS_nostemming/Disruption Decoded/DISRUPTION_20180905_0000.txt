executive summary double downgrade 
believe the media landscape india just other parts the world likely undergo significant change due 
changing consumer behavior while the west has already seen significant penetration ott players such netflix and 
amazon prime consumer households thus disrupting traditional content and distribution players india are still the 
beginning that however see two key risks brewing for zee 
near term ward off competition from new players such netflix amazon prime video jio etc see zee taking the 
bull the horn and making significant investments original content and marketing its ott offering this likely 
exert pressure near term margins earnings since there significant uncertainty today how the financial performance 
will play out over the next years have laid out scenario analysis our base case ebitda margins assume per management estimate however our bear case margins assume going down 
see exhibit see higher probability our bear case unfolding 
medium term there could possibility that advertising dollars shift digital customers start engaging more 
digital platforms for key markets such the europe and china share already due the rapid increase 
digital advertising see exhibits hence this could slow down spend growth india currently the mid teens 
and could have significant impact zee advertising revenues which currently makes its total revenue our base 
case assume share industry spend goes from resulting cagr however 
our bear case comes through where assume industry share goes then growth will slow down cagr and 
hurt zee 
global case studies highlight the disruption faced broadcasters due increasing digital content consumption our case 
studies the developed media markets indicate that shifts content consumption behavior caused significant disruption 
the linear networks saw declining subscriber penetration and lost third their audience few years consumption 
moved digital platforms our european media team too seeing the impact from rising penetration netflix and amazon 
china different where consumption video has shifted digital platforms such iqiyi tencent video etc 
expensive valuations ytd the stock has underperformed the benchmark and down sensex even then 
one year forward ebitda for ebitda cagr over over see scope for derating ott 
losses start flowing through almost consensus still have buy hold rating the stock and their earnings 
estimates are and higher than for and respectively

indian media content industry could 
potentially disrupted like global peers 
evidence from developed markets globally indicate that the shift the way content consumed and distributed has 
caused significant disruption the media content industry 
the netflix originals strategy commenced february since then netflix penetration households rose 
from while linear network subscriber penetration declined from thanks differentiated 
content the platform with declining linear viewership penetration advertising revenue growth slowed since 
and lost share digital advertising 
europe our media analyst omar sheikh the report european letter from america jun indicated that 
viewing traditional networks europe already being negatively impacted rising penetration netflix and amazon 
given the structural pressure believes advertising which network revenues europe has probably peaked 
china different where consumption video has shifted digital platforms such iqiyi and tencent video and the 
share digital advertising has increased from 
believe india could witness similar change with advertising dollars shifting digital customers start engaging 
more digital platforms indeed think this shift may not dramatic the near term wireline broadband penetration 
significantly low traditional subscription tariffs india are much lower than broadband tariffs and the content 
consumed india hindi regional languages and hence availability relevant online content for the masses critical 
requirement however see these issues gradually getting addressed wireline broadband penetration could increase now 
with jio focussing that segment and this could also take down broadband tariffs the country just the way played out 
the wireless segment are also seeing significant investments planned for creating local language content and the recent 
success sacred games from netflix could shot the arm for global ott players result could see spend 
growth slow down the medium term with concomitant impact zee traditional advertising revenues 
key question what are global broadcasters doing arrest this disruption and keep themselves relevant 
strategic shift content production focussing increasing original programing launching new shows favoring house 
production introducing big stars and generating revenue from international licensing deals 
consolidation through walt disney acquiring much fox 
diversifying into ott services business models built traditional distribution cbs hbo starz and wwe are 
amplifying their growth through ott distribution 
this transition unfolded have seen the media stocks broadcasters well pay operators rate and 
significantly underperform the index over past few years interestingly even though the advertising revenue began 
flatten out but growth remained and before proved down year for national organic 
basis multiple derating started playing out from early broadcasters and pay operators started hinting cord 
cutting and pay subscribers started losing subscribers though india still few years away from such scenario its early 
indications could have significant impact zee multiple risk highlight
