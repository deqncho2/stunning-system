foodary and franchisees brought house caltex under 
going retail transformation via its foodary strategy 
electric vehicles evs have the potential completely disrupt the 
rolling out new formats and offerings aimed exploiting the 
fuel distribution business over the medium long term the most 
convenience market caltex has also decided move away 
obvious impact reduced petrol and diesel sales morgan stanley 
from the franchisee model expected cost 
research forecasts that sales volume decline could reach from 
over the next three years 
today levels the there would also likely secondary affects such lower retail sales noted evs are 
valuation and earnings changes 
currently charged home meaning there less reason visit 
petrol station 
have made changes our earnings forecasts this note but 
trim our price target from share the decrease 
one the challenges for investors how should the risk evs 
comes adjust our multiple from this for 
priced today given that the pace adoption remains uncertain 
two reasons our earnings forecasts february don 
include the loss woolworth supply whereas did 
how caltex responding 
include the loss woolworth supply from and significant proportion caltex dcf valuation lies the terminal value 
think the threat adoption any meaningful way australia 
which dependent terminal growth rate assumptions clearly 
some way off although the pace rollout remains uncertain 
evs pose risk these growth rates over time does lytton 
surprise see obvious changes caltex business model 
refinery viability were refining margins reduce point time 
this point time however putting evs one side there are 
when greater investment required convert the refinery pro 
number changes caltex business model that are interrelated 
duce low sulfur fuels 
with caltex long term growth prospects 
believe there still some risk the woolworth contract over 
caltex operates mature market and supplies around one third 
time thus our base case assumptions may too optimistic mul 
australia petrol and diesel requirements changes underway over 
tiyear view woolworth reviewing other sales options outside the 
the past few years include 
process this means caltex could lose some all this contract 
depending who the service stations are sold the contract
