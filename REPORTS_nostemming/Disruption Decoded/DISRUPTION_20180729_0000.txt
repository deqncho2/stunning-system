disruption gaming license uncertainty 
the first two casino licenses are for renewal march less than two years from now the remaining four will 
june for the first time the last years there are two ways think about the risks 
one monetary this likely and easy quantify this could either one time fee ongoing revenue tax that higher 
than the current 
the other existential may mean either loss license competition from new entrant 
monetary outflow 
new entrants 
have analyzed two scenarios 
there are two ways include new entrants 
upfront one time payment one year gaming ebitda for 
one would create seventh license holder here new 
each operator macau gaming industry ebitda was 
entrant could take much market share 
the outflow will have minor impact overall 
enough land and capital were allocated but think real 
market value and may even result multiple rating this 
istic assume market share loss considering 
scenario similar what crown paid for the extension its 
there not enough land and would have late mover disad 
license melbourne ebitda 
vantage 
raising revenue tax from the current macau 
revenue tax one the highest the world more competi 
this scenario deduct ebitda from existing 
tion from japan and korea should mean significant 
players but keep all other assumptions unchanged 
increase the tax rate however the event these countries 
arrive market value even this 
raise the annual tax rate increase can justified based 
scenario larger companies galaxy and sands could see 
current roic around new casinos like wynn 
minimal impact while sjm and mgm could see larger 
palace and parisian this scenario overall market value 
declines revenue ebitda and value 
drops from now companies with 
alternatively the government might force existing operators 
higher margin and mass exposure galaxy and sands should 
share their license with local partners less likely our 
benefit more while companies with high vip exposure 
view however the event that some all the operators 
wynn lower margin sjm should suffer 
might asked surrender their equity assets 
new local partner for price equal the book value the 
existing operators could lose their gaming ebitda 
from onwards 
the potential downside significant and estimate that 
the market value could drop such 
scenario conceptually this risk mainly foreign operators 
like sands wynn and mgm 
disruption competition 
macau market share china outbound tourists was but captures around all gambling chinese 
citizens macau accounts for total global land based casino revenue but all casino spending chinese citizens 
identify potential disruption two fronts here 
hainan the island bigger area than macau and does not require visa for arrivals from china 
japan three times more local high net worth individuals compared china and strong inbound tourism growth also favored 
chinese outbound tourists 
hainan 
japan 
see meaningful cannibalization from hainan the tune 
japan may take only the gaming revenue macau japan 
hainan recently received approval establish 
attracted around one third its visitors from china 
lottery and horse racing which could precursor allow gam 
compared sanya hainan thus could have can 
bling the island which has excess hotel capacity star 
nibalization affect macau this justified singapore opening 
rated rooms with only occupancy this not our 
which had minimal impact macau japan gaming revenue 
base case 
which estimate when the first wave casinos 
open will not rely solely visitors from china japan 
hainan were take market share all gambling 
pachinko industry generated revenue bigger 
chinese citizens that would mean drop 
than macau has three times the number local high 
ebitda for macau leaving with market value

gaming licenses 
believe the first test license renewal will come march with the renewal the gaming licenses held sjm and mgm china 
think two year license extension for these two operators likely happen after that all six current operators will through the license 
renewal process the same pace expect the macau government release the license renewal framework and the discussion 
negotiation between the government and operators start 
the first time for macau renew gaming licenses and there not formalities precedent references these licenses could from 
rebidding and many global gaming companies well chinese non gaming companies would interested get their hands these 
licenses 
discuss four major scenarios around license renewal following two sections 
monetary outflow 
one off payment one year gaming ebitda 
for each operator 
case studies for upfront fees 
cases for 
payment one time upfront license fee possible with reference 
australia the most recent license renewal australia was 
cases australia singapore and europe historically the macau 
crown melbourne which required upfront payment 
government has relied heavily casino contributions for its gdp 
and final payment the expiry 
and fiscal reserves expect the one off upfront license fee could 
the current period the lump sum 
around total the annual gaming ebitda generation 
equivalent the property ebitda 
from six operators 
however the license period much longer 
years 
this similar what crown paid for the extension its license 
south korea regarding duty free licenses the korea 
melbourne ebitda many other indus 
customs service has proposed increasing license fee rate 
tries like telecoms the authority charges one time fees for spectrum 
from revenue depending the 
auction 
absolute revenue amount 
singapore also requires fee per year for 
one off upfront license fee would paid 
renewing three year term 
capital expenditure our dcf valuation exhibit suggests that 
our macau market cap estimate could face downside 
this case 
cases against 
macau upfront one off payment small 
number for the macau government this upfront payment 
could discourage potential bidders with high credentials 
gaming development regional competition from japan the 
philippines and other counties also fierce 
morgan stanley research 
revenue tax 
the potential tax rate hike could the disruptor that could hurt 
casino profitability and ebitda margin macau generated total 
case studies for revenue tax hikes 
gaming revenue and gaming ebitda 
cases for 
which implies ebitda margin average for the industry the 
south korea regarding duty free licenses the korea 
gaming tax rate were raised from expect the total 
customs service has proposed increasing license fee rate 
gaming ebitda margin would trimmed and therefore reduce 
from revenue depending the 
ebitda assuming current margin for the industry 
absolute revenue amount 
singapore addition the gaming revenue tax 
this scenario justified based historical roic for macau casinos 
singapore also levy income tax profit when casinos 
thus increase could still allow macau companies 
became operational 
generate good return their investment for example wynn palace 
opened its casino cotai cost and the annu 
macau macau companies have higher roic the 
government could raise tax yet keep companies profitable 
alized return within the first two years already tracking more 
than 
our base case scenario expect long term ebitda growth 
from however the tax hike happens 
license renewal expect ebitda decline immediately 
yoy due margin shrink our dcf valuation 
exhibit suggests that our macau market cap estimate 
could face downside this case 
cases against 
australia crown melbourne was able negotiate lower 
taxes when its license was renewed including the 
removal super tax vips and the waiver 
previously proposed gaming machine levy 
maryland when mgm opened maryland the state 
government lowered slot taxes for maryland live 
and for horseshoe baltimore compared the 
headline rates slots and tables 
macau macau current gaming tax rate already 
one the highest globally and more regional competition 
coming japan and south korea also ebitda 
margin vip business which contributes 
government tax revenue could become too low sustain 
the business 
new entrants 
seventh license awarded 
ebitda shared with new local 
partners 
think the potential addition new seventh gaming license 
could create more competition for existing operators the new oper 
think license sharing likely happen new entrant joins the 
ator would take part market share assume that the fair share 
game with land and gaming facilities the scenario possible 
should however because late entry and limited 
that the new entrant buys the stake current operators 
hotels and tables think the new entrant could best 
which will total net compa

incumbents will drop due sharing and estimate devel

regional competition 
view regional competition the first key disruptor 
that macau may face the next years macau ggr 
has tripled since ggr the 
las vegas strip representing over share major 
global gaming markets believe that the macau gaming 
market one the key beneficiaries china strong 
economy and wealthier chinese visitors specifically 
count only chinese gamblers estimate that macau ggr 
share global major gaming markets could high 
around 
hainan unlikely but most disruptive 
april china announced that hainan could develop horse 
racing sports lottery and instant lottery for large international 
sporting events this could precursor allowing gambling the 
island argue that could happen based the below rationales 
although the possibility low 
capital outflow measures from china over gamblers 
macau are mainland chinese which means that over 
however both either japan and hainan open casinos 
capital flowed out from the chinese 
macau share chinese gamblers would decline meaningfully 
mainland macau thus overseas 
because inroads from these two regional competitors esti 
traffic control achievable the island hainan separate

island and would easy control traffic and out 
with the first casino opening and expect the cannibaliza 
entrance fees and verification enter casinos could 
tion could and from hainan and japan respectively 
others way control the traffic 
our scenario analysis suggests that macau market valuation 
large hotel inventory and undeveloped land hainan has 
could decline casinos open both hainan and japan 
excess hotel rooms with low occupancy starred 
hotel rooms with only occupancy rate the land 
hainan still underdeveloped whereas macau has limited 
land for new properties 
with strong domestic visitation large hotel inventory and low occupancy visas required and much easier transportation for chinese 
capital outflow issues and diversified experiences for gamblers 
hainan could have disruptive impact macau opens casinos
