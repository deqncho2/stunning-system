payments india the exponential growth 
story 
india path formalize its economy and using technology drive this move discussed our september blue paper there are three drivers this 
move digital payments with new real time payment solutions also enabled almost all households having bank 
account digital identity indians are already 
enrolled this and the new online indirect tax system the 
goods and services tax gst these moves will bring large 
part the population into the formal economy and enable 
them access cheaper financing this will have major 
impact across the economy some the key conclusions 
reached our blue paper the next india india digital 
leap the multi trillion dollar opportunity sep 
are follows 
million payment solutions using mobile phones have 
been gaining acceptance initially through mobile wallets which are 
part closed loop ecosystem and now through interoperable 
payment system 
mid new real time payment gateway unified payment 
interface upi was launched and our view that over time this 
will become the main mode digital payments both for peer topeer and peer business payments this view driven 
the fact that upi interoperable payments gateway linking 
bank accounts unlike the hitherto popular wallets fact the biggest wallet players are also joining upi 
less than two years after its launch upi annualizing 
transactions gdp and accounted for total digital 
key driver this move digital payments which our focus 
transactions march expect this continue grow 
this note the large majority transactions india are cash trans 
rapid pace enabled new players improved offering and deeper 
actions historically the migration non cash forms has been slow 
smartphone penetration expect upi increase gdp 
driven lack consumer awareness and also lack physical 
over the next five years and this would imply that 
infrastructure however this changing there has been sharp 
total upi transactions would billion 
increase point sale pos terminals which has driven card 
cagr and billion cagr 
usage both credit and debit but the big story has been mobile 
that implies total digital payments would gdp

lower fees banks make fairly substantial amount fees for

the risk fintech firms offer payment product which signifi
