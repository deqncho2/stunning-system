these are consistent with much lower admissions per capita

sapprft these also support our view that lower tier cities will

respondents tier and below cities enjoyed 
sustainable growth beyond our box office income and 
watching chinese films the most theatre higher than the

tier and below cities versus and tier and and

this consistent with higher box office contribution from lower tier 
significant development chinese films similar what happened

chinese film strategy supports psa 
stabilization and rebound 
chinese films only contributed imax box 
the back adopting the multi film strategy during blackout 
office china compared with the level for the 
periods and increasing the number chinese films outside blackout 
industry imax only has less than chinese film box office market 
periods previously imax only released one film time but the 
share china compared with foreign film box office market 
clustering chinese films into blackout periods created significant 
share this the result imax only released chinese 
hit miss risk for imax therefore imax changed its strategy 
films during mostly within blackout periods 
release chinese films the same time during blackout periods 
foreign films chinese films are clustered into 
starting october and recorded yoy increase box 
blackout periods which created high selection risk for imax under 
office during the national day holiday estimate significant 
the previous single film strategy demonstrated the recent 
improvement imax chinese film box office market share 
misses the mermaid and wolf warrior and ticket price pre 
while imax foreign film box office market share 
mium relatively lower for imax format chinese films compared 
rebounds driving overall imax box 
with foreign films 
office market share our bull case 
forecast higher chinese film market share 
this put pressure imax china psa expanded into low 
assuming better indexing imax box office percentage 
tier cities estimate imax china has screens located 
the film total box office further lifting psa 
tier below cities end compared with this result its rapid expansion into lower tier cities along 
additional dmr conversion costs will incurred for imax 
with its partners recent years especially wanda which accounted 
china result increasing the number different films 
for imax china screens tier below cities estimate 
releases given period imax china pays conversion fees 
imax china psa was negatively affected the preference for chi 
for most films and for most films imax 
nese films lower tier city viewers and the clustering chinese 
corp for foreign film conversion and cost plus conversion fees 
films into blackout periods leaves limited high quality chinese film 
for chinese films conversion believe psa upside from more chi 
choice for imax outside blackout periods however see signifi 
nese film releases outweighs the increase conversion costs espe 
cant upside opportunity for imax psa lower tier cities also bol 
cially imax china further expands into lower tier cities our 
stered consumption upgrade and imax multi film selection 
sensitivity analysis box office brings breakeven gross 
strategy 
profit contribution for imax china from both film and theatre segments assuming indexing moreover imax corp has taken steps 
box office market share analysis supports our view that imax 
streamline its digital mastering dmr costs and already 
china psa will stabilize and then rebound from onwards

management evaluating the potential for dividends although has 
based ticket price and occupancy rate the middle the 
not made any announcements this regard think imax china 
range implies ticket price and 
could start paying dividends payout based 
occupancy rate which looks conservative enough 
strong free cash flow when the screen expansion growth rate slows 
compared with the ticket price and occupancy 
down translating dividend yield given the share price 
rate for the industry 
weakness hsi believe possible that 
the company could declare dividend earlier for which 
after two consecutive years disappointment the market appears 
believe could positive catalyst announced with the 
too bearish the long term psa outlook for imax china how 
annual results end february were occur 
ever believe adopting multi film strategy during blackout 
periods and increasing overall number films should help imax 
china psa stabilize and rebound from
