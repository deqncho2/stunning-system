these regions are more developed and have higher proportion the wealthy 
population however with the luxury dealership stores becoming saturated coastal 
regions have witnessed accelerating consolidation the china dealer segment and 
these leading dealers are more open acquiring stores located inland areas and 
lower tier cities 
for instance baoxin acquired stores including luxury brands such jlr and 
cadillac from sichuan ganghong zhongsheng acquired stores including 
luxury brands such mercedes from hainan jiahua and yongda acquired 
stores including luxury brands such bmw from jiangsu baozun all these stores are 
located tier lower tier cities such chengdu and mianyang sichuan province

have achieved strong expansion the luxury car segment and now dominate this 
market the three leading german luxury brands jointly account for more than 
china luxury market while their domestically manufactured models account for 
over luxury vehicle production volume china

shared profit from the beijing hyundai account for baic net profit 
and continued strong momentum for beijing benz expect shared 
profit from the beijing benz account for baic net profit and 
turnaround beijing hyundai back improving model cycle 
and renewed strategic focus management 
improving model line and mix starting from beijing hyundai plans roll out 
five suv models the end this year the new launch and the face lift 
reina full model change kona new launch santa full model 
change and tucson face lift given its heavy emphasis the suv segment 
particularly the small sized suv segment the near term the company should 
improve its suv mix and narrow the gap the industry since expect the suv 
segment the only growth driver the industry the next few years this 
bodes well for beijing hyundai sales recovery and onwards 
exhibit beijing hyundai key model launches 
source company data morgan stanley research 
key strategic changes oct part its major business restructuring the 
hyundai motor group announced that plans provide more autonomy regional 
offices subsidiaries compared with the previous structure centralized decisionmaking process this marks significant change its business structure previously 
all the key decisions including regional strategies and targets were made and 
assigned the control tower its headquarters resulting discrepancies between 
manufacturing and sales targets and limited flexibility timing and number product 
launches and mix decentralized operations have been widely adopted its key 
competitors such volkswagen toyota and honda 
key management changes sept the company announced the appointment tao 
hung tan chief executive officer beijing hyundai motor succeeding wonshin 
chang tan has been instrumental hyundai entry the chinese market and will 
responsible for turning around its operations including stabilizing the and 
improving relationships with suppliers 
jun hyundai motor hired veteran volkswagen designer china simon loasby 
loasby became hyundai second highest ranking foreign executive its design 
team after the design chief peter schreyer and charge designing and developing 
chinese models while advising the group strategy and marketing for the chinese 
market 
with loasby board expect beijing hyundai begin launching more targeted 
models china the new approach adding local flavor chinese consumers specific 
preferences should gradually improve and strengthen the hyundai brand overall 
competitiveness china believe beijing hyundai currently scheduled launch 
targeted sedan and likely accelerate that momentum with additional 
models the next few years 
beijing benz sustain sales and profitability 
daimler results showed that its share profits attributable the beijing benz 
amounted yoy from since daimler holds 
equity interest the beijing benz calculate net profit beijing benz 
expect sales beijing benz remain resilient from 
onwards given the strong demand for its class and glc models which has been 
evidenced the fact that retail pricing the class has held quite well after 
bmw new series launch addition are positive sales demand the 
luxury segment china and expect sales luxury cars china maintain mid teens 
cagr the next few years backed consumption upgrades and replacement demand 
which believe bodes well for beijing benz sales and profitability and

what would make more bullish 
geely will have strong new model pipeline plans launch three new 
models under the geely brand one mpv one class sedan and one class sedan 
addition aside from the lynk model geely will launch two new models under 
the lynk brand the and models these new models were 
achieve higher than expected sales volume growth and margin improvement 
this would make more bullish the stock 
what would make more bearish 
believe the intense competition china suv segment due slowdown china 
market could drag down geely suv sales growth and profitability which 
could lead lower than expected earnings addition brands currently 
dominate the mid range high end suv segment which asp and margin are higher 
than the low end suv segment brands decide lower their asps maintain

gwm shares have consistently carried premium its shares the average
