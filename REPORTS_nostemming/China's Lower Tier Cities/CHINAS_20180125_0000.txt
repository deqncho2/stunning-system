investment summary 
see opportunity amid the share price drop owing the recent 
downward guidance 
management indicated that sales growth for likely lower than the for 
which previously guided there was sudden drop sales sell channel 
december while the cumulative sales trend was above line with the previous 
guidance until november think the issue was hiccup appears from our 
channel checks that the sell channel for december and january combined still 
good with retail demand intact 
more importantly both our alphawise survey and our communications with distributors 
point strong market share and sales growth for hengan sanitary napkins with this 
evidence mind are convinced that hengan sales growth will 
significantly higher than the trend think the correction has priced the 
weakness december and that this represents good opportunity build positions 
the dip 
sales growth will the strongest trigger for stock rating 
china staples group has rated from next months from december 
now driven mainly increased expectations recovery demand and 
broad based price hikes expect that much stronger sales growth for hengan 
will push the stock catch with peers since finding bargain not easy currently 
potential price hikes hpc categories could another catalyst spur valuation

hiccup unlikely repeated 
management acknowledged issue with its sales growth target structure which led 
some gaps sales intensity the end the year note that was the first year 
implementing the amoeba system and the incentives place contributed some 
dialing down sell during december which some distributors spoke also 
mentioned our channel checks with distributors reflect improving momentum into 
january and change the overall retail sales trend 
management confirmed that such exception will not occur this year 
sales teams evaluation and compensation calculation will counted until the yearend addition double digit percentage sales team leaders who were short their 
targets will replaced january and february some the new leaders are those 
from high performing teams 
another issue which made quite few sales teams unable meet sales target 
was related historical inventory issues especially southern and central china 
management indicated that few sizable special distributors that could purchase 
products more cheaply from hengan the past were located mainly southern and 
central china and that they were also the price disruptors the local channels 
making difficult for hengan control channel inventory the special distributorship 
was eliminated only the beginning there was still some legacy channel 
inventory issue hanging over certain new sales teams our channel checks also showed 
that hengan sales the south were the weakest across the regions management 
expects that this overhang will gradually fade away the affected local markets 
key findings from alphawise survey sanitary napkins 
alphawise survey methodology 
between july and september conducted survey total 
residents from cities tier cities tier cities and tier lower cities 
via telephone interviews broader consumption behavior the total 
respondents reside tier cities and the remaining tier lower 
cities subset female consumers participated the section related 
purchases and brand perception sanitary napkins the margin error based 
the total sample with confidence level and higher between subgroups 
strong positioning tier cities positive surprise our alphawise survey confirms 
that hengan space has very strong position tier cities and below with implied 
market share while hengan strength lower tier cities known think the 
result hengan leading position tier cities may counter consensus longeterm think hengan will the major beneficiary the consumption trade tier 
cities can leverage its extensive distribution network and strong product brand 
gain market share those currently fragmented markets 
from income level and age group perspective hengan implied market share based 
our survey strong across different segments

source morgan stanley research 
positive takeaways 
market share sanitary napkins strong with most distributors showing highsingle digit teens growth the distributor who saw sales decline for sanitary 
napkins commented that the entire offline market for leading brands his market 
under substantial pressure from commerce 
the major competitors sanitary napkins are either not doing well are facing 
challenges penetrating county level markets given that they business mainly 
with sizable retailers distributors their channel pricing generally not 
consistent and stable hengan 
tissue paper marketing positioning also good but some distributors are seeing 
hengan lose market share vinda growth tissue paper weaker than 
sanitary napkins 
risks and opportunities around amoeba organization 
the feedback about amoeba organization from distributors somewhat contradictory 
some team leaders are fully motivated capable making sound business plan 
drive sales growth via introducing new unde penetrated products they also spend 
wisely channel expenses nonetheless some sales leaders simply squeeze 
distributors margin cutting marketing subsidies and are not capable leading the 
distributors optimize their product portfolio improve penetration 
see few risks that hengan needs mitigate 
the right people amoeba decentralized model and sales leader fully 
empowered selection the right people critical 
short term behaviour ensure sales leader capability hengan sets the rules 
that sales team short its target for six months the sales leader can 
replaced under such pressure think there may pushback from sales 
leaders focus certain new products may take time develop core users 
coordination between sales teams and product teams support sales teams for 
strategic new products hengan product teams the company headquarters will 
allocate marketing budgets for local sales teams push the new products 
however think the success rate will really depend the partnership between 
the both parties 
greater sales volatility the amoeba organization has been running for less than 
year expect see greater sales volatility amid the adjustments 
the whole are still optimistic about hengan reforms despite the challenges 
and think the best solution for hengan better utilize its strength product 
brand and channel disagree with the view some investors that hengan adoption 
amoeba structure aimed simply cost savings good evidence this our 
view that hengan will spend big budget participate cctv national brand
