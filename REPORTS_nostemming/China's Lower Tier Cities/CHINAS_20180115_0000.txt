flexible hukou policy since which think indicates more room 
however the other half have grown faster pace the past few 
for consumption propensity rise small cities than large ones 
years and remain less penetrated than higher tier cities terms 
more migrant workers are likely choose live lower tiered

cities which offer them social fund benefits cheaper living costs thus 
raising consumption lower tiered cities and rapid development 
bigger population base believe population growth lower 
commerce should also make easier for those lower tier cities 
tier cities will hold better thanks more flexible hukou policy

which allows migrant workers residency rights city higher fer 
tier cities thus boosting consumption 
tility rates and cheaper living costs than higher tier cities the relatively stronger population growth lower tier cities will mean 
have seen housing destocking lower tier cities since late

stock preferences 
mgm china expect mgm cotai opening janwe think mgm wynn and galaxy will continue 
uary with hotel rooms existing rooms drive 
outperform sjm remains rated view 
ebitda growth for mgm china the highest our 
near term market share loss but see significant 
coverage other casino opening during the year fcfe yield for 
upside potential towards the second half when 
one the highest our coverage the stock per 
gets close cotai opening for sands expect ebitda 
formed well anticipation the january opening and thus 
growth underperform peers owing its size and 
could see some near term price consolidation while there are some 
limited dps growth for and 
uncertainties around table allocations and ramp expect ebitda 
growth drive outperformance for the year 
wynn macau think wynn palace not fully 
sands china the company owns close 
ramped yet after driving overall wynn macau ebitda growth 
hotel rooms representing market share hotel occu 
yoy further upside will come from increasing hotel 
pancy lower than peers and industry peak 
room comp ratio from increasing cash yield 
cycle which should allow sands china grow more than 
hotel rooms using ota online travel agents less building 
peers when the improved infrastructure brings more visitors 
the mass market database and ramping chairman club which 
macau also the company has the largest exposure the grind mass 
still underused and can better also believe the company will 
segment lower spending per capita thus think stands out 
sustain high dividend payout ratio around implying 
benefit the most when lower tier cities become wealthier driving 
dividend yield driven fcfe yield 
higher spending per capita expect the market reward sands 
for maintaining market share and raising dps marginally for 
galaxy are ahead consensus and 
for and ebitda galaxy owns about hotel rooms 
the second highest among peers after sands china the 
sjm while possible for sjm see the most 
pany will develop galaxy macau phase and the next few years 
upside based our fcfe forecast driven the highest fcfe 
with around new hotel rooms thus close doubling its cur 
yield among peers believe nearer term market 
rent capacity see further earnings upside the company can get 
share losses and the delay the opening lisboa palace will likely 
clearance for more gaming tables from the government for the new 
result share price underperformance the opening grand lisboa 
phases the company has the strongest balance sheet our cov 
palace tables and rooms will triple the company self
