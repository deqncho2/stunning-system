believe lower tier cities will become the key driver china 
private consumption fueling trillion market 
see opportunities for companies geared toward increasing

why focus lower tier cities now the popular perception 
more eager spend relatively affordable housing markets 
that large cities offer the most important consumer base but 
higher household saving rates easier hukou related social 
believe that lower tier cities are becoming the key driver china 
security access and rising penetration commerce could

boost household consumption ratios that supports 
account for two thirds incremental growth national private 
relatively faster consumption growth through

reached inflection point their population growth has been 
stronger following hukou reform also note economic integration 
and income convergence amid policymakers recent initiatives 
rebalance regional development gdp per capita lower tier cities 
reaching that tier cities decade ago which indicates 
accelerated transition toward service consumption 
bigger while migration tier cities has stalled recent

lower tier cities key driver toward 
trillion private consumption market 
our blue paper why are bullish china february 
argued that china transitions toward 
why lower tier cities have potential 
drive china consumption 
high income society its private consumption market can 
reach trillion gdp from 
investors believe tier cities have been better placed lead 
trillion currently gdp different from the 
china consumption for the following reasons 
popular perception that larger cities are better positioned 
lead china consumption growth believe that 
significantly higher per capita income while china national 
lower tier cities will bigger wealthier and more eager 
gdp per capita income still the middle high level 
spend taking the lead driving china private 
most tier cities have already passed the 
consumption growth the next years expect 
high income threshold and are close the level korea and 
lower tier cities account for roughly two thirds total 
taiwan exhibit 
incremental growth private consumption 
faster pace economic transition toward services 
meanwhile the consumption bundle lower tier cities 
international experience suggests that the share the 
likely shift toward services particularly travel gaming 
services sector the economy generally rises with income 
healthcare and household goods services 
levels indeed share services gdp has increased

however believe lower tier cities have more potential 
drive consumption while tier cities have made tremendous 
contributions china consumption growth and economic 
transition their growth potential has been weakening because they 
have passed the high income threshold and are approaching the 
technology frontier 
contrast developments over the past decade suggest stronger 
consumption potential lower tier cities the form higher 
population growth stronger catch effect income growth 
improved infrastructure and public resources better housing 
affordability ratios and higher household saving rates 
these give confidence that lower tier cities will become 
bigger wealthier and more eager spend and will lead china 
consumption growth the next years 
evidence 
converging population growth between higher and lower tier 
cities usual residence the annual average population growth 
tier cities has decelerated and 
compared and particular population 
growth shanghai declined for the first time contrast 
growth lower tier cities has held well 
compared exhibit exhibit the growth 
convergence was more obvious for urban population hukou 
registration the urban population growth decelerated from 
and and tier cities 
while accelerating from 
lower tier cities exhibit 
owing relatively higher fertility rate the natural population 
growth excluding net population inflows was close 
lower tier cities recent years compared and tier 
bigger population base 
thesis 
the urban population lower tier cities today already and 
that tier and tier cities although the weakening demographic 
trend china will mean generally slower population growth across 
all tiers cities believe population growth lower tier cities will 
hold better thanks more flexible hukou policy higher fertility 
rates and more acceptable living costs the relatively stronger 
population growth lower tier cities will mean bigger consumer 
base 
and tier cities respectively exhibit our view this reflects 
higher fertility rates lower tier cities function relatively 
lower living costs compared larger cities 
and more favorable hukou policy lower tier cities the state 
council kicked off new round reform household registration 
july with instructions relax household registration 
lower tier cities and phase out urban rural division according the 
ndrc september provisional level regions issued reform 
schemes that consolidate rural urban identity and corresponding 
welfare programs meanwhile the state council issued plan 
december pledging complete hukou registration for 
urban usual residence expect urban population 
growth lower tier cities will annually 
higher than tier cities and tier cities based 
estimate expect population will move 
from rural areas urban areas the next years within 
which will relocate lower tier cities 
urban hukou registration the growth divergence can 
more significant annually for lower tier cities 
tier cities and tier cities 
million additional migrant workers the other hand 
restrictions hukou registration have remained tight big cities 
with various requirements permanent job positions and minimum 
years pension contribution residence 
our view the continued hukou reform lower tier cities will 
help encourage inward migration 
rural residents now have more freedom settle down 
most lower tier cities and find job 
policymakers have relaxed the hukou restrictions most 
the new policies can attract more migrant workers move 
smaller cities while maintaining strict control large cities 
from top tier lower tier cities particularly given the 
expect the urbanization ratio hukou registration could 
increasing living costs and continued hukou restrictions big 
rise from currently around 
cities 
population can gain hukou status toward within which 
expect will lower tier cities 
meanwhile higher hukou coverage means easier access social 
security systems such pension health care and education 
lower tier cities which may reduce the need for precautionary 
savings and encourage household consumption

wealthier households

international experience suggests income convergence among 
cagr 
regions with different income levels over time

similarly the the gdp per capita the five poorest

convergence occurred because these regions share similar

technology flows pursuing higher marginal returns less developed
