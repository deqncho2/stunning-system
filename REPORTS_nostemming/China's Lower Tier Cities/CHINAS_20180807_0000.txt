based the rise china lower tier cities identify major trends with significant implications for the future development china transportation industry 
less cyclical travel patterns 
think this will mainly led further declines the number 
looking ahead the trend continues expect passenger traffic 
china migrant workers who used stay working large cities far 
could less cyclical nature led lower spikes during the cny 
away from their hometowns for better salaries the long distance 
period but more frequent travel during the non peak seasons stimu 
journeys meant that these migrant works traveled back their 
lated travel among city clusters 
hometowns only once twice year trains buses motorcycles such journeys were concentrated mostly during chinese 
average travel distance stage length may shrink more frequent 
new year period passenger traffic surged record million 
intercity trips will outgrow long distance domestic travel passenger 
exhibit creating probably the largest human migrations 
mix likely improve with lower proportion low income 
earth 
workers than previously the proportion business leisure travelers may increase paves the way for better service quality but 
however this trend may diminish future income levels increase 
higher fare levels 
with better living standards lower tier cities adjacent their 
hometowns the other hand sustained cost pressures living 
finally the traffic becomes less cyclical believe will help 
and housing large cities are making the jobs less attractive 
improve overall capacity efficiency with smoother traffic flows and 
higher seat utilization rates
