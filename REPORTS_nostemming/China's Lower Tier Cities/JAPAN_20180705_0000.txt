increases are rather manageable and that unicharm can still enjoy 
better margins especially from the chinese diaper business thus

may not necessarily early making more bullish call further

our estimate generally line with consensus expecta

our new price target value the stock

reflected the slowdown the company earnings growth

the company cagr sales cagr for the next

able top line growth which key for whether the market 
will assign forward multiple not therefore 
the company strong sales growth were short lived 
there would downside risk our target valuation are 
looking for and sales growth for and 
respectively 
cost inflation our gross margin assumption our base case 
reflects increase tissue wood pulp prices and mid 
high single digits increase petrochemicals our bear case 
assume higher costs for these two raw materials which 
account for more than total cogs 
competition some margin erosion because competition 
from online further intensifies sanitary napkins and tissues 
weishang brands wechat sold via multilayer structure becomes real threat the leading players the sanitary napkins category 
execution risks understand that all business reforms 
involve execution risks not factor many them into 
our base case forecast because management has been conducting the reform process gradually and carefully however 
our bear case consider some short term disruption 
the business owing the reforms 
valuation the market focused only short term results 
and unwilling pay for premium valuation despite the 
solid track record 
kao merries expected remain key 
favorite brand chinese consumer 
overview kao business china estimate that 
kao sales china account for total sales and 
potentially slightly higher percentage china 
while cosmetics another category that showing strong 
growth today the majority the sales today still come 
from baby diapers 
think that room remains for kao gain market share based 
the company product quality and potential for regional expansion 
well greater commerce ratio penetration the market 
also believe that the growth this category could further help 
improving margins the chinese business given that feminine care 
gross margins are usually higher than those baby diapers our 
model expect kao feminine care sales china grow 
merries still top brand baby diapers kao has been key benefi 
and significantly outpacing the 
ciary the shift consumer preference imported and premium 
market growth low single digits 
diapers sales the merries brand sales have grown almost threefold the five years between and our estimate driven 
note however that the size the feminine care business china 
mostly the robust demand growth china kmb similar bene 
still small only chinese sales our estimate this 
ficiary appears have started lose market share 
pares plus for baby diapers thus the category does not 
recently but our understanding that kao has successfully main 
have meaningful impact kao earnings from china also 
tained its market share retail remaining the top brand 
according industry competitors the commerce channel 
the market the company appears also increasing the propor 
believed account only for the market today this 
tion pull diaper exports appropriately meeting the evolving 
unless the channel mix shifts meaningfully kao with limited 
needs the consumer today 
regional off line retail coverage could struggle increase its presence the total feminine care market 
our view merries has built position the brand for mothers 
purchase something that will not fade easily expect kao main 
why remain bullish kao continue believe the fol 
tain market share over the next few years however kao may not 
lowing three earnings growth drivers are intact 
able gain further market share meaningfully competitors such 
unicharm and intensify their promotional activities the 
market accordingly forecast kao baby diaper sales growth 
china and slightly outpacing 
the market growth sales growth still materially higher than the market growth because expect the market 
baby diaper sales growth potential coupled with outlook for 
improved margin levels 
solid fabric home care business japan top share high 
margins and 
growing cosmetics sales china 
preference for made japan diapers will continue supporting the 
demand growth for kao products above market levels 
also note that particularly for this year kao less vulnerable 
raw materials cost increase because palm kernel oil based materials 
sanitary napkins could the next growth driver but would 
are becoming significantly cheaper enabling the company offset 
probably take time much the growth sanitary products 
any cost increases related pulp and crude oil price increases 
china has depended baby diapers but sanitary napkins are 
another category that has shown steady growth over the last five 
addition highlight that kao has the best shareholder return 
years with potential for further growth the future believe the 
policy fcf return acquisitions the japanese hpc 
heightened awareness the kao corporate brand has helped cap 
industry 
turing new customer base for the laurier brand and though kao 
share the total market remains low only low single digits 
finally terms valuation current looks relatively 
petitor acknowledges that the market share high lim 
undervalued its peers within our hpc industry coverage universe 
ited the commerce channel not too far from the upper teens 
maintain our rating kao partly reflection the stock 
levels for hengan and unicharm 
being inexpensive levels relative its somewhat overheated cosmetics toiletries peers
