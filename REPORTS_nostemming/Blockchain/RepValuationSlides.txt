how play the global banking space our portfolio skewed towards the where our strategists and are more 
constructive conversely hunker down asia where slowing growth and bad debt formation will pose challenges 
fed lift off steeper yield curves are positive for long term profitability but can painful short term for book values 
believe reflation plays better the this year than europe and japan strong secular growth market share gains and 
improving consumer also likely drive outperformance 
commodity driven underperformance our view the market still not bearish enough the repercussions for 
bank revenues and bad debt from the impact china slowdown asia and brazil are also cautious midcap 
banks with sizable energy exposure given the decline the price oil 
policy divergence growing disparity among regional economic outlooks evident asset quality trends are seeing 
signs pick asia latam russia but easing europe and india expansion the ecb risks flipping the effect 
from positive negative for many eurozone banks 
risk profile transformations alongside better visibility around balance sheet rehabilitation easing regulatory 
litigation burdens and reflation have squeezed risk perceptions especially europe 
return dividends are the acid test for balance sheet repair and regulatory conformity see rating potential for

top stock picks 
japanese banks should remain relatively resilient 
thanks the steady recovery the domestic economy 
gains accelerated sales cross held shares will 
offset flat slight decline nii and decline reserve 
write back given relatively healthy capital conditions 
expect banks more proactive terms 
capital return with clarity the regulations raised into 
insurance and consumer finance groups will 
generate higher delta terms earnings growth 
than banks but also see reasonable upside 
potential for banks given low valuations 
mizuho believe that the market has not given full credit 
its plan sell down the equity portfolio more aggressively than 
peers consensus now low eps but 
think the consensus could start rising thereby making 
consensus look lower into end period which march 
this year also think the bigger capital gains the sale 
the equity portfolio will lead better capital return policy 
some gains will returned shareholders 
korea 
korean banks have been underperformers the past 
couple years and heading into stick with 
our preference for non life insurers over the banks 
within the korean financials space the regulatory 
situation looks more favorable and new business 
growth has more upside 
sfg the main rating factor for korean banks should 
effective capital management and believe sfg should 
the vanguard the minimum ratio level needs and sfg group basis already 
above this expect sfg able increase its payout 
ratio from for around and 
increase the payout ratio years come 
malaysia 
malaysian banking likely remain sluggish with 
forecast improvement yoy gdp growth 
the margin front competition and slower loan growth 
have meant downward repricing pressure asset 
yields lack deposit growth exacerbated the 
compression nim way higher funding costs 
capital market activities have also slowed tandem 
with recent quarterly declines attributed both 
economic and political uncertainty malaysia 
rhbc expect slower revenue growth and higher credit 
charges drive flat down roes for the industry between

costs drive roe improvement its ongoing rights issue and

expectation for underlying loan growth

mention loans and npls this segment since 
while gross sme npls are still increasing special

kbank our view kbank has the best quality franchise 
thailand especially the higher return msme sector 
currently its exposures here are causing some pain terms 
credit charges but see this cyclical rather than 
structural issue and means that current valuations are 
attractive our view note that our estimates for kbank 
assume provision against currently performing loans 
their financial assistance scheme believe that kbank has 
also invested more heavily than peers crm systems and 
has therefore been able defend fee income better our 
view this investment positions kbank well for the future 
ocbc like ocbc relative peers for its life assurance 
exposure which believe should make relatively more 
defensive rising rate environment ocbc generates 
its value from its holding great eastern currently 
believe this valued just below but see scope for 
this rate line with other asian life assurers and our 
base case value life assurance companies tend 
outperform banks rising rate environment addition 
note that relative its history ocbc trades lower multiples 
than peers believe that this partly result its higher
