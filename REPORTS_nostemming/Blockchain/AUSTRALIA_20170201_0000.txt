life margins and experience outlook 
should see less volatility life experience albeit margins and returns are much lower industry profit 
margins exhibit highlight continuing challenges and volatility within income protection both retail and 
group schemes but relatively attractive returns lump sum traditional life insurance 
rolling out new claims processes remedy elevated claims proving difficult execute demanding different 
skill set and higher emotional intelligence claims managers transition people back work drive better 
claims outcomes the antiquated product design longer fits the behavioral shifts today society and the 
distribution model based bygone era predating super when whole life policies dominated the market 
the case amp despite efforts reprice refine the product and attack claims and lapse experience driving 
change long tail business where the profits mostly reside the force book has proven more challenging 
than expected 
meanwhile new entrants like nippon acquired mlc are seeking commutate transition the inforce book 
policyholders more flexible lifetime benefit design product structure capture value from directing 
premiums long term care and lifetime annuities within the existing product construct recent issues cba 
comminsure regarding the treatment customers and payment claims have heightened regulatory scrutiny 
across the industry further best interests open architecture and the growing presence japanese life insurers 
the australian market nippon dai ichi sony life accepting lower return capital means the issues life 
are structurally challenged that being said margins have been rebased and larger players amp cba have 
put their retail income protection books into loss recognition and taken substantial write downs the 
wealth revenue margin compression 
transition year for mysuper the deadline for disengaged customers move into the newly legislated 
lower fee mysuper products july but margin headwinds look manageable thereafter fee pressure 
should normalise driven competitive tension from planners seeking lower cost solution under 
customer best interest tests greater choice via open architecture platforms and technology advancements 
retail platforms planners migrating core satellite portfolio constructs drive higher after fee returns via 
greater use smart beta passive allocations the core also putting pressure fee revenues 
workplace super pricing across retail and industry funds converging with the latter coming under pressure 
they develop more contemporary offerings service retirees and higher balance customers median mysuper 
prices for retail and industry funds are broadly line too exhibit however the participation and account size 
varies between the two segments this largely due many industry funds transitioning entirely mysuper 
compliant funds while for retail funds the default funds transitioning mysuper are generally lower balance 
accounts residing within their corporate super business according apra retail fund member accounts 
are now captured within mysuper retail fum industry funds member accounts fum 
the retail mysuper members average account balance just industry funds with the deadline 
for transition approaching july fee compression should normalize traditional competitive forces that 
being said with average account size the fixed monthly admin fee bps provides margin support for 
example per week equates fee with amp backbook default funds now 
total wealth fum fee headwinds seem manageable 
investor flows confidence where the money 
company performance being influenced distribution mix and capabilities planners workplace super 
catchments demographics and product mix super pension managed account capabilities and solutions 
service the smsf sector 
regulatory uncertainty the tax treatment super and contribution caps has also hindered flows with this 
now resolved flows should improve further from july the government will lower the annual non 
concessional contributions cap but manage the transition individuals under age will eligible 
bring forward the current arrangements allowing them make years non concessional contributions 
which this should provide one off boost for the sector 
the wall cash remains record highs exhibit despite falling yields with growing preference 
among retail investors pay down debt alongside reducing appetite for property investment exhibit that 
being said the preference for shares and super remains stable albeit relatively subdued levels since the global 
financial crisis 
the structural attractiveness and long term growth the segment remains attractive with contributions over the 
working lives australians legislated increase from with current total assets 
deloitte actuaries forecast the superannuation pool double the next years and reach 
exhibit with super assets almost doubling from current annual gross domestic product 
more than the next years 
while the system long way from maturity the growth trajectory varies across segments retail industry 
funds smsf and business mix member demographics accumulations retirement 
for example the industry fund age profile and greater catchment new entrants the workforce via industrial 
awards means its strength accumulation with less strain from retirement outflows the apra stats show 
industry fund members are for retail funds conversely members aged 
over just for industry funds for retail funds this dynamic driving higher relative asset 
growth within industry funds the retail segment exhibit further the reduced liquidity strain for industry 
funds has driven higher allocations unlisted assets property and infrastructure for retail exhibit 
supporting relative outperformance there risk this trade unwinds bond proxies fall value rising 
interest rate cycle driving outperformance among the retail segment 
looking deeper the flows industry funds retail funds despite robust contributions and 
respectively pension payments are dramatically lower the retail segment 
notwithstanding this both sectors are also suffering from net rollovers and respectively 
self managed super funds which remains attractive option for many retirees albeit growth this segment 
abating 
looking deeper into the retail segment the mix accumulation and pension driving much different growth 
profiles net flows one extreme colonial cba and ioof who are overweight retirees meaning they have 
run hard stand still with supportive investment markets critical growth meanwhile amp westpac 
and mlc nab are more favorably positioned exhibit 
while smsf outflows are headwind the growth retail funds amp has the market leading smsf 
administration footprint execution key capturing outflows onto the amp smsf platform another factor

robo advice opportunity seized incumbents 
expect most wealth managers have developed clearer path rolling out robo advice solutions 
fintech has reduced the cost providing basic investment services the mass consumer the combination 
etfs algorithms and intuitive user interfaces together now make profitable offer investors with 
semi customized investment portfolios technology the enabler lowering break evens expand markets and 
increase engagement 
expect incumbents win the larger addressable market that fintechs are seeking create leveraging 
their existing network the key advantage incumbents over fintech their lower customer acquisition costs 
this evident the where established platforms like schwab and vanguard have shown the power 
strong brand attracting flows the first year they offered robo services dwarfing the pure play 
robos like betterment and wealthfront 
the super savings pool the honey pot attracting start robo advisers and innovation 
players seeking protect incumbency expand the market improve the economics and reduce the compliance risk 
around advice with around australians having some form relationship with financial advisor robo 
platforms provide large untapped market opportunity while there direct client untapped opportunity 
providing digital tools and robo advice capabilities help deliver more strategic advice service more clients and 
lower the cost advice also beneficial planners recent study investment trends financial 
advisers july shows planers believe robo advice not threat the industry 
thus far most incumbents have been quietly exploring the potential opportunity fully automated robo advice 
platforms mlc the face existing self directed and guided advice tool and calculators already provided 
others like macquarie owners advisory are more actively seeking create opportunity via low cost robo 
platform within the self directed discretionary savings segment amp more actively focused digital advice 
solutions for financial planners with direct robo next the agenda rest industry fund has partnered with 
acorn roll out savings alternative 
meanwhile the large pension administration providers servicing the incumbents such link and mercer have 
done deals with more developed robo platforms players ignition wealth link and decimal mercer both ignition 
wealth and decimal are vying become the institutional grade oracle sap providers robo advice cloud 
based platform solutions the market offer where revenues are based licensing and user access 
the etf players blackrock vanguard and beta shares are exploring robo advice leveraging their brand and scale 
deliver multi asset etf solutions both direct consumers and via financial adviser networks seeking lower cost 
alternatives with appeal broader market 
does regulatory scrutiny remain elevated 
the wake negative industry publicity the payment life insurance claims and the major banks extracting 
fees customers not receiving advice regulatory scrutiny likely remains elevated view 
this would not surprised see asic seek greater penalty fees for wrong doing where the penalty 
multiples the benefit obtained focus likely continues default mysuper accounts with the transition 
deadline approaching july advice opt customer best interests life claims and pension arbitrage longer 
dated annuities the risk from best interests greater dilution from more choice open architecture and 
increasing focus fees the positive the greater certainty the tax treatment super and contribution 
concessions should help flows recover 
how big role for annuities 
the growth the post retirement sector and longevity income streams demands growing role for annuities 
however with the regulation likely demanding members opt deferred lifetime comprehensive income 
products for retirement its unclear whether there will desire further lock portion superannuation 
savings say the sweet spot for annuities remains the segment the market that might able fund 
their retirement those with enough generally live off the asset base and those without enough are better off 
annuity with the baby boomers only being within the super system for part their working lives the mean 
super balance pre retirees just source asfa such most australians don have 
enough fund comfortable retirement and until the super system mature people retire with years 
accumulated savings the growth annuities risks disappointing some investors see challenger will the growth 
disappoint 
managed accounts coming age 
with greater appeal for both clients and financial advisers managed accounts platforms are growing faster and 
taking share particularly from wrap platforms research house investment trends platform benchmarking 
report shows dramatic growth the number planners using managed account platforms their primary 
platform for new inflows rising from exhibit there risk that new customers 
and new inflows are directed managed accounts while industry net flows the majors capture flows from 
existing customers our view the wrap platforms are greater risk funds transition managed accounts 
the traditional super master trusts are stickier nature with transition crystalising capital gains 
our report managed accounts evolution revolution forecasts growth cagr versus the overall 
platform market mid high single digits while our forecast fum insignificant 
the context superannuation market share net flows and market growth this likely more 
substantial 
core satellite and the rise passive 
australia passive allocation has doubled since over source rainmaker but this remains 
below the and driven the need protect margins the core satellite approach 
progressively being adopted both planners and super funds deliver clients better after fee returns this 
achieved seeking split alpha and beta with the core being invested low tracking error quant strategies 
smart beta offerings complemented more directive alpha benchmark unaware funds driving forces the shift 
include asset owners consolidating and internalising asset management shift low cost mysuper and 
ongoing fee pressure financial planners and dealer groups reconfiguring their business models capture more 
value self directed investors seeking out simpler lower cost solutions and the proliferation etfs and 
emergence etmfs providing opportunity package simple tailored multi asset solutions this

topical issues general insurance 
where are the pricing cycle 
top line growth globally remains under pressure across most regions and lines business albeit the rate 
deterioration seems stabilising while there are pockets showing signs improvement this largely 
address underperformance given the continuing abundance capital and industry dynamics the prolonged soft 
cycle likely remains 
according marsh global primary rates remain around pcp exhibit lloyd london 
premium rate indices remains relatively soft though speciality lines have slightly positive trajectory exhibit 
aon benfield market analysis suggests global primary insurer and reinsurer capital decade highs primary 
exhibit reinsurer exhibit while the frequency cats globally elevated events the 
historical average global insured losses was below the average 
exhibit and exhibit 
global cat bond issuance alternative capital looks have peaked exhibit though the total cat 
bonds outstanding remains elevated while this likely continues long term source capital for 
the sector issuance will come under pressure bond markets sell off and yields other asset classes improve supportive for the insurance pricing cycle 
the major global reinsurance broker january renewal reports guy carpenter jlt and willis suggest 
the rate line down despite underlying roes across the reinsurance market being under pressure excess reserves and relatively benign cats means reported roe remain robust willis reports australian 
property cat reinsurance rates loss were down january with casualty lines reinsurance 
loss down exhibit exhibit 
market scout premium surveys suggest overall commercial lines recovering from lows jan driven 
professional liability and fiduciary and liability lines ciab broker surveys suggest general liability and 
commercial property lines remain soft with commercial auto delivering positive rates response 
recent adverse claims development tower commercial rate data suggest the overall commercial market flat 
albeit trending down recent years see exhibit exhibit 
premium growth australia has been progressively improving during helped the rebound commercial 
lines late exhibit strength personal lines gwp has been largely driven pricing ctp and 
stronger volumes home and motor 
the new premium index shows australia home new business pricing holding flat exhibit with the bid 
for new motor business exhibit the more rational behaviour motor lines reflects the gradual 
deterioration industry profitability with the cor hovering around despite the growth premiums 
premium per policy home and motor were marginally negative the september quarter with ctp 
response poor underwriting performance nsw 
premium growth commercial lines encouraging with premium per policy across commercial motor and 
property improving however this necessary with industry cors these segments market commentary 
from australian brokers has been more positive sme lines which bodes well for iag qbe and sun within this 
segment within mid market segments the market continues difficult while insurers are shedding risky 
business industry discussions suggest this being replaced with equally tough accounts meaning real 
improvement 
the recent quake losses provides timely reminder that pricing discipline needs 
sustained this follows months where rate pressure has been increasing 
where are the earnings cycle 
growth net earned premiums tough rate reductions rate reductions are cycling through the more 
recent improving pricing discipline australian insurers troubled lines business helping alleviate earned 
headwinds into 
earnings now seem bottoming with the rolling month nep growth pcp for australia 
direct insurers the september quarter supporting this view the sharp turn nep growth the 
september quarter the strongest have seen for years exhibit largely driven price action 
nsw ctp commercial motor and commercial property however view this necessary support the 
earnings outlook while the more rational pricing behaviour pleasing the industry remains long way from the 
start traditional hardening cycle necessary support meaningful upgrade cycle 
australian insurers have been largely seeking insulate margin headwinds through better supply chain 
efficiencies expense savings synergies and claims management data analytics claims handling while 
reducing reinsurance costs have helped absorb some the net earned headwinds the benefits have been mostly 
reinvested strengthening programs reduce earnings volatility with these initiatives largely exhausted more 
recently navigating margin pressures has been harder commercial lines insurers seek shed unprofitable 
business they are generally replacing volume with equally challenging accounts while competitively pricing 
retain good business this has seen attritional loss creep 
however are now seeing more progressive action initially personal lines although this now abating and 
more recently nsw ctp sme and short tail commercial lines mid market address claims inflation and mispricing deliver targeted cross cycle returns deductibles and terms have been tightening with modest price 
action collectively the rate line for short tail commercial lines seems with nsw ctp 
average 
claims inflation outlook 
longer tail lines wages and economic inflation remain benign which bodes well for prior year profits however 
the frequency small claims and rising cost legal representation has been troubling current accident year 
profitability nsw ctp for the latter regulators are seeking reduce legal representation and introduce risk 
equalisation scheme where profits are distributed evenly among participants see below the insurance council 
australia claims statistics suggest home contents inflation issues are subsiding but motor inflation 
remains elevated see exhibit 
while australian inflation outlooks remains subdued and challenges from the construction boom and falling 
are subsiding global reflation remains area interest for qbe highlight two potential issues here 
sustained soft cycle higher yields are reinvested into lower premiums higher underwriting risk higher 
investment risk and global reflation reduces capacity for reserve releases underpinning performance recent 
years with insurers mis pricing risk during the transition pricing lags the rise insured losses 
are reserves adequate and sustainable 
analysis reserving tables suggests there are issues across iag sun and qbe see exhibit exhibit 
though qbe accident year and iag adverse losses are visible the tables underlying margins for 
sun iag and qbe assume continuing reserve releases and respectively 
the reflation trade presents some risk qbe and continue watch the performance its european 
business key driver group reserves closely the positive side qbe claims its long run assumptions 
business written remain unchanged and the growing long tail speciality book loss assumptions are similarly 
conservatively set 
iag continues maintain long run assumptions despite the benign wages and inflation environment australia 
the other hand sun has been more aggressively releasing reserves and weakening assumptions with reserving 
per policy falling see not much left reserve sustaining elevated reserve releases looks more challenging for 
sun though the benign inflation and soft wages growth environment continues the likelihood adverse 
development appears low 
longer run nsw ctp reforms could see the reserve releases fall creating headwinds for long run 
underlying margins and potentially inflating terminal values 
have investment returns bottomed 
the outlook for running yields improving with global growth improving and reflation emerging that being said 
with iag and sun asset duration matched with liabilities years will take time for tailwinds emerge 
the falling yields over recent years are yet fully roll through the portfolio the market risks being too 
bullish near term upside qbe who runs deliberate mis match and asset duration years most 
leveraged the recovery global yields see qbe macro swing micro ping see exhibits exhibit 
what will ctp reforms means for iag sun and qbe 
proposed nsw ctp reform potentially delivers lower premium pool lower targeted returns capital 
relief and lower normalized reserve releases underlying margins but the transition could beneficial 
margins see nsw ctp the firing line 
government reforms nsw ctp likely limit claims inflation introducing defined claims benefits reduce legal 
representation the greater certainty outcomes should see reserves fall providing capital tailwind however 
reforms also target insurance margin avg since underpinned loss sharing scheme 
removing opportunity for outperformance among peers targeted margins likely suffer with normalised reserve 
releases also falling medium term with the stated goal drive average premium down topline 
headwinds likely emerge given average pricing currently despite nsw current year losses reserve 
releases helped ctp nsw qld act deliver margins 
consolidation across global market 
while slowing from peak activity likely continue remain feature the global market 
with the rate decline premium rates globally slowing and reflation global growth and yields showing 
signs improving global players seeking deploy excess capital and increase leverage the cycle will likely 
continue see attractive however valuations seem less compelling with insurers rating and the 
sector trading above book value for global comps see global insurance monthly but the steady population 
growth economic stability and stable regulatory regime make australia relatively attractive than most developed 
emerging markets recent market speculation has highlighted possible corporate interest qbe see allianz 
targets australia qbe with informal bid reuters jan 
insurtech become mainstream

remain relevant digital world iag strategy and business model seems them positioning navigate the 
minefield opportunity see strategy day that confidence continue monitor this space closely with

how play rising yields generally financials are beneficiaries rising yields returns asset portfolios 
improve however believe some investors have paid insufficient attention the sustainability sources 
funds that certain companies deploy earn investment income for example cpu benefits from lift 
annualized eps from lift the fed funds rate rate hikes however number its key sources 
funds are risk cyclical and structural decline org activity listed companies are cpu largest single 
source client funds yet volumes are trending downwards from record levels the within the core 
registry business shareholders record are declining the carry trade pinned the business 
dividend payments drips capital raisings shrinking similar rate state governments are escheating 
abandoned property uncashed dividend cheques while new payment platforms could reduce the carry 
duration automated clearing house new payments platform faster payments service qbe remains 
our preferred play rising yields 
will bounce back exhibit highlights that has historically cycled waves the 
wave was fuelled the rise lbos and globalization cross border and was ended the credit crisis the 
current wave which began has been fuelled record low interest rates factors that could drive 
continued reduction activity include rising borrowing costs higher yields and potentially elimination 
corporate interest deductibility and stronger corporate earnings growth diverting use excess cash into organic 
capex away from acquisitions the other hand was soft year for european corporate activity and 
has shown early signs rising corporate confidence 
there arms race brewing the australian securities value chain asx seeking upgrade its central 
securities depository chess onto distributed ledger platform meanwhile cpu has partnered with setl 
establish securities ownership registers using blockchain this has created uncertainty among investors regarding 
where each intermediary lies the value chain and how the market will evolve think upgrade chess via blockchain otherwise could support soft push asx into the registry issuer services function 
meanwhile the cpu setl project appears signal possible expansion the settlement depository function 
successful implementation blockchain asx could see australia move more efficient model where 
registry issuer services are provided the csd low cost similar many offshore markets the middle
