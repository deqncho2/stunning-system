changing regulation has caused cryptocurrency exchanges reconsider which country 
they are located april when ran our analysis the largest cryptocurrency 
volumes were traded via one exchange called binance which had announced that will 
move operations from hong kong malta from around other exchanges 
analysed the next favoured locations are south korea belize and seychelles exhibit 
the united kingdom ranked particularly highly the number exchanges located 
there but only saw trading volume 
defined but also attractive regulation makes exchange decide choose one country 
over another set laws for companies follow when handling digital tokens 
customer assets aml policies taxes etc regulatory certainty part the 
attractiveness for the companies they can plan for the future they know what 
expect low taxes are benefit 
the country where bitcoin traded unknown but the fiat currency that exchanged 
for bitcoin can used proxy the major trading currency exchanges has changed 
over time exhibit exhibit shows that most recently most trading still versus the 
japanese yen but crypto token usd tether usdt still taking increasing 
share volumes that has occurred because the biggest exchanges only allow trading 
between cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency prices have been falling correlations 
between coins stayed high traders looked for way come out the market with 
usdt being relatively stable around usd providing that avenue cryptocurrencies 
make about all trading bitcoin while fiat currencies around

global cryptocurrencies regulation 
james faucette 
the degree regulation varies widely governments have taken multiple approaches 
regulating cryptocurrencies some jurisdictions have kept the space less regulated 
part attract crypto investment malta and others are using part push 
for improved efficiency for their financial services industries others countries like the 
have wide range regulatory reviews underway regarding cryptocurrencies the 
financial regulators have their own unique and evolving views crypto for 
example the irs opinion that cryptocurrencies are assets and therefore investors 
need disclose gains for short and long term capital gains taxes the sec recently 
stated that initial coin offerings icos can construed securities and can subject 
securities law several federal reserve governors have highlighted that 
cryptocurrency not legal tender reviews are ongoing and should expect the 
regulatory regime continue firm 
exhibit degrees regulation icos and cryptocurrencies globally 
note green area represents country where government has provided limited guidance regulation red area indicates that country has prohibited 
cryptocurrencies some capacity yellow indicates progressing toward greater regulation this intended offer visual representation varying 
levels regulation point time and may not accurately reflect more recent developments source business insider morgan stanley research 
meanwhile large sums money raised from icos are funding lobbying efforts 
associations are engaging with investors venture capital firms who have invested 
heavily icos and cryptocurrency technology push pro cryptocurrency legislation 
coinbase the largest based cryptocurrency exchange platform recently formed 
pac political action committee the and fidelity lobbying behalf bitcoin 
and other digital assets according the fec and politico associations like access 
singapore and bitcoin association switzerland are also said lobbying and 
educating interested parties expect lobbying increase countries that are moving 
toward stricter regulations given the large amounts capital stake 
significant investor losses may lead regulation icos have raised over capital 
ytd nearly much the total for however highlighted our note 
update bitcoin cryptocurrencies and blockchain potential icos failed 
before after their icos much higher failure rate startups their first year reports 
fraudulent icos have also surfaced with the wsj reporting that some active icos 
currently raising over have missing fake executive teams and are using plagiarized 
investment documents cryptocurrency exchange hacks have also hurt investors with 
coin losses resulting from just hacks exhibit earlier this year the 
south korean government inspected cryptocurrency exchanges and found that 
firm met all inspection standards according the wsj meaningful losses with 
recourse may spur tighter regulation increases believe cryptocurrency 
transactions will migrate less regulated jurisdictions example when china 
increased its restriction bitcoin mining and then banned trading saw

more consumers get involved time incorporate the cryptocurrency ecosystem into 
the rest the financial system applying the same regulatory approach and the same 
rigorous standards mar 
suggested could more efficient prohibit banks and other financial institutions from 
holding and selling cryptocurrencies than directly regulate crypto according mar

assets manipulated the market that technical breakdowns the exchanges platforms 
had caused them significant losses several complaints against ico issuers alleged unlicensed

regulatory landscape the 
betsy graseck 
different agencies different jurisdictions different rules the fragmentation the 
financial regulatory system has led patchwork crypto regulations making 
tougher for market participants navigate federal agencies are currently leading the 
efforts our view the securities and exchange commission sec has been focused 
the ico market looking for any potential fraud other misconduct the commodity 
futures trading commission cftc has oversight the crypto futures market 
meanwhile the financial crimes enforcement network fincen has said that any 
businesses exchanging virtual currencies are money transmitters meaning that they 
have register with fincen and are subject aml bsa compliance while the three 
agencies focus different aspects crypto they shared the same goal providing 
more investor protection particular for retail investors 
what does the sec care about icos the sec has said that certain ico tokens are 
securities and therefore fall under its jurisdiction whether not token deemed 
security depends the specific facts and circumstances the offerings determined 
the howey test those that are securities will need registered with the sec 
unless exempted the sec also looking apply securities law exchanges and 
digital asset storage companies that deal with securities token ytd the sec has 
brought enforcement actions against icos that allegedly violated federal securities 
law note that the sec has previously said that bitcoin and ethereum are not considered 
securities 
another area that has been gaining attention crypto etfs the sec has not date 
approved for listing and trading any etfs holding cryptocurrencies other related 
assets the sec has recently rejected second attempt cameron and tyler 
winklevoss founders crypto exchange gemini list the first crypto etf 
regulated exchange citing issues with high volatility and funds liquidity the market 
now watching for the sec decision whether approve for listing the vaneck solidx 
bitcoin etf proposal the sec has set deadline for september make decision 
crypto derivatives fall under the purview the cftc the cftc has designated crypto 
commodity giving oversight the crypto derivatives markets late the 
cftc has allowed the cboe and cme launch bitcoin futures products their 
exchanges the cftc believes that the bitcoin futures markets will provide them with 
greater visibility into the underlying spot markets that they would not otherwise have 
worth highlighting that the two bitcoin futures products are cash settled contracts 
which means that buyers not have hold bitcoin itself additionally clearing 
members have the ability impose trading exposure limits their clients well 
increase margin requirements 
cryptocurrencies are assets for federal tax purposes per the irs this means that 
crypto subject capital gain taxes just like stocks bonds other investment 
properties further the irs has recently launched the joint chiefs global tax 
enforcement with four other countries namely australia canada the netherlands 
and the investigate cryptocurrency crimes like tax fraud and money laundering 
what about the fed former fed chair janet yellen has called crypto highly 
speculative asset that doesn constitute legal tender while the fed does not have 
direct jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies responsible for ensuring that the banking 
organizations under its supervision are appropriately managing their risk exposure 
crypto market participants 
building more coordinated regulatory response crypto the financial stability 
oversight council fsoc has formed cryptocurrency working group comprising the 
sec cftc the fed and the fincen further the sec and cftc have issued 
memorandum understanding june ensure continued coordination and 
information sharing between the two agencies particular cryptocurrencies 
think that more concerted effort regulate crypto will lead more rule clarity and 
less duplications positive for the development crypto markets the long run
