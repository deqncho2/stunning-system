new application and obstacle 
relative success cryptocurrencies shows the path forward and the issues steer clear 
for blockchain freight transportation fact number transportation industry participants from walmart maersk have already gone live with blockchain their supply chains 
the development common technology and implementation standards currently spearheaded organizations like bita may long way toward smoothing the path implementation 
may early days yet but the ultimate stock implications may already coming into 
focus blockchain can successful quick smooth transparent and secure execution 
supply chains should eliminate the need for middle men the process between the original 
shipper and the end customer the first leg participants closest the threat are likely 
asset light like chrw echo and others who provide shipper carrier matching services 
addition documentation and other process support this could apply both domestic 
truck brokerage well global freight forwarding the second leg maybe for fleet card operators like fleetcor and particularly wex covered danyal hussein who provide fuel cards 
and virtual card payments which could replaced auto executing smart contracts 
though these companies have been diversifying away from the transportation market into 
broader assortment payment businesses the key beneficiaries blockchain freight are 
likely asset based truck carriers tls like sndr wern and ltls like xpo odfl and 
shippers also believe that increased use technology could further divide the industry 
into the haves and have nots the haves being large well funded technologically sophisticated companies and the have nots being the smaller mom and pop carriers and shippers
