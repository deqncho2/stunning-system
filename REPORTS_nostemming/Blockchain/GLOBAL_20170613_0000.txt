twelve months incumbent financial institutions are leading the charge with 
potential cost and capital efficiencies the driver proofs concept

four key findings 
and settle transactions 
incumbents likely win have written our may 
blockchain still hasn had true test early signs are that this 
fintech report expect incumbents dominate given the 
promising technology but many the big questions have 
amount buy and trust required for blockchain fully 
yet answered and hasn been tested scale 
utilized 
complex fast moving business environment 
implementation favoring incumbents our view 
this 
suggests 
longer 
time 
scaled 
blockchain can inserted into the existing infrastructure for 
added resiliency and security given concerns over 
one final thought the rapid appreciation cryptocurrencies has 
blockchain technological scalability and the complexity 
elicited many inbound phone calls both our banks and tech teams 
the existing financial infrastructure think the best 
possible explanations include investors search uncorrelated risk 
near term use cases blockchain technology will those 
assets and technologists looking for incremental security but 
that integrate blockchain into the existing infrastructure 
governmental acceptance would required for this further 
with its promise security and immutability blockchain 
accelerate the price which regulation 
technology offers solution for financial intermediaries 
whose business models depend its reputation being 
secure and resilient 
socialising blockchain key legal regulatory and business 
case questions still need answered different 
jurisdictions may have different attitudes 
still killer app kick start blockchain adoption many 
proofs concept are the process globally but there 
killer app yet which think needed kick start adoption

executive summary 
one year ago investors and corporates began take more 
interest the blockchain see our reports global financials 
fintech blockchain banking disruptive threat tool 
april and global exchanges blockchain asx 
set shape brave new world june that time 
there was little actual evidence how this new technology 
would develop the context the financial services 
industry even was practical beyond small scale 
are now firmly the middle the proof concept phase 
development see exhibit this report examine 
the milestones that have been achieved 
investment conclusions 
still too early for specific investment conclusions however 
progress being made and may see initial parts the shared 
infrastructure emerge over the next months our view that 
incumbents are generally more likely benefit than new entrants 
and are most likely see cost benefits possibly increased capital 
efficiency further down the road revenue benefits are possible 
some cases but these should treated with more initial 
uncertainty companies that are more involved early the 
process are more likely advantaged our view including asx 
where what and how 
ubs bny mellon northern trust state street and jpm finally 
note that there are competing proofs studying the same use cases 
singapore project ubin and ubs utility settlement coin 
over the last months have further developed our thoughts 
competing proofs trade finance reconciliation given the seeming 
how the business model for the blockchain will develop see who 
need for interoperability and fit into existing systems will 
will advantaged incumbents disruptors except few 
interesting see competing visions can coexist the future 
cases where markets are small nonexistent think that 
whether see winner takes all scenario play out 
blockchain business solutions they work will developed 
incumbents will permissioned and will target reducing costs 
making existing processes more resilient and secure our research 
shows that originally anticipated most the proofs concept 
are concentrated capital markets type businesses and around 
settlement discuss several initiatives this report also 
show that the technology being developed globally 
gauge the likelihood success otherwise have written

what happened far 
blockchain the technology behind bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies erupted onto the fintech scene several 
years ago creating parallel financial system based 
decentralized 
ledger 
independent 
existing 
infrastructures there was perception meaningful tail 
risk incumbents including the card networks money 
transfer networks and banks 
blockchain technology the context banking and financial 
institutions really refers the more general distributed 
ledger technology importantly banking requires private 
permissioned network opposed open 
permission less network such the one underpinning 
bitcoin 
several consortiums led incumbents with high market 
share have emerged test proof concept blockchain 
technologies particularly the securities clearing and 
settlement space leaders including asx nasdaq bny 
mellon northern trust state street and jpm are assessing 
whether blockchain can deliver services more cheaply and 
more securely than current systems 
applications for distributed ledger have broadened and 
various efforts are under way assess the business case 
whether the benefits exceed the costs and risks 
implementation particularly relative simpler alternatives 
such incremental updates legacy infrastructure 
what next 
proof concept for some applications like securities 
clearing and settlement and slowing enthusiasm for others 
bitcoin the point sale 
expect adoption will come waves asset class asset 
class asset classes ripe for proof concept efforts are 
those with 
mature legacy process with existing friction 
inefficiencies that warrant disruption ntrs private

effectively lead the proof concept effort bny

international transfer assets between mobile

incumbents likely given the amount collaboration 
required expect could take several years replace 
existing back office functions produce measurable cost 
savings the asset classes adopted 
there potential application part the cybersecurity 
toolkit against escalating cybersecurity risk blockchain 
technology considered more difficult hack 
and blockchain 
artificial intelligence and blockchain have been among the buzzword elites the past couple years can help but wonder 
they shouldn actually competitors whether they will complement one another 
the core intention blockchain concept create record that irrefutable its accuracy and reliability but like 
everything else life absolute confidence comes price exponentially growing computing and bandwidth requirements 
least linear growth storage requirements significant security and privacy questions and all those costs are very front end 
loaded creating free rider incentives with the payoff coming long term maintenance costs fall 
the other hand could actually calculate probabilities accuracy and reliability increasing levels confidence the 
long run there economic difference between and reliability and better data more computing power and 
greater bandwidth should improve the ability deliver higher confidence levels improving the calculation probabilities can 
achieved with the falling costs afforded moore law while investment undertaken hoc basis investment and 
improvement can made iteratively allowing for clearer path and time payback 
have seen the probabilistic approach transaction security and already see substantial success within the traditional payment 
networks like those operated visa and mastercard the other hand working improve behind the scenes transaction 
assessments those networks have been able keep overall fraud losses low even relative newcomer square has been able 
keep its losses below even has given away the ability accept credit and debit cards they literally give away 
readers and they require credit checks for individuals other verification person account and still effectively manage 
merchant consumer fraud think moore law and improved data analytics could push those losses lower 
hence our question can used conjunction with internet things cloud computing big data and all the current 
buzzwords improve the application blockchain

the first trial has been successful that the blockchain has been successfully used complete interbank payments however 
number issues for further examination have emerged 
are likely see many blockchains that will use different protocols therefore important that apis are developed

blockchains and that these will use different protocols 
within the financial services industry order enhance singapore 
therefore important that apis developed ensure that the 
attractiveness regional financial hub and promote the 
blockchains can talk each other this was key component the 
government smart nation agenda mas has said that focussed 
interbank payment trial where bcs information systems provided 
three advantages that could come from the use blockchain 
banks with common payments gateway such that they would not 
need rewrite their own back end systems participate the 
operational efficiency can reduced need for

blockchain technical 
why blockchain more secure 
high level blockchain consensus based system records could only changed when nodes the network reach 
consensus requires significant computing power hijack even one node let alone all nodes network other 
words hacking would extremely difficult set and more importantly prohibitively expensive 
has blockchain ever been hacked 
yes possible hack blockchain especially networks with fewer nodes 
the most famous hack was the dao attack june which led ether theft the hack exploited vulnerability 
application called dao that was running the ethereum smart contract blockchain platform 
number bitcoin exchanges have also been hacked and are vulnerable the traditional sense they often store user data 
private keys centralized location key management therefore critical managing security the network 
what happened after the ethereum hack 
the hack caused philosophical split and led the creation ethereum and ethereum classic 
ethereum includes hard fork that reversed the theft through change code the move was controversial 
undermined very core feature blockchain its immutability still majority the ethereum members voted for this option 
the minority who thinks immutability the network should respected even hack stuck with what now known 
the ethereum classic where the theft preserved record

many use cases but limited crypto application the front end payments 
virtual currencies alternative card payments early bitcoin proponents pushed the notion that bitcoin with minimal 
transaction costs besides converting out btc could more inexpensive way for merchants accept payments online 
wave merchants including overstock expedia and paypal braintree partnered with coinbase accept bitcoin the 
pos but adoption slowed and some clear hurdles stand the way longer term viability 
cost accept not materially lower btc transactions require miner fee this variable currently costs over 
get transaction cleared the next block plus conversion costs for those consumers and merchants that prefer not use btc 
store value high ticket transaction this could viable though the card networks also offer lower interchange 
rates for high ticket transactions for small ticket and micro transactions this cost can several percentage points higher 
and miner fees increase which they will because block subsidies decrease over time the costs look set grow 
expect these processing costs for other currencies grow 
see few reasons for consumers use btc over credit debit card given that paying online with btc represents 
marginally more inconvenient way pay our view given the push nature the transaction the longer and more uncertain 
transaction settlement due miner fee bidding and the lower merchant bank funded rewards versus credit
