bitcoin trading moving away from fiat 
since there have been three major funding currencies for bitcoin usd cny and 
jpy exhibit our dataset bitcoin prices from over markets exchanges 
versus different trading currencies largely covers fiat currencies only the 
markets are trading bitcoin versus other cryptocurrencies during the most recent bear 
market usdt dollar tether has been taking larger share trading volumes 
exhibit 
dollar tether token that its creators say that for every unit tether the 
market they back with dollar held reserves keeping its market price stable 
usd the coin usdt not major funding unit but its increasing use 
interesting development over the coming years think that market focus could turn 
increasingly towards cross trades between cryptocurrencies tokens which would 
transact via distributed ledgers only and not via the banking system

exhibit shows that the past month half bitcoin trading exchanges has been 
done versus the japanese yen jpy with volumes much higher than those versus the 
dollar usd the japanese retail community have long been active participants the 
foreign exchange market particularly via margin accounts they tend sell jpy and buy 
foreign currencies with high yields leveraged bitflyer the largest bitcoin 
exchange japan offers its clients leverage but with volatility that that 
usdjpy bitcoin trading volumes versus jpy january were only around the 
margin trading account volumes appreciating jpy expect could move

why tether usdt trading increasing tether trading volumes increased since 
december and think this because two major bitcoin exchanges binance and okex 
added tether their platforms mid late last year both these exchanges not 
accept fiat currencies when falling bitcoin prices also led falling prices most 
other cryptocurrencies traders likely turned tether due its price being equivalent 
and stable the dollar 
the increasing tether usage may come surprise for some because the company 
behind the cryptocurrency has come under much scrutiny some are sceptical that the 
company has the billion reserve the potential impact bank regulation 
could another reason for bitcoin traders move out their position into less 
volatile cryptocurrency rather than convert fiat 
crypto funding currencies 
the bitcoin bear market saw selling cryptocurrencies exchanges but the market 
volatility didn dent the issuance new crypto tokens january and february saw 
record dollar amount capital raised via initial coin offerings icos billion 
and billion respectively exhibit icos are being used way for companies 
raise capital start new projects usually associated with maintaining blockchain 
ico company will issue units their new token exchange for set amount 
another coin cryptocurrency some cases fiat currencies some ways ico 
new way crowdfunding where digital tokens issued are part the future product 
from the company icos over recent months have tended ask for ethereum bitcoin 
this why say that cryptocurrencies are becoming funding currencies

ico preferred over funding the buzz created bitcoin prices soared last year 
invigorated new industry that aims convert any type information stored 
database contract between parties into blockchain based distributed ledger 
smart contract bitcoin atm installations have continued grow month this 
year which another sign that price weakness isn stopping the growing blockchain 
industry tech related startups have historically tended get initial funding from 
venture capital blockchain startups appear prefer use icos 
since the start blockchain related startups around the world raised 
billion via venture capital over three times that value billion was raised via 
icos the new method raising capital continues expand even market prices for 
other cryptocurrencies are weak according techcrunch there have been twice the 
number blockchain based venture capital deals relative icos the past few years 
but icos have raised over seven times the amount money per deal exhibit 
the continued strength ico fundraising may part attributable increased 
direct participation venture capitalists for vcs investing team via icos rather 
than directly can bring key benefits vcs are afforded near immediate liquidity versus 
typical holding period several years decade more for direct investment 
allows vcs build diversified portfolios much faster and iii vcs can have lower level 
advisory commitment team managements 
volatile market prices private investor borrowing more interestingly companies 
have started issue more coins private investors rather than leaving the ico run 
the open market the billion raised february via icos was via private 
rounds according tokeneconomy will continue monitor how this market 
evolves and coin offerings could become favoured way for non blockchain based 
companies raise capital 
telegram ico closely watched this regard will one the largest ever 
over billion and the initial fundraising round was only open accredited private 
investors with certain amount money invest you can only use dollars 
participate telegram ico 
regulation increasing the uncertainty over the definition these newly issued tokens 
via icos increasing the scrutiny regulators march the house financial 
committee held hearing titled examining the cryptocurrencies and ico markets the 
discussion concluded that they must distinguish between cryptocurrencies which are like 
digitally scarce commodities that are used for payment and those which are tokens that 
act like securities they called for standardisation across documents promoting icos 
white papers protect investors with information about the origin the ico issuing 
company and what legal rights the token holders may have ico companies have 
received subpoenas from the sec recently the sec believes that they may have 
issued tokens that should classified securities and therefore follow the laws 
attached securities 
correlations and liquidity 
the market still price discovery mode for bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies 
the valuation any these cryptocurrencies based whatever they can used 
for bitcoin mechanism for payment yet isn currently used for many payments for 
goods and services the current price therefore reflects future expectation that bitcoin 
and related technology may used for payments for this reason when the bitcoin 
price started fall december brought down most other cryptocurrency prices 
exhibit shows that the day correlation between bitcoin and major 
cryptocurrencies rose prices fell with correlations having fallen the prior bitcoin
