central banks regulators ceos and celebrities are all commenting 
cryptocurrencies nowadays they tend focus bitcoin price volatility but 
for those involved financial markets the topic unlikely away countries 
are most likely accommodating cryptocurrency they have certain 
characteristics large financial industry are looking increase 
efficiencies small economy hope grow new industry increase 
international trade and iii fixed managed exchange rate and capital 
controls 
for this analysis differentiation required between cryptocurrency token 
trading exchange versus the blockchain and distributed ledger technology 
being used make processes more efficient such for value transfer and 
contracts the latter what governments are likely welcome could 
generate jobs and boost productivity 
changing regulation has caused cryptocurrency exchanges reconsider which 
country they are located today the largest cryptocurrency volumes are 
traded via one exchange called binance which has just announced that will 
move operations from hong kong malta from around other exchanges 
analysed the next favoured locations are south korea belize and seychelles 
exhibit the united kingdom ranks particularly highly the number 
exchanges located there but still only sees trading volume 
central banks currently issue physical notes and coins but some are now 
researching whether that could digital form hypothetically there the 
potential for every transaction the economy noted private ledger 
unlike bitcoin which public real time having this knowledge would 
valuable for tax collection maintaining capital controls and implementing 
monetary policy 
countries that have banned cryptocurrency usage trading mining creation 
new tokens via icos could exploring central bank digital coin which some 
may call cryptocurrency removing competition makes adoption their 
currency more effective among the major countries china and russia have 
been most vocal and are likely create digital version their currency 
some point within countries sweden has low cash usage within its economy 
the central bank looking for digital alternative krona likely with 
infrastructure being the main hurdle will discuss central bank coins more
