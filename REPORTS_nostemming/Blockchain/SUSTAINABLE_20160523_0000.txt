soundbite blockchain 
the solution for supply 
chain transparency 
arly uses blockchain are highlighting its potential 
provide visibility into the provenance good 
commodity this short note look the 
benefits and current limitations 
verifying suppliers practices one the key challenges for companies 
especially where subcontracting widespread customers are increasingly 
focused the origin their products particularly after incidents such the 
rana plaza disaster april whilst many companies have sought 
improve transparency their supply chain increasingly complex and global 
supply chains are making harder for company have oversight 
such the real details behind supply chains are largely opaque little 
information known about whether the food eat the mobile phone and 
computer use every day have been produced using slave child labour 
unsafe working conditions caused environmental destruction funded 
violent and corrupt political regimes 
there has been growing pressure from customers governments and ngos 
companies provide greater transparency their supply chain initiatives 
include the supply chain disclosure under the modern slavery bill and 
the conflict minerals disclosures rules part the dodd frank wall street 
reform and consumer protection act companies themselves have 
been working map their supply chains perform internal audits and provide 
clear guidance conduct however guaranteeing the integrity supply chain 
costly process and many these strategies only far help provide 
stakeholders with transparency the origin their products 
can blockchain provide the answer supply chain transparency blockchain 
enables the identification the provenance product enabling 
understand where did come from where did who owns and who 
bought effectively allowing see the life story item everledger barclays demo days techstars accelerator presentation for example enables 
the consumer have proof that the apple they are eating was grown 
organic farm the diamond they are wearing not blood diamond for 
conflict minerals could mean the end conflict mineral surveys for suppliers 
because all minerals would have stamp stating the smelter mine origin 
which would accompany the mineral each stage processing

how does the blockchain actually work the blockchain shared distributed 
ledger that can track items value and allows individuals inspect and audit 
transactions they are recorded information encrypted code and added the 
chain small block that everyone can see and for every transaction that occurs 
order for the block added must verified the blockchain users and 
therefore this stops fraudulent block being added the chain 
furthermore the blockchain allows the use smart contracts which are effectively 
legal contracts where there need for third party enforce the clauses because 
they are visible all users everledger for example two people sign agreement 
stating the ownership diamond will transferred person pays certain sum 
money certain date person the smart contract transfers the ownership the 
diamond payment however payment not made time then the smart contract 
does not transfer ownership everledger 
see four key benefits the blockchain immutable records are permanent 
and cannot changed records are secure distributed ledgers are inherently difficult 
for cyber attackers breach because there are multiple copies the same ledger and 
therefore hacker would have attack every ledger simultaneously for the 
participants not spot the change transactions are transparent for all users see the blockchain works tracking every transaction across the supply chain thus opening 
the visibility the supply chains and has the benefit being scalable looking 
further out traceability product transactions may also help with tax transparency 
there are emerging cases blockchain advancing supply chain transparency already 
blockchain being used wide range areas both financial and non financial 
including the certification and tracking diamonds art and digital music see exhibit 
the financial services sector currently leading the field experimenting with and 
implementing the technology but not the only industry disrupted ibm banking blockchain 
blockchain being used track and protect diamonds everledger establishing 
digital passport for each diamond record its provenance travel and any transactions 
with unique cryptographic fingerprint distributed ledger technology beyond 
blockchain the first stage the creation which records the digital 
dna the diamond capturing the colour clarity carat and cut data points 
that describe diamond physically girdle diameter the diamond and then laser 
inscribes the diamond with serial number the diamond then assigned digital 
passport the blockchain track every transaction that occurs according the 
company which was set april there are now million diamonds the 
blockchain everledger now working with insurance companies fraudulent claims 
and interpol diamonds crossing borders and entering the black market

everledger 
insurance diamonds 
everledger uses the blockchain track individual diamonds from the mine the consumer the industry 
attracts relatively high level paper forgery and the blockchain helps reduce fraud and prevent blood 
diamonds entering the market everledger 
provenance 
retail 
provenance aims record all products the retail supply chain the blockchain and make them 
searchable for consumers for example you will able scan code can tuna and know 
exactly where the tuna was caught provenance org 
blockverify 
pharmaceuticals luxury items blockverify aims track and verify tagged products high value against counterfeit products diverted 
diamonds electronics 
goods stolen merchandise and fraudulent transactions each product has recorded history from origin 
the blockchain blockverify 
source morgan stanley research 
however the blockchain still very new technology and very much the 
experimental phase are likely see different blockchains for different use cases 
rather than one overarching blockchain questions arise whether blockchain will 
used large scale provide supply chain transparency will the blockchain just 
used for the luxury market where are currently seeing use cases will expand 
the mass market identify some limitations which are not insurmountable for its use 
tool for supply chain transparency large scale see also appendix 
identification the good purchased the blockchain works recording details 
good through process tagging passporting everledger for example records 
diamonds digital and laser inscribes code into the diamond this means that when 
transactions are recorded the blockchain they can tied back that exact 
diamond however for goods that are not unique nature such coffee beans cocoa 
and tin for example difficult understand how the transactions the blockchain 
would matched the physical good being transferred such may see more 
uses the blockchain for high level supply chain mapping and luxury goods however 
one solution has been package products and stamp them with codes and rfid 
tagging provide traceability from source 
energy cost the blockchain may not energy efficient according tracking website 
blockchain info they logged megawatt hours electricity consumption from the 
bitcoin blockchain over hour period which the equivalent the power 
homes bbc news more recently analysis the government office 
for science report distributed ledger technology beyond block chain estimated 
that the energy requirements run bitcoin are excess and may comparable 
the electricity usage ireland however new blockchains are emerging such that 
used everledger which don need large numbers data miners and therefore have 
lower energy costs 
set cost who funds the cost building new infrastructure track supply chains 
far have seen examples where third parties such everledger create private 
distributed ledger for insurance companies and diamond companies use when 
purchasing and tracking diamond transactions however they ultimately need create 
profit viable alternatives may include industry consortiums third party 
organisations such fairtrade championing the technology 
scalability the public distributed ledger currently not available for everyday 
transactions the high street internet largely because scalability around network 
bandwith storage and even processing power see global financials fintech global 
insight blockchain banking disruptive threat tool apr indeed 
according blockchain info the median transaction confirmation time for the bitcoin 
blockchain has been between and minutes over the last year this compares 
visa which capable processing transaction messages per second visa 
factsheet june however this may not issue for some markets such the 
luxury market where the level transactions much lower and new blockchains are 
being designed with faster processing power 
volume order for the blockchain solution for supply chain transparency 
will ultimately require all members the supply chain participate this likely 
take time and result change culture 
whilst many these problems are being resolved the full benefits and limitations 
the blockchain will take some time emerge the long term opportunity clear 
improving supply chain transparency but whether this across all supply chains just 
limited use cases such the luxury market uncertain over the next few years will 
look out for use cases both the financials sector see appendix for proposed timeline 
and those that focus ethical supply chains such conflict minerals cocoa coffee 
etc which could provide the tipping point for large scale use adoption
