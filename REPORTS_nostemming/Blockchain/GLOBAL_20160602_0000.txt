australia provides favorable test case given the highly consolidated market vertical integration 
exchange trading clearing and settlement infrastructure under the asx and dematerialization digital rather 
than physical records such environment provides greater opportunity align stakeholder and regulatory 
interests execute blockchain solution more mature markets such australia and singapore future 
growth and relevance are greater risks which could drive more innovation and earlier adoption than for 
example hong kong china growth 
the and europe the large market size and fragmented structure involves vast range participants 
slowing down blockchain implementation conflicting views the business case and self interest the 
application the technology could undermine potential market wide benefits however collaborative industryled initiatives driving consistency standards for distributed ledgers hyperledger and see exhibit 
help address these challenges and the market heavily engaged broad range proof concepts 
more specifically the the dtcc market csd taking leadership role embracing disruption 
ensure future solutions deliver the promise modernizing the post trade process they have called for 
collaborative approach and are investing blockchain variety ways including through their linux 
foundation hyperledger project membership financial investment digital asset holdings dah and plans

hosted industry wide blockchain symposium march forward blockchain activity europe 
have seen limited centralized and ordinated responses however all major infrastructure providers are 
working either part consortia independently typically both developing blockchain technology and 
solutions whilst regulators have been clear that they not wish stifle the innovation this stage 
global exchanges june 
central depository likely play pivotal role 
our view blockchain simply open architecture software with which participants can interface forms the 
base layer technology stack which new applications can built this future state the excess rents 
likely accrue those that hold the authentication verification key participate our view the csds may 
best positioned drive innovation given their crucial role equity post trade they also face disruption risk 
they sit idle such the entire value chain exchanges clearing houses custodians registry issuer services 
providers broker dealers will likely need revisit existing processes and some cases engineer their 
value proposition act trusted third party this particularly true for those players with brand 
retail franchise that exist due the friction and inefficient processes the current system key risks 
opportunities across the value chain are evaluated key opportunities risks the value chain 
for the csd replacement with blockchain could put revenues under pressure benefits are passed 
stakeholders issuers and investors however see opportunity grow revenue pools data and analytic 
services further the csd maintains the blockchain and verification process has capacity extract rents 
although note that any monopoly style rents are likely increase regulatory attention our view other 
tech companies are likely drive ecosystem innovative apps enhance services across the equity 
market also creating the opportunity for the csd become the itunes platform for the equity market 
the same time neither the custody registry players both potential competitors depository are sitting 
idle blockchain opportunities and custodians particular have number defensive advantages 
blockchain world particular their depth relationship with their existing customer base response they are 
actively building out functionality interface plug blockchain network manage both the threat 
and opportunity that the technology presents some cases blockchain has the potential reduce their core 
value proposition how much will clients willing pay for safekeeping and maintenance and lower 
barriers entry for technology providers compete this space leveraging apis software however 
also has the potential lower costs and allow them move into new parts the value chain see what about 
the opportunity displace custody and registry below for more detail 
key hurdles adoption aligning stakeholder interests key 
our global team recently identified framework key hurdles adoption global insight blockchain 
banking disruptive threat tool apr exhibit apply this framework within the context 
equity markets blockchain basics and the equity market value chain and believe the biggest challenge 
aligning the interests the various stakeholders including regulators the value chain unless blockchain 
technology broadly adopted consistent standards the network benefits that unleash efficiency and 
innovation are risk not being realized without this highlighted the dtcc the industry risk 
repeating the past and creating countless new siloed solutions based different standards and with significant 
reconciliation challenges essentially new system with the same challenges face today however given 
the vested interests and potential second order implications for existing revenue pools across the value chain 
aligning collective interests key challenge with some markets more complicated than others this one 
the reasons several companies have decided offer their clients blockchain solutions that are agnostic 
protocols bny mellon has been involved wide range blockchain proofs concept while nasdaq state 
street and icap albeit not equities have pitched their readiness supply their clients with flexible 
blockchain solutions that address both their needs and those other suppliers 
the technology still largely proof concept stage further key hurdle whether can scaled 
service entire market other risks evaluated include security economics and regulation 
this uber moment for the industry 
there lot hype the market the potential the blockchain offers the post trade environment and 
implications for intermediaries that interact with the existing market infrastructure some market commentators 
have suggested blockchain analogous email for money while the founders bitcoin claim the 
technology will the financial system what email did postal services see similarities with the 
global exchanges june 
internet which open architecture protocol for exchanging information however achieving utopian state 
for blockchain open architecture protocol for the exchange digital assets seems stretch today 
not see the near medium term implications for the industry profound the impact the 
internet had other industries retail media principally this because the more highly regulated 
nature the financial services industry and the challenge aligning the vested interests numerous 
stakeholders which could make the path adoption more complicated while this limits the uber like 
disruptive threat industry structure this may not insulate the potential impact revenue pools medium term 
implications for the back office could analogous the emergence the electronic order book cash 
equities delivering operational and informational efficiency through reductions transaction costs and 
improvements market access and transparency the expense floor based telephone trading the 
advent blockchain technology and potential implications remind that always overestimate the change 
that will occur the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur the next ten bill gates 
the road ahead 
not about today 
the issue implementing blockchain equity markets often associated believe mis associated with 
collapsing the settlement period and the impact clearing costs and capital requirements the exchanges 
have interviewed are divided this however view settlement delays separate issue and legal 
commercial construct rather than technical issue fact could exist current technology while the 
asx highlights opportunity not proposing any change settlement periods the first instance 
following the roll out blockchain solution this reduces any immediate threat clearing revenues while 
developing options expand into new revenue pools 
what about the opportunity displace custody and registry 
custodians the linchpin securities servicing unbundling services tough 
whilst this report primarily written from exchanges point view would remiss not consider the 
role custodians after all they represent the revenue pool and are the linchpin securities 
services 
custodians are critical partners for their asset manager clients their services free asset managers from having 
all the middle and back office work associated with investing such their work directly affects asset 
manager efficiency productivity and marketing pitch and they are unlikely change this service relationship 
lightly however their fundamental value add provide investors with safe place hold their assets 
segregated from bank assets and from other investor assets 
the debate whether via the csd blockchain infrastructure exchanges have the opportunity build more 
efficient custody services clearly stickier customers annuity revenue stream price sensitive 
transaction driven revenues would attractive the exchanges however the bundled pricing and breadth 
services offered custodians will make hard for new tech adjacent service providers attack the 
custodians further some services securities lending trading and treasury cash management 
leverage the bank balance sheet custody parent entities while there may some leakage given the forces 
play the biggest risk likely fee compression 
nonetheless custodians are making defensive and offensive investments blockchain defense reduce the 
risk that new third party service provider comes with better mousetrap and wrests clients from the 
custodians offense delivering clients more functionality cheaper before competitors new entrants

the securities industry experimenting with blockchain solutions replace the central depository the

blockchain solution involves creating single shared ledger which participants can change only 
consensus believe the most likely solution for the securities market permissioned blockchain 
replacing elements the csd potential benefits include cost savings lower risk clear audit trail and 
new business opportunities potential hurdles include the scalability the technology regulatory 
reluctance security concerns and coordinating stakeholder buy and engagement while blockchain 
and the potential reduction settlement times are related believe they should treated separate

record shareholder ownership blockchain distributed ledger identical copies the ledger are held 
multiple hosts nodes and validated consensus process any change the record has 
independently verified the nodes this means that the blockchain has the ability become the sole source 
the truth because the blockchain trusted and can accessed any the parties involved creating 
there need for market participants hold their own version the ledger thus the need for costly 
reconciliation between ledgers eliminated reducing costs and technically improving security

the context equity markets the piece infrastructure that would likely replaced with blockchain the 
csd which operates the post trade section the value chain performing settlements and maintaining 
central electronic database share registration during settlement the csd effects the transfer securities

account the relevant unit securities

central body settle transaction each node will independently verify the new transaction and update the

the permissioned model the network nodes would restricted community known and trusted 
participants such exchanges brokers custodians regulators and registrars this contrasts with open 
blockchain such bitcoin discussions with industry participants suggest the form blockchain that will likely 
implemented the financial services industry will permissioned ledger given 
cost and computational requirement closed blockchain should significantly lower running costs 
open blockchain would require protection against corruption through technical means requiring significant 
computing power verify each block the chain recent government office for science report dec 
noted that has been estimated that the energy requirements run bitcoin are excess and 
may comparable the energy usage ireland over time technological improvements could see 
processing requirements could fall without compromising security 
security client boarding know your customer and anti money laundering regulations are likely 
enforced similar manner they are today the anonymity that promised open blockchain may not 
suitable for the modern financial services industry and unlikely appeal regulators that have invested 
considerable effort recent years build transparency over kyc regulations and reducing tax avoidance 
why blockchain being considered 
addition the asx asx leads the charge various players are manufacturing prototypes and deploying 
these initially either smaller scale markets syndicated loans sub segments larger markets icap 
testing with new block trades firms will need assess whether the benefits exceed the costs and risks

enhanced security remains proven whether blockchain solution can least secure csd 
however number characteristics may assist enhance security consensus the consensus mechanism 
requires majority nodes validate any changes the blockchain making difficult for single party 
hack defraud and encryption unlike traditional database each individual transaction block 
blockchain encrypted and thus each participant can only access their own data the ledger the data they 
have permission access 
reduced risk removes single point failure the system the csd however this remains 
proven and blockchain may present new risks misaligned incentives governance

identifying and tracking the company register important design blockchain contains precise history 
ownership because ownership verified chaining transaction the previous transaction this way the 
share register can tracked way that difficult achieve under the current book entry methodology 
new opportunities finally and will discuss later believe whole host applications will 
ultimately evolve around this infrastructure whilst this will create threats for some existing financial service 
providers will also create new opportunities note that players such icap are developing blockchain 
solution for onward sale customers contrast others peers that are looking reap cost benefits 
early adoption not about settlement 
proponents blockchain highlight the fact that could key advantage the technology while 
others see reduction settlement times undesirable 
shortening the settlement cycle separate debate 
recent report the dtcc noted that already validates matches and confirms trades within seconds 
delaying settlement three days legal construct mainly manage operational constraints and assist retail 
investors the conversations have had with various csds and settlement agents suggest that could 
achieved using existing technologies and globally are already moving one the advantages 
blockchain the ability provide greater choice market models potentially allowing participants 
optimize their settlement speed 
however blockchain could catalyst 
the introduction blockchain could act catalyst redesign many systems and reduction settlement 
time will lower risk and capital the system this could major benefit for exchanges and participants 
not see reduction settlement time alongside the introduction the blockchain the capital benefits 
lower error rates cost savings and security benefits would have justify any additional investment expense 
does the market want faster settlement 
despite the benefits wide adoption arguably sub optimal and unlikely near term outcome 
fact number markets that previously operated have since extended their settlement periods 
address liquidity and operational issues tel aviv moscow kazakhstan widespread adoption 
settlement unlikely until the following issues are addressed the ability take short positions and 
borrow lend securities impacting market liquidity operational constraints such funding trades real time 
visibility transactions payments systems iii the ability settle trades net basis and error reversal 
fat finger given the immutable nature blockchain 
this remains area intense debate with some experienced participants arguing that with shorter settlement 
times possible liquidity could fact increase driven growth the options market which would more 
than offset the negative liquidity impact from reduced stock lending addition there belief that with 
global exchanges june 
refinement the existing process there will still ability stock borrow lend under the blockchain 
why the moscow exchange abandoned 
previously the moscow exchange operated settlement which meant that participants were required 
deposit the cash and securities advance that system was major barrier international 
investors who are typically used settlement meaning the settlement and delivery 
securities takes place two three days after the trade date 
the move away from was part broader reforms help modernize the moscow exchange and 
increase international investor participation russian markets the reform was done alongside 
additional measures such the establishment the csd believe the globally recognised 
settlement model has lowered the cost for market participants increased efficiency deployed capital 
and helped support trading volumes 
key hurdles implementation 
our global team recently highlighted hurdles for adoption exhibit number high hurdles must met 
before blockchain widely adopted 
scalability performance 
technology still the proof concept stage the asx will very important test case scaling 
permissioned network the size national public equity market though there are numerous examples 
smaller test cases underway such icap nasdaq and japan exchange 
regulation 
while regulators some markets may resist change they are increasingly seeking more proactive when 
new technology delivers better outcomes for stakeholders ultimately the potential benefits blockchain the 
capital markets might act push factor for regulators these include reducing market costs for investors 
and issuers improved transparency and regulatory oversight iii greater auditability trades and share 
ownership reduced operational and credit risk and increased innovation and competition among service 
providers barriers entry are lowered these would have weighed against the risks and costs 
introducing any new system 
security 
regulators and participants will need satisfied that security blockchain least strong the 
status quo number characteristics may support improved security consensus the consensus 
mechanism requires majority nodes validate any changes the blockchain making difficult for 
single party hack defraud and encryption unlike traditional database each individual transaction 
block blockchain encrypted thus each participant can only access their own data the ledger the data 
they have permission access blockchain architects also need prove regulators and participants that the 
technology can solve issues such hacked accounts and lost passwords 
global exchanges june 
aligning incentives 
ultimately whether not blockchain becomes widely implemented depends upon the weight interests 
retaining the status quo those advocating for change for some industry participants these changes could 
impact current revenue streams however they also offer the potential significantly lower costs and capital 
requirements well create new business opportunities for some players help assess stakeholder 
engagement have evaluated the characteristics different markets influencing readiness for adoption the 
market appetite and capacity for exchanges benefit from adoption see global state readiness for 
blockchain explore the potential impacts participants the value chain key opportunities and 
risks the value chain 
evolving the right standard 
many banks and intermediaries have been exploring blockchain individually through competing consortiums 
hyperledger ethereum and ripple the dtcc noted its white paper embracing disruption jan 
result the industry risk repeating the past and creating countless new siloed solutions based 
different standards and with significant reconciliation challenges essentially new system with the same 
challenges face today the industry needs adopt standards for blockchain relation messaging

market characteristics 
highlight four key characteristics that support early adoption blockchain applying this framework asian 
markets stand out most suitable for large scale early adoption important note however that the lack 
the characteristics listed below not prohibitive adopting blockchain 
vertical integration integrating new technology within the existing market more difficult when 
the key pieces market infrastructure along the trade cycle are controlled different stakeholders 
from the perspective the exchanges those which own their market central depository seem best 
placed drive blockchain innovation however standalone csds may also deploy blockchain for 
the greater good though the path implementation and stakeholder engagement potentially 
more challenging 
consolidated infrastructure similarly markets where multiple exchanges ccps and csds 
inter operate may find more difficult coordinate new system for example europe this 
would require joint effort between the more than csds the market each with differing 
financial objectives 
direct registration typically investors will access their market csd through member 
participant this usually registered broker dealer custodian under direct registration the 
legal title shares recorded the underlying investor name the csd and appears the 
company register this contrasts some markets where legal title registered the csd 
participant while the underlying investor merely beneficial owner 
dematerialization design blockchain manages the transfer and ownership digitally 
represented assets and incompatible with physical assets such share certificates certificated 
markets would need undergo dematerialization process before transition blockchain

structural challenges the securities services industry globally has experienced rising competition 
leading compression transaction registry and custody fees facing weak asset growth low 
interest rates and rising costs the various intermediaries are exploring new ways reshape their 
business models this has seen players such csds custodians and registrars expand their service 
offering beyond their core business finding new value added services and moving along the 
securities value chain some markets this has led blurring boundaries between intermediaries 
new era competition the implementation blockchain equity markets challenges the status 
quo number ways the extent that creates efficiencies and reduces processing requirements 
reconciliations safekeeping database maintenance the value proposition certain players would 
impacted the same time blockchain may catalyze further competition the post trade arena 
lowering the barriers for new players and allowing existing players move along the value chain 
incumbents will likely attempt leverage their experience expertise but most crucially their existing 
infrastructure see permissioned blockchain network the most likely model defend their 
position nearly all are active proof concept work and some cases are building their own 
infrastructures become blockchain compatible however incumbency expertise and human capital 
alone often insufficient withstand the disruptive force technology 
winners losers given the nascent positioning this technology believe would premature 
definitive winners and losers however evaluating the implications for the post trade value

publicly listed companies will always have obligation maintain date record their shareholders 
for public inspection this duty imposed company law and necessity for effective corporate 
governance merely switching the technology platform used effect clearing settlement will not change this 
but what worth 
however blockchain has the potential simplify the 
register maintenance process itself for example the 
process reconciling updating the register reflect 
daily csd movements operating separate direct 
register identification beneficial owners tracking 
bearer securities could made obsolete this 
because the blockchain ledger represents the whole and

mainland china case study 
the china securities depository and clearing corporation csdc was established and jointly 
owned the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges the csdc undertakes all the securities 
registration clearing and settlement functions that operates the ccp csd and central registrar 
registration shares listed companies are contained entirely within the csdc the csdc provides 
issuers with their full shareholder register free charge regular basis and hoc basis upon 
request 
shareholder communications such agm notifications are broadcast via the mass media and investors 
have the onus monitor for relevant notices the csdc also provides online platform for issuers 
administer proxy voting 
what about corporate actions 
the capacity blockchain host apis applications may open securities services competition from 
technology players key impact areas are likely proxy voting and dividend payments registrars expertise 
specialized knowledge tax status and incumbency are advantages and will help defend their position 
however any risk the core registry maintenance function risks unbundling the various other registrar 
services which are tied this 
what are the opportunities 
despite the risks opportunities for registry companies include leveraging their expertise manufacture 
apis applications interface with the ledger perform registry analytics operating node the blockchain 
potentially holding the private key for issuers and investors registrars are likely take actions defend 
their position building their own prototypes enabling blockchain capability their own systems and

custodian 
custodians revenue pool critical partner asset manager clients 
custodians are critical partners for their asset manager clients their work directly affects asset manager 
efficiency productivity and marketing pitch such asset managers are unlikely change this service 
relationship lightly 
the global custodian revenue pool including asset servicing safekeeping assets receipt and 
disbursement assets dividend and interest income collection and distribution fund accounting fund 
administration middle office outsourcing securities lending trading and treasury management the 
industry concentrated the top end with the five largest based custodians generating this 
global custodian revenue pool the industry much more fragmented from there 
custodians are key part the securities value chain they sit between exchanges clearing houses and the 
investors owning the financial assets their fundamental value add provide investors with safe place 
hold their assets segregated from the bank assets and from other investor assets segregated safekeeping 
assets has always been critical service that custodians have provided but providing best class service has 
become even more important post the lehman failure since then investors have required more 
protections for more narrowly defined asset pools often with unique documentation needs 
over the past three decades custodians have expanded their value add their asset manager clients doing 
more work for them custodians now offer services that free asset managers from having all the middle 
and back office work associated with investing this frees their clients focus asset allocation and asset 
selection the range services that custodians offer broad including performance measurement and 
analysis performance reporting comparative reporting accounting fund administration fund management 
and securities processing custodians have customized their offerings for their larger clients enabling unique 
services not only for their direct asset manager clients but also for the clients their clients 
however believe several the services custodians offer can provided more efficiently with access 
bank balance sheet this includes securities lending where the reinvestment cash collateral held lieu the 
lent securities drives important part the roa managing excess cash for the asset manager another 
activity that can use bank balance sheet deposits another example 
custodians have been investing their systems provide asset manager clients with best class service for 
decades priorities have migrated over time from creating central infrastructure enhance efficiency 
tagged data points enable ultimate reporting flexibility and customization leveraging the cloud 
drive speedier system updates addition efficiencies custodians spend larger percentage revenues 
tech than commercial retail banks including personnel invests revenues and northern 
trust invests revenues 
why custody attractive exchanges and csds 
why might exchanges and csds interested migrating the securities servicing value chain into the 
complex world custody custodians have lower pre tax margins their asset servicing segments 
higher ebitda margins for exchanges this reflects the more headcount intensive customer service 
business model well the headcount required for reconciliation compliance legal and regulatory 
requirements custodians also have lower multiples for exchanges 
the answer likely two fold first exchanges are looking lock stickier customer relationships like the 
custodians have especially when compared against with the highly price sensitive transaction driven revenues 
several have done this via technology services they offer like nadq bundling pricing for registration and asset 
ownership with asset transactions could also drive stickier customers second they have the opportunity 
build more efficient asset management services through blockchain infrastructure exchanges can offer this 
via more efficient blockchain platform with fewer people required for reconciliation they may able

unbundling custody services tough 
custodians realize the potential risk being disintermediated that part the reason why despite their 
significant moats they are investing blockchain 
what are the moats custodians have the breadth services they provide their customers listed above 
custodians are doing the books and records for asset management clients they are creating the reports that 
show the performance analytics which drives asset manger rankings versus competitors and performance 
client expectations these are sticky services which clients not change lightly their services directly affect the 
clients the asset managers too and result there high bar meet for asset managers make any 
changes additionally the custodian pricing model bundled charging one fee for the increasingly complex 
work provided this makes hard for new tech startup strong adjacent service provider pick apart the 
cost asset registration from safekeeping from asset transfer also custodians are typically banks with balance 
sheets which enable more efficiencies for some the services provided 
custodians investing blockchain manage disintermediation risks 
the custodians are making defensive and offensive investments blockchain defense reduce the risk that 
new third party service provider comes with better mousetrap and wrests clients from the custodians 
offense delivering clients more functionality cheaper before competitors new entrants adjacent firms 
all five the largest based custodians are investing blockchain state street stt bny mellon 
northern trust ntrs jpmorgan jpm and citigroup are each the consortium stt and jpm are 
also members the linux foundations hyperledger project these consortiums are working dozens 
proof concepts pocs around post trade settlement registration and account authorization state street 
investing year project called beacon which includes blockchain investments one stt goals 
ensure that able offer its clients blockchain solutions based its clients needs and requests bny mellon 
investing several pocs including internal blockchain and internal coin 
fee pressure likely the greatest risk 
see the blockchain risk the custodians primarily one price pressure will exchange offer asset 
registry and asset custody work for free bring higher value added fees like fund accounting and fund 
administration this could drive more price pressure for the custodians they fend off new entrants into their 
business believe asset managers are not inclined shift business price alone given the custodian 
breadth product and the depth relationship that extend the asset manager clients but the implication 
continued pressure the top line

clearing house central clearing counterparty ccp 
what risks opportunities could blockchain present 
counterparty risk and thus the need for equity clearing 
arises from and correlated the time lag between 
execution and settlement settlement risk 
greater than unless there broad based shift 
near instantaneous settlement equity trades see 
the role the ccp unlikely materially change 
blockchain basics and the equity market value chain 
the extent that blockchain drives shortening the 
settlement period this would reduce the economic costs 
clearing which includes operating expenses 
clearing participants ccp capital requirements and 
broker regulatory capital freed capital could 
redeployed into growth initiatives returned 
investors increasing the roe this maybe why the 
exchanges perceive the reduction settlement times 
very differently than while our view that 
settlement time and blockchain are related but different 
issues the exchanges our survey are split 
whether the two are linked

exchange 
the core role the exchange provide public venue cross match buy and sell orders our view this 
will remain largely unchanged the main issue for exchange our view will whether not settlement 
times are reduced and the impact that may have liquidity for example with instant settlement trading 
volumes could increase adding exchange fees real time settlement could lead huge increases 
liquidity especially amongst algorithmic traders and from the interplay the securities and derivatives 
markets also potentially increasing trading fees one potential development may the creation separate 
market with different price however note earlier believe that settlement times and block chain 
not necessarily need linked 
brokers 
similar exchanges the execution functions brokers should remain largely unchanged assuming investors 
will still need access the exchange and settlement infrastructure via approved participant there should 
minimal impact other value add services such market making research some prime brokerage services 
there were eventual move market wide settlement would expect financial innovation provide 
new methods borrow stock potentially opening derivatives option markets and new areas sell risk 
management the retail broking side new apps improve wealth management offering are possible the 
extent that back and middle office costs can reduced the sell side may beneficiary
