bitcoin futures exploring risks and opportunities 
bitcoin futures trading coming regulated trading market near you the largest 
exchange operator cme group announced last week that has received regulatory 
approval launch bitcoin futures contracts beginning december the first regulated 
futures trading platform for the cryptocurrency cboe holdings one the big 
exchanges its own right followed suit and offer futures trading starting 
december the wall street journal has reported that nasdaq plans launch its own 
bitcoin futures offering the first half 
expect the discount brokers including trade ameritrade and ally financial 
offer bitcoin futures trading through cme and other exchanges some point after 
the launches trade ameritrade and ally financial management suggested they 
would consider offering bitcoin futures contracts once they become available the 
exchanges but more recently trade has said will take wait and see approach and 
watch how the futures trade schw also taking careful approach until has more 
information and better grasp potential risks exchange traded futures contracts 
with central clearing net cash settlement and regulatory oversight may give discount 
brokers enough comfort offer bitcoin futures trading despite volatility and the wide 
spectrum views around the cryptocurrency futures trading will enable investors 
take short positions bitcoin for the first time 
view bitcoin futures trading potential commission revenue opportunity

exchanges operation globally offering cryptocurrencies physical and derivatives 
could means for discount brokers acquire new customers and take share 
why stop bitcoin futures contracts why not offer wider array cryptocurrency 
accounts that enable consumers trade cryptocurrencies broadly were years 
ago when the discount brokers were insurgents wouldn surprised see them 
first movers providing access newly regulated areas cryptocurrency trading 
over time they may well move beyond bitcoin futures but discount brokers are the 
business providing retail customers with market access and facilitating trades while 
generally not providing advice recommendations they already enable customers 
trade wide variety volatile and less liquid securities currencies and derivatives 
futures and options contracts further customers can already take additional risk 
via trading margin interestingly fidelity allows customers use its website view

retail customers are generally less familiar with trading futures contracts which 
could challenge client acceptance futures bitcoin trading vehicle 
futures contracts represent trades ameritrade and trade 
economics futures contracts are less attractive than options and equities which 
could weigh the overall commission per trade trade offers futures 
contracts for well below the blended commission rate around 
margin calls from significant volatility bitcoin raises risk capital shortfall 
discount brokers futures commission merchant fcm more details below 
client education tools will critical both around using futures contracts and 
broadly around bitcoin and cryptocurrencies 
see wide range additional questions risks around offering 
cryptocurrencies such extremely high realized volatility difficult assess 
intrinsic valuation lack custody security bitcoin full bearer 
instrument how does one guard against theft technical limitations such the 
speed which transactions are posted operational challenges viable 
currency and form payment and criteria for determining which cryptocurrencies 
offer how does one limit just bitcoin without arbitrary assessment 
capital and margin levels present the bulk the risk discount brokers thinking 
about offering bitcoin futures trading cme group set the required margin level 
notional value for bitcoin contracts while cboe set the required margin level 
according the cme contract terms sheet futures contract will equal 
bitcoins and the maximum position size for investor contracts equal 
bitcoins cboe contracts however will equal bitcoin and have the same 
contract limit equal bitcoins 
using cme example approximate current bitcoin price levels the maximum 
notional value that could held investor would assuming 
bitcoin price according cftc data etfc amtd and schw fcms 
futures commission merchant hold and capital 
respectively investor deposits the margin requirement 
and the position moves against them sharply very short period time greater 
than the margined amount then brokers would potentially exposed and 
higher risk this not unique bitcoin futures contracts general have margin 
requirements but exacerbated the extreme volatility and uncertainty the 
underlying asset 
wonder the level set cme group provides enough capital cushion for 
the brokers operate under given the risks and circumstances though the lower 
level set cme could driven the exchange desire drive trading volume 
capital risk for fcms 
fcms have the ability adjust their margin requirement upward common 
among larger institutions though this could make them less competitive with retail 
customers looking for maximum leverage

and trade all tread carefully and slowly but the first step expect offering 
bitcoin futures contracts perhaps within the next several months 
who most likely embrace bitcoin among the brokers our view amtd the
