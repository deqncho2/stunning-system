high secure dividend yield msstdivs index 
weak macro environment suggests continued focus 
income investing believe the hunt for yield likely 
persist given weaker macro backdrop difficult earnings 
outlook and prospect even lower yields our 
economists have modeled recession the their 
base case and expect just growth the eurozone 
see european earnings declining 
and just growth leaving our eps below 
consensus our bond strategists expect global bond yields 
fall further over the coming quarters with year 
treasury yields expected trough and year 
gilt yields fall 
dividend investing not easy given already elevated 
payouts addition difficult earnings outlook 
europe payout ratio close record high which 
raises the question sustainability market dividends 
the median stock trailing dividend yield just above 
the market close which makes finding attractive 
dividend stock ideas even harder 
focus our high secure dividend yield 
screen given that the market dividend yield not overly 
attractive and concentrated only few sectors think 
important overlay qualitative approach identify 
the best dividend stock ideas hence prefer focus 
our high secure yield screen msstdivs comprising 
stocks that offer above market yield and where our 
analysts believe the payout very safe for least the next 
two years the median stock the list should provide 
yield with dps growth per annum over the 
next couple years note that the basket has enjoyed 
positive relative earnings revisions trends for over year
