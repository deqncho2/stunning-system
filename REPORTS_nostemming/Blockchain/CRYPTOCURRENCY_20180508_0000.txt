summarise what some countries have been saying about digital fiat 
currencies blockchain sweden china marshall islands japan switzerland 
this document presents theoretical discussions but not intended suggest 
where think digital fiat currency could implemented all the reasons 
why 
central banks monitoring several central banks are actively debating whether 
not introduce digital version paper notes and coins cash range 
technology platforms are being considered from current types blockchainbased ones the technology could help better track domestic and 
international currency flows pushing research efforts countries with managed 
exchange rates not expect central banks want use private 
cryptocurrency networks like bitcoin they are more likely create their own 
second cryptocurrencies are not used for many goods and services transactions 
today and result they not currently exert significant influence 
macro outcomes instead the central banks focus understanding 
cryptocurrencies from financial stability perspective 
central banks monetary policy theoretically monetary system that 
digital may enable deeper negative rates this appeals certain central banks 
freely circulating paper notes and coins cash limits the ability the central 
banks force negative deposit rates digital version cash could theoretically 
allow negative deposit rates charged all money circulation within any 
economy course the challenge this theory that deep and long standing 
negative rates eventually are problematic for banks central banks would then 
have direct currency users implement monetary policy reducing 
leverage the system significantly and cutting gdp growth this 
theoretical debate but one that some central banks are engaging 
broadly there are few other reasons why country may see interest new 
payment networks blockchain the cryptocurrency industry financial services 
centres japan the hong kong where financial regulation could lead 
larger cryptocurrency investment funds small economies where most 
cryptocurrency exchanges are based helped attractive regulation malta

central banks monetary policy 
many central banks have spoken about the risks buying volatile instrument like 
cryptocurrencies their comments primarily reflect central bank investor protection 
policies the financial stability board fsb recently concluded that the small size the 
financial flows between the banking sector and cryptocurrency networks means they 
are not financial stability risk today expect central banks increase regulation 
further reduce the risks more lively debate the topic whether digital fiat 
currencies could offer advantages for implementation monetary policy which 
explore below the ideas presented here are provide framework thinking and 
don necessarily cover all topics detail which plan future notes for 
reference the bank for international settlements has provided nice overview the 
considerations around central bank digital currencies 
managed exchange rates 
investment flows into and out country impact exchange rates managed exchange 
rate where central bank will have certain level the exchange rate mind and 
intervene the markets the currency deviates too far from many emerging 
economies adopt this policy they believe could help manage inflation rates 
weak currencies push import prices and allow export industries grow remain 
competitive too strong currencies are unfavourable flows out country are too 
quick then managing the exchange rate level can become more difficult capital controls 
may put place limit the amount foreign currency individual may purchase 
see our recent economics note central bank reactions inflows 
digital form notes and coins can help manage outflows all transactions 
would recorded simplistically capital controls are implemented digitally 
physically digitally via the banking network monitoring cash withdrawals transfers 
and putting limits accounts and physically the border checks may done the 
amount cash being carried someone both methods have their limitations but the 
latter may harder manage and where digitising cash could help the digital fiat 
system transactions would assigned someone unlike cash where there 
trace allowing personal limits enforced more easily 
considering just managed exchange rates the scope for the number central banks 
having discussion fiat digital currencies large the world fiat currencies 
are managed some extent only the countries that the imf looks have 
free floating exchange rates countries anchor their currency usd 
and eur and wide and cheap access both those currencies important 
for many economies 
pegged exchange rates can provide businesses that have lot foreign currency 
revenue costs with more certainty that future cash flows don fluctuate too much 
due changes countries with pegged exchange rates will see their central banks 
buy sell foreign currency the market valuation deviates from the target far 
are aware there aren any pegged cryptocurrencies however there are 
backed crypto coins tokens known stable coins where the creators the tokens 
say that they will store certain amount assets for every crypto token created one 
the largest stable coins called dollar tether backed usd and trading the 
market around usd 
cash usage and interest rates 
over the last decade monetary policy measures stimulate demand and raise inflation 
expectations have become more nconventional low and negative interest rates are 
common within developed markets exhibit over the same time frame the trend 
demand for physical cash has not been universal 
exhibit japan has high while sweden has low cash circulation 
relative their economies 
exhibit switzerland japan european countries and south korea 
have seen rise demand for cash 
source macrobond morgan stanley research imf using annual gdp from

countries like japan switzerland and many within europe have seen rise cash 
relative gdp exhibit all these regions experienced low lowering inflation 
expectations the purchasing power the cash being preserved may have led 
more cash being used store value versus being used purchase assets 
interestingly south korea which participates large volume cryptocurrency 
trading has also seen increased demand for cash the bis additionally found that japan 
and south korea have seen rise demand for larger denomination notes

sweden the exception this scenario cash circulation has declined over the past 
decade even inflation expectations fell this largely because swedish regulations 
led the banking system reduce availability cash post the financial crisis atms were 
removed and customers had travel the particular branches that carried cash 
technological developments the way consumers make transactions such moving 
card and mobile payments have contributed reduced demand for cash exhibit 
shows the proportion payments done using cash across range countries mexico 
and india have high levels cash transactions relative the developed economies 
the australia and sweden south korea low level cash payments contrast 
the increasing demand for cash the economy over the last decade digital versions 
cash may useful for different reasons japan and sweden 
exhibit european countries already have negative interest rates 
source macrobond morgan stanley research the exhibit shows policy rate and not deposit rate but the 
two rates follow each other closely 
more broadly negative interest rates are tools being used 
central banks like the ecb and boj with goal raising inflation 
via encouraging credit growth negative deposit rates can 
theoretically fully trickle through the full economy only the 
deposits are held within the banking system practice retail 
banks haven typically passed negative rates their 
depositors but rates have fallen which may have encouraged 
cash holdings countries with high levels cash circulation 
may find more difficult for negative deposit rates pass 
through changing corporate and consumer behaviour you are 
not charged negative rate for holding note your pocket 
switching from paper note digital coin can allow negative 
interest rates applied all currency 
the challenge course that negative rates for too long will problematic for the 
banking system leaving the central bank with mechanism deploy monetary policy 
broadly add leverage the economy negative rates are clearly double edged 
sword which when taken too deep too long could damage economy materially 
banks shrink and leverage supporting gdp evaporates 
sweden central bank the riksbank considering whether issue krona 
digital form cash sweden has the highest level card payments within the 
developed markets and low level cash circulation relative gdp exhibit 
countries with low level cash circulation may have central banks that are more 
interested digital forms their own physical currency 
sweden government currently reviewing the situation worried that cash 
usage falls too fast may difficult maintain the cash infrastructure and that 
risk free asset the form central bank money may cease entirely the riksbank 
floden has recently said that the state could subsidise cash even force banks and all 
shops accept cash but also added that these measures aren necessarily the best 
way forward the debate will continue the central bank currently looking for input 
from technology companies how they can implement their krona project 
japan cash circulation among the highest the developed and emerging markets 
exhibit relative the country gdp and has increased since the financial crisis 
last year the japanese government set target doubling cashless settlements over 
years encouraging the use blockchain technology for money transfer and creating 
data sharing interfaces between fintech firms and banks japanese bank digital initiatives 
have been explored our bank analysts here and more recent news updates 
summarised the press summarised here 
the boj has not suggested that would look into creating digital version the yen 
paper note coin but would not surprising some point did consider 
using the olympics coin infrastructure test blockchain technology doesn 
necessarily need used create digital coin but being discussed similar 
debates converting digital coin economy with high proportion paper 
notes allowing negative interest rates applied more money could have the 
biggest impact changing consumer and corporate behaviour the impact described 
here theoretical and assumes that all physical cash converted digital 
consumers decide not convert the digital format then the negative interest rates 
cannot passed via this method 
cost cash versus digital there have incentives for central banks consider 
changing the system money from physical digital one consideration the cost 
production the money versus its value which economists call seigniorage for 
example costs print bill the seigniorage would 
analysis rogoff curse cash shows that sweden has low seigniorage revenue 
relative gdp which suggests less incentive for the central bank 
stay with paper money system than say russia hong kong which 
have the highest revenue relative gdp analysis from the bank canada suggests 
that introducing central bank digital currencies may still preserve seigniorage because 
even though demand for bank notes may decline the central bank could charge higher 
fees for other services provides the financial industry however this estimate 
the central bank there precedent follow 
alternative payment networks 
international trade has been growing for decades and with comes growing 
international payment networks from the banking sector and private companies

networks and payment methods are likely continue over the coming years countries
