what happened far 
apple android samsung and others have introduced their mobile wallets over the past years hoping redirect brick and 
mortar and later commerce card payment flows through their pipes but traction brick and mortar retail has been 
underwhelming 
key hurdle has been the efficiency the existing card payment ecosystem lack true value add combined with inertial 
consumers and inadequate acceptance infrastructure 
what next 
mobile phone providers will likely continue offering mobile wallets but traction likely slow and could take years build 
nfc acceptance infrastructure should grow with terminal upgrade cycle over coming years 
foundation 
what has hampered initial success the first hurdle very 
the believe that adoption apple pay the physical 
well entrenched infrastructure apple pay was met with high 
pos remains challenging the near term even though the shift 
hopes when launched september but initial user 
from mag stripe emv driving some disruption consumer 
adoption was slow and see one defining reason 
behavior the value proposition consumers and merchants 
well established card payments infrastructure which when paired 
remains unclear and lack ubiquity terms contactless 
with inertial consumer behavior financials tends favor 
acceptance infrastructure remains important hurdle further 
incumbents specifically apple pay and nfc payments general 
points acceptance has been gating factor apple pay usage 
are often faulted for fixing problem that doesn exist and while 
for instance points grew the over the last year while 
there are some advantages using you don have carry your 
monthly apple pay transactions grew nearly fight the 
cards around your transactions process faster than emv chip 
inertia using well established card payment infrastructure 
the upside has not been enough incentivize consumers change 
important for apple pay attract points acceptance for 
payments methods this exasperated the infrastructure 
transactions completed regular basis for example japan 
disadvantage that apple pay has faced that nfc acceptance itself 
more than transit users complete million apple pay 
has been slow roll out mature existing card payments 
transactions per month 
technology merchant willingness accept applepay has also 
been limited even where nfc exists and goes back issue 
see apple pay frictionless touchid enabled checkout more 
perceived lack value add 
valuable for mobile based app browser payments but 
ubiquitous acceptance challenge here well the 
and while adoption has accelerated recent quarters global 
acceptance gap bridges over time apple pay could have fair shot 
penetration remains low close months after launching the 
gaining meaningful traction particularly adds new 
apple pay service the company reported that there were 
customers default they purchase iphones longer term 
locations the that were accepting apple pay fast forward 
think meaningful traction only likely apple pay and other 
and over million contactless ready locations accept apple 
mobile wallet providers can parlay traction digital wallets see 
pay with more than million the alone according apple 
profile digital wallets particularly lines between online 
furthermore the number apple pay customers has tripled yoy 
and offline commerce become blurred consumers find value 
and transaction volume has increased over the last 
using digital wallets for and mcommerce and out habit 
month albeit off low base however customer adoption still has 
continue using the wallet brick and mortar locations well one 
ways apple pay only available countries 
example better mcommerce integration with imessage where 
worldwide the service expanded taiwan and ireland the most 
apple customers can now send starbucks gift card via imessage 
recent quarter and apple pay usage penetration has leveled off 
expanding these use cases could encroach other peer peer 
the low mid single digits according pymnts

after getting scale processing ebay transactions pypl has diversified into the leading ecommerce digital wallet accepted 
more than major websites the and processing over global ecommerce 
other digital wallets have been launched large firms including visa mastercard chase american express apple and google 
what next 
still long runway for growth mobile commerce and ecommerce take share from brick and mortar and paypal 
expands acceptance among merchants globally 
but compared other fintech companies pypl more the mature end the spectrum with new opportunities like pay 
with venmo unlikely needle movers against large revenue base

factors 
lead online acceptance which role reversal now positions

exponential growth commerce and lack efficient 
payment system for online payments while card networks like 
and provided workable solution for making payments online 
where none other existed there was clear friction having 
consumers enter digit card details leading high rates cart 
abandonment moreover there were security and trust issues with 
consumers not wanting share their payment credentials with 
merchant that was not well known them pypl digital wallet 
helped solve both these issues 
with amazon and others see our latest online payment tracker

the other wallet providers slow their investment thereby 
limiting overall risk share loss pypl

despite already having the highest acceptance pypl also added the 
most merchants over the past year 
another equally important factor for pypl success was 
pypl acquisition ebay leading commerce

our outlook for insurtech 
small business insurance sbi represents market and 
the early stages digital disruption changing demographics 
see few viable paths but the most probable assumes that 
small business owners increasing number insurtech startups 
brokers gain significant traction and that mid market and large 
and heightened focus traditional carriers both incumbents and 
brokers become increasingly interested the small business space 
new entrants this sizeable and profitable market are catalysts 
prompting rapid development distributor enabling software 
for trend where smbs increasingly opt business with the 
and technology the scenario further assumes that two these 
most tech savvy insurers those that can offer consumer like 
distributor platforms get adopted major incumbent carriers 
experience 
prompting other carriers step their digital insurance 
initiatives expect carriers and distributors digital business will 
what gives conviction the demographics favor digital 
still mostly come from new companies that are relatively small 
insurance solutions more than small business 
size but expect digital start making inroads with traditional 
the will owned millennials and gen xers two groups 
customers and with companies the ten employee range 
that prefer purchase and manage insurance digitally and 
lower risk industries 
according our recent survey small businesses would buy 
insurance online they were starting their businesses today 
who are the likely winners and laggards among our coverage 
there are unmet insurance needs small businesses and

money transfer pricing for market leader western union has been decline for several years primarily competition brick 
and mortar channels has intensified 
but revenue also increasingly levered online money transfer where backed firms like xoom transferwise and 
worldremit have continued expand 
what next 
pressure from fintech providers has not registered yet and global financial inclusion rate determining step outright 
disruption but intensifying competition seems inevitable over the long haul 
foundation 
consumer behavior helps startups but banking access still 
hurdle for disruption across the industry and even among 
incumbents slow but steady shift towards online money transfer

which requires that third party application use customer credentials log each institution each time order secure

matches similar development the and europe 
possible that open api innovations will help create new earnings opportunities operational and financial data accumulated
