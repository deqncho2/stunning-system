financial planning dealergroups need replace lost revenue post fofa changes 
perhaps the key catalyst for the take managed accounts dealergroups seeking replace revenues lost 
from platform volume rebates new business old book grandfathered this seeing dealergroups effectively 
taking greater share the wealth value chain the fofa reforms banned volume based rebates from 
platforms dealergroups financial planners july importantly these volume rebates were contributing 
revenues and removing them was meaningful headwind future profitability for the dealergroups 
another important fofa change was introducing the best interests test align financial planner behaviour with 
their clients best interests fofa also added the two year advice opt and removed product commissions 
headwinds financial planners incomes 
with customers and not manufacturers now paying financial planners the value chain slowly inverting 
becoming customer not manufacturer centric exhibit this also means the equity value planner 
practice longer based arbitrary multiple revenues but rather the profitability the business this 
means creating value for customers cost efficient way becomes key motivation for financial planners 
managed accounts are better customer mousetrap because they meet more their needs than managed 
funds the better mousetrap delivering higher inflows and market share progressive financial planners

rce rgan stan ley research 
managed accounts allow dealergroups protect even expand revenues taking 
greater share the wealth value chain 
one way for dealergroups make this lost revenue shift clients into model portfolio and pick product packaging fee along the way this fee for running the model portfolio asset allocation and 
underlying fund manager selection there are two ways doing this the first traditional approach set 
model portfolio based managed funds but housed within the dealergroup and not the product 
manufacturer doing this the dealergroup trying squeeze the platform provider fees and likely can 
charge closer the other method set model portfolio based smas fees smas are lower 
than mutual funds giving dealergroups scope extract higher product packaging fee even 
greater the latter option superior for progressive planners looking grow the equity value their practice 
with differentiated offering 
with the product packaging fee financial planning dealergroups are performing additional service for the 
clients reducing potential regulatory issues what more planners are using smas then satisfying the best 
interests test seems easier smas are better structure for the end client some would even argue that not 
switching smas when they are available option not looking after the end client needs the full 
extent 
course individual planners not have the scale run the model portfolio and asset allocation process 
product packaging done dealergroup level sharing the costs between planners dealergroups need 
set investment committee perhaps bringing external asset consultants sit the committee this 
assists the integrity the investment process adding the product packaging fee means the 
dealergroup can protect even expand revenue margins taking greater share the wealth value chain 
the dealergroup can earn revenue margins with the product packaging fee margins prefofa exhibit this suits larger and more progressive independent financial advisor ifa dealergroups

who captures the increased dealergroup revenues two models emerging 
financial planner driven model better financial planners are seeking capture and retain the upside from 
growing dealergroup revenues via product packaging fees this model also delivers the best cost outcomes 
financial planners drive straight through processing from financial planning software front end xplan 
midwinter into the sma admin platform independent platforms mason stevens are perhaps best 
placed help planners deliver this they typically offer more flexible front end costs for the client are 
further reduced with duplication custodian and entry exit fees 
platform directed model platforms are seeking sustain the status quo packaging models smas for 
dealergroups under their licence while replacing traditional volume rebates with licence advice fee this 
product structure sees the scale benefits accrued the platform shared with the dealergroup the sma 
capability allows the platform capture some the admin margins traditionally found within the asset 
managers custody pricing etc which now receive pure fee for their challenge this model that ifas 
are unlikely capture the straight through processing benefits often their financial planning software not 
integrated into the platform 
planners see further growth options customers demand transparency smas 
the advice market polarising into mass market and high net worth planners will need efficient operating 
models delivering mcplans the masses robo advice tools likely assist this meanwhile many planners are 
moving upstream servicing only hnw clients smas have natural appeal financial advisors targeting hnw 
clients these clients appreciate and are increasingly demanding the beneficial ownership transparency and tax 
planning advantages smas during the gfc many planners struggled explain their clients why their 
managed funds investments were falling value with little transparency smas are tool reach the hnw 
clients helping financial advisors grow their flows and revenues along with their practice value 
meanwhile younger clients are used self control and transparency they grow their wealth and appreciate 
the difficulty investing more than handful direct stocks they will increasingly seek professional 
investment management they should naturally gravitate towards smas rather than managed funds 
cost efficiencies further boost financial practice value 
many financial planning dealergroups are managing direct stocks for their clients and sometimes also advising 
the investment decision this can cumbersome and manual process manage with record advice 
roa needed for every portfolio trade including corporate actions delays are not uncommon smas help 
outsource this cumbersome management investment professional backed admin platform 
disruptors australia financials 
reducing back office and paperwork processing for the planner were noted that financial planning practice 
could save while also spending more time with clients however understand that this 
figure could conservative with some individual planners saving over 
better processes driven smas also ensure that there delay corporate actions with clients achieving 
consistent outcomes alongside more formal investment decision making this reduces business risk and lowers 
professional insurance liability premiums 
retail stockbrokers evolving into wealth managers with little help from smas 
retail stockbrokers see managed accounts scale play and stepping stone becoming wealth managers 
managed accounts allow brokers aggregate all their client assets not just earn transaction fees direct 
share trading this brings two major benefits growing the revenue pie and also generating stable fee income 
stream the extra fees come from three sources aggregating potentially all client assets not just direct 
shares reallocating direct shares smas generating ongoing fee income and product packaging fees 
from facilitating smas and higher value add portfolio management 
while this requires shifting the mindset retail broker advisors the benefits are compelling and falling 
broking fees will maintain pressure evolve the business model for example ord minnett part ioof 
using the platform for most its client flows accumulating fua with sma 
capabilities not found elsewhere among ioof internal platforms importantly stockbrokers adopting smas are 
adding extra layer growth for sma platforms bringing off platform assets direct equities onto 
platforms for example smsfs currently hold direct equities exhibit 
btfg panorama aiming bring smas the masses 
financial group part westpac was one the pioneers wrap platforms has made substantial 
investment the new panorama platform that enables managed accounts although btfg calling them 
model portfolios for marketing purposes using its solid reputation with ifas drive greater take 
managed accounts btfg legitimised wrap platforms and now commands fua across its

ifa support btfg has substantial aligned advisor footprint its push into managed accounts likely

back the future history platforms and why master trusts will endure 
platforms evolved from the original unitised managed fund retail offering the through master trusts 
the and wraps the exhibit however platforms have added enormous costs and 
unnecessary complexity custody unit pricing administration making parts the industry inefficient legacy 
issues and incumbency mean responding change costly slow but technology now allows the break 
execution and via managed accounts 
wraps themselves are evolution master trusts that allow the individual investor select his her own 
investment managers and own the underlying units managed fund sma platforms take this one step 
forward allowing the individual investor own the underlying shares that the investment manager selects 
his her behalf this bringing greater transparency tax optimisation and cost efficiencies into the system 
also means that advisors and clients using wraps for their greater control will likely move sma platforms 
the other hand master trusts are simpler structure better suited bringing operating cost scale mass 
market offerings within super for example more efficient run corporate super offering via master 
trust structure and the low touch low demand nature the client means most are going satisfied with the 
offering 
exhibit technology now enabling wraps platforms evolve into managed accounts platforms
