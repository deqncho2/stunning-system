outlook keep your motor 
running 
rising growth coupled with laser focused expense 
management should deliver positive eps revisions 
early pullback possible rates stabilize and tax details 
debated use buying opportunity bull case builds 
throughout five key themes unfold 
buy into pullbacks after the recent standard deviation move the large cap 
bank stocks some investors are asking why not step the sidelines 
expect the stocks pull back bit early rates settle down and 
congress debates which tax breaks eliminate order lower corporate and 
personal tax rates and what infrastructure proposals run with but would 
use those pullbacks add exposures see higher probability the 
bull case unfolding than the bear case during 
base case rising expect the first third will lay the groundwork for 
the bull case tax reform and infrastructure proposals become more certain 
the details matter lot for individual stock calls have put our best guess 
impact into our bull case eps congressional decisions are made would 
expect raise our base case eps increased visibility the five key 
levers 
fiscal ignition lowering taxes and lighting loan growth
