similar outcome the financial services sector certainly possi

none the surveyed group claim have established credi

outsource most efforts the largest the outsourcers can 
material impact results valuations until least the time 
benefit from the scale efficiencies shared network while 
frame given that expect internal optimization efforts will pre 
remaining nimble largest customer outsourcer

smaller banks may benefit from outsourcing relative going 
alone but lose nimbleness which may ultimately neutralize 
digital adaptation and integration can contribute outperformance while expect the industry can shape one several ways with either large fis developing the best data sets and 
capabilities smaller firms neutralizing that through parties 
note that the largest incumbents are likely reasonably well positioned and that the threat disruption doesn necessarily portend 
poor stock performance for incumbents the retail industry performance suggests see exhibit there can outperformance 
from strong survivor bias whereby those that best adapted
