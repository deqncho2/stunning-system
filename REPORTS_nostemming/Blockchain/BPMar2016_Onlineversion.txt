asset managers systemic risk over estimated conduct risk underestimated 
contrary widely held perception mutual funds have not been source systemic risk 
redemptions were just the worst three months but stress tests new 
liquidity rules focus value for money and more intrusive regulation will require further 
adaptation including further cost pressure and new focus scale and capital 
liquidity challenges exacerbated negative rates could help not hinder index 
and etf players and those with longer lock ups think core fixed income etfs 
will increasingly used help manage fund liquidity the other end our barbell 
players with favourable lock periods may seize advantage

will fail meet their cost capital the next two years especially europe pricing 
helping but won enough ultra low rates and shifting liquidity dynamics weigh 
revenue pools the benefits scale are becoming more extreme too estimate 
market share could for grabs banks make sharper client and regional choices 
the bigger prize lies thinking the operating model estimate that longer term 
investment reshape operating models structurally removing cost and capital especially 
fixed income and currencies could lead roe uplift but may take years 
winners will those with scale but specialist banks and non banks could also prosper

financial regulation and changes

liquidity conundrum troubling more

liquidity conditions have worsened since wrote last

weigh further the market 
banks are still looking trim capacity regulatory costs 
and challenging markets continue drag returns and many 
banks are not achieving their hurdle rates expect another

this comes after wholesale banking balance sheets 
supporting traded markets have contracted riskweighted assets rwas basel iii adjusted basis 
implying terms total balance sheets since 
quantitative easing and the experiment negative rates 
are exacerbating the effects lower market liquidity 
believe central banks have underestimated the degree 
which ultra low and negative rates are affecting fixed income 
market liquidity part holders collateral hang 
existing paper given regulatory and accounting concerns 
meanwhile the cost inventories rising 
the market impact trading has increased the last 
months this the key message from our survey asset 
managers which together hold more than trillion assets 
under management aum concerns about secondary market 
liquidity are most acute europe many have little confidence 
that liquidity will improve the short medium term and all 
are concerned that lower liquidity driving price gap risk 
asset managers are still filling their orders but with more price 
impact and often across different mix counterparts 
new rules and the cumulative impact overlapping 
regulation are likely tighten liquidity further while 
policymakers have growing concerns the liquidity 
conundrum see this translating into recalibration rather 
than significant change bank rules many the 
policymakers interviewed for this report recognise the 
case recalibrate but there limited international 
agreement how about that hence why see 
growing focus how regulate asset managers new rules 
are likely carefully implemented for instance recently 
revised proposals related the fundamental review the 
trading book frtb suggest roughly half the impact 
rwas that was initially proposed however not 
anticipate significant change existing bank regulations 
asset managers systemic risk overestimated conduct risk underestimated

systemic risk mutual funds overestimated 
mutual funds have again proven not source 
systemic risk contrary widely held perceptions last 
year could not find examples runs the system for 
long term mutual funds opposed short term money 
market funds despite stress emerging markets and high 
yield and early mutual funds once again saw 
outflows line with historical norms redemptions the 
worst three months the year were line with the historical 
range versus liquid assets today across all 
corporate bond and high yield funds latest available 
data suggesting that asset managers are managing risks 
prudently and the risks are navigable this work also 
highlights that liquidity funds has increased times 
during times stress also worth remembering that 
mutual funds not own more than credit assets 
any the major categories globally albeit concerns are 
growing among market participants that when investors look

some individual managers saw much higher redemptions

those with the highest levels took significant asset hits

the pressure meet redemptions for these funds 
measured the gap between redemptions and the 
combination cash cash equivalents funds and dealer 
capacity roughly doubled asset managers and dealers 
must both harness technology explore new more efficient 
trading models uncover scarcer liquidity 
market participants are already adapting changes 
liquidity credit mutual funds are husbanding more cash 
upgrading risk management processes and generally being 
more conservative portfolio construction the focus 
shifting the primary market and longer asset holding 
periods and more barbelled portfolios liquid illiquid 
institutional mandates however think many firms will 
need more particularly regulatory costs rise many 
alternative asset managers have structural advantage 
larger funds with the scale build advanced risk 
management systems 
theory the asset management industry should have 
little fear from fund stress tests and stronger liquidity 
management guidance depending the calibration the 
nature the underlying investor base the key for mutual 
funds the some two thirds mutual funds are held 
tax incentivised retail savers who invest for the long term and 
only switch from time time europe data have seen 
supports that those pension tax wrappers also hold for far 
longer than those outside over time think policymakers 
need create predictive models for future redemptions that 
factor new risks and patterns investor behaviour right 
now macro prudential policymakers appear more focused 
systemic risks and the flow credit the real economy 
that basis think historical averages could used for 
first set stress tests however have learned from the 
bank stress tests regulators have often calibrated using 
worst case data 
conduct risk rising 
conduct rules the horizon could have profound 
effect business models and winners while the industry 
concerned primarily with tackling the multiple regulatory 
efforts liquidity management and stress testing 
believe underestimates the sheer size the emerging 
conduct wave value for money starting come the 
forefront the regulatory agenda and the closet tracking 
march 
wholesale banks asset managers 
debate entails liability risk for the industry see the 
morgan stanley blue paper 
biggest concern terms conduct spill over from 
prudential regulation such rising litigation 
our base case assumes that higher costs are necessary 
for asset managers respond more stringent conduct 
rules expect incremental conduct compliance related 
costs put further pressure margins 
combined with increased costs for upgrading trading and 
liquidity management this could push costs around 
across the industry believe the mid sized players many 
which are captive within large financial institutions 
underestimate the need for change and have not touched the 
core the operating model our bear case for pick 
litigation the back this conduct risk all this implies 
that will critical for shareholders and investors alike 
carefully monitor capital largely unmanaged resource 
asset management 
liquidity challenges could help not hinder index 
and etf players 
contrary concerns liquidity fixed income exchange 
traded funds etfs may actually benefit negative rates 
and asset manager liquidity guidelines and stress tests should 
boost fixed income etfs our analysis one example 
support for fixed income etfs like equities has been 
sweep for cash coming set leave our meetings 
showed that growing number managers are open this 
including leaving etfs longer term buffer that said 
they also revealed schism between managers who value 
etfs and those who not wish seen using etfs 
their active funds the largest firms hedge funds and 
insurance companies sounded far less reluctant have 
competitor cusips isins their portfolios than some their 
mid sized peers 
however expect etf growth focus increasingly 
larger more liquid asset classes see incremental 
assets under management coming from core asset classes 
scale and tracking error challenges put pressure lower 
liquidity areas these may constrain some smart beta players 
less liquid strategies the bear case for etfs though 
that regulators take action for example more onerous 
liquidity buffers for etfs themselves stem their rise 
players with longer lock periods may able take 
advantage open ended strategies that depend liquidity 
for alpha will more constrained which could lead some 
convergence returns this should benefit alternative 
managers with longer liquidity locks although strategies that 
depend leverage may find increasingly difficult obtain 
financing from the street estimate that trillion 
open ended mutual fund exposure emerging markets 
and high yield assets where liquidity challenges are most 
intense more closed end segregated mandate ownership 
these assets could help new technology dramatically 
reduce mandate sizes 
leaders the solutions space should also emerge 
winners but expect the field narrow sharply 
see attractive growth opportunities for multi asset solutions 
however the field looks set narrow ultra low rates 
and liquidity challenge the model and some providers 
struggle make the transition from product provider 
broader advisory role 
banks heavy pruning necessary boost 
returns 
our base case that many investment banks especially 
europe will fail achieve their cost capital over the 
next two years only further restructuring capacity shrinkage 
and changing the business model can drive recovery our 
view pricing starting help but will not enough 
its own scale benefits are becoming ever more extreme 
posing tough questions for managements outside the top five 
franchises any area 
ultra low rates new regulation and thin liquidity have 
structurally changed the client opportunity for banks and 
the industry still grappling with this since client 
sales have fallen per year clients have become 
more selective over when and how trade critically banks 
are now much less able monetise this flow despite 
removing trillion balance sheet similar amount 
rwa and billion cost since there still too 
much capacity our view relative the forward looking 
client revenue opportunity 
with around one third banks performing below hurdle 
rates expect tough decisions about withdrawing 
capital from parts the business banks have trimmed 
hard but most still hold onto range sub hurdle 
businesses preserve optionality and for fear negative 
impact the wider franchise yet our analysis suggests that 
while scale benefits are strong within product region they 
are much less marked the wholesale banking level 
expect more restructuring banks whittle down the 
activities and client groups where they can build edge this 
could put market share for grabs similar 
size the wave restructuring

longer term competitive advantage lies 
thinking the operating model 
the bigger prize now lies reshaping the operating 
model banks will need streamline infrastructure transform 
sales models and push towards electronic and alternative 
execution think this could lead net roe uplift 
for the industry but over several years and requiring 
considerable investment those under earnings pressure may 
struggle capture these benefits unless they make tough 
choices free cost capital and management bandwidth 
see most scope reform operating models fixed 
income think economic pressures will push more banks 
create capital light models supporting new execution 
styles our interviews with asset managers suggest that there 
widespread support for this transition with some pushing 
volumes alternative platforms improve liquidity however 
there still lot inertia and most investors still view deep 
relationships with core set banks vital weather 
volatile markets and scarce liquidity 
non banks will grow importance and could capture

shifting liquidity dynamics and persistently low rates are 
making ever harder monetise client activity flow fixed

already becoming strong force sub scale banks are 
increasingly likely believe opt for partnerships with 
third party liquidity providers and offer white label solutions 
accepting revenue loss for cost and capital release 
credit there battle for control data networks banks 
shift towards quasi agency role and anticipate growing 
use non bank balance sheets 
yet range viable ficc models looks likely stay 
institutional flow trading the area under most pressure but 
represents only ficc revenues our analysis 
other areas such debt capital markets corporate hedging 
and foreign exchange solutions and illiquid credit trading 
remain more attractive the larger players will committed 
across the board believe leveraging their scale 
advantage terms technology and depth internal 
liquidity smaller players will have carve out profitable 
niches believe and exit outsource other activities 
changes client behaviour are both challenge and 
opportunity for the sell side clients are becoming ever 
more sophisticated managing their order flow and dealer

tackling infrastructure costs critical could 
morgan stanley blue paper 
released billion costs relatively few firms 
have managed rationalise their technology platforms 
governance and controls but the stakes are high there 
less low hanging fruit the front office now banks have 
already cut costs over the past five years but infrastructure costs have stayed resolute complex regulatory 
initiatives have offset any benefits success over the next two 
three years will hinge banks being able overhaul their 
infrastructure cost base and respond new technologies 
revenues the wane scale models 
benefiting for now 
our base case sees revenues down putting 
ever greater pressure management teams act the 
combination turning credit and equity markets with ultra low 
interest rates creating particularly tough cyclical headwinds 
addition structural client changes and capacity 
withdrawal this would imply ficc down since 
more broadly wholesale banking fee pools would 
lower proportion gdp than any time since 
save the crisis our bear case calibrated equity market 
corrections over the past years which have typically 
wiped out four six quarters earnings 
cyclical headwinds highlight structural over capacity 
equities and investment banking banks have skewed 
towards these areas pursuit capital light growth yet 
many are offering waterfront service without the scale 
cover the heavy fixed cost base equities only the largest 
global players and truly specialist firms are set return 
profit over the cycle banking are effectively seeing 
fragmentation into attractive and unattractive segments the 
collapse leveraged finance concentration the top 
growing role for boutiques and fight for deal economics are 
particularly squeezing the middle 
deteriorating conditions emerging markets are turning 
the heat sub scale international networks many 
banks have retained considerable optionality markets 
where they have long suffered from weak economics with 
returns average only half those local players asia 
particular pain point think more banks will trim further 
while the benefits scale are stark see viable 
options for specialist models built around clients and 
regions average the top five banks any given asset 
class generate more pretax profit per dollar capital 
deployed than the next five yet many banks excel one 
region product and not another and the economic 
benefits size the overall wholesale level are more muted 
the near term integrated scale players stand benefit 
they pivot invest operating model reform and consolidate 
share yet all those spoke saw very strong role for 
specialist providers reinforcing our view that narrow focused 
models can also produce advantaged economics the 
challenge for these banks build portfolios businesses 
that are mutually reinforcing and attractive through the cycle 
think this will make choices across regions and across 
client groups more important than ever driving strategy 
players ultra low negative rates 
trump structural opportunities 
see opportunities for market infrastructure 
players step into modular supply and demand chains and 
offer services the buy and sell side for estimated prize 
billion new revenue however they will have 
this the face pressured economics growing liquidity 
and operational risks and regulatory challenges upgrades 
risk management could add industry costs

low rates and regulations are challenging the economics 
custodians and clearers with more costs likely pushed 
clients ultra low interest rates are placing downward 
pressure net interest income and causing questions for 
custodians and clearers around collateral types and

sell side has come reside with these players who facilitate 
intraday trading across markets and timing conventions

markets tightening financial conditions while economic 
growth remains positive territory cash spreads trade 
recessionary levels and the lack liquidity explains some 
this disconnect more importantly there direct cost the 
macro economy from the higher illiquidity premia terms 
greater borrowing costs particular this translates into 
meaningfully higher costs for borrowers especially highyield corporates beyond cyclical factors which ultimately 
could limit capital access setting off the feedback loop 
tighter financial conditions this effect beginning manifest

the good news that believe regulations have probably

banks now have clear line sight steady state capital

messages from our proprietary survey 
key takeaways from our meetings with senior executives asset managers with over trillion combined assets under management 
investors are increasingly concerned about credit market liquidity 
although the last months have not seen material deterioration there 
little confidence improvement the near medium term 
there overall agreement the need for better liquidity risk 
management across the industry but most think their practices and 
systems are robust enough 
the greatest challenges are seen emerging markets and high yield 
although concern extends broader corporate credit non agency 
mortgages rates and emerging market 
all have policies monitor liquidity and consistent portfolio reviews and 
mechanisms handle redemptions 
trades are still being done what has changed how and what price 
point 
many establish liquidity thresholds daily nav vehicles assessing 
historical worst redemption experience over various time horizons 
many are concerned that bank regulation has impaired market making 
and hence liquidity while the shift sell side structure from principal 
agency hampering liquidity and increasing the risk price gap 
there are mixed views etf usage help manage liquidity some 
consider etfs liquid securities within credit funds and are 
comfortable using few hundred basis points the portfolio 
whereas others prefer futures 
all are concerned that lower liquidity exaggerating market moves 
less liquid securities 
many mutual funds have inter fund lending arrangements and credit 
facilities help manage redemptions but for emergency use only 
near term impacts greater liquidity premium cost borrowing for 
corporates longer term solution innovation structures and product 
investors are building larger liquidity premiums given concerns 
market liquidity and their ability exit positions the investment thesis 
changes 
institutional focused firms can use customised mandates take greater 
liquidity risks and generate client alpha 
the buy side trying limit the number counterparties improve 
access the balance sheet from the sell side some still use many 
dealers but expect reduction from here 
some see daily nav funds migrating higher capital structures order 
keep funds more liquid and nimble however this could lead 
homogenisation holdings 
many see innovation critical terms mutual fund structures 
well significant development fixed income markets reduced 
issues corporates 
alternative asset managers with longer dated capital see opportunities 
liquidity constrained environment with significant price volatility 
alts increasingly see value certain credits that trade below intrinsic 
value largely because the lack liquidity but they are taking buyand hold maturity view because their ability exit may limited 
sec proposal welcome though seen too prescriptive certain areas 
investors are supportive the direction the sec proposals though 
some feel they are prescriptive mainly regard liquidity classification 
buckets and fund sizing 
some fear the liquidity bucket proposals could impair liquidity and 
returns everyone rushes own the same liquid assets and 
dispersion among holdings decreases 
many want see more global regulatory consistency and coordination 
for example the use gates extremes 
most view the illiquidity limit reasonable some also recommend 
self report system getting close that level 
swing pricing viewed good thing currently not allowed the 
but sec proposals could enable funds enact swing pricing 
europeans await new rules with interest those familiar with aifmd feel 
good basis and are ease with new rules 
electronic platforms may successful but will tough unless 
dealer community involved 
some believe that electronic market makers are far ahead brokers 
but the latter have all the relationships solution could partnership 
between the two 
many want the forefront electronic trading but are agnostic 
platforms despite the number proposals many are sceptical that they 
hold the solution and see dealer community involvement critical

our research shows that equity allocated wholesale 
banking has increased around since even

managed down rwas and balance sheets and the capital

businesses has increased approximately billion 
banks have worked build capital ratios 
the adoption the fundamental review the trading 
book frtb and total loss absorbing capacity tlac 
will nudge capital requirements yet higher estimate 
moving the frtb will push rwa for wholesale 
divisions before mitigating actions some banks are 
already implementing initiatives that will help move rwa the 
other direction such running off legacy assets and 
upgrading risk measurement frameworks think these will 
reduce the overall increase rwa for wholesale divisions 
closer but compared previous regulations the scope 
for reducing rwas through technical factors more limited 
the impact will skewed across products however and most 
severe for less liquid products such parts credit and 
structured businesses further headwinds will come from 
tlac albeit with widely skewed impact across the banks 
banks face very different trade offs driving these 
constraints down businesses industry level 
expect leverage ratios remain the binding constraint 
capital rather than rwa even after the frtb for individual 
banks however the constraints vary widely depending 
group level limitations and priorities this means that banks 
are increasingly viewing the same businesses through very 
different return metrics with different weights applied rwa 
leverage and liquidity constraints stress test based

lending and are now struggling monetise the balance sheet 
deployed our interviews with corporates indicate that 
many markets cheap lending not differentiating factor 
and with reciprocity guiding allocations many banks have 
simply extended lending clients that will not generate 
sufficient revenues repay these costs 
most mid sized players need think long and hard about 
how remove excess capacity see potential 
streamline overlapping coverage layers and take more 
selective approach regions and sectors for some this 
could mean aligning more closely with transaction banking 
and skewing towards cfo treasurer coverage for others 
could mean aligning more closely with wealth management

the network effect justifying sub hurdle activity interregional activity has consistently driven only sales 
and trading revenues for the past years most this 
activity takes place between the largest global hubs with 
only small fraction industry activity from non core

reality given cost pressures and expect more come

the exception has been certain asset 
classes 
the crunch liquidity emerging markets can seen 
clearly below which shows that traded volumes local 
currency emerging market bond funds have declined 
around since their peak september while 
roughly half this decline can explained dollar 
appreciation versus emerging currencies over this period the 
underlying trend clear and highlights the pressure that 
international banks are under slim down their balance 
sheets moreover although hard currency dollardenominated bond traded volumes look stable this against 
backdrop increased issuance with debt outstanding 
growing since september also signalling 
the reduced market liquidity 
overall when looking emerging market funds outflows 
have been similar the worst experience approximately

responds proactively the greater regulatory focus further 
improving transparency terms liquidity and leverage 
whereas our interviews and action from asset managers

lock periods lengthening redemption notice periods 
help manage liquidity 
however there are barriers more structural change for

flexibility and theory could even trigger run while not 
our base case see rising risk extended dislocation 
high yield credit markets which could create negative 
feedback loop that increases the risk our bear case 
transpiring for example liquidity crisis affecting retail 
money would likely lead significantly wider range 
regulatory outcomes for asset managers and such gating 
redemptions could become more commonplace particularly 
fund outflows accelerate fund liquidity levels not improve

sec proposals raise the bar but see 
europeans more insulated than 
given the clear shift liquidity risk asset owners and the 
buy side policymakers continue focus how best 
respond this end view the recent sec proposals 
liquidity management rules for mutual funds just the start 
ongoing process which will likely culminate greater 
transparency stress tests and potential position limits 
instruments deemed too illiquid within funds 
from our interviews and analysis draw two conclusions 
see scope for more institutional focused asset 
managers cope better with redemptions and lower liquidity 
given the ability often protected contractual terms for 
segregated mandates transferred end clients without 
the need convert the asset cash 
european firms appear somewhat better positioned than 
their peers for example two thirds the trillion 
european retail industry ucits format where many 
the sec proposals are already part the existing ucits 
directive particularly given that these rules are patterned 
the stricter bank regulation take for example the ucits 
funds mandate 
similarly for european funds falling under the alternative 
investment funds directive aifmd there are strict 
requirements 
below lay out the asset exposures our global coverage 
names give some sense potential vulnerability 
dislocation reduced liquidity fixed income markets our 
european stock picks reflect our view that players with 
outsized exposure credit especially emerging markets and 
high yield with weaker macro backdrop emerging 
markets are likely face the biggest challenges hence 
aberdeen and ashmore are our least preferred while 
schroders and henderson have limited exposure retail 
fixed income for amundi although has large overall 
exposure the retail component low the bulk its fixed 
income assets are managed behalf captive institutional 
and insurance clients natixis faces greater headwinds its 
mutual fund business given exposure credit funds via 
loomis 
among the asset managers view franklin most 
challenged given its disproportionate exposure emerging 
market debt and more broadly retail fixed income our top 
picks include blackrock with its leading ishares etf platform 
broad product offering and limited less than exposure 
retail fixed income 
among the australian asset managers macquarie has the 
largest fixed income business with funds under 
management fum however just fum comprises 
retail fixed income the underlying assets are largely 
investment grade credit perpetual has the largest retail 
fixed income presence with fum predominantly 
investment grade credit would highlight that the company

away from the investment bank the better returning

our top picks are informed our work the long term 
secular and cyclical outlook from this depth study take 
into account where are ahead market expectations and 
returns and balance this with risk reward analysis how 
much safety margin there our assessment 
europe prefer names where positioning strong 
equities right sized ficc allows for superior returns for 
example ubs overweight are wary heavy 
restructuring names where reliance non core sell down 
top line improvement may harder achieve today 
market environment credit suisse and barclays equalweight particularly where capital build steady state 
looks challenge deutsche bank equal weight like 
light restructuring stories bnp overweight and those where 
see the underlying business franchise undervalued the 
market royal bank scotland overweight prefer 
market infrastructure names over asset managers given the 
risks euronext and flow traders overweight are also 
positive amundi overweight among the asset managers 
given positioning benefit from and capital strength our 
least preferred stocks are standard chartered hsbc and 
aberdeen all underweight 
north america among the large cap banks prefer 
morgan bank america and goldman sachs all 
overweight each for very different reasons the three 
morgan offers the highest risk adjusted returns with rote 
our estimates and the least volatility 
also trimming high capital cost businesses which could drive 
our estimated returns over time capital invested the 
business fades like bank america for its and more 
plain vanilla ficc skew less credit volatility and less global 
volatility goldman sachs offers top product position 
each global region see its earnings coiled spring 
energy stabilises and market volatility settles down 
japan have overweight rating nomura holdings 
after the central bank boj surprise decision late january 
adopt negative interest rate the stock sold off and now 
trades around believe the 
market has yet digest the potential impact financial 
institutions this policy move although there view that 
one potential positive outcome could equification the 
japanese market which could eventually benefit investment 
banks and asset managers while nomura does not face the 
same pressure shrink its capital intensive operations that 
some its european peers the firm does still need 
this indeed the process cutting its global wholesale 
cost base light the global ficc revenue pie shrinkage 
expect the process take few quarters its earnings 
outlook over the next quarter two likely tough and 
the pace recovery the shares could slow for some 
time that said the current price seems have incorporated 
the earnings downside risk extent hence see more 
upside than downside month horizon 
australia our top pick investment management 
overweight its earnings diversity global distribution and 
cost flexibility are attractive while margin expansion continues 
via hambro funds and stronger domestic business mix 
have equal weight rating macquarie group while 
does not face the same capital and liquidity driven pressure 
shrink many global wholesale banks and its business

even though economic activity has slowed some

though recession risks have risen morgan stanley 
economists not expect imminent recession their base 
case while corporate defaults have picked default wave

spreads are the range seen during the full blown recession 
when credit defaults were meaningfully higher

illiquidity premia our view 
higher illiquidity premia credit markets here stay

can gain valuable insight from the prevailing conditions

traded about tighter than the single name cds all 
the constituents the index all but four which trade the 
clearing house and thus without counterparty exposure 
issues turn the single name cds trade about 
tighter than the spreads the cash bonds the constituent 
issuers what explains this phenomenon 
least part the reason believe lies the higher cash 
balances being carried funds due expected redemptions 
and the heightened prospect regulatory requirements 
related liquidity one way making for the lost carry 
sell protection the cdx index stressed market 
scenario cdx would easy unwind given its superior

the challenges sourcing and dealer balance sheet 
constraints which are greater for cash bonds than for singlename cds post crisis the cash synthetic basis averaged
