our industry 
the automotive and commercial vehicle parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules oems for the manufacture new vehicles 
well the aftermarket for use replacement parts overall expect long term growth global vehicle production the oem market global 
vehicle production including light and commercial vehicles increased versus the previous year including increases europe china and 
south america however after several years increases consumer demand for vehicles north america receded resulting year over year decrease 
north american production 
demand for automotive components the oem market generally function the number new vehicles produced response consumer demand which 
primarily driven macro economic factors such credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends the 
commercial vehicle market oem demand for components also tied vehicle production and driven industrial production the amount freight tonnage 
being transported and the availability credit and interest rates among other factors although oem demand tied actual vehicle production participants 
the automotive and commercial vehicle parts industry also have the opportunity grow faster further penetrating business with existing customers and 
existing markets gaining new customers and increasing presence global markets above market growth can achieved through product alignment favorable 
macro trends such increasingly stringent regulations and growing consumer demand for electrification the number vehicles utilizing electrification 
expected grow more than global vehicle production compared just four percent today global supplier with advanced technology 
engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities are well positioned benefit from these opportunities 
heightened regulatory environment 
oems continue focus improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions order meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements various markets 
worldwide basis the relevant authorities the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have 
already instituted regulations requiring further reductions emissions and increased fuel economy many cases other authorities have initiated legislation 
regulation that would further tighten standards through and beyond based the current regulatory environment believe that oems including those 
the and china will required reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation 
oems and suppliers are forced find ways improve fuel injection and combustion efficiency engine management electrical power consumption vehicle 
weight and integration alternative powertrains electric hybrid propulsion result suppliers such delphi technologies are continuing develop 
innovations that result improvements fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine 
downsizing without loss performance 
standardization sourcing oems

supply relationships with our customers 
typically supply products our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed general terms and conditions established each 
oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer customer they typically contemplate relationship under which our customers place orders for 
their requirements specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required purchase any minimum amount products from these 
relationships typically extend over the life the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect each business award which may subject adjustments 
under certain circumstances such commodity foreign exchange escalation escalation clauses for cost reductions achieved the terms and 
conditions typically provide that are subject warranty the products supplied most cases the duration such warranty coterminous with the 
warranty offered the oem the end user the vehicle may also obligated share all part recall costs the oem recalls its vehicles for 
defects attributable our products 
individual purchase orders are terminable for cause non performance and most cases upon our insolvency and certain change control events addition 
many our oem customers have the option terminate for convenience certain programs which permits our customers impose pressure pricing during 
the life the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration the vehicle program potentially reducing our profit margins and increasing 
the risk our losing future sales under those purchase contracts manufacture and ship based customer release schedules normally provided weekly 
basis which can vary due cyclical automobile production dealer inventory levels 
although customer programs typically extend future periods and although there expectation that will supply certain levels oem production during 
such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited 
specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm 
orders are typically fulfilled promptly possible from the conversion available raw materials sub components and work process inventory for oem 
orders and from current hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount such purchase order releases hand and not processed

cost cutting initiatives adopted our customers result increased downward pressure pricing our customer supply agreements generally require step downs 
component pricing over the period production typically one two percent per year addition our customers often reserve the right terminate their 
supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers 
including because the automotive component supply industry highly competitive serves limited number customers has high fixed cost base and 
historically has had excess capacity based these factors and the fact that our customers product programs typically last number years and are anticipated 
encompass large volumes our customers are able negotiate favorable pricing accordingly tier supplier one that supplies vehicle components directly 
manufacturers are subject substantial continuing pressure from oems reduce the price our products for example our customer supply agreements 
generally provide for annual reductions pricing our products over the period production possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could 
intensify oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives our financial performance therefore dependent our ability continue achieve product

that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the and other economies and specifically the automotive sector particular changes international trade 
agreements such the north american free trade agreement other political pressures could affect the operations our oem customers resulting reduced 
automotive production certain regions shifts the mix production higher cost regions increases interest rates could also negatively impact automotive 
production result increased consumer borrowing costs reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result shifts the mix 
future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars reductions 
industrial production and the corresponding level freight tonnage being transported while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our 
flexible cost structure have well positioned withstand the impact industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts the mix global
