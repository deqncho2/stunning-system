nawa and were appointed 
denso first outside directors 
which means that the company history 
with outside directors extremely short 
the time our appointment not 
sure denso understood what kind 
impact outside directors would have 
the company however governance 
something that changes through trial 
and error accordance with the characteristics company business the 
introduction the outside directors has 
given denso opportunity make 
significant progress enhancing the 
function its governance system and 
the board directors denso board 
directors very open and management welcoming comments and

much possible enable make 
much stronger and better informed 
contribution the board discussion 
outside directors 
takashi nawa 
also agree that denso governance 
has evolved during this two year period 
however the company still faces several 
issues for example believe necessary for denso deepen its debate 
what the quality management practice other words important for 
the company return the basics and 
deliberate management issues from 
the perspective customers and society whole believe that denso 
commitment quality and performance 
manufacturing unmatched and this 
precisely why would like see the 
company thoroughly pursue that same 
level commitment terms the 
quality management practice well 
olcott 
also believe that denso boasts 
world class level manufacturing and 
this will continue enhance its global 
competitiveness the long term 
however also believe that denso can 
make further improvements its strategic decision making process for many 
japanese companies not only denso 
there need for the board decisionmaking process based thorough 
debate that emphasizes real strategic 
content rather than ritualistic 
approach the agenda which has 
outside director 
takashi nawa 
nawa has been serving outside director with the 
company since also works professor 
hitotsubashi university graduate school international 
corporate strategy well senior advisor the 
boston consulting group 
prevailed the past without thorough airing high level strategic issues 
the board our role outside directors limited but would emphasize 
that what separates denso from many 
other companies its desire enable 
outside directors properly understand 
both its strong and weak aspects which 
turn allows take part the 
decision making process informed 
way even when high level technical 
knowledge required our role outside directors satisfied that the 
company has clear management vision 
and rational and realistic strategy 
place realize that vision need 
ensure that major investment decisions 
are consistent with this strategy from 
this perspective would like further 
deepen the content debates the 
board directors going forward 
the role outside directors 
enhancing denso competitiveness 
through governance 
nawa 
believe extremely important for the 
decisions being made now properly 
reflect the company underlying management vision and strategy role 
outside director constantly 
question the motivation behind the 
company decisions and what the 
company intends making 
those decisions 
olcott 
denso global company providing 
its products and services customers 
around the world however the 
company employees particularly its 
management consist predominantly 
japanese males who joined the company 
straight from university and who have 
only had experience working for denso 
this sense denso typical japanese 
community firm while this brings 
number advantages competing 
increasingly global environment means 
that denso needs accelerate changes 
its thinking human resource management promoting diversity much more 
aggressively especially the senior 
ranks while employees are important 
stakeholders need consider the 
entire denso global workforce equal 
members this stakeholder group see 
one missions ensure that 
this reflected board deliberations 
and decisions this critical factor 
building denso long term competitiveness and corporate value 
necessary steps further improve 
corporate value 
nawa 
believe denso extremely honest 
company which gives clear sense 
its spirit and underlying values 
order become even better company however denso needs provide 
society with products and services 
even higher value doing denso 
will become company that society 
itself needs part this process 
cycle needs established that connects this higher social value with financial value and the proper governance 
systems must place secure such 
cycle believe that aiming realize 
this kind company denso will 
improve its quality management practice which had mentioned earlier 
olcott 
with the discontinuity and disruptive 
innovation that occurring the automotive industry denso faces 
extremely difficult operating environment going forward this kind environment the board directors must 
become much stronger forum for 
debate ensure that the company can 
strategically and promptly respond 
challenges they arise believe that
