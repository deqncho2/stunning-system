toyota motor launching toyota safety sense active safety package 
toyota has developed active safety system called toyota safety sense aimed 
preventing collisions wide range vehicle speeds and aiding damage reduction 
slated for launch the two packages will priced levels chosen encourage 
widespread use and will rolled out across most passenger models and grades 
japan north america and europe the end toyota safety sense integrates 
several toyota existing active safety technologies the pre collision system pcs 
helps prevent and mitigate collisions lane departure alert lda helps prevent vehicles 
from departing from their lanes and causing accident and ahb helps ensure optimal 
forward visibility during nighttime driving the packages combine laser radar millimeterwave radar with camera achieving high recognition performance and reliability and 
offering multi faceted approach active safety two packages will available 
depending the vehicle type package for compact cars and package for

the toyota safety sense package features three proprietary active safety technologies 
pcs lda and ahb and combines single lens camera and laser radar ensure 
outstanding performance and reliability the package helps prevent mitigate collisions 
even high speeds pcs detects objects ahead the vehicle and when there the 
possibility collision prompts the driver brake with audio and visual alert when the 
driver notices the hazard and brakes the system provides additional braking force the

reducing speed approximately that much denso supplies the sensor unit for the toyota 
safety sense package which will rolled out summer primarily mid sized 
and luxury passenger cars 
the toyota used both laser radar and millimeter wave radar high end 
models such the crown majesta but decided discontinue use the laser radar 
because poor detection performance bad weather use these sensors has been 
revived the toyota safety sense packages which feature laser radar that smaller 
size and mounted inside the vehicle for greater weather resistance under toyota new 
tnga global vehicle platform the sensor units will shared across different models this 
along with mass production has helped keep costs down setting certain parameters 
such the sensor unit relative positioning and tilt performance kept standard 
regardless the vehicle size and shape the pre crash safety system previously 
employed vehicles such the lexus toyota used stereo camera seems that 
not every vehicle will switched over the new single lens camera systems some will 
continue feature stereo camera technology 
toyota also has greatly enhanced its parking assist technology toyota intelligent park

clearance sonar ics function help prevent mitigate collisions through automated 
braking addition new multi point turn support function automatically controls steering 
tight parking spaces requiring repeated back and forth movements another partiallyautomated function assists departure from parallel parking spaces with little room front 
and behind the vehicle this made possible through the use greater numbers

automation issues 
from people systems non technical issues solve before adoption 
fully autonomous vehicles are moving closer reality but many issues not related 
advances technology stand the way widespread adoption the moment the 
assumption that all responsibility for vehicle control lies with the driver who has the right 
navigate their car within infrastructure defined roads and signage however 
replacing driver with vehicle within this framework throws raft problems 
according working group the ministry land infrastructure and transport mlit 
which looked issues related autonomous vehicles number hurdles need 
overcome ahead adoption such regulations public acceptance road infrastructure 
commercialization demand and economic impact 
terms the regulatory framework changes current driving license systems will 
required ahead any shift driverless cars for example drivers will need have some 
understanding autonomous driving systems how work them and what those 
systems malfunction also the level demand from the public could issue which 
might require initiatives tackle misplaced confidence conversely distrust driverless 
cars adoption would also conditional the understanding and acceptance 
pedestrians and other road users commercialize and generate demand for 
autonomous vehicles there would have balance between investment 
infrastructure and benefits for society well the creation service models the 
private sector given these and other non technical issues the mlit working group sees 
good prospects for shift more advanced driver support technologies but thinks the 
adoption fully autonomous vehicles unlikely happen the near future

legal and regulatory framework 
the world traffic laws are based the assumption that vehicles are controlled people 
the basis for these laws the geneva convention road traffic ratified the 
japan and many other countries and the vienna convention road traffic 
signed mainly european countries the vienna convention clearly states that every 
driver shall all times able control his her vehicle autonomous driving systems use 
information from the surrounding environment make decisions and control the vehicle 
instead the driver the existing legal framework would have revised before 
driverless cars can become reality 
the vienna convention road traffic was fact amended allow autonomous 
vehicles with the aim cutting road traffic accidents and addressing aging population and 
environmental issues the amendment states that autonomous driving systems would 
recognized under the convention provided they comply with relevant international laws

driver rights and responsibilities 
mentioned earlier the current assumption that the driver has sole control the vehicle 
presents significant obstacle legal and regulatory amendments and the adoption 
driverless cars currently all national traffic laws are based this assumption the 
event accident during driving almost all responsibility lies with the driver 
discussions have now started many countries about who liable autonomous driving 
systems not people are control the vehicle manufacturers would face significant 
risks they were required take sole responsibility for accidents caused their systems 
likely hampering the development and commercialization driverless cars 
ideas about who should take responsibility differ from country country one view the 
that driverless systems become more advanced and drivers have less control 
drivers should able override autonomous systems that they retain some control 
over their vehicle the early stages adoption least europe the view that 
driverless cars should have systems that constantly monitor the driver condition and 
always allow him her override autonomous control emergency this would ensure 
the driver retains some level responsibility for the control autonomous vehicles the 
approach japan slightly different given there sure way proving driver 
judgment and awareness during autonomous driving the view that liability for accidents

should transferred external parties under mlit proposals anybody buying 
autonomous vehicle would required sign third party insurance contract the

how retain the joys driving and car ownership 
although the public and private sectors have joined together pursue automation 
technologies japan the and europe automakers have been reluctant 
commercialize fully automated vehicles this largely because great number 
technological obstacles remain but believe also partly because concerns that 
the spread self driving vehicles could destroy the added value that only automakers 
have been able put into vehicles 
increased traction for autonomous vehicle concept could increase the emphasis autos 
mode transportation and substantially shift the focus away from the pleasures 
driving and car ownership that many owners enjoy for instance autonomous vehicles 
lead greater car sharing this could exacerbate the ongoing decline car ownership 
automakers have pursued automation technologies way appealing customers 
from the perspectives the environment safety and comfort but another key theme 
today auto market how the joys driving and owning vehicle can preserved 
toyota has unveiled prototype self driving vehicle but the message has conveyed 
through various media seems that this point wary commercializing fully 
autonomous vehicle 
believe driver assistance topics will the focus automation technologies for now 
automakers strive preserve the joy driving daimler exhibited fully automated 
concept car the luxury motion some acclaim ces but had 
steering wheel and other elements allow driver control the vehicle bmw like 
toyota seems see semi automated driving central theme next generation 
vehicles from safety perspective the other hand surveys conducted google and 
others suggest today consumers place greater emphasis convenience safety 
innovation reliability luxury and fuel efficiency this means more difficult for 
automakers establish differentiation with engine transmission specs interior design 
elements and other considerations that were more highly valued consumers the past 
automakers product development efforts will need balance these considerations while 
preserving the joy driving and owning cars

suppliers the auto parts sector well for companies other sectors including 
industrial electronics consumer electronics and electronic components robust demand 
growth likely for components essential self driving systems including various sensors 
required for peripheral surveillance decision making and steering well ecus and 
actuators will impossible for automakers handle all these technologies their 
own and this likely lead many opportunities for suppliers boost added value 
throughout the supply chain 
progress with automation will drive demand for sensors with more accurate detection and 
recognition functions and ecus that can handle larger data loads and more complex 
operations this likely mean growth not just for the largest tier suppliers but also 
for electronic components makers semiconductor makers and lower tier suppliers 
because the great number devices involved similarly control logic and other 
software will become increasingly important developments automation will prompt

expect millimeter wave radar used for longer distances while the lowcost millimeter wave radar will used for shorter distances millimeter wave 
radar sensors emit radio waves certain frequencies and receive waves reflected back 
from objects distance and relative speed measured using the time between wave 
transmission and reception and changes frequency such systems offer good detection 
performance and can measure distances including large distances with great accuracy 
while detecting shapes using existing systems difficult millimeter wave radar are also 
highly durable challenging weather thick fog snow heavy rain systems using waves can detect objects ahead but their relatively high cost

depending the scale mass production the equipment built using silicon circuit 
boards millimeter wave radar has date been used only for vehicle detection but 
their detection capabilities improve should future possible use them detect 
pedestrians well 
systems employing waves are used for shorter distances around their 
strengths are their low cost and wide viewing angle they can detect shorter distances 
they are widely used the sides and the rear vehicles suppliers short range

omnidirectional laser scanners 
omnidirectional laser scanners are experimental devices used the development 
future fully automated cars think their mass production commercialization still some 
way off designed not for individual adas functions but rather for total automation 
omnidirectional laser scanners detect objects the vehicle environment using degree 
infrared scanning combined with highly accurate mapping data they can detect 
vehicle position and the location objects around with high degree precision 
said the heart google self driving cars they are currently made company 
velodyne which supplies them for the experimental self driving cars various 
manufacturers 
although omnidirectional laser scanners offer outstanding performance their per vehicle 
cost high and they are very large their structure basically the same that the 
laser radar systems discussed above but they carry very high prices they incorporate 
number laser light sources that rotate inside the body the device velodyne laser 
scanner has laser emitters and priced roughly the same luxury 
passenger car the unit large and can only mounted the roof creating various 
installation issues

european and companies leading automation market but expect 
non auto companies such denso gain share over the longer term 
estimate that the automation market typified adas currently worth around 
and that european and companies are the lead according our estimates 
continental commanded the global automation market autoliv and 
robert bosch far larger shares than those other companies non auto sector 
companies had but even denso which had the largest share among japanese megasuppliers had market share only this because key customer toyota motor was 
somewhat late developing mass market vehicles fitted with adas such aeb 
however expect denso gain share will supply toyota safety sense for midand high class models toyota plans include its toyota safety sense accident 
prevention and safety package its entire line from also expect continental 
which has track record supplying products for mass produced vehicles gain share 
for now due supply toyota safety sense packages which are another 
accident prevention and safety package for toyota compact cars euro ncap will 
include evaluation pedestrian detection systems from think toyota might 
eventually adopt systems that combine millimeter wave radar and mono camera sensors 
also compact cars and that the process denso might try win share from 
continental the mass produced vehicle segment

denso outperform 
denso set benefit from automation technology market growth more than 
any other automotive parts company under our coverage 
denso wide ranging approach the development and commercialization automation 
technologies means the company looks set benefit from automation technology market 
growth more than any other auto parts maker under our coverage denso also one 
only few japanese suppliers capable engaging the battle for market share even 
competition expected intensify the automation market including with megasuppliers from europe and the denso internal targets include capturing share 
the adas market and securing operating margins above the company wide 
average 
expect sales automation adas technologies rise from the current level 
over and over this basis expect rise 
from the current just over and just below date 
denso has supplied automation products toyota for use the lexus and other models 
but expect growth denso automation sales and pick pace from with 
the full scale introduction toyota safety sense active safety package for mid sized 
and high end cars denso may also engage rapid business development with 
companies other than toyota once application design simplified through the 
standardization active safety packages line with the toyota new global architecture 
tnga platform 
denso particularly strong position because the company portfolio includes nearly 
all the technology elements used automation including camera sensors both 
mono stereo millimeter wave radar including laser sensors and 
ecu the company can therefore combine these elements different ways according 
the specifications particular car models for sensor fusion area where 
anticipate growing demand denso has long track record automation technologies 
even supplying the radar and camera sensors used toyota high end vehicles the 
denso has also supplied millimeter wave radar for mazda activesense and 
camera sensors for hyundai vehicles denso supplies low cost laser radar systems for use 
compact cars avoid low speed collisions including the daihatsu smart assist system 
denso has only captured share the automation market thus far because its main 
customer toyota that uses adas systems only high end vehicles expect 
denso share increase around over the longer term with the 
introduction toyota safety sense active safety packages and with growth sales 
customers other than toyota 
the two active safety systems that toyota introducing from denso scheduled 
supply parts for the toyota safety sense package for mid sized and high end cars 
denso system features superior recognition capabilities and reliability through the use 
mono camera technology and millimeter wave radar the system combines three 
types active safety functions pre crash safety pcs lane departure alert lda and 
automatic high beam ahb systems with pedestrian detection help avoid 
collisions with pedestrians and reduce damage injury the system also features radar 
cruise control 
the pcs system detects cars and pedestrians front the vehicle and helps avoid 
collisions and reduce damage injury through alarms braking assistance and automatic 
braking automatic braking operates speeds when compared with 
pedestrians for example the difference speed between the vehicle and the 
pedestrian the system decelerates the vehicle around help avoid 
collisions with other vehicles the system operates wide range speeds between 
and maximum speed for example the car travelling and may hit 
stationary vehicle the system can reduce the vehicle speed around

toyota also has another active safety package the toyota safety sense system for 
compact cars supplied continental this system combines laser radar and mono 
camera technologies denso could also supply this system but think toyota placed 
this business with continental order spread the risk with this advanced system and 
light continental track record with mass production terms future developments 
though think denso could aim gradually win orders from toyota for systems used 
various mass produced toyota vehicles 
particular interest that denso adding systems the safety sense products 
supplies toyota and will lead the way mass producing this system when 
added safety regulations standards for the ncap evaluation programs europe and 
japan once part the ncap evaluation program expect growing demand 
the mass produced car segment for systems that combine mono camera technologies and 
millimeter wave radar like the toyota safety sense products denso supplies toyota 
denso also taking the lead improving its millimeter wave radar camera capabilities 
with view the addition night vision pedestrian detection capabilities 
ncap evaluation programs from expect such moves help denso capture 
greater market share over the longer term driven sales both toyota and other 
automakers 
denso addition advancing driver assistance technologies leading the development 
technologies for fully automated driving trial runs automated vehicles based 
the lexus began public roads minami chita aichi prefecture denso has 
identified the following challenges achieving fully automated driving three levels 
automated driving from the vehicle capable moving independently and 
the driver can respond appropriately demands from the system for challenge 
denso developing next generation millimeter wave radar camera sensors and 
focusing the development technologies increase the sensitivity vehicle position 
detection including adas locators and built communication technologies for 
challenge denso developing technologies detect driver status using driver status 
monitors dsms and visualize information using head displays huds 
adas locators utilize precise geographical data and gps data and detect data the 
road ahead that cannot captured with camera sensors radar locators are designed 
reduce potential danger using sensors detect advance information that cannot 
seen including around curves too far away for camera sensors radar 
communication technologies use devices that provide information links with other vehicles 
infrastructure and detect target objects blind spots that camera sensors radar cannot 
handle for example vehicles exchange information their position and this then used 
prevent collisions crossings with poor visibility this technology allows detection over 
greater area through the use data from other vehicles infrastructure supplement 
vehicle blind spot data that cannot obtained from sensors maps 
with dsm technology camera sensors are installed within the vehicle interior detect the

currently specializing rear detection low speed applications 
the field automation technologies aisin seiki has focused thus far the 
development and mass production advanced parking assist apa systems that use 
rear camera sensors aisin seiki may continue specialize rear detection and lowspeed applications over the near term but expect the company gradually engage 
the development high speed technologies expect adas sales rise from the 
current level nearly and just below expect 
increase from the current just over and nearly 
aisin seiki was involved from the start the development toyota intelligent parking 
assist ipa system and has good track record supplying this system 
the ipa was the first system worldwide allow automated operation the 
parking brake can described frontrunner automation technology aisin seiki 
supplies nearly all the ipa systems used toyota and has also supplied daimler the 
past aisin seiki also supplies the new system that has been launched toyota 
the combines the company original ipa technology with intelligent clearance 
sonar ics function help prevent mitigate collisions through automated braking 
addition new multi point turn support function automatically controls steering tight 
parking spaces requiring repeated back and forth movements another partially automated 
function assists departure from parallel parking spaces with little room front and 
behind the vehicle valeo and robert bosch have the top two shares the market for 
adas systems that use rear cameras like aisin seiki apa but aisin seiki ranks third 
with share nearly expect aisin seiki maintain this share over the longer 
term rear camera devices are used more the and other countries 
aisin seiki also developing better adas technologies for the future the company 
working rear through monitor that features improved rear detection technologies 
the system combines images from rear and vehicle cameras create image that 
looks through obstacles structural members the vehicle and projected onto the 
mirror the system improves driver visibility and helps the driver confirm that they have 
not missed any obstacles behind the vehicle the system allows field view 
behind the vehicle and can also used with the rear camera currently installed apa 
systems the rear through monitor requires technologies synthesize images using 
data from multiple camera sensors this may become key technology for aisin seiki over 
the longer term 
march aisin seiki opened the kyushu development center the electronics 
technology management department kitakyushu fukuoka prefecture the center will 
used for the development core technologies for safety applications including image 
recognition spatial recognition and vehicle control the company apparently developing 
alongside low speed adas technologies like the previous apa system basic technologies 
wide ranging fields including for high speed applications think demand for aisin 
seiki technologies may grow further all automakers work automate various 
functions under specific conditions including parking and freeway driving with the goal 
applying these technologies 
think aisin seiki may also able capture share the adas market segments 
other than apa from rivals denso and continental over the longer term the company 
develops more sophisticated multiple sensor technologies like the rear through monitor 
furthermore combining controllers with peripheral information seen the 
that coordinates with navigation systems aisin seiki could generate greater added value
