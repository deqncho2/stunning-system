autonomous vehicle debate this topic has far reaching implications 
mous vehicles have centered vehicles that can work with little 
regarding what connectivity autonomous vehicles will need there 
connectivity this exemplified tesla and google projects auto 
are two distinct models 
pilot and waymo which not rely connectivity traditional 
wireless networks 
intelligence the car the fundamental dynamics behind 
this model equip the car with sensors and processors 
however the long run believe that autonomous vehicles 
let drive itself short the sensors within the vehicle 
would need partially cloud based for two simple reasons 
collect data its immediate surroundings this data then 
local processing power not enough datasets are large they 
processed within the car computer allowing react 
can stored the vehicle 
quickly and proactively situations and obstacles tesla 
making the largest steps towards this technology with their 
autopilot system which uses camera sensors sonar and 
radar data processed via onboard computer 
edge computing more effective cloudbased system 
intelligence the cloud the principle behind keeping the 
intelligence the cloud tell the car where from 
multi access edge computing mec moves some the data 
centralised location having the intelligence kept the 
workload edge device the edge the network that 
cloud would allow autonomous vehicle interact with 
located physically closer the end user reducing latency net 
smart city macro network other vehicles pedestrians and 
work congestion and data management costs the concept sim 
infrastructure this can perhaps increase the safety the 
ilar cacheing data mec compares with centralised cloud 
overall network central system could directing the 
computing where data transmitted processed and stored 
entire ecosystem real time the drawback with this 
central data centre 
approach that requires initial upfront investment the 
infrastructure and mapping well mobile networks with 
the context avs mobile edge computing platform essentially 
low latency ubiquitous mobile connectivity allow the 
miniature data centre installed local base station then
