least vehicles annually support medium long term growth potential within 
rapidly globalizing sector automakers need gain scale and inject resources into markets 
with high growth potential the pre globalization car market was based competition for 
the regional markets japan the and europe but today all the major automakers 
are engaged many fronted war grab share the emerging markets china india 
and asean alongside existing major markets the result greater convergence between 
automakers terms the mix regional sales well the related model mix

automakers increasingly rely suppliers automotive technology advances the 
same time vehicle manufacturers are undeniably dependent range automotive 
technologies open architecture steadily being adopted suppliers possess many the 
core technologies involved the use electronics automation and informatization 
implying these technologies are tending become black box solutions far the 
automakers are concerned moreover automakers china and other developing 
countries strive close the technical gap developed country rivals have option but 
seek the cooperation suppliers advanced technologies many which now possess 
global footprint yet since any automaker can develop vehicles with passable technical 
characteristics provided they gain the cooperation the suppliers this also the single

implications lower auto and auto parts sector stock valuations 
looking automobile auto parts and electronic parts sector stock valuations over the 
past years see that automobile and auto parts sector stock valuations have fallen 
slightly the last two years this doubt due several factors but given that 
electronic parts sector stock valuations have risen the same time have consider 
the possibility that value added moving some not all sector stocks amid auto 
commoditization and shift open architectures added value which automakers 
previously kept themselves tending flow outwards also auto parts added value 
migrating from conventional areas electronics and other areas and think valuations 
might reflecting these factors

with electronic parts makers increasingly exposed the automobile market the disparity 
between the relative valuations electronic parts sector stocks and auto parts sector 
stocks topic constant discussion certainly the month forward average the 
electronic parts sector over the past years far higher than the equivalent for 
the auto parts sector should also noted that whereas the latest month 
forward average for the electronic parts sector slightly below the past year 
average the auto parts average far further from the past year 
average believe the auto parts sector average reflects declining expected growth 
rate versus the sector compared with past performance 
conduct the same comparison for denso which has the largest exposure the 
electronics field among auto parts sector companies see clear premium versus the 
sector average since for example the high represents climb 
level quite close the electronic parts sector average believe this indicates that 
denso could expand the electrification market has comprehensive product 
portfolio and that expectations versus denso earnings growth could rise the same 
level for electronic parts think valuation disparities between individual companies

with the new prius toyota will introduce the new ths iii hybrid system and use 
its toyota new global architecture tnga platform which aims achieve profitability 
approaching the companywide average individual cost basis result the costs 
hev systems from the new prius onwards will considerably reduced furthermore 
the company inaugurate local production core components china and elsewhere 
which should radically accelerate the global development hev technologies 
ths emerges the facto industry standard and further economies scale fall within 
reach would not surprised see the company actively marketing the system itself 
other automakers through hybrid business alliances that case major system 
suppliers like denso aisin seiki and peve would benefit least the top line toyota 
also planning introduce fcevs end and aims reproduce the success 
that scored with hevs the next generation environmentally friendly vehicles 
honda outperform introducing three new hev systems part 
its earth dreams technology next generation powertrains the new model fit hybrid 
use the intelligent dual clutch drive dcd system minimize the increase price

from elsewhere while nissan neutral focusing evs 
mainly for next generation models shifting omnidirectional strategy that includes 
hevs where there strong demand however will take some time before these make

developing hev transmissions that can used various cars signaling that intends 
aggressively market its hev transmissions customers other than toyota think 
that toyota hev strategies may support the active selling hev transmissions and 
regenerative braking systems other companies toyota hev systems use hev 
transmissions from aisin and regenerative braking systems from advics which 
together account for about half the total cost other words the per vehicle added

electrification powertrains 
hevs phevs evs and fcevs take pride place 
among technologies reduce engine loading 
electrification powertrains critical environmental standards are met 
think automakers must redouble their commitment technological development 
supporting improved fuel efficiency keeping yardstick the eu average 
emission target for lower fuel consumption and achieve greater fuel efficiency 
think automakers will need take multi pronged approach our view the main 
approaches are likely improving internal combustion engines improving energy 
efficiency reducing the engine weight and reducing the engine load reducing the 
engine load primarily means curbing the vehicle reliance energy produced 
the engine for the most part think this will achieved electrifying systems that 
have traditionally been mechanical often hydraulic among technologies geared toward

environmental regulations the driving force behind 
recent automotive technologies 
adoption hev phev fcev technologies imperative automakers are clear 
environmental objectives 
clear present that the auto sector technological needs are being driven primarily 
environmental regulation environmental regulations can broadly grouped into 
exhaust gas regulations aimed reducing emissions particulate matter nitrogen 
oxides and other byproducts prime example being the european union euro emission 
standards and emission and fuel economy standards typified the eu 
regulation and japan fuel efficiency standards which are dictated 
the energy conservation law with regard emission standards particular the 
has set itself the target progressively reducing average new car emissions 
and this has lent impetus automakers 
development eco friendly vehicles not just europe but indeed worldwide the 
meanwhile has settled fuel economy standards that will require model year cars 
get the equivalent miles per gallon marking technological leap forward with 
nearly double the fuel efficiency new vehicles currently the road 
figure compare average emissions for the world leading automakers with 
its high weighting compact cars fiat has the lowest emission volume while daimler 
highest owing its heavy weighting larger vehicles among japanese automakers 
strong sales the prius and other hybrid vehicles have propelled toyota into the lead 
ranks second only fiat global basis while the eu overall target reduce 
emissions average the emission goals individual auto 
manufacturers are calculated based average vehicle weight and such difficult 
get picture progress toward those goals have doubt though that 
automakers are doing their utmost reduce emissions through the launch 
compliant vehicles they otherwise face graduated penalties their average emission 
levels are above the target 
meet the target automakers must lower their average emission 
volume per annum through goes without saying that this will require 
improved fuel economy for larger vehicles currently emitting more than 
addition though automakers need reduce average emissions for compact cars 
the market volume zone level well below without certain weighting 
eco friendly vehicles using hev phev fcv technologies automakers will not meet 
the target and over the past few years and european automakers have gradually 
increased their exposure such vehicles

ongoing expansion market for eco friendly vehicles 
anticipate further growth the market for environmentally friendly vehicles using 
electric powertrain technologies hev phev fcev etc place conventional 
internal combustion engines just over two million hevs phev and evs were 
produced worldwide japanese automakers took early lead mass producing hevs 
phevs and evs but since the lehman crisis their and european counterparts have 
progressively rolled out new offerings whereas there were only few eco friendly models 
the market the early there were automakers clearly have been 
motivated the need meet environmental regulations including the requirement 
europe that average new car emissions reduced and 
think the number models will only increase expect automakers 
especially those based japan offer hybrid versions every model their range 
japan hevs are fueling growth the passenger vehicle market indeed the months 
since the consumption tax hike hevs from toyota and honda have been key shoring

chronological view eco friendly vehicle evolution 
now years since toyota launched the first prius and cast our eyes across the 
world automobile manufacturers find that almost all the industry leaders have some 
form eco friendly vehicle hev phev fcev etc their model lineup the 
market for environmentally friendly cars has grown progressively bigger terms both 
the amount vehicles sold and the number players involved below present 
chronological view the market evolution from the dawn this new era when toyota 
began mass producing the first generation prius the present day listing the major 
players contributions 
toyota cumulative hev sales units adopting all the above 
approach and taking steps globalize hev business 
toyota launched the prius the world first mass produced hev with the tagline 
just time for the century with the release the prius automakers around the 
world wanted know more about the toyota hybrid system ths which was major 
topic conversation the detroit motor show toyota went develop number 
hevs the estima hybrid and crown mild hybrid dint mounting furtherevolved hybrid systems ths ths existing models 
the company released the second generation prius introducing the characteristic 
triangle silhouette that remains feature today that model featured the ths hybrid 
system refinement the original ths toyota also added two hybrids the 
and the lexus lineup and around the same time brought out 
hybrid version the camry the company best selling car north america the flagship 
lexus came out and that year cumulative hev sales topped the million 
vehicle mark 
the following year saw the limited launch the fchv adv advanced version 
the fuel cell vehicle toyota had been working since the this model extended 
the single fill cruising range around the third generation prius debuted 
greatly boosting toyota overall hev sales volume with the aid tax breaks 
introduced that year encourage eco car purchases when toyota released the thirdgeneration prius was immediately compared the second generation insight that 
honda had just released the time toyota continued selling the second generation 
prius rebadged the prius alongside the new version 
auto auto parts electronic components sector 
july 
since then toyota has added three dedicated hybrid vehicles the lexus sai 
and lexus well continuing mount hybrid systems existing models 
creating cars like the auris hybrid launched the prius the first vehicle the prius lineup use ion batteries when also released small type dedicated hev the 
prius aqua like the third generation prius the aqua features toyota hybrid system 
ths with reduction gear offering fuel efficiency the test cycle 
since october has ranked ahead the prius the best selling car japan 
toyota first plug hybrid the prius phv debuted when the company also 
commenced sales the electric vehicle developed jointly with the based 
tesla motors the same time toyota continues its way offering full hev lineup 
mounting hybrid systems core models such the yaris and corolla whereas the 
company sold only around hevs when the first generation prius launched 
had achieved cumulative sales vehicles 
the tokyo motor show saw the unveiling the toyota fcev concept previewing 
next generation hydrogen fuel cell powered hybrid production car scheduled launch 
japan early end ahead the worldwide rollout the company intends 
release fourth generation prius featuring the toyota hybrid system iii ths iii 
expect the use the tnga platform with this model will support improvement 
profitability almost the company wide average individual unit cost basis may 
also commence production hybrid vehicles and their key parts china doing 
taking major step toward globalization the hev business 
honda from focus ima three pronged hev strategy 
honda involvement hevs dates back when launched the first generation 
insight this was the first vehicle use honda integrated motor assist ima technology 
featuring single motor parallel hybrid system installed with the internal combustion 
engine from design aspect the insight was notable for its aerodynamic rear wheel 
skirts launched some years later end the latest civic hybrid features the fifthgeneration ima system mounted the seventh generation civic prior that the accord 
hybrid debuted the with the north american seventh generation accord 
its base 
honda also pursuing development fcvs began leasing the fcx japan 
and the and followed with the fcx clarity honda also recently announced 
plans collaborate with next generation fuel cell technology the 
company launched the second generation insight now five door hatchback like its direct 
competitor the prius this new insight featured improved ima system and enhanced 
fuel economy the test cycle with starting price only set 
off hybrid war with toyota prius 
honda released several more ima equipped hevs over the course including 
the its first experiment with sports type hev and the fit hybrid fit shuttle 
hybrid and freed hybrid all based the second generation fit the ilx hybrid 
became the first hev released under the luxury acura brand and the same year honda 
began offering the fit lease only proposition october honda had grown 
cumulative hev sales volume one million units 
honda next generation earth dreams technology powertrain suite features three new 
hev systems essence three pronged approach the manner abenomics 
three arrows launched january the second generation accord hybrid employs 
honda mmd intelligent multi mode drive two motor hybrid system more recently the 
company released the second generation fit hybrid featuring the single motor dcd 
intelligent dual clutch drive system the next generation nsx apparently plans 
use the three motor awd super handling all wheel drive system featuring 
independent motors for the right and left rear wheels 
auto auto parts electronic components sector 
july 
nissan strategic shift from focus evs multi pronged approach including 
hevs 
when one thinks nissan and eco friendly cars the leaf tends come mind 
however ten years earlier nissan delivered units the tino hev 
sedan minivan crossover appearances would suggest that the company has since taken 
alternative path hev development reality the altima hybrid released the 
featured ths supplied toyota although nissan subsequently persisted with 
development response market needs also launched the fuga hybrid using 
proprietary hev technology 
the same year nissan began marketing the aforementioned leaf the secondgeneration leaf unveiled can run when fully charged from the 
previous version and has average electrical consumption all the 
mode while initially priced around japan the leaf now retails for about 
january cumulative global sales reached units 
nissan revived the hybrid story when launched the cima dedicated hybrid 
like the fuga hybrid that preceded the cima featured one motor two clutch parallel 
hybrid intelligent dual clutch control system nissan also released the serena hybrid 
smart simple hybrid the end nissan announced plans roll out 
hev models including one phev whereas evs previously held sway among its 
environmental vehicles the company now taking multi pronged approach that includes 
demand hevs 
other japanese automakers key may lie supplementing technologies through 
alliances 
among the other japanese automakers mitsubishi motor has concentrated 
development released the miev ahead the nissan leaf and 
debuted the outlander phev mazda unveiled hybrid version the tribute virtual 
twin the ford escape hybrid both feature two motor hybrid system produced 
aisin mazda also offers hybrid version the new axela launched and 
featuring toyota hybrid technology 
fuji heavy industries released the plug stella phev but later halted production 
launched the hybrid using hev system developed house but the 
company may look borrow toyota hybrid technology future adapted for use its 
own vehicles the minivehicle category suzuki has used the ene charge system for 
charging batteries its wagon and other models which are best described 
micro hybrids with alternator tuned for energy regeneration when decelerating 
overseas automakers ramping development eco cars hot pursuit 
japanese rivals 
overseas automakers hybrid vehicle launches have picked rapidly since the lehman 
crisis daimler and bmw have jointly developed advanced hybrid system that 
used mainly big suvs also released the chevrolet volt series hybrid 
with range extender engine daimler meanwhile worked with bmw develop mild hev 
system that featured the mercedes hybrid and bmw activehybrid while 
and porsche brought out the touareg hybrid and cayenne hybrid featuring shared 
drivetrain 
among korean automakers hyundai debuted its first lpg hev the avante lpi hybrid 
followed the sonata hybrid gasoline hev overseas automakers 
including those from the europe and korea plan sustain steady flow eco car 
launches comply with increasingly stringent environmental standards bmw has already

the evolution the toyota prius 
how the pioneering model the hev market has changed 
the toyota prius has evolved over three generations since debuted clear 
that the model has gained size while becoming less expensive and more fuel efficient 
the first generation prius had two motors plus engine sitting forward compartment 
for front wheel drive vehicle this ths utilizing planetary gears was the first attempt 
hev drivetrain packaging the battery pack comprised batteries arranged 
series and located compartment under the rear passenger seat 
the first generation prius was four door passenger sedan with dimensions 
and the second and third generation models were larger 
serve the requirements overseas markets such north america becoming five door 
hatchbacks with the same triangular silhouette design the dimensions increased 
and respectively vehicle 
weight also increased with each subsequent generation 
although the model has grown size its price tag has been lowered the first and second 
generations had basic model starting prices japan before consumption tax 
while the basic third generation prius had sales price the same basis 
part this was compete price with the second generation insight that honda launched 
the same year toyota also lowered the price tag the second generation prius just 
starting prices for the fourth generation prius scheduled for introduction 
are expected lower again support full scale commercial development overseas 
toyota developed the basic ths design create the ths powertrain for the secondgeneration prius the volume the battery pack was squeezed while increasing 
the overall charge capacity for the third generation model toyota further increased the 
energy efficiency the ths system adding reduction gears the fuel economy the 
prius mode has improved over the generations from and 
respectively further improvements are anticipated with the fourth generation with 
fuel economy mode forecast increase from

analysis hev phev market 
hev phev product comparison highlights strategic differences between 
automakers 
have researched the hev phev and models marketed the leading global 
automakers pinpoint salient trends the market for green cars our comparison 
based dividing quantitative characteristics models the product the three 
dimensions and the vehicle weight fuel efficiency measured for mode 
price place each global maker models the relevant axis size price fuel 
efficiency price for evs derive values for fuel efficiency using maker specifications for 
total energy efficiency and power consumption 
our analysis reveals that japanese automakers such toyota and honda are tending 
develop comparatively compact models while seeking achieve gains fuel efficiency 
relative price contrast automakers such and ford are introducing models 
that provide more room for the same price rather than improvements fuel efficiency our 
analysis also shows that evs tend deliver higher fuel efficiency other factors such 
vehicle range are ignored 
japanese automakers targeting cheaper models with low fuel consumption 
the hev phev models japanese automakers are mainly the compact and 
subcompact segments this partly reflects the fact that most these models were 
developed primarily for the japanese market but also illustrates how these manufacturers 
are targeting small vehicles that offer low fuel consumption the nissan leaf the 
best performing model our fuel efficiency price index among the hev models the 
newly remodeled fit jazz overseas from honda also scores highly this regard 
naturally this the result honda efforts keep fuel consumption and model price 
low but the sales success also shows how this approach has produced cars that are 
attractive japanese consumers 
auto auto parts electronic components sector 
july 
three years after its initial release toyota has made minor changes the aqua raise 
its fuel efficiency surpassing the fit however even the most basic model the 
range more expensive than the fit besides the aqua prius and other hevs 
toyota also putting its hybrid drive technology into wide range models including its 
luxury lexus range while still aiming find the correct pricing balance going forward 
terms general trends think japanese automakers will target further improvements 
fuel efficiency price terms discuss later the report the majority the current 
hev phev models the market impose heavier cost burden the consumer than 
any the conventional icev models this means further reductions price are needed 
these new classes passenger vehicle are supplant icev models completely 
western automakers are mainly adding value existing model range while starting 
focus more seriously fuel efficiency improvements 
western automakers have released limited numbers pure hev phev models 
preferring add value developing hybrid versions existing models neither bmw nor 
mercedes models compare well based our price based indices because both 
companies line ups are the luxury end the market the first dedicated developed 
bmw the plug hybrid with optional range extender whilst the fuel efficiency 
this phev high considerably more expensive than any japanese 
mass production model rather than targeting low fuel economy absolute terms 
automakers have developed hybrid models based traditional relationship between 
price and vehicle size gm chevrolet impala eco the best the makers hev 
models size price terms believe this due the decision base the hev models 
full size pickup platform although the chevrolet volt marketed dedicated 
phev compact slightly inferior the various japanese models both size price and 
fuel efficiency price terms 
environmental regulations continue tighten developed countries exemplified 
the strict emission standards europe and zero emission vehicle zev regulations 
the expect these regulatory trends prompt western automakers accelerate 
development pure hev phev models close the gap with japanese automakers 
among recent european entrants are the from and the bmw mercedes 
also expected develop plug hybrid models for the next generation its class and 
class cars the plans expand the number models fitted with its eassist

full scale global rollout toyota promising ths 
ths could become facto standard 
toyota expected achieve considerable cost savings its fourth generation prius due 
out through introduction tnga and new hev system based its nextgeneration ths iii this will play critical role driving global sales the prius which 
has already achieved significant penetration the japanese market well supporting 
the company efforts make the toyota hybrid system ths the global facto 
standard time when rivals are introducing steady stream models incorporating 
phev and other technologies 
maintain its technological lead toyota has shared its hev technology with only very 
limited number companies date however believe this could change going 
forward with toyota selling its ths system directly other automakers through hybrid 
business alliances order pursue its goal turning ths into the facto standard 
well create greater economies scale this could also prove boon for 
toyota main suppliers who have not been able sell hybrid parts many which were 
jointly developed with toyota outside buyers this can expected make fairly 
significant contribution the earnings key systems suppliers like denso aisin seiki 
and primearth energy 
analysis hev phev economics 
lower price tags and costs are required increase hev market penetration 
our opinion further reductions vehicle manufacturing costs and associated price tags 
are essential hev phev models are gain increased market penetration have 
made detailed study the economic rationale for consumers purchase current hev 
models comparing specific hev models against comparable icev models our analysis 
estimates the payback period for the hev based the difference sales price our 
assumptions have set standard mileage per month based japanese 
government road transport data have also assumed gasoline price 
based our price comparison the dealer rrp including consumption tax and 
used model variants that are close possible terms features equipment and 
engine displacement 
auto auto parts electronic components sector 
july 
whilst the conclusions are naturally sensitive the assumptions our analysis shows that 
most consumers would not able recoup the hev price differential purchase within 
standard period ownership except the cases the toyota aqua and the honda fit 
for the toyota prius calculate would take owners months over seven years 
recoup the difference price with the equivalent toyota auris the case the 
lexus the payback period compared with the equivalent gasoline powered lexus 
months over years strictly economic terms would seem the 
purchasers these hev models are effect heavily subsidizing the manufacturer 
contrast those purchasing the toyota aqua rather than the equivalent vitz model could 
expect recoup the difference price months about years this seems 
more reasonable economic proposition for consumers for the remodeled honda fit 
the price differential with gasoline powered model equivalent engine displacement 
little less than which could recouped just months around two years 
based these estimates think honda likely sell more hybrid version fit models 
than originally expected consumers will naturally see more compelling economic case 
buy hybrid rather than gasoline powered equivalent the price differential between 
the two shrinks further reductions total costs are required automakers are push 
market penetration rates for hev models the next level

relying fuel cell stacks that create power through hydrogen oxygen chemical reaction 
well high pressure tanks for storing the hydrogen fuel the new fcev will have 
range approximately mode and refilling time about three minutes full 
tank hydrogen par with typical gasoline powered vehicle 
honda unveiled its new honda fcev concept the los angeles international auto 
show honda proprietary stack about smaller than conventional stacks yet 
still produces over power with power density the car equipped 
with high pressure hydrogen storage tank has range over miles and 
hydrogen tank refilling time about three minutes honda will release the car japan 
the and europe also working with general motors jointly develop 
low cost hydrogen storage tank system that will smaller and lighter than current 
systems while offering greater performance which should help the company continue 
expand its fcev business over the medium term 
even the automobile market sees resumed offensive phevs and evs and 
renewed emphasis among automakers expanding sales toyota and honda appear 
staking their bets fcevs the core the next generation environmentallyfriendly vehicles think this could also aimed reproducing the companies 
success hevs the current market leading technology japanese automakers like 
toyota and honda led the way mass production hevs and also hold number key 
related patents result representing market entry barriers that make difficult for other 
companies keep this should allow heavyweights like toyota and honda maintain 
their technological lead and capture the bulk market share over the near term looks 
like both toyota and honda are now trying replicate this successful formula fcevs 
according patent result data toyota the number one and honda number two total 
number japanese patent applications filed relating hydrogen storage and 
compression technology the the top applicant for patents related fuel cell 
technology general motors followed honda second and toyota fourth place 
short addition japanese automakers like toyota and honda global makers like 
are also actively pursuing fcev related technology with the goals both building new 
barriers market entry well maintaining technological edge the industry moves 
toward open architecture that when these technologies mainstream they will 
able capture value added with development infrastructure like hydrogen refilling 
stations still issue full scale growth fcevs will take longer than for hevs but

the shift toward electrification powertrains 
products and suppliers 
limited number auto parts suppliers standouts among non automaker affiliates 
the table below summarize major products and supply chains related electrical 
powertrains including hev phev and fcev the first striking point that the auto 
parts suppliers common conventional automotive supply chains have limited presence 
electrical powertrain supply chains the supply chain map below shows the only 
such companies present from within our coverage universe are denso aisin seiki toyota 
industries keihin and calsonic kansei plus toyota boshoku with its motor cores 
drivetrains such hev transmissions which combine motors generators and gears 
aisin seiki jatco and others handle the supply systems while electronic equipment 
and electronic component makers supply motors and makers steel and specialty steel 
and other materials makers dominate the market for motor components such 
permanent magnets and electromagnetic steel plates denso supplies comprehensive 
range parts including inverters converters ecus electrical current sensors 
high voltage relays and power semiconductors toyota industries makes 
converters and auxiliary parts such electrical compressors honda affiliate keihin 
supplies motor battery ecus hev ecus while nissan affiliate calsonic kansei supplies 
inverters and lithium ion battery controllers lbcs for the leaf 
contrast the above large number manufacturers unaffiliated with automakers are 
already represented these supply chains for example even key part markets 
which denso has the largest share inverters converters electrical current 
sensors high voltage relays etc the second place group includes electronic component 
makers tdk nichicon shindengen electric and alps electric also already see 
electronic equipment makers such toshiba mitsubishi electric and hitachi hitachi 
automotive systems and consumer electronics makers such panasonic deeply 
involved these supply chains japanese device makers are also prominent the supply 
discrete ics used for power supply and inverter and converter passive 
components 
more new entries non auto affiliates and ongoing differentiation among 
individual auto parts suppliers likely 
expect the market for electrical auto parts grow some the 
automaker affiliates current conventional supply chains will not capture this exclusively 
rather other companies that are already working win away even little the total 
value added business relative the total auto parts market are likely accelerate this 
pursuit time goes the auto parts market the model cycle relatively stable and 
discount requests limited making this fairly easy business for non auto affiliates move 
into therefore think likely that their sales expansion will accelerate 
the market for electrical auto parts does expand the remainder the 
conventional auto parts market could conversely see its value added contribution decline 
further this would unavoidable the extent that finished vehicle makers are unable 
pass through selling prices all the increased costs from efforts improve the 
attractiveness their vehicles terms fuel efficiency and higher value added other 
words between suppliers able get involved electrical auto parts and suppliers unable 
avoid remaining conventional auto parts gaps are likely grow asp parts per 
vehicle with distinctions earnings growth widening over time

device rich systems ecus expanding 
ecu expansion continues 
electronic control continues gain importance alongside demand for shift higherspec systems that partly driven tougher regulations believe the number 
vehicles fitted with ecus will continue increase addition the shift from hydraulic 
electronic control using electric motors electric vehicles and increasing adoption 
sensors and actuators cars advanced electronic control demand due tougher 
emissions and fuel consumption regulations governing internal combustion engines 
accordingly look for the number cars equipped with ecus continue increase 
per year carmakers might strive install integrated ecus the future but 
the near term expect ecu adoption system continue expand

high barriers entry japanese device makers should benefit the most from 
demand growth the near term 
the fact that powertrain electric vehicle and suspension ecus must meet tougher 
standards than body and non body ecus terms heat water and vibration resistance 
should boon japanese device makers which make the high reliability their 
products selling point 
for example body and non body ecus which are mounted near the cabin generally 
have withstand ambient temperature range degrees celsius water 
protected and withstand vibration ecus mounted near engine 
compartments require higher specification components the requirements are 
degrees celsius shower submerge and 
besides devices for these automotive systems require reliability and mass production 
tests over long period years before mass production can get fully under way this 
generates startup costs but the business can expected generate stable earnings for 
around years once mass production gets going the sector was forced engage 
fierce price competition for time due short product life cycles and catch with 
asian rivals but think japanese device makers position will remain unchanged the 
near term 
electronic parts profit contribution likely outstrip that from semiconductors 
comparison with hardware automobiles have longer product cycles and require 
long term guarantee supply semiconductor devices migration finer process 
geometries source cost savings but scope for such savings limited automakers 
needs dictate that the same process maintained for long periods time advances 
autonomous and connected vehicles will demand increased adoption application 
processors and connectivity solutions cellular etc these products however 
must manufactured using cutting edge ultrafine process technologies this makes 
difficult leave products and production lines unchanged over long periods much 
thought must given the type eco system that should built 
when comes passive and electromechanical components connectors the 
materials required specifications and design differ greatly depending whether the enduse hardware automobile however the production processes not vary 
much unlike semiconductor manufacturing where cost savings rely primarily 
upgrades production equipment passive and electromechanical component makers can 
resort also improving takt time shortening production lines and employing labor saving 
technology while barriers entry are high and easy matter maintain excellent 
product quality see greater scope for earnings expansion than the production 
parts for hardware where manufacturers face annual pressure for price cuts the 
realm and must also cope with seasonal swings demand

shift automotive electronics from mlcc market 
perspective 
expecting mlcc shipment value continue grow per year 
the following examine the proliferation electronics automobiles based 
murata mfg and tdk mlcc sales automakers estimate that these two companies 
command nearly the global market making them good yardstick for measuring 
trends the adoption electronics automobiles 
mlccs are basic components incorporated the electronic circuits ecus the 
automotive mlcc market has grown around fold value over the past years 
cagr owing growth the number ecus used cars supported 
increasing use auto electronics electrification automation and computerization 
per vehicle sales shipment value divided number vehicles sold worldwide including 
commercial vehicles rose from unit unit cagr 
the automotive electronic devices market usually thought grow the same pace 
the number ecus per vehicle per year however noted above growth 
device rich ecus and systems leading increased mlcc demand excess ecu 
demand growth expect this trend gain momentum 
limited commoditization automotive mlccs 
the idea that mlccs can considered commodity does not necessarily hold true 
the automotive sphere mlccs used car navigation and car audio systems are highly 
commoditized but take example the mlccs deployed ecus mounted 
inside near the engine room degree customization required not only size and 
capacity but also the mode vibration required each customer and ecu and 
extension the type resin external metal terminal conductive epoxy 
japanese manufacturers streets ahead passive components 
japanese companies particular murata mfg and tdk dominate the mlcc market 
japanese manufacturers also command huge market shares other areas including 
inductors resistors quartz devices and ceramic resonators gather that tdk for 
example has share the inductor market and that its global share rises 
nearly confine our discussion common mode filters cmf used differential 
transmission the other aforementioned markets are also largely controlled japanese 
manufacturers including murata mfg toko and panasonic looking ahead anticipate 
rapid growth demand for power inductors uptake converters increases 
and think japanese companies will sure respond appropriately

japanese makers maintaining large shares especially power and mcu ics 
japanese semiconductor makers have lost market presence except certain product 
categories such nand and cmos sensors however they still have around 
share the automotive semiconductor market renesas electronics accounting for most 
the share they have large shares the power supply discrete and mcu markets 
they have not sustained major share losses despite revisions business continuity plans 
and supply risk after the march earthquake 
overseas manufacturers expect gain share among japanese makers from around 
overseas majors such infineon ifx stmicroelectronics nxp freescale 
semiconductor fsl nxp and texas instruments txn are aiming business with 
japanese tier companies and automakers but expect full fledged adoption only from
