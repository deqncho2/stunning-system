attract new and are desired existing customers and effectively compete autonomous ride sharing and transportation service sales 
full size pick trucks and suvs which may affected increases the price oil the volatility global sales and operations aggressive 
competition including the impact new market entrants changes the introduction novel interpretations laws regulations policies 
particularly those relating free trade agreements tax rates and vehicle safety and any government actions that may affect the production licensing 
distribution pricing selling our products our joint ventures which cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which may have 
limited control compliance with laws and regulations applicable our industry including those regarding fuel economy and emissions costs and 
risks associated with litigation and government investigations compliance with the terms the deferred prosecution agreement our ability 
maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid recalls and the cost and effect our reputation and products the ability suppliers deliver 
parts systems and components without disruption and schedule our dependence our manufacturing facilities our ability realize 
production efficiencies and cost reductions our ability successfully restructure operations various countries our ability manage risks
