trends uncertainties and opportunities 
economic conditions our business directly related automotive sales and automotive light and commercial vehicle production our customers automotive 
sales depend number factors including global and regional economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production including light and 
commercial vehicles increased from economic conditions and the resultant levels automotive vehicle production were uneven from 
regional perspective compared vehicle production increased europe china and south america following several years 
increases consumer demand for vehicles north america receded resulting decrease year over year north american production overall 
global vehicle production remained flat for the three months ended march and expected increase compared vehicle 
production expected remain flat china increase europe south america and north america

economic volatility weakness north america europe china continued weakness south america could result significant reduction automotive 
sales and production our customers which would have adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition there also potential 
that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the and other economies and specifically the automotive sector particular changes international trade 
agreements such the north american free trade agreement other political pressures could affect the operations our oem customers resulting reduced 
automotive production certain regions shifts the mix production higher cost regions increases interest rates could also negatively impact 
automotive production result increased consumer borrowing costs reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result shifts the 
mix future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars 
reductions industrial production and the corresponding level freight tonnage being transported while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base 
along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned withstand the impact industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts the mix 
global automotive production higher cost regions vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 
there have also been periods increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united 
kingdom and europe result the referendum held june which voters approved exit from the european union 
commonly referred brexit result the referendum the british government formally initiated the process for withdrawal march the terms 
any withdrawal are subject negotiation period that could last least two years from the initiation date nevertheless the proposed withdrawal has created 
significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the and the these developments the perception that any them could occur may 
adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability key market 
participants operate certain financial markets and could contribute instability global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased 
volatility interest rates and foreign exchange rates although are actively monitoring the ongoing potential impacts brexit and will seek minimize its 
impact our business any these effects brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results operations financial 
condition and cash flows approximately our annual net sales were generated the and approximately were denominated british

imports from countries where manufacture products such china and mexico could have material adverse effect our business and financial results 
product development the automotive component supply industry highly competitive both domestically and internationally and characterized rapidly 
changing technology evolving industry standards and demand for improved vehicle performance and additional power needs our ability anticipate changes 
technology regulatory standards and successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products timely and cost competitive basis will significant 
factor our ability remain competitive compete effectively the automotive supply industry must able develop new products that meet our 
customers demands timely manner our advanced technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned meet 
increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands 
oems are increasingly looking their suppliers simplify vehicle design and assembly processes reduce costs result suppliers that sell vehicle 
components directly manufacturers tier suppliers have assumed many the design engineering research and development and assembly functions 
traditionally performed vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fully engineered solutions systems and pre assembled combinations component 
parts are positioned leverage the trend toward system sourcing 
engineering design development our history and culture innovation have enabled develop significant intellectual property and design and development 
expertise provide high quality technologically advanced products that meet and exceed our customers demands for safety durability and performance have 
team approximately scientists engineers and technicians across major technical centers globally focused innovating and developing marketrelevant product solutions invested approximately million which includes approximately million investment customers and

reduce emissions and improve engine performance also leverage our oem product engineering capabilities across our aftermarket product lines capture 
value over the lifetime vehicle 
the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over 
time including cost recovery component the price each part based expected volumes recently and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost 
recovery payments independent volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 
pricing cost cutting initiatives adopted our customers result increased downward pressure pricing our customer supply agreements generally require 
step downs component pricing over the periods production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the 
automotive component supply industry fragmented and serves limited number automotive oems our profitability depends part our ability generate 
sufficient cost savings the future offset price reductions 
maintain low fixed cost structure which provides with the flexibility invest new growth opportunities and remain profitable all points the 
traditional vehicle industry production cycle result approximately our hourly workforce located best cost countries furthermore have 
operational flexibility leveraging workforce contract workers which represented approximately the hourly workforce march 
however will continue adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint response changes the global and regional automotive 
markets and order increase investment advanced technologies and engineering evidenced our going restructuring programs focused the 
continued rotation our manufacturing footprint best cost locations continue operate cyclical industry that impacted movements the 
global and regional economies continually evaluate opportunities further refine our cost structure 
oem product recalls the number vehicles recalled globally oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either initiated the oems 
influenced regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations 
table contents 
across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute increased recalls outside the 
automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity safety issues the automotive industry including increased 
focus from regulators and consumers anticipate the number automotive recalls may remain above historical levels the near future although engage 
extensive product quality programs and processes and have not experienced any significant impacts date result the recalls that have been initiated 
possible that may adversely affected the future the pace these recalls continues 
industry consolidation consolidation among worldwide suppliers expected continue suppliers seek achieve operating synergies and value stream 
efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships oems continue expand globally additionally new entrants from 
outside the traditional automotive industry may seek gain access certain vehicle component markets believe companies with strong balance sheets and 
financial discipline are the best position take advantage the industry consolidation trend 
consolidated results operations

business which refer collectively volume fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates which refer contractual reductions the sales 
price the oem which refer contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes sales mix can have either favorable unfavorable 
impacts revenue such changes can the result shifts regional growth shifts oem sales demand well shifts consumer demand related 
vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance shift sales demand favoring particular oem vehicle model for which not have 
supply contract may negatively impact our revenue shift regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales those our 
customers that have large market share those regions which turn would expected have favorable impact our revenue

other including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included volume net contractual price reductions operational 
performance 
the automotive component supply industry traditionally subject inflationary pressures with respect raw materials and labor which may place operational 
and profitability burdens the entire supply chain will continue work with our customers and suppliers mitigate the impact these inflationary 
pressures the future addition expect commodity cost volatility have continual impact future earnings and operating cash flows such 
continually seek mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material related cost exposures using number approaches including combining purchase 
requirements with customers and other suppliers using alternate suppliers product designs and negotiating cost reductions and commodity cost contract
