approaches are likely improving internal combustion engines improving energy 
efficiency reducing the engine weight and reducing the engine load reducing the 
engine load primarily means curbing the vehicle reliance energy produced 
the engine for the most part think this will achieved electrifying systems that

short term emissions requirements japan emissions regulations have grown 
increasingly stringent since euro regulations which consist six levels euro 
require pollutants effectively reduced less than half the permitted levels 
regulations have also been tightened the with autos coming under 
epa tier california the california air resources board carb has introduced lev 
iii regulations starting with autos after starting with the new short term emissions 
requirements japan moved the new long term emissions regulations and 
eventually the post new long term emission regulations faced with alarming levels 
air pollution china put emissions regulations force the national level starting

stricter standards effective from should spur growth 
phev demand 
the auto industry developed systems bridge meet the eu standards 
scheduled take effect more radical electrified vehicle innovations will 
needed comply with even stricter environmental standards expected imposed 
the future electrified vehicles hevs hevs phevs evs and fcevs currently 
account for estimated share the global automobile market one reason for their 
low share besides the cost equipping vehicles with electric power units that 
recharging infrastructure for evs fcevs not yet adequately available with 
standards slated continue progressively tightened beyond the target 
expect demand for phevs currently the most fuel efficient vehicles and evs which will 
likely benefit from government incentives grow sharply from forecast global 
unit demand for phevs and from mere 
for evs our corresponding and forecasts are and 
respectively from 
automakers rushing roll out phevs the most fuel efficient ice 
vehicles 
phevs are hybrid vehicles that are equipped with both internal combustion engines ice 
and electric powertrains and can recharge their batteries from external power source 
phevs are equipped with larger batteries and have much greater all electric range than 
hevs meanwhile their ices enable phevs circumvent evs continuous driving range 
limitations fuel efficiency conversion methods for phevs differ internationally but phevs 
are currently considered the most fuel efficient ice equipped vehicles being more 
marketable than evs which are dependent solely external power sources and have 
continuous driving range limitations phevs will likely grow prevalence this report 
phevs include extended range evs equipped with ices used exclusively for recharging 
extend driving range 
automakers are expediting development phev models preparation for future 
tightening standards japanese automakers particularly toyota and honda have 
been expanding their hev model lines recently however they have started place 
priority phevs also toyota new prius phv has maximum all electric range 
drastic improvement from its predecessor range its hev mode fuel 
efficiency better than the smaller toyota aqua prius hev 
under the us combined fuel economy standard the new prius phv rated per 
gasoline liter equivalent honda announced that will roll out phev around 
november conjunction with the upcoming full model change the suv 
space mitsubishi motors outlander phev has all electric range and 
impressive hev mode fuel efficiency among automakers offers 
the volt extended range the volt has all electric range approx 
and maximum driving range about approx full tank gas both 
which are vastly better than the original volt corresponding specs european automakers 
also are starting focus phev models while they seem laggards developing 
auto auto parts industrial consumer electronics electronic components sector 
april 
the full hybrid systems which toyota and honda excel they apparently aim make 
for lost time accelerating development phevs which pose less challenge than 
full hybrids 
european automakers are focusing phevs response fuel 
efficiency conversion formulas 
formulas used calculate phev fuel consumption differ internationally partly reflecting 
that phevs not consume any fuel when used for short distance driving japan 
phevs combined fuel efficiency was previously calculated multiplying their 
conventional fuel efficiency coefficient that adjusts for the battery powered share 
distance driven this method was abandoned the original prius phv hevmode fuel efficiency was mode but its combined fuel efficiency was 
astounding phev models became more varied extended range evs 
combined fuel efficiency was likewise abandoned because longer accurately reflected 
all phevs actual fuel efficiency currently phevs japan have both and hevmode fuel efficiency ratings europe contrast phevs improvement fuel efficiency 
over ice equipped vehicles calculated multiplying conventional ice equipped 
vehicles emissions reduction coefficient using the formula 
dav dav where the reduction coefficient the vehicle all electric range and 
dav the average distance between battery recharges dav statutorily set for 
example assume that mercedes benz hypothetically develops phev version fullsized class sedan with emissions given all electric range 
the phev model reduction coefficient would which would yield 
emissions rating well below europe emissions limit 
from this example readily apparent that this emissions formula one reason 
why european automakers are focusing phevs the phevs fuel efficiency 
calculated formula similar japan old combined fuel efficiency formula the 
formulas based mode utility rate european and north american markets 
phevs are advantageous automakers terms compliance with emission 
standards the phev market segment should continue grow rapidly 
evs boast zero emissions but have limitations 
evs are vehicles powered solely electric motors and with internal combustion 
engine power source other than external charger define them narrowly this 
report pure electric vehicles meaning that exclude plug hybrids phevs and 
other variations evs available present include the mass market nissan leaf and tesla 
model and model evs exclusive reliance electric power means that they generate 
exhaust emissions but also limits their driving range and requires long charging 
times the leaf has battery and while takes just minutes charge 
full capacity using fast charger the largest widely available japan 
present its range just even full charge the tesla model ups this 
the back battery but the battery exceptionally pricey and requires 
triple the charging time the leaf another impediment penetration has been the 
fact that charging infrastructure remains work progress worldwide there were around 
public charging stations globally icct estimate and while this was 
around triple the number just these have fast chargers all 
this suggests evs are currently well suited frequent short distance driving cities but 
remain slightly too inflexible accommodate broader range usage environments 
china possible game changer near term longer term demand hinges 
performance and government policy 
the fact that evs generate zero emissions has governments worldwide offering generous 
subsidies for buyers japan and other developed countries offer subsidies for the 
required charging systems and evs also have the highest purchase subsidies any

continue this policy through this has expecting continued growth the market 
through centered china but think demand could shift toward phevs from 
chinese subsidies taper off and view their ease use and compatibility with 
conventional internal combustion vehicles that said see possibility sales 
continuing rise sharply depending where vehicle performance and government 
subsidies from here battery makers are working improve battery efficiency and are 
also making steady improvements charging time chademo organization working

electrification spreads auxiliary equipment 
shift higher voltages not only for primary motors 
with reliance electric motor power increasing automakers strive achieve 
compliance with environmental regulations think electrification automotive 
components will likely accelerate due expansion the supporting battery capacity 
power supply voltages rise from and then for hevs and 
for phevs the added value auto batteries that support this will naturally increase 
but tandem with this expanding capacity the rise voltage should also promote 
electrification auxiliary equipment engine peripherals that used depend engine

substantial scope for electrification engine and driving components 
engines are surrounded numerous components including oil pumps water pumps 
exhaust gas recirculation egr valves associated with engine air intakes and exhausts 
variable valve timing vvt units turbochargers and compressors that mediate 
engine power are driven oil pressure other means generated engine power 
because these components are connected the engine they cause loss engine power 
and because they depend engine turnover they cannot easily turned and off 
using electric motors run these parts enables efficient control and reduces the load 
the engine thereby enabling automakers boost fuel economy 
automotive oil pump actuator that generates powertrain lubrication cooling 
pneumatic pressure drive other auxiliary components making these electrically 
driven becomes possible control them without relying engine rpms and also use 
idling stop systems all which can sharply improve fuel efficiency electrification has 
similar benefits for water pumps including for use cooling the inverters required 
electrified vehicle electrification exhaust gas recirculation egr variable valve timing 
vvt and turbo superchargers can further improve the fuel efficiency internal 
combustion engine particular electric turbochargers join integrated starter generators 
isg key component for systems conventional turbochargers are driven 
engine exhaust superchargers rely the engine crankshaft but electric 
turbocharger uses motor rotate the compressor this reduces turbo lag and exhaust 
pressure loss caused fluctuations exhaust gas energy and improves the engine 
responsiveness this allows engine down sizing and down speeding and makes major 
contribution improved fuel efficiency the bottleneck electrifying these components 
has been the amount voltage required but this now looks set remedied with the 
development high voltage vehicles higher voltages could also facilitate electrification 
automotive air conditioning compressors support reduced engine loads 
also believe there still substantial scope for electrification suspension systems 
improve driving performance more cars are being fitted with electric power steering 
systems eps but still room for growth the global installment eps roughly 
fuel efficiency could see improvement electrifying the power steering 
which the past was driven hydraulics generated from engines voltages rise more 
cars will include such features electric driving brakes and parking brakes electrically 
controlled suspensions electric active stabilizers and electric four wheel drive expect 
these systems improve vehicle range assist stable driving and contribute 
indirectly improved fuel economy stabilizers act anti rolling anti swaying system 
while cars turns unstable roads with electrification the stabilizers controlled 
motors and reduction gears instead the rigidity the physical stabilizer bars terms 
give more flexibility and smooth control for vehicle stability adopting power supplies 
with higher voltage above the electrified active stabilizers could see more usage 
larger vehicles electric system notably installed new toyota prius equips 
independent driving motor vehicle rear axle traditional used power transfer 
unit transfer case split the output force from transmission front and rear axles 
whereas the electric units generates its own force avoid any engine loss 
establish along with the active stabilizer both units require higher electrical loads 
however anticipate higher installation the overall vehicle power source becomes 
higher

expecting electrification auxiliary equipment lead large 
increase the number motors 
expect large increase the number motors use due electrification 
auxiliary equipment estimate that cars today have around motors average 
excluding the primary motor low price vehicles have around while electrified cars 
and high class vehicles can have over the difference thus substantial electric 
motors are already used for basic functions such starting the engine locking doors and 
operating windscreen wipers however use electric motors for the functions mentioned 
above including engine related and driving components still rare think the shift 
higher voltage systems will push accelerated use motors these components motors 
used engine and driving related parts need powerful this area covers mid

expect increased vehicle electrification hev hev phev drive steady 
growth demand for the high output batteries that power these vehicles the amount 
battery capacity required electrified vehicles varies widely from for hevs 
for evs but the global market for next generation automotive batteries totaled 
upward expect this reach and 
tandem with increased vehicle electrification battery prices per kwh very widely 
but currently average around our estimate 
present electrified vehicles generally use either nickel metal hydride nimh lithiumion ion batteries ion batteries account for the majority due their superiority 
terms charge capacity and charge discharge current but battery makers are working 
develop everything from new basic materials new basic technologies effort 
improve evs driving range and charge performance key issue the need for higher 
capacity batteries enable longer driving distances with onboard space limited battery 
makers are looking into materials with higher energy density they race develop 
higher performance batteries increased penetration also hinges battery costs being 
reduced battery makers aim lower the average cost per kwh from 
present less than 
growth the number electrified vehicles also implies coming economies scale for 
the battery makers however the market for automotive ion batteries has become 
substantially more crowded recent years making for exceptionally competitive 
operating environment the number suppliers rose from just seven over 
the leaders are currently panasonic which supplies tesla toyota primearth

growth electrified vehicles including phevs evs full hybrids 
micro hybrids systems and hev systems for improved fuel efficiency should 
lead not just higher voltage main motors surplus power from higher voltage batteries 
should lead electrification auxiliary devices and higher voltage drives for the system 
expect this lead growth the number passive components and 
semiconductors well increase their value added high voltage components 
tend have higher value added smaller motors lower current capacity helps reduce 
the volume and weight motors and generators and growth the number

the core toyota group supplier for the electrification technologies 
denso has taken all hands approach developing products for electric vehicles 
addition its wide range electronic control systems for internal combustion engines 
assume the company sales parts for hybrid electric plug hybrid and electric 
vehicles are poised grow from its new mediumterm plan calls for consolidated sales compared with 
management looks for earnings growth driven electrical products and expects 
sales adas advanced driver assistance systems related products increase 
denso offers broad range products this field including ecus for hybrid 
electric vehicles inverters converters battery monitoring units electrical current 
sensors high voltage batteries and motor generators moreover the company could 
become significantly involved the electrification auxiliary equipment such electrical 
variable valve timing systems and electric compressors anticipate top line growth 
sales expand for electrical products from the increasing use high voltage systems 
automobiles 
date denso has mainly supplied its electrical products toyota motor but seeks 
increase uptake other automakers developing products that meet their diverse needs 
for systems supplier denso has won orders for inverters and other electrical products 
from nissan motor and mazda motor and began developing batteries after gaining 
foothold ion batteries that were employed the ene charge system the previous 
suzuki wagon model the suzuki solio hybrid launched end features drive 
motor unit developed denso for fully hybrid systems denso can now offer all the key 
components used electric vehicles such motors batteries and inverters and has 
reportedly been increasing its supply capacity systems provider understand that 
the bulk its deliveries for electric vehicles are products for hybrid electric vehicles and 
are focusing its development products for electric vehicles with high voltage 
specifications toward end toyota motor created the business planning 
department new organization for house ventures joined three major group 
companies comprising denso aisin seiki and toyota industries toyota pressing ahead 
with the development electric vehicles one option for meeting zero emission

room for product electrification wide open strengthening joint 
development with group companies 
aisin seiki the world largest supplier transmissions the company has grown 
earnings expanding sales automatic transmissions toyota motor and other 
automakers the automatic transmission business however the weighting 
transmissions for hybrid electric vehicles has been the rise and advances are being 
made the electrification engine and drivetrain components areas strength for the 
company owing part toyota motor the leader the hybrid electric vehicle market 
among external suppliers aisin seiki boasts the largest share the global market for 
transmissions used hybrid electric vehicles since its transmissions were put the 
prius models the company has had foothold for supplying wider range models 
auto auto parts industrial consumer electronics electronic components sector 
april 
including the thereby increasing the weighting hybrid electric vehicle 
transmissions total sales moreover aisin seiki has been working transmission for 
single motor hybrid electric vehicles opening the possibility sales growth 
automakers other than toyota motor its regenerative braking systems are also key 
component electric vehicles and area where demand should continue strengthen 
aisin seiki has been electrifying wide range products such electric pumps among 
engine parts well electric active stabilizers and electric units among drivetrain 
parts electric pumps the company supplies electric oil pumps for cooling hybrid electric 
and electric vehicles well inverters and electric water pumps for cooling engines 
the electrification parts allows the company not only minimize opportunity loss but 
also contribute the optimization cooling mechanisms through the application 
linear controls aisin seiki currently holds top global market share electric water 
pumps well electric oil pump for iss 
their revenue from electric pumps estimated around while 
forecast this expand the expansion the electric pumps should 
fueled further electrification main engine water pumps well from growing 
numbers iss vehicles and electrified vehicles equipped with inverters its electric active 
stabilizers help stabilize vehicle attitude and improve steering stability controlling roll 
integrating motors speed reducers and stabilizers the same axle its electric active 
stabilizers are more responsive than traditional hydraulically controlled stabilizers the 
company electric active stabilizers are primarily installed luxury vehicles and are likely 
used more widely high voltage systems become more prevalent 
aisin seiki began supplying electric units for the new prius traditionally 
units have transfer unit that evenly distributes the force put wheel shafts which 
worsens fuel economy because the rotating force the transmission was distributed 
across the front and rear wheels with electric units independent motor drive 
mechanisms are installed each wheel shaft eliminating the loss power traditional 
units electric units have helped improve the driving performance the prius 
which had been criticized for poor handling freezing cold regions due lack 
october aisin seiki launched four working groups focus product lines for the 
development next generation products the company aims generate synergies 
development assigning group companies each working group and collaborating 
across the organization the electrification working group charge advancing the 
development electrification technologies with major group companies including aisin 
seiki aisin advics and aisin february management announced the 
start virtual company system each business group companies will managed 
single company with the aim bringing together the core technologies each company 
and improving development efficiency the electrification domain aisin seiki which 
makes drivetrain parts and automatic transmissions for commercial vehicles aisin 
which handles automatic transmissions for passenger cars and aisin which supplies 
manual transmissions and transfer units will work together address the needs 
future electric vehicles 
the electric unit the new prius was jointly developed this way group 
companies and may regarded product symbolizing the combined capabilities 
this organization mentioned earlier aisin seiki one the key suppliers the 
business planning department that toyota motor created late last year new 
organization for internal ventures thus believe aisin seiki will strengthen development 
products for electric vehicles aisin seiki has already made known that will spare 
effort developing drive units motors inverters and gear case integration units for
