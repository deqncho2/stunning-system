greater china technology semiconductors 
position for future auto semi 
growth upgrading asm pacific 
and vanguard 
asm pacific and vanguard are the two stocks see 
benefiting the most from fast growing auto semi demand 
the next two years given their revenue exposure 
semiconductor content growing exponentially cars semiconductors are key 
components enable future trends the automotive industry make cars 
safer adas advanced driver assistance systems greener electric vehicles 
and smarter communication entertainment some types semiconductors 
such image sensors and power discretes may see revenue cagr 
the coming decade global auto semi stocks have rated these trends 
within greater china semiconductors think asm pacific auto semi 
equipment vendor and vanguard power discrete foundry are best positioned 
upgrade asm pacific given the growing semi contents cars the stock 
has underperformed hsi hsi asm pacific since 
november given the semi inventory digestion caused smartphone 
demand weakness think the recent market correction has presented good 
entry point into the stock asm has strong position supplying smt surface 
mounting technology placing chips passive components onto pcb boards 
equipment key car module makers such continental which committed 
growing capex the coming years increase and estimated 
continental grow revenue from 
vanguard may transform into power semi foundry the stock has 
outperformed taiex taiex driven the wafer price hikes 
given the tight supply and management comments analyst call for 
potential new fab construction had been cautious the stock given the 
shrinking lcd driver market well competition from china fabs now 
believe power discretes mosfet igbt will significantly change the company 
revenue and margin profiles therefore raise our mid term earnings growth 
rate assumptions and upgrade 
other stock ideas that have exposure auto reiterate smic given 
its exposure automotive camera sensors while other big cap names like tsmc 
and mediatek are also well positioned their revenue contribution from auto 
semis growing but still too small

three secular trends that drive auto semi demand growth 
the semi content increase just illustration the overall trend next 
generation cars that they will become 
safer adas advanced driver assistance systems 
see the most important trend for cars become safer approximately million 
people die every year traffic related accidents almost per day according 
the world health organization such the development adas advanced driver 
assistance systems has been the center discussions the auto industry well 
the semiconductor universe could ultimately promote safer driving and reduce car 
accidents once adopted widely 
different from autonomous driving adas provides various detection systems help 
the driver make safer decisions drive more safely based all the sensor inputs and 
calculations adas indeed stepping stone for the happening true autonomous 
driving beyond level and above but adas will happen much sooner some the 
more crucial subsystems under adas include the following 
adaptive light control system 
autonomous emergency braking 
blind spot monitor system 
driver monitoring system 
lane departure warning system 
surround view system 
all the systems above are enabled through three processes sensing analyzing and 
executing from cmos complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensors 
that capture surrounding images using semiconductor components analyzing the 
inputs using semiconductor hardware such gpu and cpu see many opportunities 
the semi space leverage this secular trend and position benefit addition will 
also need mcus for controlling engines sensors and various other adas related 
applications 
greener electric vehicles 
societies are becoming more aware environmental issues another trend that 
prominent for cars become greener pollution caused the collaterals from 
internal combustion engines has become worldwide issue automobiles with internal 
combustion engines take the total carbon dioxide emissions the world 
along with nox general term for nitrogen oxide which are the main drivers global 
warming global and local governments have also started more environmentally 
conscious setting more and more regulations for auto makers adhere 
result the cost manufacturing internal combustion engines could increase which 
could also further accelerate the progress adopting electric vehicles the future with 
subsidies and gradually decreasing battery prices 
while might take long time adopted more broadly hardware semis for 
both ice and are going enable the trend greener vehicles happen sooner the 
main drivers are pmic and mosfets that waste less energy and increase power 
transmission efficiency which could directly lower emissions the long run addition 
behind every charger some element utility equipment necessary enable power 
flow electric vehicles from transformers wires new electric meters each

vehicle driver monitoring systems vehicle vehicle communication platforms 
and infotainment systems will also make vehicles smarter the dollar amount 
electronic content vehicle has been increasing significantly recent years these 
changes are not just going make the cars more convenient but also more

how does the greater china semi supply chain fit into the auto 
semi investment theme 
will take several years for local vendors replace foreign auto 
semi suppliers 
today semi companies europe and japan still control the key technologies given 
their proximity top auto oems 
china car production outgrowing the world and china accounts for global 
car procurement currently however cars are different consumer electronics and 
require much higher reliability car manufacturers china have typically stuck with 
foreign vendors which quite different smartphone supply chains that have 
broadly adopted chips from asia vendors 
long term believe china will need more domestic suppliers for auto semiconductors 
think will still take several years for greater china semi industry acquire the key 
patents for most advanced automotive semi technology meanwhile are also 
attempting identify the tech enablers the greater china region that are directly 
involved with this auto semi trend and will provide more detailed discussion

think some business models can work greater china auto 
semis 
the following business opportunities are most concrete which why are upgrading 
asm pacific and vanguard today 
idm wafer foundry outsourcing 
majority auto semi vendors today are running idm integrated device manufacturer 
business model which means vertical integration its chip design wafer 
manufacturing and even module assembly idm companies are running fab lite 
strategies maintain certain levels outsourcing reduce capex burden risk some 
outsourcing driven technology limitations mcu companies have stopped 
investing logic fabs and instead outsource foundries for leading edge foundry 
process renasas and stmicro are both the key mcu customers for tsmc outsourcing 
can also driven increase demand the outsourcing analog power semi has 
been slow because most foundry processes are proprietary however given the strong 
demand for power semis expect outsourcing accelerate the coming years

autonomous driving algorithm for china market 
autonomous driving key technology disruption for the car several machine vision 
algorithm companies china are trying develop chips that can run the deep learning 
cars opposed running the algorithm cloud which will take longer the trend 
should benefit domestic algorithm developers because the car needs its chips 
localized that the speed and response times can optimized chip design service 
companies and leading edge wafer foundries should benefit however any revenue 
contribution likely small the coming year 
asm pacific good entry point for the long term auto semi story 
share price has been weak lengthier semi inventory digestion 
downgraded our rating asm pacific three months ago arguing for lengthier 
semi down cycle according tsmc comments semiconductor inventory exiting 
was several days higher than normal which implies that backend equipment orders 
could weak the coming quarter asm pacific still has big exposure smartphone 
semi some secular trends such dual cam and sensing could important 
catalyst the long run however the new lcd iphone might not include the dual cam 
feature save costs all these factors have led asm underperforming the hsi over 
the past three months 
ratio correlation asm pacific stock price 
given the scale and nature asm pacific business its book bill ratio the ratio 
that calculated through the amount that ordered divided the amount that 
actually paid and billed therefore the higher the number means the higher the 
demand has been seen leading indicator the overall semiconductor cycle 
historically when the hits lows has proven good time accumulate the 
stock asm pacific price corrected over the week its earnings 
announcement investors believed that its had peaked after strong run 
its fell believe bookings will recover given underlying demand 
from autos and active alignment tools separately one key customer ase just 
commented that backend capex should flat this year our view 
likely that can move back therefore think are now good 
entry point the market still bearish the smartphone market while the auto semi 
potential has yet fully captured

secular demands from auto semis

like asm long term positioning its revenue comes from auto 
semi applications 
auto accounts for revenue coming from smt for car modules and auto semi 
idm packaging smt the main revenue driver for its automotive business cars are 
becoming more intelligent and connected the increase semi content inevitable 
which will also significantly increase the need for bigger capacity for smt addition 
asm selling diebonder and wirebonders global auto semi idms and other osat 
companies that are doing auto related back end processes aggregate asm has more 
than revenue exposure auto semis and view the company important 
proxy the overall auto semis story 
believe asm pacific will outgrow its peers given its advantages auto 
one characteristic for auto semi that different from smartphones its product 
diversity and lower volume per product smartphone asm pacific leading smt 
and back end equipment provider has advantage autos given its strategy offer 
wide range product portfolio products for customers become more diverse 
think less sensible aim for the highest quality equipment for each manufacturing 
process asm pacific offers comparable quality with more cost effective options which 
our view will likely put step ahead its peers addition being the industry 
leader smt another value add that often overlooked auto industry known for 
being very sticky customer auto companies seldom change partners the leader 
with many top tier auto parts companies believe asm pacific will continue excel 
with resourceful technical support for new players into the field 
our concerns active alignment business proved overdone 
have been too concerned about house threat active alignment equipment has 
been talking point around asm however starting from late investors had 
been worried that camera module makers might start have house capabilities 
terms manufacturing equipment their own based our channel checks asm 
equipment still the standard and not that likely replaced any time 
soon terms cost effectiveness also note that sensing asp around 
that regular cis equipment therefore dual camera becomes more essential while 
sensing applications mature see huge growth potential for asm late

however are raising our eps forecasts for and for leave 
our revenue forecast unchanged but revise our and revenue 
forecasts the threat active alignment equipment sourcing has been 
lifted with added momentum from auto smt and smt for smartphone believe that 
gross margin could expand slightly given the high asp granted equipment 
keep opex unchanged across the timeframe resulting increase eps 
and increase 
compared consensus have slightly higher eps forecasts for and 
believe that the auto semi trend will commence earlier than market expectations 
addition its demand increase beyond this also reflected our bullish 
projection the top line not think that the market has priced the positive 
margin impact the active alignment equipment would command double the asp 
compared the original cis equipment also think that the market has overlooked 
its competitive advantage offers diverse product portfolio that can help 
customers ramp timely with its after sales service and compatible software interface

and also the adoption dual camera and sensing smartphones see being 
relatively cheap compared the rest our coverage addition given its exposure 
auto semi believe that asm pacific will able rate should start exhibit 
less seasonality with strong growth potential into the next few years compared its 
historical numbers asm pacific also trading below its mean terms oneyear forward after the correction since last july the peak its now looks 
good opportunity accumulate asm pacific for exposure auto semi for

wafer prices should continue rise the coming year 
see near term wafer asp and margin upside given strong auto semi demand the 
stock price may have already reflected the wafer price hike but think the 
trend will continue the following quarters given the tight raw wafer supply vanguard 
should also regain bargaining power with lcd driver customers has added led 
power and fingerprint sensors new businesses expect the company guide 
revenue grow usd terms and gross margin should improve further 
however the lack raw wafer supply would constrain the growth 
remains seen how investors react the new fab construction 
proposal 
the last analyst meeting the company did not rule out new fab opportunity 
vanguard does not rule out new fab investment which has changed our negative 
investment thesis about value trap would prefer the company spend more
