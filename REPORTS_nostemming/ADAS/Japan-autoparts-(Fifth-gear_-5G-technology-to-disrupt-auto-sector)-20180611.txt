unfortunately low volume means little data generation however the successful

autonomous vehicles the millions miles which impressive but achieve
full autonomy actually need reliability that million times better need
trillion mile reliability

sounds the math makes
sense
while that sounds preposterous for megamaker like toyota actually
achievable for example consider that toyota sells about unit year and
perhaps those vehicles can drive miles per year over year period
toyota can have enough connected cars gather data one trillion miles
driving this level measuring reliability essential achieving safe systems
and toyota overriding goal for its autonomous driving programme has been
enhance safety
toyota sees risks level

the nissan dena easy ride concept utilises nissan seamless autonomous
mobility system sam ces nissan first introduced sam based
technology this system designed engage human support when autonomous
vehicles run into random unpredictable situations utilising humans where
appropriate nissan hopes accelerate the move self driving world
what the car has break
the rules
for example imagine car comes upon traffic accident where police officer
waving cars around the site forcing the car cross double yellow line illegal
manoeuvre purely independent vehicle would probably forced stop
holding traffic
utilising human mobility
managers
however sam case the vehicle programmed know when should not
make decision its own and contact mobility manager who can evaluate the
situation and paint lane lines the screen the car knows where after
the car clears the trouble spot other cars are informed the situation and the
mobility manager releases the car continue autonomously and proceeds
help with other situations the system learns from experience will need
lean less and less human managers for guidance
the starting point was again
nasa technology
this system product nissan ongoing relationship with nasa nasa visual
environment for remote virtual exploration software was the starting point for
nissan sam system this software was originally used visualise and supervise
interplanetary robots and help them through ambiguous situations

nissan autonomous driving leader and former nasa scientist maarten
sierhuis said our goal change the transportation infrastructure want
reduce fatalities and congestion need huge number vehicles out there
what are doing nissan finding way that can have this future
transportation system not years more but now
interesting admission that
level autonomous may
still years away
find sierhaus statements interesting reality check and admission that
sae level fully self driving vehicles may still couple decades away
interestingly this echoes something that recently heard the opening
honda center where one its advisors stanford university professor
emertis edward feignebaum noted that common sense and judgement were still

gill pratt relates that when toyota ceo akio toyoda was recruiting him
lead the toyota research institute asked toyoda what his priority for
autonomous driving was safety was
one point that stuck pratt head was how high the demand for safety the
automotive industry was for example the public has proved intolerant
shortcomings devices returning the one trillion mile figure pratt that
discussed earlier recall that was the product toyota units

few safety defects
hundreds billions driving
miles can result
existential crisis
yet when think major automotive recalls involving death injury the
numbers are very small relative basis the firestone ford tyre controversy
saw fatalities toyota problems with unintended acceleration cost lives
the takata airbag defect resulted deaths worldwide all these events
lead existential crises for the companies connected them yet all occurred
order magnitude similar one trillion miles driving
not all miles are created
equal
moreover not all test miles are created equal driving the same course over and
over particularly clear days california roads adds little new knowledge
challenging the autonomous systems will result better vehicles says pratt
moreover interpreting low number incident reports where human has take
over control the car false indicator progress pratt believes means the
system not being challenged not only hundreds billions trillion miles
driving needed but high number challenging miles
toyota late entrant
autonomous driving
toyota was late entrant into the autonomous driving race for example ceo
toyoda who well known car racing enthusiast often behind the wheel
himself believed that toyota should provide mobility with humans controlling the
vehicle the slogan fun drive was central the automaker thinking
however the back toyota sponsorship the paralympics met
athletes who told him dial his notion back they simply wanted
mobility personally went through big change thinking
when toyota changed its
view changed big
tri investment
while toyota had some behind the scenes work going autonomous driving
decided greatly step its game november toyota decided
invest over five years and start the toyota research institute tri pratt

toyota considers driver
capabilities driving
environment and system
toyota thinking automated driving research divided into three general
areas the system capabilities the capabilities the driver and the difficulties
the driving environment importantly toyota notes that driver capabilities and
environmental difficulty are dynamic they may vary over time creating situations
where the risk accidents rises substantially thus important goal for toyota
developing automated driving supply systems with enough capability
mitigate crash risks

two types automated
driving guardian and
chauffeur
toyota classifies automated driving capability into two categories one
guardian guardian role intervene driving when looks like the driver
not capable avoiding accident the simplest level are thinking
devices like emergency braking but its ultimate form would prevent any
type driver error resulting accident
guardian prevents
accidents chauffer
autonomous driving but
they share lot
the other capability referred chauffeur chauffeur what usually
think when talk about any level autonomous driving the system takes the
primary role driving the vehicle toyota research primarily based level
and systems while representing different concepts driving guardian and
chauffeur the two systems would based similar hardware and software
the societal hurdle for
guardian low harm
however crashes will probably never preventable how will society
judge what sufficient safety the hurdle for the guardian concept where the
human driver still charge probably much lower than chauffeur guardian
role avoid problems hopefully making bad situation better and the least
harm regulation liability and the public acceptance guardian type
systems will relatively low
chauffeur faces much
higher standard
chauffeur the other hand having the primary responsibility for driving will
face much higher standard while considered human err not cut
machines the same kind slack ces pratt asked the audience
would accept autonomous driving that was only good people resulted
less traffic less pollution and more convenience but there deaths per
annum accidents
americans die
accidents yearly would
accept chauffeur
delivered
would accept autonomous driving only americans died traffic
accidents per year while the rational answer yes the actual answer still
probably interestingly there consensus yet what safe enough
consider the reaction recent uber and tesla accidents the answer seems
and appears that the ultimate hurdle for autonomous driving providers will
high however while consensus will needed soon unclear how
standard will developed and whether will the same globally
toyota has concerns about
levels and level may
hard deliver
level
that vein toyota target primary research towards level and systems
and has deep concerns about level and systems level systems the car
does most the driving but certain situations the driver has ready
reengage with the road getting the driver reconnect time difficult task
and even with seconds warning highway speed means that the
car has identify hazards over away this basis pratt believes
that level may difficult level
recent accidents level
systems show that
maintaining driver vigilance
may impractical
level systems which are increasing the market are not without risk and
recent accidents are starting have the public and government taking dimmer
view autonomous driving level demands that the driver remain constantly
vigilant while the car moving and should expected take control the car
moment notice
psychologists have been
studying vigilance
decrement since
world war
that the idea least the reality that automakers that rely vigilant
driver may bucking human nature indeed the systems get better they may
become riskier drivers overtrust systems maintaining awareness hard
psychologists call the vigilance decrement and have been studying since
world war two when they discovered radar operators were less effective

requirement that
drivers remain constantly
the ball unrealistic
while drivers may have been distracted texting while driving activity
apparently present recent uber and tesla crashes makers that set condition
that those behind the wheel remain constantly top their driving
responsibilities may unrealistic their expectations alternatively alternative
systems might need designed provide small diversions for drivers toyota
emphatically says texting not one them
level coming from
multiple companies the
next several years
returning high level autonomous driving pratt and toyota believe that level
will probably available from multiple companies within the next several years
level essentially level but with restrictions like limited operating areas
speeds times day and maybe only when the weather good given the cost
and the limitations most likely maas will bring level systems the market
faster level what companies refer when they say autonomous driving will
available early the next decade
nobody the automotive
industries close
level system
finally what about the ultimate autonomy none the automobile
industries are close achieving true level autonomy will take many years
machine learning and many more miles than anyone has logged both simulated
and real world testing achieve the perfection required for level autonomy

large processing package
but much smaller than
before
you look the trunk you can see the processing package this also
substantial reduction from the past when they used call junk the trunk
this smaller package can easily removed researchers and work
the environment another
priority
the second priority when pratt was being recruited was the environment
however putting autonomous driving together with green vehicles like battery
creates special challenges
however and are
two things that don mix
this point
one challenge that faces the development high level autonomous driving
are power demands for example pratt noted that the human brain requires
about watts power operate the other hand high level autonomous
drive systems take thousands watts operate perception and planning
systems this comes with couple important implications this probably
explains why toyota level bev concept the palette large vehicle and

wonder the system
needs some value
engineering before
commercially available
for all the sophistication the system drove still appears costly for
example the car boasts dazzling array sensors figures and our
research into adas systems and recent reports lidar price cuts would suggest
that the sensors alone would have very high price tag suspect some value
engineering needs take place additional services need offered with
the system make economically viable this takes back toyota
thoughts maas
perhaps getting costs down
key before introduction
others will have multilane
systems earlier
given how production ready the system appears least superficially wonder
costs are reason why the system will not offered until nissan has
said will offer multilane system from although not yet know the
exact capabilities yet
honda making large
strides
also took ride prototype for autonomous surface street driving
system this prototype highlighted the recognition capabilities that honda has
developed while obviously further away from commercialisation than the
highway driving systems better highlighted the strides honda has been taking
lane lines are not needed
for honda city driving
system
unlike other systems this one does not need lane lines other clear discrete
markings keep the car centred its lane comprehensive decision making
accomplished based variety data such planted areas the texture and
colour the driving surface and road structure
for example the system nuanced enough recognise the boundary the
asphalt road and grassy shoulder the edge the road also can detect
where one road meets another and determine where stop and how turn the
only sensing required for this system was one stereo camera and other aids
such maps lidar honda has been making progress handling road

what are volt mild hybrid vehicles
volt mild hybrid vehicles are vehicles powered internal
combustion engines and are also equipped with electric motors
which helps save fuel turning off the engine when the
vehicles are stopped braking this minimises engine use thus
improving fuel efficiency more powerful electrical systems allow the adoption start stop technologies and thus
improve the fuel efficiency ice cars there are several
reasons why mild hybrids help improve efficiency
volt electrified powertrains which allow engine
electric

motors which provide
acceleration and speed boosts

downsizing enabling more efficient use power
start stop systems which allow the engine idle
while stationary which leads less fuel consumption
high power solutions which support power steering
water pumps and air condition compressors
previously relied ice for power and

electrical systems which support active
suspension systems and electric turbo superchargers

toyota believes that vehicles will tend inhabit one three domains depending
what type electrified power train uses and the size the vehicle and how

domain this undoubtedly reflects concerns about the high costs batteries and
limitations range
toyota sees the main
application fcev for

the clarity platform lacks
space for battery
problem with the clarity phev that its design does not allow for large

have flat platform and the batteries are laid across the whole floor and limit
losses the interior the car for this reason see the clarity bev
weaker offering than the phev most likely the cost the phev will more

tightening regulations
reduce gas emissions and
improve fuel economy
governments tightening regulations reducing gas emissions and improving
fuel economy have been encouraging carmakers adjust their engine
transmission designs comply
regulatory drive cut gas emission and fuel consumption
governments have specifically targeted the auto industry with their own
reduction objectives for greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide
nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matter combat climate

number electronic component items are similar that ice cars the
total number electronic components evs should substantially higher than

the potential losers from the revolution would suppliers that have

evs without expanding into parts
autopart makers with high
exposure engines are
speeding development
offerings
however given the migration from ice cars evs accelerating autopart
companies with high exposure engines have been speeding development
offerings for example powertrain company borgwarner which has high
sales contribution from transmissions and engines for ice cars could face
declining sales pure ice related products however trying catch
offering increasing numbers related products including electric drive
motors power electronics and electric drive modules while phevs with both
