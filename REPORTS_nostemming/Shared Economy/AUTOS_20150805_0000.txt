what they beepi beepi licensed used car dealer that 
connects buyers and sellers used cars through online marketplace the 
online peer peer model enables beepi bring much needed 
transparency the used car buying and selling process not having brick 
mortar stores and commission based selling process beepi can pass 
savings both buyers and sellers other words buyers pay less and 
sellers get more average than they would traditional dealer 
estimate these savings the range unit total beepi 
makes money the markup paid the buyer which more than 
now beepi only transacting cars that are less than years old and 
have less than miles the odometer this the core used retail product 
for franchise well independent dealers 
how does work buyer your vehicle beepi will come you 
run point inspection your car offer you quote everything 
checks out let you keep the car until they find buyer buy the car from 
you they can find buyer within days and collect the car and take care 
all the paperwork seller the vehicle beepi offers haggle price 
the vehicle with markup not more than beepi certified fullservice warranty help with financing the purchase delivery directly 
your driveway and day questions asked money back guarantee 
beepi allows for trade ins well many pieces this process are meant 
match improve the customer experience and transparency franchise 
well independent dealers 
why important the used vehicle market has annual sales 
units with the largest player kmx having market share the used 
vehicle market one the most fragmented automotive verticals with even 
lower barriers entry than the new vehicle market since there are 
franchise laws that can prevent dealers online traditional set many 
stores many markets they want market share consolidation through 
brick mortar strategy alone may too slow and gradual contrast the 
asset light peer peer model extremely scalable case point with less 
than two years operations beepi already markets and per wsj 
article aiming every major market end the year before

expanding international markets the same article stated that beepi 
expected generate revenues car that 
equates roughly cars sold kmx retail volume beepi 
isn the only peer peer dealer out there there are other new entrants with 
similar business models well 
believe high quality inventory key being used vehicle dealer and 
such business models continue beat offer prices from traditional dealer 
stores could start seeing long term shift market share peer peer 
players believe these business models can have meaningful impact not 
only the share but the profitability dealers they continue price 
their vehicles discount brick mortar stores also don believe this 
business model just for millennials especially with the level 
transparency and ease use brought the new entrants our 
conversations with beepi mgmt confirmed this 
what are the barriers entry the barriers entry the used car business 
are relatively low however scale the business and major consolidator 
you need processes and systems that are repeatable transparent and data 
driven this has been one the main drivers kmx success used car 
dealer kmx developed proprietary algorithms and retail like process over 
several years that gave them lead peers what buy what price and 
when sell beepi has developed such proprietary algorithms too but one 
could argue that their model even more transparent and scalable with brick 
mortar strategy your physical footprint key asset while with beepi like 
models your network vehicles inspectors believe the franchise 
and independent dealers want they could complement their brick mortar 
strategy with that peer peer business model however this would favor 
the well resourced dealer groups the average mom pop stores 
what their history beepi was started two years ago business school 
grads ale resnik and owen savir with mission fix broken used car 
market the company started with dozens cars the bay area april 
and quickly expanded operations per media reports beepi last reported 
revenues for and expects revenues this year the 
company now has over employees and aims increase its size 
and every major city end the year they also aim expand 
internationally 
whom they compete with beepi believes they compete with anyone 
who sells car whether its independent franchise dealer just 
individual trying sell similar car through online social platform long 
car that fits their current criteria miles years old beepi 
your competitor 
implications relevance for our stocks don believe the recent rise 
peer peer used car sales fad seen the impact peer peer 
business models with ride car sharing companies uber lyft getaround 
flightcar sidecar via etc the economics the taxi rental market well 
what improved transparency truecar can new vehicle margins and 
gross profit per unit gpu franchise dealers while still early days 
cannot discount the possibility used vehicle profitability coming under 
further pressure traditional dealers because beepi like models however
