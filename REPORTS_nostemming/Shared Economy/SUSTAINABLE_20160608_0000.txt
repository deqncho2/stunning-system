the sharing economy could redesign the competitive landscape judging from 
the sectors where has taken hold with important implications for labor 
markets price formation consumption trends and investment incentives the 
pool assets shared through line platforms growing beyond free file 
exchange transport tourism and financial services where impact already 
material 
affordability and convenience drive the popularity line exchanges 
moreover increasing shift preference towards asset access rather than 
asset ownership partly fostered demographic trends but also urbanisation 
help create the critical mass that sharing platforms need become viable 
business propositions 
the macro level there are multiple benefits the sharing economy for 
economic growth better utilisation resources increases supply lowering 
prices adds real disposable income eventually stimulating demand also 
creating new markets the same time online platforms enable more efficient 
pricing and better supply demand matching 
the micro level there are more grey areas consumers will probably 
increasingly become partial asset owners now easier rent instead 
buying and micro entrepreneurs however the increasingly blurred line 
between the personal and professional sphere commercial transactions raises 
concerns about the labour market and health and safety posing new challenges 
for the measurement economic output tax revenue capturing and 
policymakers regulation

investors thinking that will 
continue thrive and others 
maintaining that 
temporary fad 
where the sharing economy has taken hold notably the transport tourism and financial sector 
challenging existing business models lowering profit margins and threatening incumbents companies 
has the potential expand other sectors consumers preferences continue shift from asset 
ownership access attracted increased affordability amidst falling transaction costs and facilitated 
rising smart device penetration demographics and change the perception what matters for 
status now based more experience and network community trustworthiness are supportive factors 
too the future the sharing economy depends participants trust the platforms but also the 
pace which regulators and incumbents will react well how new technology reduces the need for 
intermediation which the sharing economy still relying present 
the sharing economy even here opinions are 
positive for long term divided between those who 
economic growth 
focus productivity gains 
and those who highlight the 
threat safety and wages 
the economic benefits are broad its present form already encourages more efficient use 
resources and allows better matching supply and demand expanding supply and allowing 
monetisation underused assets broadens the sources income furthermore reducing friction 
costs and information asymmetries lowers prices and barriers access goods and services which 
otherwise could unaffordable and widens consumers options potentially creating new demand 
real terms depending the asset shared there also evidence that can help build community and 
connection with others many the efficiency gains related the sharing economy are not captured 
traditional measures output though making difficult quantify its impact 
going forward whether the sharing economy will result lower consumption goods and services that 
will ease strains resource capacity and reduce waste less clear cut and probably depends the 
sector will also depend how the extra purchasing power that generates spent finally benefits

views are split between the

transactions the sharing economy are increasingly peer peer the boundaries between personal 
and professional the provision commercial services blurred often escaping regulatory framework 
which was designed with traditional businesses mind the extent that sharing economy business 
models rely avoiding costly regulations they are unlikely sustainable though indeed calls for 
more regulation are increasing not just the where the lobby incumbents seems more 
powerful especially where economic rents are high but also the 
nevertheless this does not mean that governments will extend existing regulations automatically the 
sharing economy even country approaches may course differ resolution these challenges may 
include self regulatory approach which might represent more efficient compromise between 
regulation all and government heavy handed approach 
could the sharing 
yes this will reduce 
economy risk creating competition

creating new monopolies this side effect platform based models which naturally tend scale

summary and conclusions 
the sharing economy growing fast the industries where has taken hold 
reshaping significantly business models compressing profit margins and challenging 
incumbent companies has the potential broaden further and transform additional 
markets thus far have probably only just scratched the surface its potential 
taking the cue from the model the sharing economy has fostered transactions 
and will likely continue expand the range resources capital and labour that 
can shared broadens this note provide framework understand which 
goods and services lend themselves better shared and how sectors can 
affected 
the sharing economy umbrella encompassing different types economic 
exchanges times informal via online platforms which have increased thanks 
network externalities created rising internet and smart devices penetration well 
rising users trust present most are profit driven whilst some are genuinely 
collaborative they all have two common traits the use temporary access nonownership models utilising goods and services the reliance online platforms 
that facilitate the matching demand and supply resources time and skills 
exhibit the sharing economy changing the way individuals value asset ownership 
the options green are the new sharing exchanges that peer peer online transactions have made available 
source morgan stanley research 
the primary drivers the sharing economy are the increase product transparency 
accessibility and affordability they offer even the latter times can only 
perceived convenience matters too finally demographics and urbanisation are also 
supportive well changes the factors that are important for status 
internet connected world they seem longer defined asset ownership rather 
respect network community 
the macro level there are multiple benefits for long term growth the positives 
encompass better asset utilisation better matching supply and demand and more 
efficient pricing among others the micro level contrast implications are not clearcut including for the labour market health and safety and the environment moreover 
evidence that encourages genuine collaboration mixed longer term whether the 
sharing economy triggers reduction consumer spending that can alleviate the strain 
resources with positive environmental impact depends the industry and how 
the extra real disposable income that the sharing economy itself helps generate 
spent 
our analysis suggests that countries where consumption per capita already 
elevated and where trust high between transacting peers and the institutional 
framework the sharing economy finds fertile ground and but there 
also upside potential emerging markets since individuals own fewer assets and have 
lower income they may shift attitudes towards asset access opposed ownership 
faster although admittedly owning assets may remain appealing hedge against 
political and policy risks 
the sharing economy grows traditional consumer spending habits are likely 
change assessing whether purchase asset consumers will now conduct 
cost benefit analysis which will include the possibility renting the asset out 
maximise utility instead buying importantly individuals can consumers and 
suppliers the same time the line between the personal and professional sphere 
commercial transactions will become increasingly blurred posing new challenges for the 
measurement economic output tax revenue capturing and regulations for 
policymakers exhibit 
our analysts highlight that for some industries the sharing economy disruptor 
whilst opening new opportunities for others according our autos analysts 
difficult find beneficiaries across listed companies globally with challenged models 
including car rental most oems and many suppliers however they see couple 
opportunities toyota may benefit from its recently announced strategic tie 
with uber whilst our tesla investment thesis substantially driven our 
analyst view the company entering the demand mobility business where sees 
well positioned initiatives non traditional areas mobility including 
its initiatives ride sharing models and related acknowledgment 
autonomous automated driving trends contributed our analyst upgrading his rating 
the stock from europe bmw drivenow and ridenow the 
most significant house development car sharing services elsewhere our analysts 
believe the otas such expedia and priceline are risk from the 
alternative accommodation providers like airbnb analysts see limited disruption 
the global hotel industry however they are watching developments carefully with 
recent cautious comments europe and the finally parcel carriers such ups 
and fedex are facing the threat emerging startups crowdsourcing lastmile delivery local level leveraging the growth omnichannel retailing 
broadening the types assets shared could have positive consequences for other 
sectors such healthcare reduced costs more cost effective treatment and 
telecoms acceleration broadband and mobile penetration for some sectors the 
impact mixed like insurance which could benefit from the emergence new 
products such cyber insurance but suffer from fewer revenues from car insurance 
our conclusion that are probably the start transition the extent that 
sharing economy business models rely avoiding costly regulations they are not 
sustainable result the future the sharing economy depends the pace 
which regulators and incumbents will react this front the recent guidelines the 
commission which discourage overly restrictive measures the sharing economy 
encouraging moreover the pace which new technology reduces the need for 
intermediation which the sharing economy still relying present also important 
ironically the large line platforms which are currently enjoying the benefits scale 
network effects may become victims their own success and could challenged 
either new technology stricter regulation both entirely possible that the 
sharing economy evolves the role intermediaries will mutualised 
what store for the sharing economy 
the activity sharing not new the dictionary definition sharing participate 
use enjoy experience jointly sharing traditional consumer behavior and basic 
form distribution which often confused with commodity exchange and gift giving 
forms family community based sharing existed the past and still exist but 
people have historically limited their sharing within their own close social network 
what new the sharing out opposed the sharing within familiar circles 
which technology facilitating instead sharing and exchange transactions now involve 
strangers today sharing platforms facilitate sharing among people who not know 
each other and who not necessarily have friends connections common their 
origins trace back the online retail platforms such amazon which originally acted 
intermediary between companies and consumers sell goods with increasing 
internet and broadband penetration and the advent smartphones the sharing 
economy has developed into market for exchanges amongst peers who share their 
assets whether physical human capital skills 
can the success uber replicated elsewhere 
uber business model centres application app which enables consumers and taxi drivers connect directly thus 
removing the need for either centralised booking system for cab hailed the street its growth has been rapid 
with uber now operating countries and over cities uber taxi drivers are largely classified independent 
contractors rather than employees uber they own they own cars uber helps them with deals car rentals and 
financing and thus the business model largely viewed individuals sharing their own asset with other individuals who 
not have access car number alternatives uber have been launched including ridewithvia blablacar which 
encourages ride pooling and lyft the high value the asset combined with the low car utilisation rate our autos analysts 
estimate that cars are used for just hour day are two key characteristics that facilitate the use this type 
service for shared economy 
via better utilisation their resources the sharing economy enables asset owners 
provide temporary access goods and services consumers generally exchange 
for fee two the most notable examples line sharing platforms are uber and 
airbnb which operate the transport and tourism industries but there are 
increasingly large number examples different types good and services being 
shared the broader economy these include labour services taskrabbit nondurable goods such handbags bag borrow steal wifi fon durable goods 
such boats boat bound innovations have also occurred the financial sector with 
the growth platforms for crowdfunding and peer peer lending 
difficult estimate how large the sharing economy could become this depends 
many factors that explore later the report but have created framework 
for considering where there may significant growth present there are least 
seven requirements for successful shared economy our view 
technology penetration reaching critical mass with any internet based business 
success dependent high number active participants arguably this even more 
vital within sharing economy that depends individuals borrowing renting from 
each other rather than one larger company over the last years internet penetration 
has risen from globally with substantial increases both the developed 
and developing world exhibit and exhibit there has also been rapid rise active 
mobile broadband subscriptions which particularly important for the sharing 
such uber and smartphone penetration exhibit and exhibit this not only 
among the young generation but the popularity tablets boosting the number 
older people going online well ahead ecommerce penetration expected 
continue increase over the next three years according analysts across all

trust between actors the sharing economy because the 
sharing economy its infancy little regulation has been 
developed far for now sharing economies rely the 
continued development generalised trust order for peer topeer transactions occur lenders suppliers need trust that 
their assets are protected from fraud damage furthermore 
the effectiveness the legal system protect property rights 
important too 
there are several ways which the internet enables such trust 
built between strangers social media and review websites 
have created immediate feedback loop which provides insights 
into the best and worst actors both sides the sharing 
source nielsen global survey share communities morgan stanley research 
relationship indeed friedman notes reputational enforcement 
works spreading true information about bad behaviour people 
who receive that information modify their actions accordingly which imposes costs 
those who have behaved badly 
and does appear that consumers are trusting the sharing economy study 
nielsen concluded that global online consumers are willing share rent their 
personal items share communities for payment exhibit furthermore two thirds 
are likely use the products and services from others shared community 
relatively high value assets the benefit renting sharing asset declines 
with the value the good for example the apparel sector luxury handbag which 
costs several thousands dollars might rented out consumers unable 
unwilling spend such large amount themselves however new not pre cycled 
dress unlikely have the same demand surprise therefore that the two 
most successful examples sharing economy are linked the two most expensive 
assets consumers typically want access too property and cars 
unused capacity the rest the report analyse what are the incentives for 
asset owners rent their assets and for users borrow rather than buying them 
unlocking unused capacity this exchange mechanism leads better utilisation 
resources otherwise idle and boosts the flexibility markets meet consumer 
demand for services arguably person always utilised whether working 
sleeping enjoying leisure time however the sharing economy can help organise 
time optimise the balance and structure day week etc indeed the sharing 
services could actually meet people demands for more flexible working individuals 
can set their own parameters for the type work they are willing and the time 
that they are available possibly being even more productive 
intermediary enable the two sides the transaction meet most sharing 
economy business models are based platforms connecting individuals who possess 
excess resources with individuals who need resources creating two sided markets 
one side the market the platform contracts the service with the customers the 
other side independent service providers deliver the service using their own assets 
effectively the platform which acts intermediary and does not directly employ 
the service providers nor has any ownership control the assets that are used 
provide the service uber does not own cars alibaba has inventory airbnb has 
real estate properties the penetration blockchain might remove this need going 
forward though 
new attitudes asset ownership another key driver the expanding sharing 
economy the changing consumption habits certain demographic groups 
particular the millennials the there some evidence that uber and similar car 
sharing services may resulting less demand for car ownership looking the 
overall the percentage under holding driver license has fallen over the last 
years between bps depending the specific age cohort exhibit now 
there are other factors behind this trend with uber only starting but 
interesting development that worth following look the broader sharing 
economy nielsen global survey share communities also suggests that 
the millennials who are driving the popularity and success the sharing economy 
indeed millennials born are willing rent from sharing 
community compared generation and baby boomers exhibit 
flexible working practices the sharing economy triggering shift away from 
dependent employment towards self employment enabling workers work when they 
want and have more employment mobility according recent based study 
around line adults aged years have tried find paid work through 
sharing economy platforms such upwork uber handy although only around half 
this number have been successful slight bias towards women 
men and almost one third crowd workers aged years interestingly 
there huge variety work being conducted within the sharing economy exhibit 
and exhibit driving accounted for just respondents compared 
computer line work and professional work estimated that uber 
drivers drive less than hours per week 
exhibit the share younger people with driver license

which sectors may impacted 
goods services likely shared amongst peers 
the propensity peers participate line sharing platforms depends partly 
the characteristics the goods service exchanged and their pricing exhibit 
there are also other factors which will explore later the report that might affect 
participants willingness share but for many successful start ups there are also many 
line platforms that have failed quickly partly because the goods services whose 
sharing they wanted facilitate did not lend themselves this business model for 
example the idea sharing drills seemed initially appealing drills owned 
households are typically underutilised however has not proved successful 
other products because drills are small ticket items with relatively low difference 
between the value buying and renting 
the product demand and supply elasticities matter the demand elasticity measures 
how demand for good service changes response changes variables such the 
product absolute price relative prices competing products and income level the 
supply side because sharing may involve rivalry for the underlying product actual and 
perceived product scarcity the likelihood that product unavailable when 
consumer desires access also important determinant sharing propensity 
therefore the availability the good service which depends also the size the 
pool owners and renters matters too for example individuals are more likely find 
parking spot justpark many people the same area rent out their driveways and 
that would tend reduce prices conversely prices would higher when demand 
exceeds supply 
based academic evidence and available surveys have singled out the following 
variables which can affect the demand and supply the assets shared 
price the higher the price good service purchased the more likely 
rented both the expected return for the supplier increases well 
the attractiveness for the consumer that can enjoy the good for short period 
time and fraction the purchasing price 
income high household income typically associated with greater ownership this 
important the sharing economy could increase the availability and the 
accessibility goods and services lower income earners thus increasing 
inclusiveness 
frequency usage goods that tend used frequently are typically also 
owned and are less likely rented out the sharing economy good 
rented frequently transactions costs for example delivery costs have also 
factored 
predictability usage not just the frequency that matters the determining 
the propensity ownership but also its usage can planned advance pair 
scissors less likely rented than grass mower which might used 
frequently but whose usage easier plan 
proximity this important assess transaction costs and the availability 
supply for example with taskrabbit the elasticity supply due the fact 
that the seller might available perform tasks only within defined time 
window any given month say every saturday depending the distance 
that they have travel 
how supply can vary preference for ownership still relatively high this implies 
that most people who want rent assets are competitive since they already own the 
asset that they are willing share the cost purchasing that assets has already been 
paid and therefore will probably not factored the cost benefit analysis the 
supplier over time however the attractiveness renting increases fewer people 
may replace the assets that they own when those assets reach the end their natural 
life and rent them instead goods are scarce this means that the pool available 
assets will shrink resulting higher prices here costs are also important any cost 
renting would create economy scale that would favour those with lots capacity 
sell the rental market costs are high and significant ownership would tilt back 
towards those who not value their own consumption traditional rental firms 
exhibit low frequency and high predictability usage ideal for sharing asset owners 
the exhibit displays selection goods and services that can shared via line platforms their positioning the four quadrants random and does not reflect the exact intersection between the mix 
frequency predictability use for each item which may also subjective

sector 
even the where the sharing economy less advanced than the growing 
fast the commission estimates that gross revenues from collaborative platforms 
and providers were almost double the amount its potential 
significant but there already clear evidence that some sectors the sharing economy 
causing disruption 
autos the shared mobility model moving the transportation business from 
privately owned and operated model professional service run large firms 
engaged mega fleet management this addressing the key inefficiency the autos 
industry cars are typically used for less than hour day with utilitisation rate less 
than hour day but also utilisation available seat mile basis 
occupancy rates out available seats the average car multiplied our 
analysts estimate that shared miles taxis plus ride sharing firms excluding car rental 
could much the global vehicle miles travelled compared

trillion miles traveled around dollar per mile for trillion global gdp 
plus passenger hours annually provide profound adjacent opportunities areas

banks market place lenders offer the potential for new form disintermediation 
offering loans directly between investors and borrowers without the need for bank 
the benefit could both regulatory arbitrage less capital needed well less 
maturity mismatch this maturity mismatch has been the basis banking and 
supported economic growth but understandably source regulatory concern given 
was stretched too far pre crisis which new rules have addressed growth 
marketplace lending has been strong aided institutional investors the west turbo 
charging growth think large proportion growth has been from the latter rather 
than retail the positive the benefit scaling quickly but institutional funding 
could more fickle changes perception the opportunity and risks marketplace 
lenders challenge traditional banks and lenders price service offering and 
convenience but they are prompting banks their game through becoming more 
efficient and timely 
the marketplace lending travails early have however highlighted the 
limitations relying institutional and the need for operational excellence lenders 
need the tech savvy start with the hard headed operational excellence and 
diligence the best class consumer lending unit one prominent firm raised the flag 
that there put back risk the platforms potentially requiring more capital globally 
market place lending flourishing china and stand out strong markets overall 
see this development positive one although like any entrepreneurial activity 
may need refinement 
but what about other sectors also being impacted increasing desire share 
assets between consumers surveyed our research sector analysts look beyond 
the current market conditions and consider future developments that might possible 
the sharing economy expands 
aerospace defence 
sharing defence equipment across nations may reduce overall demand indeed 
the smart defence initiative launched nato encouraging members the alliance 
work together harmonising requirements pooling and sharing capabilities setting 
priorities and coordinating efforts better 
brands 
there are already numerous websites for sharing luxury goods such handbags 
bag borrow steal vestiaire collective making expensive brands accessible 
wider population there the risk loss luxury status addition consumers 
focus shifting from possession experience the demand for rental service would 
increase while overall discretionary spending could come down this trend could 
eventually challenge the company resource efficiency especially for retailers with 
property asset invested 
business services 
websites such taskrabbit are enabling individuals seek direct employment for 
range tasks such office work cleaning deliveries this could result less 
demand for recruitment companies with individuals advertising their skills and spare 
capacity work directly 
capital goods 
sharing property could result greater demand for residential refurbishment 
order that the homeowners sharers meet safety standards 
shared mobility may lead lower volumes cars and could also reduce demand 
for public transport vehicles with alternatives like uber being cheaper and more 
convenient there may also less demand for hotel construction 
food retail 
food sharing coop services farmigo could disintermediate the food retail 
environment this could have larger impact fresh rather than packaged food items 
but could have growing impact traffic grocery and specialty stores that impacts 
the entire basket 
general retail 
there are couple long standing but niche examples renting goods suits 
tools but most the products that people buy from mass market retailers are either 
consumed food low value most clothing used frequently consumer electronics 
furniture making sharing difficult possible though that the retailing second 
hand goods becomes more commonplace 
healthcare 
the sharing expensive laboratory equipment could reduce the cost 
particularly for early stage biotech companies the sharing big amounts medical 
data from patients diagnostics monitoring expected reduce the total cost 
treatment for payers giving the right treatment the right patients 
insurance 
increased use the internet and big data could result the growth new 
products such cyber insurance increased underwriting performance supports 
profitability 
shared mobility could lead premium pressure there will fewer cars the 
road increased competition pricing pressure with likely increased performance 
differential between those that own and are able analyse the data and those that 
lag 
property construction 
the success property sharing mainly affecting demand for hotels are 
witnessing gradual move towards shared offices which some point could lead 
reduced office demand but doubt this will ever have material impact office 
property fundamentals 
technology 
new technologies are enabling technology shared much more effectively this 
especially true infrastructure servers and datacentres where first virtualisation 
software enabled companies mutualise application workloads across servers 
running one application one server and now the cloud enables companies share 
entire datacentres amazon web services 
car sharing could lead reduced ownership which negative trend for 
semiconductors one offsetting factor though would the higher car utilisation rate 
which would imply shorter replacement cycle 
telecoms 
there will increased demand for connectivity between people people peopleto things and things things which will help accelerate broadband and mobile 
penetration especially regions countries where currently lags 
meeting this demand will likely require the deployment generation mobile 
networks which will likely lead higher capital investments for additional 
infrastructure and spectrum rights 
transport 
shared mobility could result fewer cars motorways toll roads and also 
reduced demand for public transport 
utilities 
sharing economy could reduce the capital intensity the grid business however 
this would also reduce the growth rate for regulated networks and not without 
negative implications 
distributed energy resources especially solar and electric storage could depending 
network regulation and rate design allow consumers share sell buy energy 
generated from distributed resources and offer more services the grid peak shaving 
grid congestion relief this could incremental negative for grid electric 
demand and could also mean some reduced investment regulated electricity 
transmission distribution but only regulation allows 
the sharing economy positive for economic growth 
markets where the sharing economy already has taken hold its impact has been 
powerful increasing supply reducing prices and compressing profit margins 
result challenging incumbent operators and traditional working conditions 
whether resources are bought rented through platform they are actually 
shared when more than one consumer uses the same asset the same time either 
for monetary transaction not the sharing economy has brought many benefits but 
has also raised controversial questions the economic social and environmental fields 
exhibit most academic research has focused trying design better sharingeconomy marketplaces rather than quantifying its broader impact measuring the 
magnitude the free lance workforce the rest this note highlight pros and 
cons 
exhibit many positives but also areas with mixed negative implications 
source morgan stanley research 
the benefits 
increased supply the benefits the sharing economy originate primarily from better 
utilisation resources economists usually measure the underutilisation capital and 
labour via the output gap the difference between the actual gap economy and its 
potential capacity utilisation rates and unemployment rates increased utilisation the 
stock shareable resources effectively expands supply unlocking potential output 
owners assets whether physical financial human capital skills can maximise 
the utilisation their assets extracting value and increasing their income even the 
case resource pooling which can reduce demand for certain good service there are 
efficiency gains which are positive for economic growth 
lowers prices itself increase supply with constant demand will decrease the 
equilibrium prices the price which the quantity goods supplied equal the 
quantity demand and increase the equilibrium quantity which demand and supply 
match 
stimulating demand result increasing the accessibility and affordability 
resources transactions that otherwise might have not taken place would have 
happened via intermediary but higher cost would increase stimulating higher 
demand put differently suppliers can tap new customers and consumers having 
broader options may tempted spend more 
better demand supply matching facilitating market transactions via internet 
platforms the sharing economy allows better matching supply and demand than 
via traditional intermediaries competition among suppliers increases moreover 
academic evidence shows that the thickness markets increases too raising the 
number buyers available each seller and the number sellers available each 
buyer also increases the probability that any given time agents are able transact 
corollary from this that transactions are also generally faster demand the 
improved matching happens via 
search algorithms that operate large scale leverage big data and often 
improve more data become available the latter point important because 
implies that internet platforms are associated with constant rapid innovation and

lower transaction costs effectively the sharing economy emerged because 
developments information and communications technology have significantly lowered 
transactions costs exhibit principle every market exchange carries transaction 
costs also known friction costs these include search and information costs decision 
costs bargaining time and efforts some cases transactions which could mutually 
beneficial economic agents not occur because transaction costs are too high for 
instance one ebay first transactions consisted selling broken laser pointer 
collector broken laser pointers transaction that probably would have involved high 
advertising and search costs for the matching occur another advantage the 
reduced need for individual contracts negotiated for every transaction and lower 
associated costs costs are also falling reflecting efficiency gains and innovation which 
have compressed the marginal costs productions feature that will explore later 
the note 
the information crowdsourcing economic transactions are longer only just about 
selling renting goods and services offering and marketing are now about creating new 
distribution channels and personalised experience when consumers make purchases 
they check products online pages compare different suppliers prices real time 
check reviews but importantly with the increasing popularity social media feeds

more efficient pricing turn the faster and increased availability information 
implies that markets become more transparent and definition more efficient this 
does not mean per that prices the sharing economy are necessarily lower than 
traditional markets because the market clearing price will also depend the 
characteristics the goods and services exchanged and highlighted earlier 
demand and supply 
for example depends whether there competition between individuals use 
good service there rivalry their use also depends whether other users can 
excluded from using that good service excludable economists refer 
goods and services with these characteristics rivalry and excludability private 
goods services opposed public goods services goods services among which 
there rivalry and from which one excluded for instance using piece 
expensive clothing drill both private goods can only done one person 
time national defense often cited example public goods instead because 
equally available all country and there zero marginal cost from additional 
person using there are also goods which fall between these two categories for 
example some are characterized non rivalry but are excludable known club 
goods for instance swimming pool which might only accessible members 
sporting club cable finally there are goods that are characterised rivalry but 
are non excludable known common goods for instance most national resources like 
fish stock water resources which generate externalities 
depending the type good service the market clearing price through the sharing 
economy should better reflect demand and supply conditions this the basic principle 
behind the dynamic pricing model adopted uber under which prices fluctuate 
depending the time the day the customer location the day the week etc 
response changing supply demand conditions this concept not new the seasonal 
pricing policy the tourist sector old practice but the calculation and the 
matching now done using algorithms faster more accurate and more efficient 
dynamic sales mechanisms now exist the web with more traditional pricing models 
such posted prices and auctions 
empirical evidence lower costs but not nihil 
general line platforms have been accompanied lower prices but some degree price dispersion persists the 
early days online trading bryjolfssons and smith found that online prices for books and cds were average roughly 
cheaper than offline but displayed significant range among retailers string further studies found persistent price 
dispersion also for other products such consumer electronics despite the seemingly low cost nature the search 
environment costs decrease but not disappear 
consumers are more informed but not always compare all prices even the internet 
new frictions have emerged online retailers have put place marketing prices that encourage consumers 
click items that appear the top listed options result customers not always buy the cheapest 
option and sometimes not buy the product that prompted the original search 
auction prices are not always cheaper than posted prices even this hard reconcile with standard 
models costly search some studies found that when items are available both posted prices and auction 
prices the latter are typically lower but there are instances which they exceed the posted prices this could 
happen because there less need use auction discover the appropriate market prices since easier 
now find comparable prices line 
consumers not internalise certain fees and costs several studies found for example that ebay auction 
prices not fully adjust reflect differences shipping fees 
platform fees some platforms charge fixed fee and others minimum payment these are usually priced 
two sided market makers enlarging the network subsidising one side the market and charging the other 
side the full price 
the experience value consumer welfare can also enhanced the value off line 
practices such the interaction with people with whom asset shared from 
staying different neighborhood outside the hotel district and getting more 
authentic experience location other words consumers value the experience and 
not just the mere utility the shared asset discuss the difficulties quantifying 
this aspect challenging statisticians later the note 
incentives improve behaviour moreover there could positive side effects from 
the participation exchange platforms where suppliers and consumers are rated 
users have incentive rated positively and improve their scoring which helps 
facilitate future participation line platforms and the individual social networks 
that create communities users with similar levels trust 
where the glass half empty half full 
there are also aspects the sharing economies where the implications the macro 
level are more mixed 
labour markets sharing bringing about major changes traditional models 
work which will explore more detail separate note facilitating the 
matching labour demand supply the sharing economy helps easing labour market 
rigidities with additional benefits could help bridge the gap between the skill 
demand supply with socio economic advantages stimulating more productive and 
engaged workforce could also reduce unemployment and underemployment and 
increase accountability because customer feedback 
the media debate often neglects that economic activity the internet platforms may 
benefit below median income consumers recent academic research suggests 
indeed empirical evidence shows that willingness share varies income increasing 
household income associated with greater asset ownership with the exception 
extremely expensive goods like vacation houses jets coincidence that the 
sharing economy impetus has increased during the great recession and helped 
people generate extra income time financial strain this respect the sharing 
economy can source inclusion barriers ownership are more significant 
when income and wealth are lower 
however increasing shift from salaried self employed jobs unintended can 
also source tensions introduces new level uncertainty for the 
workforce which turn becomes less protected more precarious and with more 
difficulty accessing consumer credit indeed free lancers frequently lament long 
delays collecting payments the revenue models the internet based intermediaries 
are often based independent contractors which have lower social security costs than 
employees workers would also lack ongoing training and continuing professional 
development this respect the sharing could exacerbate income inequalities see 
sustainable economics mind the inequality gap november 
health and safety the individuals who are providing goods and services via the 
sharing economy providers not see themselves business operators nor 
employees result they may not aware their rights and responsibilities 
similarly consumers the sharing economy not understand the risks involved 
when renting goods and services sharing information essence the boundary 
between the personal and professional provision services becomes blurred this can 
result transfer risks for example insurance risks individual consumers and 
providers making them vulnerable they are not cognisant them will explore 
this issue more depth later the sections titled self government regulation 
building communities the evidence whether transactions the sharing 
economy enhance social capital with friendships and networks providing social gains 
mixed indeed some social platforms such couchsurfing hospitality exchange 
platform have led new friendship but they tend casual elusive and not 
durable with participants relayriders peer peer carsharing platform describing 
their interactions anonymous and sterile 
the negatives 
taxation present some sharing earnings from the sharing economy may evade 
taxes this because the tax levied commercial transactions applies businesses 
self employed people registered with the tax authorities and the latter case they 
often only pay taxes after certain threshold instead many individuals who may act 
suppliers the sharing economy are not registered self employed and even they 
they may not earn enough money exceed the thresholds that were set prior 
the birth the sharing economy moreover transactions are not subject vat 
furthermore the lack contribution the social security system many 
participants the sharing economy another source concern this could happen 
refusal eglect because working flexibly contractors they may not reach the 
minimum income threshold above which social security contributions are charged 
recent study commissioned the parliament concluded that eventually this may 
imply move model where contributory obligations and social protection are 
longer linked employment status salary system but the individual 
this uncaptured business creates shortfall for the tax authorities that may get bigger 
the sharing economy expands interesting that the australian taxation office has 
recently decided that all sharing economy drivers must file with the australian business 
register and pay the goods and services tax regardless their earnings airbnb has also 
started collect local takes behalf the municipalities barcelona and paris 
separate problem although not strictly connected with the nature the sharing 
economy also the taxation the profits made the sharing economy line 
platforms this because the platforms currently typically pay the taxes the country 
where they are domiciled and not where the business generated order try and 
optimise their tax burden 
rethinking traditional consumer spending 
new way consumer spending although online platforms have greatly enhanced 
exchanges and lowered transaction costs are probably still early stage the 
adjustment social norms and preferences technological changes when comes 
spending consumers still value ownership but with time renting will probably become 
increasingly popular consumer adjust their preferences and lifestyles the idea 
temporary ownership ownership all trend that demographics will help 
fuel the affordability asset ownership remains key determining how quickly this 
shift will happen think for example how rapidly the switch rents occurring 
countries where real estate prices are overvalued 
challenging traditional economic theory this means that many the assumptions 
underlying standard economic models will have reconsidered for example 
neoclassical consumer theory individuals are treated only consumers 
purchasers consumer goods services however more now than the past 
consumers may also act producers the market furthermore economic models 
typically treat consumers preferences which depend culture education and 
individual taste for example given they are considered exogenous practice 
this means that for example more knowledge and information may attract consumers 
attention particular brand but does not alter the consumers underlying 
preferences across different brands instead now increasingly important take into 
account that preferences change with knowledge advertisement and marketing efforts 
preferences are endogenous and more frequently than the past implying that 
more important understand how several determinants demand work 
simultaneously rather than only few any given time 
but easier track than the past the good news that contrast the past 
when consumer behaviours were studied through sampling which were erratic not 
always systematic and often costly now internet platforms can conduct web based 
experiments this implies that results are measured instantaneously cheaply and from 
much larger individual and geographical samples the same time pricing offers 
adverts change soon different users browse displays

the choices the prosumer 
because individuals can consumers and producers the same time for example 
they can consume the energy for their domestic use which generated their solar 
panels and also sell the excess production into the grid the line between the two roles 
now blurred leading the rise new economic agent the prosumer means 
that when spending money individuals are now confronted with new options 
incorporate their decision making process 
owning renting when buying goods and services consumers typically try 
maximise their level satisfaction utility given their budget constraints which turn 
depends income and prices more goods and services become available rent 
the peer peer market addition deciding whether buy and asset not based 
its expected usage they will also assess the cost renting that asset opposed 
owning outright moreover they will evaluate the possibility lending out that asset 
temporarily they decide buy instead exhibit admittedly markets which 
individual owners sometimes used their assets for personal consumption and sometimes 
rented them out have existed for long time for example holiday lettings yachts 
however the variety goods and services offer now increasing and comprising 
assets typically used more frequently and for shorter periods time 
sitting idle lending owning asset there are now new factors that 
consumers have consider when assessing the desirability when and how use the 
asset for instance their time preference between using the asset now later could 
vary usually time preference personal individual with high time preference 
values more his her well being the present and the immediate future relative the 
average person contrast someone with low time preference chooses defer 
consumption therefore valuing more his her well being the future given choice 
rational individuals would rather have rewards sooner rather than later preferably 
more rather than less and minimum costs 
effectively the owners expected extra income from renting asset should exceed the 
monetary value the related utility loss the lost pleasure time costs and any 
other lost benefits that would have derived from not renting the asset for asset 
owners willing have economic incentive offer the assets the rental 
market result when making relative temporal decision between whether use 
asset now later rational consumers will assess the net present value the future 
streams income that can derived from renting the asset theory the incentive 
put the asset the market will persist until the owner and the renter receive the same 
utility the margin some cases the economic incentive persists and large 
enough the user may decide become full time product service provider 
eventually the price good services will set level which both owners and 
renters receive the same level satisfaction for sharing one more unit good 
service they both have the same marginal utility the price has low enough 
that there some pool owners but not low that everyone who demands that 
good service might better off buying put differently the cost renting the 
good service the time below the purchase price then ownership less 
attractive similarly the rental rate net costs higher than the purchase price 
good service would more attractive buy the product than rent out 
opportunity costs 
the possibility lending asset the peer peer rental market increases asset values but also creates new 
opportunity costs for asset owners 
consider the following example someone who has spare bedroom his her own house has assess the benefit the 
extra income from renting the bedroom for example through airbnb against the opportunity cost not having spare 
room host family guest member the discomfort having stranger the house 
similarly worker that offers labour skills say driving with uber free lancing manual skills with taskrabbit has 
assess the value the extra income earned outside working normal hours they have standard job against the value 
other activities that could done whilst not working for instance sleeping seeing friend other leisure activities 
there are also other costs considered including depreciation and maintenance for example the cleaning the 
house the car the handing off the house keys and other transaction costs these costs born individuals could 
higher than those negotiated specialist firms for example hotels because specialists have economies scale this 
end there are now internet based platforms that offer services users airbnb such pillowhomes that provide 
short term rental management uber such rideshare insurance that provides insurance uber drivers which also 
have included cost benefit analysis over time however manufacturers might begin supply products that 
satisfy these needs for example locks that allow remote entry cars and houses 
practice research behavioral economics has found that nonprofessionals are more likely suffer from behavioral 
biases such loss aversion limited attention and overconfidence these behavioral anomalies often change the prediction 
traditional models based complete rationality for example property managed professional host earns 
higher average daily revenue has higher occupancy rate despite being offered for the same number days per 
week similar average price furthermore properties managed non professional hosts are more likely exit the 
market everything else being equal

premiumisation diversification 
one important implication how the sharing economy may affect consumer 
preferences that when choosing good service individuals preference may shift 
toward more expensive premium products they are renters they might treat 
themselves because the short term usage the goods service makes affordable 
there little incentive rent clothing its already available cheap prices but there 
more value renting luxury product they are owners because the expected 
utility from the assets now include the expected return from renting sharing 
another related implication that with increased supply and more options consumers 
may diversify their consumption and try new products services for renters this implies 
that rather than owning one good say drill they may try one with different features 
every time that they rent one even market share the most popular products with 
favorable reviews tend expand rapidly indeed there also evidence that internet 
platform and internet exchanges have helped boost demand for niche products the socalled long tail hypothesis 
the asset light generation 
this leads important question does overall consumption increase decrease 
with the sharing economy 
many media commentators have been quick conclude that demand can met with 
smaller total amount goods and services new supply becomes available with the 
entry the market previously underutilised capacity affordability and generational 
preference will increasingly induce individuals spend money contract subscription 
access goods and services rather than outright ownership even before his most 
popular book the zero marginal cost society jeremy rifkin had posited back 
that preferences would shifting from asset ownership access 
furthermore former internet analyst and now venture capitalist mary meeker has 
more recently coined the expression the asset light pay you live generation 
however the answer varies depending the product and the interplay between 
different demand elasticities the price elasticity demand for the good service 
shared how demand responds change the price the good service shared 
the cross elasticity demand how demand responds the changes the 
relative prices good services possibly generating substitution effects 
complementarity for related products and the income elasticity how demand 
responds change real income 
for selected goods and services the argument that consumption will shrink more 
compelling the drop the cost access music via cheap downloads and 
streaming has reduced dramatically demand for compact discs there evidence that 
the sharing economy could reduce demand for defense and medtech equipment they 
seek budget savings going forward two sectors where sharing would have been 
unthinkable few years ago for example germany and the netherlands are now 
sharing tanks ships and other military equipment and last year nato memo 
stated nato allies are seeking mutual cost sharing both within and outside nato even 
there has been past practice accommodate transactions that would allow 
pooling use more than one nato partner assets scientists have also 
begun share resource labs that specialise one more specific type science 
experiments providing more researchers access technology lower costs with the 
added benefit connecting people the scientific world thus opening the doors for 
collaboration and new ideas 
for others more ambiguous reduced costs and improved convenience might 
stimulate consumption for example more people may holiday because 
cheaper holiday accommodation more people may use private car sharing instead 
public transport also highlighted above there might increased demand from 
those consumers who decide buy rent out 
with mixed implications also for its environmental impact the most frequently 
common example show that the sharing economy can reduce carbon emissions and 
hence positive for climate change that car pooling which theory could reduce 
the number cars the road pollution and congestion the cities however the 
answer not simple even when car sharing does not yield profit for the driver 
the case blablacar for instance where participants only share the costs the 
journey there may now incentive for owners cars drive rather than using 
public transport for example driving could cheaper faster and more convenient 
especially for first mile last mile solution this could add the carbon footprint 
increased driving not via eco friendly vehicles and congestion creating negative 
externalities the same applies for the transport means used deliver the goods that 
are shared from the supplier the user 
depending how the extra purchasing power created the sharing economy 
spent importantly assess the impact that the sharing economy will have the 
environment one has consider the allocation the extra purchasing power that 
generates the extra income for the suppliers goods and services and the savings 
for those who use them that results spending goods and services with high 
carbon footprint the environmental impact will negative 
challenging statisticians 
many the sharing economy transactions are either excluded definition hard 
capture traditional measures output digitalisation and the rise the sharing 
economy are gradually changing the way live and work often easing menial tasks 
however the way official statistics output are collected has not kept with the 
pace the change this applies whether gdp measured the expenditure approach 
adding the value spent goods and services the production approach 
adding the value added goods and services the income approach estimating 
the incomes earned individuals including via wages and corporations via profits 
for example 
for starters gdp does not record transactions within the same sector 
neither transactions national accounts not record transactions between 
private individuals ouseholds national account basis this resulting 
underestimation gdp not new problem think second hand car boot 
sales for example which have occurred for long time they also not attract 
value added tax vat whose turnover can used benchmark gdp however 
with internet transactions between individuals using electronic networks have 
surged therefore potentially increasing the scale the gdp underestimation 
similarly the consumer price index only includes purchases therefore even 
inflation measures not fully reflect the increasing exchanges that happen 
between individuals 
nor transactions business business transactions count intermediate 
inputs the national accounts therefore they are deducted from output and are 
not part value added which computed output net intermediate 
consumption consequently they are not reflected aggregate gdp for example 
the music industry result profound changes which music now 
consumed primarily via streaming companies now generate revenues via 
advertising and licensing which are recorded transactions and hence are 
not included value added 
furthermore the provision goods and services changing there are several sectors 
the economy where business increasingly online book retailing travel agency 
banking this has resulted declining investment construction specifically 
commercial real estate component business investment and therefore gdp 
digitalisation will have contributed directly some reduction gdp while consumers 
have enjoyed least the same service not cheaper and more convenient 
efficiency gains are difficult quantify advances computing power have brought 
rapid quality changes and product innovation which traditional statistics have struggled 
capture since the mid now the sharing economy amplifying the efficient 
gains which are hard measure even when users pay fee the intermediary 
platform the supplier which recorded gdp they may getting extra nonmonetary benefit other words they are paying price for good service which 
lower than the benefit that the get from purchasing that good service gap which 
economists call consumer surplus 
rising consumer surplus the problem how account for the value nonmonetary benefits not new but gdp may missing important phenomenon now 
that the consumer surplus rising thanks digitalisation benefits such time 
saved increased consumer choice for example are not captured coincidence 
that measures life satisfaction such the oecd better life index the eurostat 
quality life indicators the commissioned world happiness report have 
proliferated recent years 
price effects the extent that traditional measures productivity cannot adequately 
capture the economic impact the sharing economy there are also important 
implications for measured price inflation productivity used calculate unit labour 
costs labour cost per employee divided productivity labour costs per unit 
output which one the key determinants inflation all other things equal higher 
productivity implies lower unit labour costs and therefore lower domestic prices 
pressures and inflation result inflation measures used the national accounts 
not capture fully sharing economy transactions the resulting upward bias inflation 
means that real inflation adjusted gdp will understated 
self government regulation 
the lowering transaction costs brought technology reducing rapidly even 
eliminating obstacles producers face enter market barriers entry with 
technology compressing marginal costs productions possibly zero close new 
suppliers are providing goods and services which were traditionally the domain large 
organisation systems originated with information goods entertainment 
communications publishing industries more resources are being made available 
nearly for free networked world the drop marginal costs now beginning 
felt also other sectors renewable energy printing manufacturing online higher 
education may this year notably the world first printed office opened dubai 
extending the printing application the construction sector for the first time 
the sharing economy redesigning the competitive landscape encouraging microentrepreneurialism and challenging the incumbents positioning some will exit the 
market others will adapt going forward there will still goods and services whose 
marginal costs are high enough warrant their exchange markets and sufficient 
profit ensure returns investment moreover fixed costs will not vanish however 
are probably moving towards new economic paradigm which hybrid 
traditional market and collaborative economies the sharing economy displacing some 
existing firms but there room for complementarity and extent the sharing 
economy supplementary existing activity opens new markets see box 
result should seen source diversification 
changing competitive landscape 
new markets some new markets may emerge enabling exchange goods and services that otherwise would not have 
been possible because the very high costs searching contacting and contracting that this would require this results 
both increased supply and broader options for consumers well increased demand because the platforms may 
attract users that would have not purchased the goods and services before 
substitution entering markets for which services already exist new intermediaries substitute for existing business 
operations transportation and accommodation turn this increases competition between new and old business 
models challenging the incumbents rifkin goes far saying that some industries margins are low that just losing 
turnover share the new operators may cause the market tip favour the new operators 
complementarity practice the supply side some the existing operators may offer their goods and services through 
the new platforms the example the tourism and taxi driving sectors illustrates this instance the new and old 
operators would complement each other for example bmw has created car sharing platform reachnow apple music 
was established competitor spotify 
the extent that sharing economy business models rely avoiding costly 
regulations the models are not sustainable though peer peer exchanges are 
susceptible variety market failures for example due asymmetric information 
think for instance the level creditworthiness which known more the borrower 
than the lender passenger entering uber car who may not know the 
qualification the intentions the driver there may also negative externalities 
which are not taken naturally into account for example the noisy airbnb guest 
disturbing the neighbours finally there the issue the ownership data generated 
users through use sharing platforms which raises privacy concerns 
there are two sides the debate true online platforms can circumvent laws and 
regulations the same time however these laws and regulations were designed with 
traditional business mind and the counter argument can made that existing 
regulations aimed solving market problems the need protect third parties are 
being addressed the sharing economy platforms innovative fashion via 
improving information provisions and reputation systems 
thus key question becomes should the government intervene should the sharing 
economy rely self regulation self regulation involves the reallocation regulatory 
responsibilities parties other than the government exhibit least theory 
third party platforms that act intermediary can police their members via digital 
reputation and monitoring systems verifying the identity and reputation buyer 
and sellers they can mitigating moral hazard and adverse selection they can also

the key build trust and acceptance more people trust the system and accept 
the idea taking some risks exchange for more accessibility and affordability 
goods and services and more convenience self regulatory solutions may allow the 
sharing economy compete more even plain field with traditional companies

there are reasons believe that governments will probably refrain from simply 
extending existing regulatory approaches peer peer exchanges though for

the recent commission guidance the collaborative economy encourages light 
touch the sharing economy whilst acknowledging that should not parallel 
economy and that rules are needed the commission placed the regulatory onus 
individual countries but concluded that these new business models can make 
important contribution jobs and growth and therefore should encouraged this 
end among its key takeaways the commission guidance suggests that services 
providers should only obliged obtain business authorisation licences where 
strictly necessary exempting platforms only acting intermediaries countries 
should differentiate between individuals providing services occasional basis 
professional capacity and should help people benefit from the new employment 
opportunities whilst ensuring fair working conditions and social protection 
importantly leading sharing platforms are beginning demonstrate greater 
willingness collaborate with governments because increasing reputational risks 
and negative publicity well mounting litigations the and europe they 
appear more willing help shape emerging regulatory frameworks and take 
active part they might doing this try increase their legitimacy but this 
encouraging sign towards more smooth navigation regulatory challenges 
going forward will watching the developments italian parliamentary bill 
which represents the first attempt provide framework for the sharing economy 
the national rather than the local level 
could the sharing economy risk creating new monopolies 
the regulatory issue encompasses also aspects regulations between sharing 
platforms not just between sharing platforms their providers and traditional 
businesses 
key concern has emerged because many types activities tend become 
concentrated single platform result network effects despite the existence 
many competing platforms initially networks effects originate when the desirability 
participating platform depends not just its characteristics but also how 
many people use for example driver uber benefits when many people need 
car ride are registered with uber and use its software application app because his 
service more likely used similarly passengers sign with uber because they expect 
find car more easily when they need with less waiting time and more geographic 
coverage furthermore network externalities can also indirect for example users are 
more likely use uber opposed other platforms because they know that more 
related services are currently available will available the future through the 
uber app for instance valentine day uber let users press button deliver roses 
their partners recently has launched uberwaw service allowing people hail 
wheelchair accessible cars london 
because users start using network large numbers and they become locked into 
single platform may difficult for new platforms gain market share for 
instance google currently captures around two thirds the internet searches and 
the dominant player that has emerged from competing search engines similarly ebay 
big player the consumer auction market uber dominant transport and airbnb 
tourism the problem the emergence these monopolies not strictly related 
the sharing economy but network problem 
the emergence new monopolies this phenomenon not new and has been object 
extensive academic research since the practice network effects create 
barriers entry that can skew competition traditionally monopolies specific 
industries especially public utilities have emerged when increasing returns scale 
create situation which luck initial success eventually lead one firm control 
entire market thus creating monopoly thanks the lower average cost 
production that result from the larger scale production some the increase 
market power now the result changes technology and etwork economies which 
erect barriers market entry effect highlighted prof stiglitz and furman 
already back their joint declaration before the department justice 
during the famous antitrust law case the united states versus microsoft 
corporation 
there may currently advantage being the first market entrant with economies 
scale high customer switching costs they exist inertia network effects and 
reputation effects the first players may end dominating the market for example 
once many users download the uber app they must convinced that alternative 
app significantly superior switch alternative software and learn how use 
the first market entrants once they have reached critical mass may also engage 
price wars deter new comers the market adding further entry barriers 
however this poses risks first once monopoly established may hard 
eliminate even once anticompetitive practices that have led the initial market 
dominance are subsequently prohibited thus restricting consumer choices 
furthermore may reduce the incentives innovation because they get too big over 
time platforms may tend get locked into obsolete standards and technologies 
therefore capping consumer welfare 
ironically these dominant sharing platforms have emerged sectors where 
contestability high compared utility networks where monopolies oligopolies 
are more common the need for the initial capital investment low entry barriers are 
also low and the markets are open wide range potential entrants furthermore 
all players access the same level technology the first ones establish platforms 
may face initial costs such developing the app establishing trust consumer 
understanding the product but for late market entrants considerable amount 
the work would already have been done 
the monopoly risk may countered increasing penetration blockchain though 
practice fee based sharing platforms act intermediaries between customers the 
demand and the supply side exhibit instead blockchain technology make trusted 
third parties that currently facilitate transactions redundant whilst currently being 
confined only the financial sector the potential for the blockchain technology 
extend other industries huge and perhaps underappreciated investors 
exhibit timeline the sharing economy evolution

need for third party

the advantage blockchain twofold the context the sharing economy 
eliminate the need for third party intermediation which what large online 
platforms like uber and ebay effectively transactions are purely between two 
counterparties 
address the problem trust enhancing the transparency the transactions all 
the way back when the product was originated and improving security the records 
which are difficult for cyberattackers breach blockchain promises effective 
way mitigate health and safety risks 
blockchain has numerous other advantages see blockchain the solution for supply 
chain transparency may still its infancy and not energy efficient 
present however time has the potential boost the sharing economy capacity 
whilst posing threat the line platforms that originated
