hardlines retail mixed implications for auto parts retailers scale key 
see the transition megafleets negative for diy auto but long term positive for difm and hence 
see mixed implications overall ultimately about scale and think the big auto parts retailers will 
continue play critical role within the parts supply chain 
the diy side the transition megafleets could have two negative effects first and perhaps most obviously 
that car ownership decreases the need service retail customers will correspondingly decline second 
software components increase and vehicle technology becomes more complicated diy customers may less 
and less able repair their own vehicles without professional assistance such see smaller base diy 
customers and lower proportion car owners repairing their own vehicles 
but think the outcome positive for the difm side the business expect that the consolidation the 
industry into megafleets will require auto repair shops grow the megafleets take advantage their scale 
and use only few repair shops perform their repairs this will turn drive consolidation within the auto 
parts distribution industry repair shops start partner with parts suppliers and distributors believe the 
main auto parts retailers aap azo orly and napa are well positioned take advantage the trend 
toward consolidation 
for the auto parts retailers our coverage orly aap orly existing market fragmentation offers the 
potential for long runway consolidation shown the chart below auto repair market share fairly well 
spread out across the four main players orly aap azo and napa together the four control just less than 
the auto parts market the next largest group the auto dealer segment which about the 
market while the main four auto parts companies have nearly doubled their collective market share since 
the dealers market share has stayed fairly constant since this implies that the recent share gain for the 
parts companies coming from the consolidation fragmented demand particularly the difm side since 
the investments required develop distribution network capable servicing megafleets are simply too great 
for independent retailer expect this consolidation trend continue with more the fragmented 
share shifting the main four players

auto parts retailers benefit from two competitive strengths that will help them the industry shifts 
megafleet model first auto parts are generally needed immediately since they are failure related items second 
supply chains were built with many close proximity major retail centers which allows for daily 
deliveries and vast assortment available inventory since fleet managers will aim maximize the utilization 
their fleet will critical priority for them complete repairs quickly hence essential component 
servicing megafleet will the ability have large assortment parts inventory available demand 
believe the main auto parts retailers real estate footprint and developed supply chain will enable them meet 
these inventory requirements these two competitive strengths have protected the auto parts industry from the 
commerce threat and continue see them assets that they can use the industry transitions 
megafleets 
importantly for the repair industry increased utilization cars will increase vehicle wear and tear necessitating 
further repairs while the increase utilization will offset large degree smaller car parc see net 
positive effect service and repair needs the result growing pie parts needs and given dealerships 
current market share see fleet managers utilizing ecosystem both dealerships and auto repair shops 
that source from third party distributors 
even today there are centralized models repair and parts retailers are important part the supply chain 
carmax performs vehicle maintenance cars sold its lots rather than buy the majority its parts 
directly from manufacturers kmx uses carquest owned aap its primary national parts distributor 
additionally large chain auto repair facilities such bridgestone have regional national contracts with the 
main auto parts retailers view these prime examples how large companies choose buy from parts 
retailers distributors instead buying direct from manufacturers see fleet managers continuing value 
product availability and selection and perhaps even valuing those attributes more they attempt maximize 
fleet utilization hence the industry continues consolidate and the four main players invest their supply 
chains the auto parts retailers our coverage should benefit

assumptions should subject immense scrutiny this exercise offers glimpse what the future could look 
like for one the public dealers our coverage universe 
deflationary impact ride sharing means more miles traveled foremost believe the proliferation 
ride sharing and the business model should have deflationary impact the cost every mile traveled 
today the cost per mile traveled the cents consumers are faced with significant costs 
associated with owning car depreciation insurance etc the not distant future more 
decline cost per mile traveled not out the question more americans give owning cars and the 
mobility industry sees influx new entrants seeking bite out growing pie sharp decline the cost 
travel should accelerate the number miles traveled each year for the purposes our analysis assume 
miles traveled will grow cagr over the next years only over the previous years 
service model with new used sales disappears dealers will have shift from selling new 
and used vehicles model devoted servicing and maintaining large fleets vehicles while the tam 
falls dramatically from today the future due loss selling complete vehicles fewer 
players should enjoy much larger piece richer margin business moreover per the exhibit below 
assume that the per mile cost servicing vehicle will remain unchanged cents mile while the advent 
active safety autonomous technologies and higher quality vehicles should reduce repair costs the high end 
less accidents the frequency which the car will need maintained along with the offering adjacent 
services can keep the service cost mile roughly flat

what megafleet 
megafleet ecosystem consisting large number potentially millions intelligent and 
connected vehicles shared consumers demand model owned and operated business 
the megafleet the result two the biggest darwinian forces facing the auto industry shared 
economy and autonomous vehicles what call shared autonomy while one the evolution the 
vehicle utilization business model the other enhances and accelerates its adoption 
megafleet drivers 
see the current world autos moving from units sold miles driven economics ride sharing 
potentially improve vehicle utilization more than fold from current levels hour day struggle 
find other asset classes that can cost play such important role our lives and yet have such low 
utilization cost per mile driven inversely proportional vehicle utilization attacking the greatest

rce rgan stan ley research 
all the vehicles the road today are human driven and majority them are owned consumers the 
technology available today has the potential turn every car the road into rental vehicle that can drive via

these vehicles are used

shared economy enabling megafleets the rapid growth ride sharing and peer peer rental business 
models will continue drive the miles driven per shared car higher and the cost per mile lower this would 
mean that won need many vehicles today other words vehicle ownership will see secular 
decline starts with giving the fourth vehicle the family but the economics renting owning keep 
getting better will soon replace the second vehicle well 
autonomous vehicles tapping megafleet full potential ride sharing can only take your vehicle 
utilization about its full potential our view these vehicles are still human driven logistical 
inefficiencies are given autonomous vehicles remove these bottlenecks and make possible for ride sharing 
solutions replace even your first vehicle autonomous vehicles can pick you anytime you want drop you 
off your desired location park itself and then get back the fleet with human intervention and minimal 
loss time not mention the socio economic benefits autonomous vehicles through lives saved 
productivity increased less congestion and fuel saving are huge and can amount gdp autonomous 
vehicle would also drive itself optimal manner which increase the mileage life the vehicle however 
given utilization increases many fold these vehicles would replaced far sooner than the current year end

few players for each megafleet functionality with massive business scale also means large scale consolidation 
every segment the current auto supply chain suppliers oems dealers and rentals 
algorithms and big data have doubt that megafleet world will have more data scientists than 
factory workers developing millions intelligent cars and connecting them with the consumer the 
infrastructure and with each other provide seamless user experience and fleet logistics would need 
massive effort the space artificial intelligence and self learning are already seeing signs this today tesla recent announcement connecting their vehicles with their infrastructure superchargers bringing 
human level decision making minimum for vehicle recharging today estimate that about the 
value the car comes from the software see that rising about world autonomous cars 
autonomous technology autonomous vehicles critical for true megafleet world autonomous vehicle 
can delivered through different mediums vision radar lidar combination these there special 
place megafleet world for players who have significant expertise with either these technologies have 
the expertise fusion and integrating these technologies with the rest the hardware the car expect the 
first autonomous car hit the road before the end the decade 
vehicle assembly see vehicle assembly the least common denominator between today auto supply 
chain and that megafleets future owned rented autonomous human driven these vehicles will need 
manufactured with precision though there could continued technological advancement vehicle 
manufacturing remove inefficiencies and lessen probability recalls this function will even more 
commoditized 
autos shared mobility july 
user experience with hour your time per day completely available autonomous vehicle there 
significant opportunity for players capture the consumers attention with global car parc vehicles 
that hours per year for grabs the race well and truly with the likes apple and google getting 
your car starting with infotainment what the value hours worth mobile consumers time and 
attention suspect more than zero which what being exploited today car 
infrastructure and vehicle maintenance megafleet vehicle will shuttling passengers non stop all day 
will need robust infrastructure and support system extremely high utilization increases the need have 
instant refueling continued vehicle diagnosis demand vehicle repair services and airplane hangar style 
hubs for daily inspection this would require geographic footprint and vehicle maintenance expertise this 
the most likely destination for auto dealers today megafleet world 
recycling with used vehicle market for retail ownership and megafleet vehicles reaching their end life 
much sooner than today levels believe would see growing market for vehicle recycling that feeds 
vehicle production 
introducing the megafleet supply chain 
everyone gives ownership vehicles who makes owns operates and manages them group the core 
functionalities discussed the section above into four main buckets that megafleet company can slotted 
into suppliers manufacturers managers and fleet maintenance servicing 
exhibit megafleet supply chain 
rce rgan stan ley research 
suppliers 
this includes all the hardware and software including autonomous technology believe the supplier 
ecosystem will largely remain unchanged from that today except fewer suppliers with enormous scale 
clear bifurcation tech commoditized suppliers 
given how critical autonomous technology expect many megafleet managers actually own proprietary 
autonomous technology have exclusive partnerships see some signs these today with tesla 
developing most its autonomous technology house except vision system and uber partnering with 
carnegie mellon robotic institute explore possibilities vehicle automation 
manufacturers 
this where the autonomous tech combines with every other component that goes into assembling vehicle 
autos shared mobility july 
just because one produces the vehicle doesn necessarily mean they have own believe the fleet 
managers would have three choices here manufacture their own vehicles partner with oems and 
partner directly with auto suppliers believe its highly likely that regardless the approach megafleet 
manager would control the most important elements technology design and engineering aspect the 
vehicle just like apple controls the iphone manufacturing 
mobility management 
driven super complex algorithms predictive analysis and big data this the most complex vertical the 
megafleet supply chain and also where most the value add comes from 
the core fleet management having the technology know where all the vehicles the fleet are 
predicting when and how move them best match user demand its easier said than done when you can 
potentially have millions autonomous vehicles the road the same time catering diverse rental needs 
the consumer short term long term inter city premium etc 
expect megafleet manager have the most critical elements megafleet vertically integrated not just 
capture most the economic value but have greater control over the entire ecosystem and consumer 
experience these critical elements include owning autonomous technology having proprietary algorithms 
seamlessly integrate consumer network with complex fleet logistics and ability control the car user 
experience 
today world see three types potential megafleet managers oems that are leading the autonomous 
race and are willing test ride sharing models ride sharing companies like uber that want get closer 
the asset vehicles and new entrants like apple google and samsung who have the ability and willingness 
provide seamless vehicle ecosystem their existing customer base already see examples each 
these happening today for example oems like bmw and audi who are leaders the industry for autonomous 
tech are also continuously experimenting with ride sharing models like drive now and audi select 
demand unit silos more recently mass market names like ford and peugeot have also announced their entry 
into car sharing business models uber partnership with carnegie mellon robotics institute cmri very 
clear statement its desire ultimately one day make car google has fleet self driving vehicles and 
pods testing millions miles the bay area and apple ambitions the car perhaps the worst kept 
secret 
all this would however need billions dollars investments from each player along with patience see 
through thinking about how they can profit from this investment next year even years will not work not 
all oems and ride sharing companies will have the vision patience and balance sheet strength play out 
will survival the fittest but those who survive will have the economies scale 
fleet maintenance 
when vehicle utilization goes more than fold from current levels you need robust infrastructure 
instant refueling continued vehicle diagnosis demand vehicle repair services and airplane hangar style 
hubs for daily inspection ensure these operations run smoothly with minimal bottlenecks this particularly 
important for autonomous fleet while fleet managers can doubt bring these functionalities house 
given the operational intensity and low tech commoditized nature believe there will room for 
business business entities fill the gap here this can take combination tesla ranger style service 
where the service delivered the location the car and airplane hangar style complete body and tech 
inspection every hours parking lot the outskirts the city 
fleet maintenance where believe dealers would fit better than anywhere else and able truly 
leverage their real estate footprint and vehicle repair servicing expertise

near term disruption adds the long term secular headwinds posed megafleets one can 
reasonably argue that future where retail vehicle ownership collapses long way off but the challenges 
along the journey can and will raise questions around the viability the current dealership business model 
you don prepare for even those consumers who would want own car will need different experience 
and value proposition buy one and that future may closer than you think 
for the last years dealerships have been run pretty much the same way you trade your old car used 
business buy new new business finance through third party lender business and bring your car 
regularly for service maintenance and repair business don expect these basic elements the 
dealership model away anytime soon but technology and pace consumer adoption ride sharing will 
dictate how these services are delivered and where dealers can really add value lets take look some the 
disruptive forces that dealerships need prepare for the journey towards megafleet 
new vehicles retail experience needs change technology has already made new vehicles 
commoditized product for dealers and its reflected their declining margins even before walking the 
consumer now knows the kind inventory available and the price others their zip codes paid for the same 
vehicle just the way retail commerce largely works today except the experience buying car nowhere 
close that buying other retail products long opaque tons documentation with sales people upselling 
products you don really need the days gimmicky commercials featuring sales managers gorilla suits 
screaming finance everybody are fading fast the technology enable this will only get better 
cheaper and easier access the regulatory hurdles that prevent documentation will slowly fall and one

slowing declining saar opportunity the dealer commentary the pace acquisitions has been the 
same for few years now there are plenty willing sellers and willing buyers the problem usually has been 
the price with public dealers themselves trading record multiples inciding with record saar levels 
makes closing deals bit difficult that extent believe slowdown saar even declining saar not 
necessarily bad news for dealers opportunity for dealers with healthy balance sheet get bigger 
bang for their buck dealers rushing buyback their own stock should perhaps pause and start thinking about 
their strategy relatively weak saar environment 
exhibit saar expectations saar slowdown decline not too far 
rce ihs rgan stan ley research 
don underestimate digitization technology impacts every aspect dealer operations lead 
generation centralized inventory management and pricing crm advertising and even the store experience 
easy for any dealer profitable record saar environment but could harder than ever 
compete when saar declines technology can help not only gain market share through better retail 
experience but also reduce cost through reduced headcount more and more processes are centralized and 
autos shared mobility july 
data driven believe there will significant number dealers available good price their business 
suffers from lack tech investments peers alternatively dealerships that are tech leaders the space with 
disciplined capital deployment would able aggressively acquire and use their evolved processes and 
systems get better return investment 
what public dealers can consolidation can help more than offset the near medium term headwinds 
across all dealer business segments dealerships with enough financial flexibility ward off competition from 
the new entrants and better cost structure will able enjoy higher profitability during this period the 
challenge would keep the cost structure lean decentralized processes and systems may not able get 
you the operational leverage you double your footprint 
dealers have been doing good job with acquisitions far and that expected continue the consolidation 
thesis actually makes dealerships attractive growth business especially the public ones but investing 
technology and business model experimentation should there their priority list 
dealerships are running out time invest technology taking sah and example takes 
several years and hundreds millions dollars roll out such initiatives developing proprietary systems 
and processes centralized pricing inventory crm tools and providing retail experience with faster transaction 
times they can perhaps manage with their current size and share market but such capabilities would 
absolutely essential sustainably gain market share and improve profitability cannot better time 
invest when saar and profitability record levels not now there little chance you will have the capital 
the next downturn one could seriously risk lagging not only other public dealers but also new entrants 
the space 
business model experimentation dealerships especially the public ones are great position pilot new 
businesses that can leverage their unique characteristics physical presence major auto markets new and 
used inventory management familiarity big parking lots repair and maintenance expertise well vehicle 
financing again the goal shouldn necessarily how they can profit from next year itself but more along the 
lines how can help them get seat the megafleet table these new business models can help them keep 
pace with how the world autos evolving and how they can fit 
there are clear partnership opportunities with ride sharing and peer peer rental companies one may argue 
that dealers are pretty late the game here but doesn take much start rental business and dealers are 
well equipped they got all the basic essential loaner cars drivers who can deliver them expertise with 
ancillary services like vehicle inspection car wash and repair facilities house and plenty parking spots 
again the idea for them understand the world shared autonomy and their potential role and not 
necessarily ride sharing peer peer rental company 
are already seeing signposts for such partnership opportunities for example uber recently partnered with 
chicago based car dealership called green wheels usa which specializes sales electric and hybrid vehicles 
under new pilot program uber will help drivers buy lease electric vehicles produced chinese 
automaker byd directly from green wheels drivers will have the option pay green wheels week 
use byd once the lease term expires the car then returned green wheels where can charged 
and maintained this case green wheels not just traditional dealer also serving fleet manager 
can see dealerships few other things well like experiment with their own peer peer used car 
platform and demand vehicle servicing 
stage shakeout 
autos shared mobility july 
exhibit key trends shakeout 
rce rgan stan ley research 
the second stage our view the most painful time for dealers their journey towards megafleets 
dealerships will likely through shakeout but those who make the other end will richly rewarded 
this stage expect dealerships build and gain scale the new businesses and partnerships they 
experimented with earlier the same time they will have cope with significant decline retail volumes 
through further consolidation profits and valuation core traditional dealership businesses can see steep 
decline 
retail sales are halved the penetration and consumer acceptance ride sharing and peer peer solutions 
hits vehicle ownership retail sales are halved the only way for dealership offset the bottom line impact 
would through combination almost doubling market share and taking cost out for that you would need 
further consolidation the space which should work favor those dealers that have the ability scale 
without adding lot headcount and have pristine balance sheets 
acquisitions slow down tech more important than ever expect the pace acquisitions slow down 
environment declining retails sales with market share gains driven mostly elimination the weaker 
players especially there deregulation franchise laws order scale without adding headcount 
dealerships would need leverage the tech they developed the previous years for those who haven its 
already too late change their customer experience and centralize their processes and systems expect such 
dealerships away acquired really low valuations 
what public dealers can 
scale alternate business models while the core traditional business sees secular decline dealerships have 
identify which their alternate business models they experimented with stage can they really scale 
sustainably this could mean lot further upfront investments and further pressure profitability 
transfer resources from traditional dealerships new business models the retail sales business 
gradually winds down dealerships can start training their existing workforce gradually move the alternate 
businesses 
rightsizing footprint they transition from traditional dealership alternate business models dealerships 
would need decide which location they need and adjust their portfolio accordingly 
stage autopia 
autos shared mobility july

the transition from player retail world that player servicing megafleets complete 
traditional vehicle services well new adjacent servicing streams primarily make dealer revenues retail 
vehicle ownership has collapsed dealer groups have collapsed from monoliths with 
massive economies scale and much more profitable and less cyclical revenue base 
when vehicle utilization goes more than fold from current levels you need robust infrastructure 
instant refueling continued vehicle diagnosis demand vehicle repair services and airplane hangar style 
hubs for daily inspection ensure these operations run smoothly with minimal bottlenecks this particularly 
important for autonomous fleet while fleet managers can doubt bring these functionalities house but 
given the operational intensity and low tech commoditized nature believe there will room for 
business business entities fill the gap here this can take combination tesla ranger style service 
where the service delivered the location the car and airplane hangar style complete body and tech 
inspection every hours parking lot the outskirts the city 
infrastructure and vehicle maintenance megafleet vehicle will shuttling passengers non stop all day 
will need robust infrastructure and support system extremely high utilization increases the need have

what should dealers trade 
within the current automotive supply chain believe public dealers deserve trade premium both 
oems and suppliers well their own historical average given the unique opportunity accelerated 
consolidation and transitioning high margin less cyclical service model

premium oems and suppliers there are several reason for dealers trade premium other auto 
verticals 
dealers are less cyclical one the most important reasons own public dealer stock their 
business the biz makes dealers less cyclical oems and suppliers while oems and suppliers profits are 
almost tied retail sales dealers get their gross profits from biz which tied vehicles 
road rather than retail sales any given year had two domestic oems bust the last cycle and many 
tier suppliers but none the public dealers 
inorganic growth opportunity offset lower margins dealer margins today are less than that oems 
and suppliers but this offset the inorganic growth opportunity dealers have 
structural margin improvement opportunity within the dealer business segments relatively 
higher through cycle margin business dealers move towards business model dominated services 
revenues can see structural improvement margins 
less capital intensive dealers are lot less capital intensive than oems and even suppliers with much 
lower working capital requirements and pretty much 
premium their own historical average consolidation and the biz were always good reasons own 
the dealer stock but the potential for accelerated consolidation and the unique opportunity reposition 
themselves pure service players warrants premium historical averages 
auto dealerships the most fragmented retail market out there with the biggest player having less than 
market share and the top with less than share auto dealers however trade discount auto retailers

key risks 
identify the following key risks our stock ratings and price targets 
shared autonomy gains traction much faster than our expectations expect the collapse retail unit 
sales total vehicles produced over the next two decades from today see this transition 
favoring larger more resourced dealer groups with diversified brand portfolios superior access capital ability 
invest technology and skill sets acquisitions many the publicly traded dealers under our coverage fit 
this mold however instead more gradual transition shared autonomy sees much faster adoption rate 
these well positioned public dealers may not get enough time make this transition less painful way 
dealer industry still regulated franchise laws existing dealer franchises continue governed 
franchise laws while new entrants the tesla route this can hurt not only the ability franchise dealers 
consolidate but also their organic share growth absence deregulation can make well resourced public 
dealers less competitive 
failure delay making tech investment house tech capabilities will absolutely essential for dealers 
provide tsla apple store like experience their current stores but also integrate themselves the 
megafleet supply chain they also need adapt near term disruption each their four primary business 
segments digitization new peer peer economics used disintermediation well autonomous 
and ota failure delay investing technology can hurt dealers ability overcome near term 
disruption and the transition mega fleet world 
failure delay experimenting with business models dealers need new business models find their 
niche the megafleet world where they can gain economies scale well offset the loss retail 
revenues potential losses failures alternate business models will likely relatively less volatile for big 
dealers such models may include executing the ride sharing model logistical technical support diagnostics 
training recycling etc like technology failure delay experimenting with new business models can hurt 
dealers ability overcome near term disruption and the transition mega fleet world 
threat sourcing and new entrants taking lead just like the current dynamics between oems and 
their suppliers you may have mega fleet managers who may want source many all these functions 
and like some the other industries that have seen disruption new entrants may find way scale faster and 
take lead megadealer without any hurdles transitioning from the current model
