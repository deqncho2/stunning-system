since the publication the morgan stanley blue paper autonomous cars self driving the new auto 
industry paradigm almost three years ago analysts have explored the implications expanding

executive summary 
addressing drunk driving materially enhances growth opportunities for beverage and restaurant firms 
drinking alcohol and driving cars represent hundred billions consumer hours and trillions dollars economic activi 
these activities theory should mutually exclusive due the threat public health and safety traffic fatalities are alcohol 
related but practice are frequently not more than million due arrests per year slides 
drunk driving laws have been shown significantly curb alcohol consumption upon introduction key markets the 
announcements lower drink driving limits markets like scotland and china had immediate and significant impacts alcoh 
consumption pub sales and stock performance key players meanwhile the introduction ride sharing services like uber have been 
shown significantly reduce the incidence dui arrests select communities for example san diego saw reduction dui 
arrests the following year when uber operations began the temporary banning uber austin has been associated 
reduction alcohol sales slides 
shared and autonomous vehicle technology help address the mutual exclusivity drinking and driving way that can 
significantly enhance the growth rate the alcohol market and trade sales restaurants the total addressable market tam 
the global alcohol market today drinks drink our base case believe greater prevalence shared 
mobility ride sharing the next years can add bps the annual growth rate the alcohol market currently this 
assumes that the joint population drivers and those who drink consume extra alcoholic beverage per week average eality this 
highly dependent the timing and telemetry shared models would drivers who reside cities where shared mobility well 
penetrated are likely consume more than additional drink per week our view beyond believe autonomous technology can 
unlock even greater tam opportunity slides 
investment implications our research suggests there could significant growth opportunities for alcoholic beverage firms and 
restaurant stocks particular highlight the following names beneficiaries constellation brands brown forman diageo kweichow 
moutai yanghe brewery bj restaurants buffalo wild wings and brinker international addition the key enablers within the autos 
shared mobility coverage universe include mobileye tesla delphi continental and autoliv slides 
the following presentation offers unique perspective the investment significance drinking and driving this serious 
topic that has great social public health and safety well economic and financial implications across multiple sectors while present 
the key conclusions and high level thoughts here morgan stanley shared mobility global beverages and restaurant teams are 
committed further exploration the theme events unfold strongly believe this topic will receive greater attention from 
management teams and investors over time hope this our work helpful staying ahead the curve
