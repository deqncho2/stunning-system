making better drivers not cars following alphabet formation its 
autonomous and ride sharing efforts into separate company called waymo the 
unit ceo john krafcik stated are not the business making better cars 
are the business making better drivers our thoughts how think 
waymo will set out disrupt the industry which believe carries important 
investment significance 
think waymo seeks deliver transport service that emphasizes 
unparalleled levels safety expect waymo use autonomous 
technology and human driver operator screening achieve entirely 
new level safety for ridesharing consumers imagine ride sharing app 
where the vehicle fleet highly fully automated vehicles 
combined with specially trained human operator see scope offer 
service where the drivers are fully licensed highly rated and subject 
more exhaustive background check some markets could see vehicle 
operators potentially functioning legal employees either waymo the 
oem another operating entity think there are some important 
lessons brand segmentation from juno business model that can 
applied more extensively differentiate quality service and reputation 
select markets see our may report auto disruptors juno the 
fight for drivers goes into high gear moreover see the potential for 
the safety autonomous vehicle fleet orders magnitude 
greater for consumers per mile basis compared more conventional 
services waymo safe 
select markets with high density expect waymo least 
initially focus its commercial roll out select geographic environments 
such highly defined geo fenced zones municipalities select 
intercity routes hub and spoke fashion where the fleet can quickly 
reach the vehicle density required provide service with high reliability 
minimal wait times and optimal fleet management economics like other 
forms public transport introduced the public over the past century 
see ride sharing achieving optimal network value where high 
utilization can assured cooperation with local governments waymo

extremely low cost while such model may not profitable 
first the aim would likely operate low net cost possible 
while maintaining large enough network accumulate the necessary 
attributes miles and data required continually improve the service 
while ultimately improving the value proposition both sides 
emphasize that initial applications the fleet would highly 
automated fully automated with the addition human operator for 
safety redundancy and legal considerations over time however the 
capabilities the machine and the network improve the skills required 
the human operator will immaterial factor safety leading the 
eventual removal the operator removing the cost the operator can 
result step change reduction cost per mile much for 
economic payback period little few weeks couple months 
depending the salary benefits avoided and the cost the technology 
the typical ride sharing cost per vehicle mile around see this 
cost falling low mile highly utilized and fully 
automated basis for waymo specifically there may unique ways can 
offer even more affordable service due adjacent data monetization 
opportunities provided the network for example imagine scenario 
where waymo alphabet attributed value the vehicle data just 
day year vehicle life could produce potential value 
year years discount rate assuming the average 
waymo vehicle used hours per day with average occupancy rate 
persons per hour this could generate passenger hours per day day 
data value would imply only cents per passenger hour the value 
this data can used offset the cost the technology hardware the 
provision the service waymo affordable 
exhibit current average cost per vehicle mile ridesharing service today 
mse increased utilization and automation has potential drive significant

through commercial strategy that emphasizes 
partnership with oems local governments and fleets there are many 
possible commercial incarnations waymo robo taxi service waymo has 
already demonstrated its ability work with existing auto manufacturers 
producing autonomous chrysler pacifica minivans with fca 
deployed shared mobility fleet from early late last month 
honda research organization subsidiary under honda motor 
announced entering into formal discussions with waymo integrate 
waymo self driving technology into honda covered morgan stanley 
japanese auto analyst ryosuke hoshino vehicles including sensors 
software and computing platform honda could initially provide waymo 
with vehicles modified accommodate waymo self driving technology 
making the oem after fca collaborate with alphabet such 
efforts see fca and honda exceptions amongst oems who 
would typically far more sensitive over proprietary data ownership and 
privacy our view most oems simply don want hand over their data 
party tech giant that may one day become powerful competitor 
quote mark fields the ceo ford motor company don want 
become the handset company other oems may choose partner with 
waymo under certain terms but established oems are not the only 
potential commercial partners there are any number privately held 
firms devoting resources developing fully autonomous vehicles zoox 
faraday future drive etc that could emerge potential suppliers 
the waymo ecosystem municipal governments with and without existing 
public bus systems could seen important customers with the fiscal 
and regulatory capacity quickly accelerate the adoption these 
technologies local level for example recently purchased 
public bus may have years useful life and retrofit the 
vehicle with automated system could cost much 
however this retrofit could pay for itself under years through lower 
insurance costs and higher productivity large vehicle fleets and logistics 
firms could utilize the waymo network applications for heavy trucks 
delivery vans shuttles etc 
aggregation miles and data the strategic and economic value the 
data waymo may have figured out that does not need make the cars 
order control the data autonomous cars create much data 
per hour that can accessed either real time daily through wireless 
and physical connection this data can made available harvested and 
analyzed for two primary objectives improve the field 
experience learning the self driving fleet and for adjacent 
monetization analytics content advertising etc stand alone basis 
alphabet autonomous car project seemed far too limited terms 
aggregate data captured with merely miles per day compared tesla 
vehicles that execute around million miles per day uber fleet over 
million miles per day higher utilized model could imagine 
waymo position match tesla number daily fleet miles traveled 
with around one quarter the fleet size with well under units 
oem the size toyota could likely produce units less than 
days production this could scale very quickly 
through front end and back end solutions machine learning 
network when training network the area autonomous driving 
there substitute for real world vehicle miles simulations can only 
far pivoting partnership strategy waymo can achieve far higher 
levels data capture more compressed time frame given the evergrowing amount capital entering this area transportation first todata synonymous with first scale hardware solutions could come 
the form complete vehicle engineering services operating systems 
hardware software sensor integration aftermarket solutions physical 
data network operation 
separate legal corporate entity that can optimize the attraction and 
deployment human and financial capital see these moves signal 
googl efforts scale its autonomous vehicle offering while controlling 
incremental costs and investment which believe will positive for 
googl earnings power that believe googl auto based partnerships 
and asset light model are likely more efficient way scale its miles 
driven and develop iterate improve its auto technology and the market 
strategy addition googl potential spinout waymo from could also 
increase waymo ability compete and attract top talent waymo 
employees compensated waymo equity could have greater potential 
benefit financially from waymo success particular compared being 
compensated with googl equity where autonomous vehicles are immaterial 
part the annual googl revenue business 
taking ridesharing level with high customer visibility see alphabet 
creation waymo clear competitive affront existing ridesharing 
offerings the market high level see waymo primary mission being 
first scale shared autonomous driving key markets our opinion see 
the formation the company more aggressive move pursue 
differentiated and competitive alternative the ride sharing model rather than 
pure vehicle manufacturer are right then could shaping 
quite eventful year terms announcements and partnerships that can 
materially change investor perceptions where value added the auto
