key thoughts following the daimler agreement supply uber with selfdriving vehicles its ride sharing network 
daimler taps into portion uber million miles per day within its 
network while uber taps into leader the development and manufacturing 
the physical device that ultimately replaces its human driver ride sharing 
firms like uber and lyft are network human drivers today what are they 
when the humans away are they network someone else cars that 
are also the drivers what value added ride sharing firm fully 
autonomous model these are the types important questions being asked 
ride sharing firms increasingly open and frank way the true value may lie 
the delicate balance between the physical machine and the virtual network 
note that our rating tesla motors heavily dependent the launch 
its own automated driving network human assisted first fact our 
valuation tesla mobility accounts for the upside our tesla 
target 
see partnership exclusivity elusive such early stage 
exploration the race acquire minds and miles feed based machinelearning network appears there are multiple paths take daimler one 
main german oem owners here formerly nokia mapping unit does 
daimler work with uber complement this effort with its german brethren 
does compete against mbly and here are also partnering autonomous 
technology but not appear involved this uber partnership either 
our discussions with oems suggest tremendous sensitivity around data 
sharing not saying impossible for deals struck that provide some 
degree access crowd sourced vehicle data for maps etc however 
see uneasy arrangement and one that may not experienced broadly 
across oems sustainably today downgrade mbly from 
part driven our concerns over the long term sustainability the 
relationship between oems and suppliers over data access and monetization 
see mobileye even stronger growth potential adas but comes cost 
downgrade

this partnership could about more than just cars last july uber acquired

autonomous car and truck projects leading truck oem daimler believes 
that truck platooning and autonomous trucks are the future and has followed 
through with live trials and concept development given the similarity

business model rethink 
shared autonomy and our global miles model form the backbone our analysis this 
section taken from our april global blue paper global investment implications 
autos review the fundamentals shared autonomous transport and how can 
impact the long term business model 
shared electric autonomy 
are witnessing major trends that taken individually could highly disruptive 
the state the industry yet not only are each these trends happening 
simultaneously but each contributes the development the other recognize 
each these trends will take many years not decades see the complete endresult with any number regulatory and profound behavioral impediments possible

shared autonomy the coming together two the most powerful trends the 
world autos shared mobility and autonomous vehicles help further leverage the 
shared mobility ecosystem and therefore integral part 
shared vehicles the business model leap from cars sold miles traveled the 
inefficiency the current auto model that cars are used for less than hour day for 
utilization rate less than this has not changed materially over years 
mobile technology and relatively simple software increases driving utilization rates 
order magnitude the shared mobility model moves the transportation business 
from privately owned and operated model professional service run large firms 
engaged mega fleet management this would transform the auto business model 
from ownership shared 
autonomous vehicles tapping the full potential shared vehicles vehicle sharing 
can only take your vehicle utilization about its full potential our view 
these vehicles are still human driven logistical inefficiencies are given autonomous 
vehicles remove these bottlenecks with the elimination the human driver far the 
largest cost today ride sharing service the person behind the wheel replace the 
driver with few million lines code and some commoditized sensors and the savings 
can really begin benefits would further enhanced through lives saved increased 
productivity reduced congestion and fuel savings 
electric vehicles the downfall the internal combustion engine the goal with 
electric vehicles have sustainable transportation using clean energy however low 
gas prices and lower utilization levels make the payback significant front cost 
unfavorable major hurdle mass adoption vehicular mobility potentially moves 
from private ownership professional fleet management millions vehicles 
providing demand service firms would able amortize the costs 
technologies and infrastructure that may not economical private ownership 
model where car only driven miles per year shared model can shrink 
payback periods little years encouraging mass production battery packs 
shared autonomous fleets address many other problems with today model such 
slower charging time lower charging station density and range limitations 
why shared autonomy makes economic sense 
shared economy and autonomous driving shared autonomy can drive the per mile 
cost mobility down potentially order magnitude the cost per mile shared 
car today currently lot higher than that owned car without taking into 
consideration the value time almost all the difference shared mile

however believe shared autonomy penetration can create deflationary cost 
environment leveraging the fixed cost and significantly reducing the variable costs 
sharing reduces the inefficiency the current auto model vehicles being used for 
less than hour day for utilization rate less than this has not changed 
materially over years perhaps one the greatest innovations the history 
the auto industry the cell phone enabling drivers and passengers connect ondemand shared model commuting patterns may make utilization not 
possible but can significantly better than the current starting point

the autonomous car addresses the biggest cost shared mile the human driver 
car capable driving itself transcends the utility lump machinery that requires 
human input maneuver spread the higher costs technology and 
maximize the use the asset autonomous car must used more than minutes 
day therefore believe autonomous car worth far more shared than owned 
the capacity utilization the average automobile hasn changed substantially 
over century generations people get used giving control the car 
computer expect they will also become accustomed giving ownership
