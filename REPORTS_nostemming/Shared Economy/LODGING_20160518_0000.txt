hoteliers have aggressively ramped their direct booking push 
reduce online travel agencies growing share and cost analyze 
who will win and see potential for share price impact for 
hotel brands and otas could quickly put one business model 
risk create price war 
hoteliers and online travel agencies seem challenging the 
question who controls the customer after living relative harmony for 
years otas like expedia and priceline have been accelerating their share 
gains hotel distribution despite hotels being record revpar response 
and buoyed consolidation global hotel brands like hilton and marriott are 
demanding lower commissions removing last room availability and recently 
encouraging loyalty rewards members book direct return for cheaper 
rates otas are then pushing the brands down their search order 
potential price swings depending whether the hotel brands the 
otas win will confirm whether superior distribution online access 
customers otas physical awareness experience hotel brands are the 
most important driver hotel demand both hotel brands and otas trade 
ebitda multiples given their asset light high growth models the 
industry shifts see the likelihood both earnings and multiples changing 
driving upside downside for each group 
potential for risk discounts hotel brands sites are shifting the 
messaging cost over experience see this the most severe outcome 
driving downside for otas and downside for lodging stocks most 
owners tell the new brand discounts are only but that 
significant today revpar environment 
very early days this started feb but expect resolution 
the next months key data points are watching are revpar str 
web and mobile traffic comscore and sensor tower and distribution trends 
travelclick the escalation the war visible both hotel owners who are 
incurring the distribution costs and guests who benefit from lower rates 
expect both adjust their behavior quickly far case can made that 
either side winning hotel brand sites are taking web mobile traffic share 
from otas and booking data suggests shift brands favor however 
owners and otas say they have seen minimal shift date and independent 
hotels revpar meaningfully outperformed brands march and april

background 
otas have been around for almost years with expedia launching part microsoft and 
priceline with its name your own price bidding model otas were natural evolution 
traditional offline travel agencies allowing consumers research and book travel online rather than person 
for the largest branded hotels otas were relatively small stable distribution channel for example only marriott mix from fluctuating with the cycle when times were tough marriott relied more 
otas the mix would closer however the past two years ota share has increased with marriott 
for example seeing the channel increase and closer currently despite the fact that hotels 
are record occupancies and room rates suggesting now would the time that branded hotels would the 
least reliant otas 
exhibit otas have accelerated market share gains the hotel distribution channel taking share 
year for the past two years despite the lodging industry seeing all time high revpar 
ota penetration 
revpar prior peak 
rce rgan stan ley research estimates righ 
otas are the most expensive booking channel for hotels hotels naturally try minimize their 
mix otas cost hotels anywhere from night room rate versus brand bookings only cost excluding the broader royalty charge the brand and call center property direct and gds bookings cost 
somewhere between however otas provide one stop shopping channel for consumers far broader 
range properties allow hotels show off their product otas purchasing scale allows them first 
search websites and allow hotels improve awareness especially for last minute and non loyalty 
customers better user experience result otas contribute volume that perhaps wouldn have otherwise 
booked 
sense otas are outsourced sales marketing for hotel brands who typically try avoid 
spending marketing dollars off their own balance sheets and once customers book brands target 
converting these initial customers loyal customers however otas also allow hotel owners decide 
whether brand not brand hotel hotel brands must careful not let the pendulum swing too far 
while the relationship has had few hiccups along the way disagreements over rate parity and roomkey 
otas are typically viewed strong frenemies the lodging industry

the last few months major hotel operators have announced significant campaigns aimed 
encouraging their guests book direct instead through otas namely 
february hilton launched the largest marketing campaign its nearly year history 
called stop clicking around promoting discount well free for 
loyalty members that book direct 
march marriott announced new members get more program for marriott rewards 
members that includes cheaper best rate guarantee mobile check and check out free 
and member exclusive events this was help dispel the myth that other travel 
websites offer better rates for our hotels guests find better rate within hours 
booking directly marriott will match that rate and offer additional discount 
april hyatt also offered discount for members its gold passport loyalty 
program booking room directly its own website 
april intercontinental hotels group announced the global roll out your rate ihg 
rewards club exclusive rate offered ihg rewards club members when they book 
direct ihg rewards club already offers blackout dates reward nights mobile check 
and extended check out times 
and may choice hotels international announced too would follow suit later this 
summer offering its million loyalty members which are currently growing million 
year million prior due another successful campaign cheaper rates they book direct 
lodging and internet may 
these five brand companies control hotel rooms increasing once marriott closes its 
acquisition starwood 
this follows hotel ota renegotiations among some the brands last year new regulations 
europe and record occupancy levels 
the end last year some large hotel chains such hilton and marriott renegotiated contracts with online travel agents pay lower fees and eliminate last room 
availability while also offering cheaper hotel rates their loyalty rewards members 
regulatory developments europe have effectively banned rate parity france germany 
italy and sweden this the practice not allowing hoteliers advertise lower prices for 
rooms across all distribution channels including their own websites than those offered 
otas 
record occupancy levels occupancy rates are above prior peaks the and some 
european markets this should mean that hotels are able lower their dependence otas 
they are full and can pick the most profitable channels however the opposite has been 
true where more expensive ota channels are gaining distribution share however operators 
appear now have the confidence attempt wrest share back 
the value chain not fully aligned comprehend the debate around the outcome this push one must 
also understand the underlying economics the hotel industry 
hotels are typically owned private real estate developers institutional funds and the 
public reits who care most about overall profitability unlike other reit sectors hotel 
owners typically take the operating risk the hotel pricing resets daily other reits where 
long term leases suggest relatively fixed yield examples large public hotel owners are hst 
lho drh 
owners pay hotel management companies operate their properties and the 
management companies are paid primarily revenue performance the hotels are run 
hotel managers which are sometimes brand companies and sometimes party managers the 
managers earn base fee either emerging markets and europe 
revenue incentive fee then added which typically operating profits emerging 
markets excess operating profits beyond owners priority invested 
capital and europe last year both hlt and mar management fees were base fees 
based off revenue and were incentive management fees fact mar incentive management 
fees peaked management fees and troughed largest public 
hotel managers are mar hlt ihg 
hotels are either independently named branded either through their manager 
standalone franchise agreement which also based revenue the typical franchise fee 
hotel room revenue additional fees are paid case the hotel wants part the brands 
central reservation system for example which typically does management and franchise fees with 
the same brand are not mutually exclusive you have hilton hotel managed hilton you pay 
one fee not both however total fees typically aggregate revenue with the add ons but 
many these fees like contributing the marketing fund are then contractually spent the brand 
the largest hotel franchisers are mar hlt ihg chh 
ota fees are issue for hotel brands even though they are not the ones most directly impacted 
brand managers franchisers don pay the ota fees rather they pass them onto the hotel owners the 
negative impacts for hotel brands from increasing ota mix are more qualitative 
loss customer control for example otas grow prevalence brands become less important 
look expedia for luxury hotel paris rather than trying find the hilton branded luxury hotel there 
lodging and internet may 
hotel brands are judged their unit growth and brands become less important their unit growth will 
slow 
younger generations increasingly operate through the internet these headwinds are likely 
increase 
lodging reits and other hotel owners will have the ultimate say given they own the hotels the brands 
operate control the eventual pricing decisions and bear most the operating risk owners feel 
meaningfully worse off from the brands attempts wrest control they will vote with their wallets going 
independent though year contracts make this longer tailed event

and its prominence web searches awareness driven committing capital advertising and the brands

failure hasn changed hotels revpar trajectories otas strategies 
estimate that the global hotel industry generated revenue billion last year believe 
that revenue brands were able siphon off billion for straight branding fees royalties while 
otas were able take billion ota commissions the theoretical math for market share shifts not

channel checks inconclusive far 
have spoken number large hotel owners and there doesn appear discernable shift 
booking volumes yet there the scenario that status quo continues both the hotel brands and the 
otas wield considerable power but different ways hotel brands typically attract business travelers that 
make and global hotel room nights who are looking for consistently high quality experiences 
otas attract primarily leisure customers and more cost conscious business travelers and are skewed 
independent hotels who are less able direct loyalty customers book direct 
exhibit channel checks with hotel owners are inconclusive date 
company commentary 
direct showing some increases volume down expedia but booking but nothing significant 
speak 
pricing isn being impacted its dynamic volumes have increased has rate brands discount pretty 
minimal 
concern that otas hotels don just compete with other brands but with the all hotels each 
marketplace the unbranded hotels compete with then have much greater flexibility offer cheaper prices 
than the otas need offer cheaper rate the brand site 
have seen loss from otas only result our inability run promos the brand sites have not seen 
any noticeable increase yet but the changes that have been implemented are very recent 
this has only recently evolved and expect overall positive result over the next several months with the 
only potential impact being the inability book promos the ota sites for distressed inventory 
the past two months there has been discernable change beyond what market conditions would normally 
dictate specifically there has been neither large overall increase ota volume for independent nor drop off 
for branded this not say our hotels overall have not seen small fluctuation ota volume 
the brands are very focused increasing direct volumes but the impact date has been marginal 
are hopeful that further consolidation should provide greater leverage the brands and owners 
competition between the otas and the brands will remain tense and likely only intensify the end the otas 
will lose share but not necessarily the brands but other disruptors specifically google etc the efforts 
the brands drive customers direct channel may not really result any lower costs they are forced 
offer discounted rates and more amenities will however give them better insight into their customers and 
allow them deliver more personalized offers and experiences 
the brands have reported increases their direct bookings result their member only offers 
don have enough independent hotels understand whether there has been shift for our branded 
hotels have not seen decline ota production 
expect the brands continue gain inroads the battle against the otas but will take time requiring 
training the customer that often the best deal available brand and may require further incentives for 
the guests through continued negotiations the ota commission percentages will further reduced and the 
hotel brands will also have additional flexibility offer promotions select consumer groups other words 
the best deal not available the otas 
too early identify discernable trend ota volumes this point 
too early identify whether the push brands have been making starting reflected the actual 
bookings expect that over longer period time some hotels will see increase direct bookings but 
will difficult gauge how much increase will will also largely depend the individual hotel

commentary from public lodging reits their earnings calls seemed paint similar 
uncertain picture for example while diamondrock drh saw drop ota dependence the quarter 
lasalle lho saw pick ota volumes both companies were able still beat ebitda expectations despite 
drh having slightly softer than expected revpar while lho heavier independent exposure had slightly 
stronger revpar though stopped giving guidance 
lodging and internet may 
exhibit public lodging reits commentary direct ota bookings their earnings calls 
company commentary 
our ota business actually down about bps about again that part our strategy for 
additional higher rated business and focusing throughout the portfolio getting additional special 
corporate demands 
you feel like the brand greater push for direct bookings having any material impact little too early 
say right now but are seeing again you can see some our numbers our push the ota side 
helping little bit but still little too early right now 
drh 
little hard right now for get clear indication how some the booking direct programs were 
impacting know that effort drive more bookings directly the website there are some rate 
reductions would say think that probably contributed less growth our transient rate than what 
might have normally seen the past maybe and from that standpoint slight negative the flipside 
course that when you look what gets through the bottom line the cost booking reservation directly 
with operator significantly cheaper than were happen through one the otas are certainly 
supportive the overall strategy and look forward working with them fine tune that they move 
forward 
hst 
could talk little bit about otas and maybe you could give reminder during the quarter some the mix 
shifts that occurred and whether you seeing any interesting trends that front 
little bit increase ota business for the quarter you might imagine saw uptick our 
occupancy when look the third parties the otas they went about for that decent size 
increase what you also may see our rooms expense had little bit uptick the commission structure 
costs little bit more money there net net was the right move terms taking play more 
occupancy driven game but did see uptick

otas their earnings calls noted they are not seeing volume shifts from the hotels direct 
bookings initiatives but still early notably expe reported not seeing any significant effect 
volumes from the hotels direct bookings push and implied that they are seeing independent hotels gain share

from the hotels push the company noted that chain hotels are now small percentage their overall hotel 
business 
exhibit otas commentary direct ota bookings their earnings calls 
company commentary 
with respect the hotels efforts drive traffic directly their website understandable they have 
strong desire strengthen their brands and understand that the other hand believe our customers 
are entitled competitive pricing and the best availability that out there for intermediaries because 
provide the largest business most the hotels that work with try maintain that balance think 
people should keep mind that the share business that the priceline group does with the chains relatively 
small not like used for priceline when the chains for the business were such major part the 
whole really much smaller part the business and ultimately for any hotel that wants maximize the 
benefit they get from working with our brands the most important things are going their pricing their 
content their availability the competitiveness the offer that can show our customers 
pcln 
expe 
far the hotel chains driving direct bookings listen think makes sense for any player out there whether 
the commerce sector the travel sector make sure that you have balanced source traffic and 
revenue very early this point but are not seeing any significant effect our volumes what are 
seeing that the hoteliers who provide with the best pricing with the best inventory are gaining share 
relative basis the marketplace and they gain share two ways one just directly through bookings and also 
remember that they also gain audience share because they are higher the sort order and very often 
consumers are clicking from our results and going and checking out the hotel direct think the players who 
are giving the best inventory are gaining both booking share and audience share within our marketplace 
did mention that are seeing some these big chains that are introducing these rates lose share 
independent hotels generally the commission rates with our independent hotels can slightly higher than the 
chain hotels

there are some early signs that the hotels direct booking initiatives are gaining traction appears 
that hotel brands have recently begun taking market share from ota sites mobile and desktop illustrated

these data could speak the potential for further ota market share gains but far the mobile 
unique visitors don show that playing out see exhibit exhibit shown the ota traffic reach 
lodging and internet may 
advantage number monthly users relative hotels smaller desktop than mobile for now this 
speaks how consumers are frequently downloading the apps but not engaging with them often 
downloads are not valuable engagement use also note that the brands seem making traction 
mobile and desktop traffic the top hotels sites has started grow faster than otas see 
while still early and their mobile desktop traffic still small relative the otas 
this potential early sign that the hotels direct booking initiatives are making traction mobile and 
desktop 
while acknowledge comparing datasets this case between comscore and sensortower can 
precarious there are user behavior explanations too that think this discrepancy could due 
combination travel infrequency americans only take average leisure vacations per year and 
therefore are unlikely need use the apps every month and entrenched desktop user behavior 
moving over mobile consumers are accustomed searching and price comparing travel across multiple 
travel sites and otas and our view the browser and google are still the best way accomplish this 
the otas view the brands pricing push detrimental hotel owners 
add fuel the ota hotel direct booking debate april the travel industry news site skift 
published the chart below from expedia highlighting hotel owners why the brands discount push 
detrimental their bottom lines see exhibit

carefully selected third party hotels the hotels are being selected the basis hotel criteria with 
minimum level facilities and minimum review score tripadvisor for example the transition 
effectively turns accor into ota allowing independent hotels sell their inventory through accor 
site and access its loyalty scheme customers 
for the independent hotel the platform offers much lower commission rate than other online 
distributors see here with subscription fee commitment hotels are carefully selected based 
location and customer review scores which should bring more consistent quality than aggregators 
with broader range hotels hotels can choose part the club accorhotels loyalty scheme 
consisting over million members 
for accor accor aims increase the number hotels available book through its websites and apps

deeper dive into the scenario analysis 
have analyzed what the potential impact would hotel brands hotel owners and otas 
relatively meaningful shift the otas brands dynamic 
first start with distribution base the cost each channel brand otas call centers gds 
property direct off the midpoint ranges put together following conversations with industry participants 
for mix use travelclick total industry actual numbers for which see representative typical 
branded hotel flex the cost and mix brand and otas our scenario analysis 
then make assumptions for how the industry could shift more branded unbranded 
assume that becomes clearer who holds more power otas brands there will natural shift the 
distribution mix hotels well the take rates for branded hotels over time hotels will also shift their 
preference for being branded not have model that available upon request our hotel and ota

rce rgan stan ley research 
our four resulting scenarios are follows 
status quo 
both otas and brand continue take market share distribution from traditional channels 
like call centers and hotel direct bookings but otas slower pace than before 
change owners distribution costs today 
brands continue grow managed franchised units 
revpar continues grow this year and slightly slower next 
brands win the war 
brand takes share distribution from otas taking back much the outsized gains otas 
were able achieve the past few years brands also negotiate down the cost otas for branded 
hotel owners and scale makes the brand channel cheaper resulting lower all 
distribution costs for owned hotels otas take rate fee drops lower than the brands 
benefit given our assumption that independent hotels will continue pay the otas the same level 
fees 
given better economics for hotel owners this leads more hotels becoming branded leading 
higher unit growth for hotel brand operators and lower growth for otas 
hotel brands and owners rate ebitda given better profitability and growth though where 
are the cycle limits upside otas rate because more structural story decline 
volume growth its most profitable segment will have outsized impact 
this scenario see value per share for expedia and value per share for priceline 
this would imply expedia would trade ebitda historical median and priceline 
lodging and internet may 
would trade ebitda historical median 
otas win the war 
brands effort push customers book more direct fails leaving otas more dominant position 
where they negotiate higher fees resulting higher distribution costs for owned hotels 
otas take rates improve 
hotels rely otas more suggesting less need for hotel brands and hence negatively impacting the 
unit growth for hotel brand companies year and potentially calling into question their entire 
business model while shift unit growth may seem extreme given the long term mgmt and 
franchise contracts hotels enter into typically years starwood good example where after 
losing its way somewhat unit growth dropped from ota hotel room 
nights accelerate and grow 
hotel brands and owners rate given worse profitability and growth otas rate because 
their greater long term structural growth 
this scenario see value per share for expedia and value per share for priceline 
this would imply expedia would trade ebitda historical median and priceline 
would trade ebitda historical median 
price war 
given the shift focus price over experience average daily hotel rates drop across the board 
line with our channel checks suggesting discounting negatively impacting all three groups 
hotel brands hotel owners and otas with hotel guests being the winners 
see outsized negative impact hotel brands owners multiples this scenario given 
investors are already cautious where are the lodging cycle rate growth lower than 
our current forecast this would imply growth decelerating from growth 
suggesting potentially negative room rates next year multiples for otas drop less because they 
are more structural stories

key take aways 
the european hotel market relatively more fragmented than the more reliant 
otas the ota mix room nights for the continental european listed 
branded operators against for the listed branded operators and think 
percentage commission costs are likely higher too 
there clear correlation between operators strength single market and their ota 
share for example premier inn owner whitbread uses otas for its room volumes 
down from last year and the brand far the leading one the scandic uses otas 
for its volumes the smallest share the continental european listed operators and 
also far the largest hotel brand the nordics markets 
ota market china appears more concentrated than market after ctrip 
acquisition qunar think with the dominant market share otas especially ctrip will 
have higher pricing power and will likely charge higher commission hotels some hotel 
operators talked believe that highly likely 
but hotels china are ramping efforts attract customers book more directly 
diversifying into other channels wechat booking which another form proprietary 
channel other channels like meituan and alitrip which charges lower commission rates 
chinese hotel brands penetration into mobile apps clearly benefitting them for 
example china lodging room nights come from its own mobile app this has 
allowed have similar ota mix and pricing the large american brands such hilton 
and marriott despite one third the number rooms

case study india hotel industry 
rising importance otas the hotel distribution landscape india 
otas were virtually non existent the hotel booking space india years ago however the past decade 
otas india have consistently enriched their platforms terms number hotels indian ota makemytrip 
example now has hotels among rated unrated hotels its platform only hotels 
similarly another ota yatra has hotels now just otas were primarily 
focused star hotels until recently however after competition arose from budget hotel aggregators otas 
aggressively started expanding their presence budget hotels per our alphawise survey conducted sep 
among unrated five star hotels across nine indian cities otas accounted for overall 
bookings increasing from year prior among the different hotel categories ota penetration was highest 
among star hotels but for the next months the surveyed hotels expect the share otas 
remain flat also among various cities ota penetration was highest tourist destinations terms 
commissions makemytrip reports take rate for its hotels while the hotels surveyed indicated 
commissions for details please see our alphawise survey report makemytrip limited goibibo and 
mmyt the top otas our hotel survey focused aggression from mmyt may help build dominance

indian hotels company working more pro active ota strategy 
illustrate what luxury hotels could vis vis their relationship with otas look the example indian 
hotels company the largest luxury hotel chain india before the merger starwood and marriott with 
rooms and properties including those outside india with otas gaining share domestic indian 
luxury market revenues and with ihcl paying believe more than revenue share few key otas 
range indian hotels has now shifted focus optimizing its channel mix lower distribution costs 
the efforts have been particularly galvanized after hired chinmai sharma the new chief revenue officer 
sharma has extensive experience revenue management was previously global head revenue 
distribution and ecommerce for louvre hotels group plus hotels sharma has led efforts 
optimize distribution for ihcl ihcl strategy this seems two pronged our view 
steps directly incentivize customers book ihcl portal these include promising customers 
higher speed internet connections during their stay they book through ihcl portal free wifi available for all 
guests but lower speeds and offering customers best price guarantee they book through the ihcl portal 
steps strengthen other distribution channels 
ihcl has invested new gds and platforms that help price its room nights more dynamically 
response daily changes demand supply 
ihcl has invested revamping its own portal making much more robust 
ihcl also working towards launching the its mobile app 
believe ihcl has seen some success its efforts with its own channels growing faster than the 
ota channel the last couple quarters
