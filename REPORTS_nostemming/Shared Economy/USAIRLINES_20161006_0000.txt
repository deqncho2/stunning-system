with the advent shared and autonomous driving see real disruption risk 
for short haul flying competition amongst airlines can deteriorate the 
operating environment exogenous factors represent incremental risk with 
disintermediation from driving being potential long term factor this concept 
real risk airlines competes directly with many existing domestic 
routes particularly those shorter length and provides more cost efficient and 
flexible transportation questioning the sustainability these routes over time 
compelling example dallas austin where flying and driving both take 
hours but the total cost the former and likely rising and 
with passengers for the latter and likely falling 
nearly all airlines have short haul presence but legacies are most vulnerable 
disruption short haul routes less than miles length comprise 
domestic departures and are very familiar like boston and las vegas 
within this note assess the drive fly decision across the top routes 
based market quotes because these routes are geographically dispersed 
most carriers have exposures ranging from domestic capacity order 
gauge the potential downside substitution hypothesized extreme 
scenario which all short haul demand dissipates and associated capacity not 
reallocated though acknowledge this would year dynamic that 
airlines should able pivot through under these parameters see 
earnings downside most airlines with american delta and united 
being standouts given their exposures and weaker margin profiles 
intercity ridesharing strategies are putting the wheels motion making this 
dynamic worth monitoring while full autonomous penetration decades off 
substitution roads are being made the form intercity ridesharing tesloop 
and others are enacting this today the results our analysis are compelling 
showing one way cost savings while only sacrificing hour travel 
time the extent these strategies accelerate over the coming years these 
higher yielding short haul routes may come under pressure resulting nearterm pricing pressure medium term valuation overhang and long term 
earnings downside all all acknowledge that full disintermediation 
unlikely and airlines should able mitigate this risk over time but hints have 
begun emerge and investors should take note

identifying the importance short haul flying 
the stage length routes varies widely within the domestic system stage lengths 
can reach miles like honolulu breaking this out prominent flight 
segments the average transcon route miles while some inter island flying 
within hawaii can reach low miles domestic capacity falls within the 
range miles and the scheduled system average miles historically 
this system average has been somewhat lower with gradually rising trend occurring 
over the last decade 
and those shorter haul represent the domestic capacity and even higher 
share departures while stage lengths vary across the system there are broader 
buckets routes with different lengths haul short medium and long primarily 
assess short haul flying routes with length less than miles because they face the 
greatest risk substitution discussed within this report the delineated route

believe ridesharing and semi autonomous technology effectively pull forward this

reasons why this carrying over intercity travel should intercity ridesharing 
proliferate the threat substitution would rise from manageable levels today and 
see case for overall shared miles rise from the current total miles

why does intercity ridesharing make sense 
there are currently limited number alternatives flying for intercity travel the 
united states and driving may often the best alternative course there are 
disadvantages driving rather than flying may take longer the driver may not enjoy 
being behind the wheel for long periods time and you may not need car want 
pay for parking your final destination

make intercity ridesharing more convenient and commercial the 
coming years 
eliminates driver opportunity costs 
improved utilization 
source morgan stanley research 
many cases travelers might need car their end destination intracity ridesharing 
uber lyft etc reduces this need and provides additional optionality consumers 
although this would motivate substitution away from driving personal rented 
vehicle not from airlines important note because could key rendering

costs other than the cost the pilot time fluctuating fuel 
prices need not have impact the cost the ride 
source morgan stanley research note penetration 
fully electric vehicles are definition sustainable and save 
fuel costs but they are not this time totally cost efficient 
current battery and fuel prices and average utilization the 
payback period fully electric vehicle roughly years 
however increasing the utilization the vehicle hours 
day can reduce the payback period less than years 
respectively this best achieved through ridesharing model 
and intercity trips could help increase utilization more quickly and 
efficiently than shorter trips car performing one new york city boston round trip 
per day already under year payback and car performing new york city 
buffalo round trip per day would well under the year payback 
semiautonomous technology improves vehicle safety advanced driver assistance 
systems adas are safety technologies that fall short autonomy but significantly 
improve the safety the driving experience well before fully autonomous vehicles are 
common the roads believe that the standard safety content vehicle will 
expand include technologies such active rollover protection forward collision 
warning and lane departure alert these technologies can have significant impact 
studies have found that the implementation low speed aeb technology led 
reduction real world rear end crashes 
course drivers intercity ridesharing trips should licensed cautious and safe 
drivers who not rely any one technology keep them safe however adas and 
semi autonomous capabilities can make rides safer with the added benefit reducing 
the reputational risk ridesharing companies and perhaps making individuals more 
willing driven long distances strangers 
these technologies also make rides less taxing the drivers intercity trips 
potentially allowing them complete more and longer trips day tesloop see 
case study below management and pilots drivers have previously said that they 
make extensive use autopilot and believe this helps them provide better service

autonomy increases utilization and eliminates driver costs 
important note that full autonomy not required for intercity 
ridesharing succeed the technologies cited above are more 
than adequate incentivize intercity ridesharing however full 
autonomy would have two additional positive impacts the 
feasibility intercity ridesharing 
first could ultimately eliminate the remaining marginal cost 
ridesharing trip assuming vehicles are fully electric and there are 
fuel costs have previously estimated that much half 
the cost uber lyft ride comes from the cost the 
human behind the wheel this kind reduction cost could 
make many more routes preferable economic basis 
source morgan stanley research 
second full autonomy could result improved utilization 
vehicles ridesharing fleet there limit how many hours human can drive 
safely day but the case full autonomy cars would close being able 
maintain hour utilization minus lag time between trips and charging time this 
increased utilization would further improve the economics the evs intercity 
ridesharing fleet 
tesloop putting the wheels motion today 
what does tesloop tesloop offers rides teslas driven tesloop pilot 
between cities affordable rate individuals book their seats online and meet the 
tesloop designated departure stop for longer trips the car may have stop once 
charge the cars include wifi charging devices headphones snacks and refreshments 
etc 
why important believe that tesloop demonstrates the capacity for new 
mobility models disintermediate traditional mobility options replicating the service 
with equal lesser costs and travel times and improving upon the experience 
airline travel and personal vehicle ownership 
saving time and money for example per seat and roughly ride 
tesloop between los angeles and palm springs comparison flying between los 
angeles and palm springs over one way and takes almost including tsa 
and first mile last mile time tesloop clear winner here cost and time basis 
alone course flights between and palm springs are uncommon and not 
significant route for airlines but tesloop intercity model combined with intracity 
ridesharing models could present compelling alternative personal car ownership 
tesloop between los angeles and vegas between and flights between 
las vegas and los angeles are about and average flight time however 
taking into account taxi baggage costs and time spent traveling from the airport 
and tsa check lines estimate the total trip come closer and 
tesloop taking into account first last mile transportation times and costs 
comes and this case may not obvious decision but 
taking into account comfort questions such avoiding tsa lines flight delays and 
baggage claim likely that some passengers would prefer tesloop type approach 
numerous other top short haul routes are faster car than plane including 
washington dallas fort worth austin seattle portland and houston austin tesloop like model many these could also cheaper 
how does the model work tesloop emphasizes not only the importance cost 
comfort and time but also productivity sustainability and safety each these three 
things important any transportation system vehicle and shared mobility models 
such tesloop could potentially have distinct advantage each these areas over 
alternatives including personal vehicle ownership airlines and public transport 
the significance 
shared the higher productivity tesloop from the shared model 
have previously written the average car only used the time and seat mile 
utilization even lower around shared transport brings the cost for each 
passenger down considerably and also makes the ride more sustainable 
ridesharing can also allow higher productivity for individual passengers they 
can work while riding please see the autos shared mobility team october 
note the car time machine what billion hours worth 
electric tesloop sustainable because only uses fully electric vehicles 
provide rides the use fully electric vehicles sustainable but not usually cost 
effective current battery and fuel prices the payback period fully electric 
vehicle years increasing the utilization the vehicle can meaningfully reduce 
the payback period the electric model also helps stabilize the cost rides 
tesloop there marginal cost giving the rides other than the pilot the 
long term shared mobility will make electric vehicles more commercializeable just 
electric vehicles will make shared models more affordable creating virtuous 
circle reduced costs and increased utilization 
autonomous not necessary for cars autonomous for intercity 
ridesharing make sense however cars become increasingly autonomous 
tesloop and similar models become increasingly practical the cost would 
significantly reduced have previously estimated that much half the 
cost uber lyft ride comes from the cost the human behind the wheel 
even partial autonomy such the autopilot adas capabilities current tesla 
models makes the rides safer and less taxing the pilots potentially 
allowing them complete multiple trips day this then further increases the 
utilization which helps pay down the higher cost tesla which brings down 
the cost the average ride shared electric and autonomous capabilities are 
independently important but together form cycle that could help tesloop and 
similar models compete with others

autos have earned valuation overhang through the threat disruption currently 
depressed auto valuation reflective cyclical industry amidst peaking concerns 
well the potential disruptive impact several trends this disruption has been 
identified various forms including but not limited electric vehicles ridesharing 
behavior and autonomous technology altogether valuations for autos and the 
oems specifically have compressed from elevated levels observed just couple 
years ago which partially attribute this disruption threat 
and airlines could endure the same given the risk short haul flying from 
developing ridesharing models and the threat autonomous technology the 
airlines could store for their own fair share disruption this the case and 
earnings are risk the tune valuation overhang could emerge estimate 
fully materialized overhang like this would the realm turns though 
dynamic like this would likely multi year nature 
rising substitution risk may push valuations converge with autonomous driving 
threatening disruption the long term sustainability short haul routes and semiautonomous ridesharing already pushing the envelope today see more validity 
the argument that airlines and autos should trade with similar overhangs should the 
threat not managed appropriately addition substitution risk investors often cite 
several reasons why the two verticals should trade such including 
cyclical gdp linked industries both autos and airlines are cyclical industries that 
are highly levered consumer trends though autos have demonstrated higher 
measure cyclicality 
historically similar margin profiles prior the dramatic fall fuel auto oems 
and airlines generated comparable margins across cycles 
elevated leverage levels capital structures incorporate significant commitments 
with airlines debt ebitdar ahead domestic auto oems the 
level 
though are still the view that airlines are worth premium acknowledge 
the validity several these points and the rising risk substitution disruption but 
still feel that airlines should trade relative premium this view premised upon

niche business model that under the

allegiant has the most unique and profitable 
airline model the industry focuses 
connecting small and mid sized cities 
various destinations with varying frequencies 
thus reducing competitive pressures 
the network strong and improving with 
increased east coast flying the airline has todate been successful with diversifying its 
network away from the west coast and las 
vegas markets with the introduction its 
airbus fleet and east coast flying this 
provides supply diversification additional 
third party ancillary opportunities such car 
rentals and larger opportunity set 
routes 
risk relating its fleet strategy are 
meaningful due dramatically changing 
fleet composition and reliance acquiring

competitive capacity growth could 
represent risk competitive capacity from 
north america hawaii had been elevated 
for the bulk but scheduled 
decelerate going forward however additional 
competitive capacity remains potential 
longer term from other airlines 
soft currencies and low fuel surcharges 
may remain for some time for many 
internationally exposed carriers the 
continued strengthening the dollar and 
lower fuel surcharges have resulted lower 
prasm trends along with weaker demand 
given exposure international 
this has meaningful impact revenues 
upcoming labor negotiations remain cost

profits over unit revenues strategy that 
weighing margins view spirit unlike 
most airlines that are more comfortable

are more focused profits and value 
creation this because its returns are well 
above the cost capital and are set 
remain based our projections however 
significant declines rasm spurred 
elevated capacity low fuel and high returns 
have created operating margin pressure
