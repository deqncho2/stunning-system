the investment significance shared and automated transport the yearold auto industry business model facing unprecedented technological 
disruption starting with the very definition the market itself moving from 
millions units sold annually trillions miles traveled annually the 
global car parc shared autonomous and electric mobility addresses many the 
shortcomings the current industry model including low utilization cars are 
used the day with available seat mile utilization barely 
consumption finite resources cars consume nearly gallons fuel per 
year accounting for oil demand and public safety roughly 
traffic fatalities per day globally what there were drug that could save 
million lives and prevent serious incapacitating injury tens millions 
people annually what would that drug worth shared and automated 
transport also unlocks the more than hours driver and passenger time 
currently spent vehicles equal million years annually itself 
representing economic opportunity for content and data worth potentially 
trillions dollars 
believe announcements are imminent with commercialization likely 
targeting the first applications should take the form small 
fleets traveling slower than fully autonomous fully electric and 
geographically limited little square mile see the roll out 
shared autonomous electric transport not unlike the roll out the early 
electric utility grid the and when names like edison and 
westinghouse were engaged city city transformation public policy and 
the right partnerships will critical the outcome for city economic growth 
population development and public health and safety while many the full 
benefits shared electric and autonomous ecosystem may take decades
