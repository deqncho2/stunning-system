offer five key thoughts below 
not near term needle mover but demonstrates high awareness 
and low complacency that the business model fundamentally 
changing our view unlikely this new revenue stream will contribute 
meaningfully hertz top line any time soon the more important takeaway 
that management actions suggest that increasingly focused 
pivoting towards mega fleet management and diversifying away from 
traditional car rental march upgraded htz large part 
due management open recognition the challenges facing the core 
business and its awareness how mobile technology and software could 
fundamentally transform the rent car business model agreements 
such this are early signs that htz looking reposition the traditional 
model and actually facilitate the growth shared mobility 
provides channel for htz season its fleet improving fleet cost 
competitiveness over time environment which earnings are 
particularly sensitive fluctuations used car prices and fleet depreciation 
partnerships with ride sharing firms may provide key disposition channel for 
aging fleet according the press release part these programs hertz will 
utilize cars that are rotating out the consumer rental fleet rather than 
dispose cars auction potentially inopportune times htz may have 
new outlet for aging fleet provided that well maintained perhaps one day 
depending the size and scope the relationship with uber lyft htz 
sensitivity used car prices will become less concern providers 
capital over time anticipate enterprise and other firms even dealers and 
oems continue expand into ride sharing fleet management with most 
the cost benefits accruing the consumer highly competitive market

while believe these agreements are net positive for the stock 
namely the multiple remiss not highlight that barriers 
entry are quite low there are already numerous options available 
prospective ride sharing drivers who are unable choose not purchase 
vehicle outright exhibit enterprise has similar programs place with uber 
the west coast general motors recently partnered with lyft provide its 
drivers with affordable access rental cars select cities envision other 
oems playing bigger role this space particularly ride sharing becomes 
attractive outlet for the growing supply off lease supply this will result 
even greater emphasis reducing operating expenditures and

pay attention potential regulatory issues the california public 
utilities commission cpuc april postponed making decision how 
regulate leased ride share vehicles cpuc had proposed rule that would 
ban the use rental cars leased for fewer than four months from being used

high level one could look htz lyft and htz uber 
agreements helping accelerate the growth business models 
that their core could significantly disrupt potentially supplant the

endeavors are still worth the risk see car rental firm long term
