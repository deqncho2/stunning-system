key observations from the tlc data 
ride sharing trips are still growing significantly nearly trips per day 
uber far the most dominant the ride sharing apps yoy 
growth lyft and via also strong but far lower base 
daily trips and respectively gett dispatching just shy trips per 
day 
but the growth ride sharing appears driven more growth the number 
drivers rather than increased utilization trips per driver vehicles dispatched 
uber per week increased yoy between april and april and 
trips per vehicle per week only increased lyft reported increase

trips per vehicle per week and increase vehicles per week 
and the iconic nyc yellow taxi far from dead new york taxis still perform 
vast majority trips the city per day this figure has declined nearly 
over the last year but now beginning lap its most depressed prior year 
comparisons worth noting that there were medallions dispatched 
april assuming each medallion represents one vehicle that would mean 
that nyc taxis result their higher utilization complete significantly more 
trips with under half the vehicles uber furthermore mta data shows that 
subway ridership has continued increase yoy since the launch ridesharing 
apps nyc 
utilization defined average number trips performed each driver 
weekly basis appears surprisingly low our calculations the average uber 
driver performs trips per week trips day trips day week the 
average taxi driver performs trips week trips day trips day 
week this suggests that driving for rideshare app has remained part time job 
for most survey showed that uberx drivers work hours 
nyc work more than hours likely that there some overlap 
between uber lyft drivers since many ridesharing drivers are multiple 
platforms not add point the sum drivers vehicles the different 
platforms total number ridesharing drivers vehicles nyc 
via passenger utilization stands out the highest the group our 
calculations via drivers performed average trips per week while 
sharing platforms such uberpool and lyftline are gaining popularity via 
business model lends itself higher percentage its cars being shared achieving the highest utilization available seat mile basis see our july
