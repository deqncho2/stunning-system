ford announcement mass produce fully autonomous shared 
fleet representative the industry awareness business 
model change and attempt stay ahead the many challenges 
human and financial capital adapt the change 
put yourself ford position for moment the world largest and most 
technologically advanced tech firms are directing vast sums investment and 
strategic focus disrupting nearly every aspect the industry that henry ford 
created years ago tesla motors receives over deposits for more 
affordable electric car within the first days unveiling the product consumer 
electronics players like dyson famous for high suction vacuum cleaners 
corp famous for led televisions and washing machines and foxconn famous 
for your iphone are getting into the car business apple makes strategic 
investment didi uber and toyota are aligning vehicle procurement and 
fleet management 
understandably investors remain highly skeptical ford has made numerous 
announcements strategic and technological initiatives aimed auto 
shared autonomous electric with real investment expenditure both the 
and partnership level yet the stock market doesn seem care ford stock 
price has underperformed the nearly ytd ford shares appear 
trade more the market expectation that the auto cycle has peaked and 
ford more cautionary language including recently downwardly revised 
guidance earnings expectations based our discussions with investors 
appears the market resigned high probability that technological disruption 
autos will come from outside the traditional industry not from within and 
any distribution the value chain will accrue players who not have the 
vast majority the left side their balance sheets devoted internal 
combustion human driving and private vehicle ownership 
the fight for young minds now take this step further and imagine the 
challenge recruiting the best talent tech hardware software and apply 
their craft traditional auto company with more traditional pay structures 
and compensation the stock the mostly traditional parent company rather 
than working for tech startup well heeled giant like alphabet covered

report 
tech talent join its firm some other auto companies talk with oems and 
suppliers admit very significant disadvantages attracting talent admittedly 
this highly nuanced issue and each case different depends who you ask 
and how you ask the question 
our key thoughts ford announcement that doubling the size its palo 
alto based efforts investment velodyne israel based saips and targets 
mass produce cars without pedals and steering wheels for commercial 
application ride sharing fleets 
expect nearly every major auto oem will soon announce plans 
produce fully autonomous car produced some scale applied 
sharing capacity near any auto company with financial 
resources and sophisticated effort can buy develop these 
technologies from growing number vendors acknowledge that 
ford may the early side announcing such efforts but believe 
the end even this year there should significant number 
competing efforts commercialize shared autonomous vehicles 
anticipate will extremely difficult for investors measure the 
competitive advantage this technological front any 
believe presenting ford viable and exciting destination for 
human talent the field advanced software tech may primary 
motivator this announcement have written extensively the 
challenge traditional auto company attracting the best talent the 
right areas potentially one the most fundamental disadvantages 
faced oems while this issue may not impact near term earnings 
believe can significantly impact long term competitiveness and the 
multiple investors are willing pay for the stock today there least 
perception the market that all the cool kids are going places like 
uber goog tsla china ford and other oems want change 
this 
image the public eye and investment community can become reality 
oems like ford want try stay ahead the wave 
announcements from outside disruptors the world shared autonomy 
light vehicle transport still concentrated enough for the oems 
know what coming around the corner from tech and consumer 
electronics firms firms that have historical attachment the 
current model 
yet another sign that the timeline fully autonomous vehicle 
hegemony may over hyped while there may dozens firms 
making robo taxis for public roads not expect material 
penetration fully autonomous cars until much years from 
now don expect the average mile traveled executed 
fully autonomous vehicle within the next years course could 
wrong but from today perspective believe the market 
expectation the path adoption level level fully 
autonomous miles may over hyped relative the pace and duration 
adoption advanced adas technology this view not 
much because the tech but other factors legal regulatory 
behavioral moral believe the world car parc may need 
replaced semi autonomous vehicles fully times over before the 
average mile traveled fully autonomous 
ford announcement was extremely light details while this 
understandable nevertheless have emphasize this ford 
management held minute session with financial analysis 
following the webcasted announcement the company did not disclose 
projected volume the vehicles powertrain details were not disclosed 
could pure hybrid ice all three ford did not specify they 
would partner with party ride sharing firms provide the ride share 
service from its own platform all options appear the table 
discussion with number partners are ongoing the company did not 
disclose the scale its ongoing financial investment this initiative 
don know the related costs will run into the hundreds millions 
dollars possibly many billions dollars ford admitted its 
commercial goals would require significant changes the regulatory 
landscape that are outside the company control 
the true economic impact this initiative may very low fact any 
significant expenditures these areas may adverse margins 
based the long term development nature the technology and the 
financial performance existing ride sharing models believe 
reasonable anticipate that significant investment shared and 
autonomous mobility could lead potentially significant increase 
capex and opex for many years before such efforts begin bear 
fruit become self sustaining wonder whether investors are 
prepared accept significantly lower earning power year period 
trade off help position the company better for the long term 
future the industry
