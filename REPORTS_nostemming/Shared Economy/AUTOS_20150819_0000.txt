what they flexdrive flexdrive subscription based car 
sharing program that allows its members reserve cars via mobile app for 
pretty much any duration while users can reserve car for personal use the 
majority them are drivers for ride sharing services namely uber flexdrive 
one the options currently available under uber vehicle solutions 
program alongside xchange leasing according jose puente founder 
and general manager they currently operate atlanta dallas and nashville 
with fleet size cars soon they launching austin and plan 
ramp vehicles year end flexdrive venture borne out cox 
automotive family owned privately held company parent autotrader 
manheim kelley blue book etc cox automotive also large backer 
peer peer car sharing called getaround 
how does work imagine that you want make little extra money 
uber driver but you don actually own car your options are quite limited 
you can out and purchase one hopefully with attractive financing deal 
make the car more affordable however you still the hook for 
maintenance insurance and other costs not mention the everyday hassles 
car ownership you could sign lease typically years which can 
even more expensive option and you still stuck with many the 
inconveniences associated with owning viable alternative may flexdrive 
you pay membership fee that allows you reserve vehicle ranging 
from compact car large suv for prices that are less than 
traditional car rental insurance maintenance and roadside assistance are 
included suppose you longer need the car after few months simply 
return with penalty 
every days miles flexdrive will contact the driver and request for 
the car swapped brought authorized maintenance center for 
point inspection once the car reaches about months miles 
whichever comes first the vehicle disposed through wholesale channels 
dealers and auctions another feature flexdrive that because 
community drivers network you can temporarily swap your car with 
other members depending the occasion suppose the sedan you been 
using for the last three weeks doesn cut for weekend getaway with the

why important according puente flexdrive goal eliminate 
the need own car offering alternative the consumer 
written about recently opportunity exists for number players who are 
attempting take year old way doing things business models 
like flexdrive are enabling companies like uber grow their driver population 
while maintaining stringent requirements and partners uber they 
facilitators solving one the greatest inefficiencies the auto industry 
ultra low utilization 
puente articulated longer term vision which flexdrive could help 
monetize assets that would otherwise sitting idle dealers car rental firms 
any fleet manager for that matter providing platform for adjacent 
businesses market their assets could reduce vehicle acquisition 
maintenance and disposal costs for flexdrive while enabling them expand 
their footprint soon flexdrive will partnering with dealers select cities 
the plan take portion the unsold inventory dealer lot and add 
those vehicles the flexdrive network for uber drivers reserve 
what are the barriers entry believe the barriers entry are 
relatively low other mobility players with enough scale could conceivably 
develop their own network drivers when asked whether dealers could 
potentially compliment their existing business with car sharing app 
puente said was unlikely consortium dealers would create their own 
universal platform market their cars given how fragmented the industry 
while barriers appear low being backed company that specializes 
automotive remarketing services appears key advantage cox 
automotive through its autotrader kbb and manheim subsidiaries among 
others collects data underlying millions new and used vehicle transactions 
our view flexdrive business model synonymous with fleet management 
with vehicle depreciation likely the single biggest cost the secret sauce fleet 
management expertise surrounding the buying and selling cars having 
access abundance data along with the financial resources and 
credibility cox automotive may give flexdrive edge optimizing the 
economics surrounding the used car transaction 
who are the competitors one could argue that flexdrive competes with 
virtually every vertical mobility including daily rental car sharing and 
vehicle ownership however consider businesses that offer short term 
leases weekly monthly opposed multi year attractive value 
propositions more direct competition example xchange leasing uber new auto leasing subsidiary under new pilot program uber will lease 
vehicles approved drivers attractive rates for camry 
with routine maintenance included drivers who participate for least days 
can return the vehicle with only two weeks notice for the most part does 
not operate the same cities flexdrive but they have plans expand the 
near future see our july note confirmed uber owns cars what 
next

oems flexdrive mission eliminate the need for car ownership players 
like this are challenging the mass market automakers whose business model 
may not selling cars individuals one day companies like ford and bmw 
are already beginning rethink their end markets completely those who can 
make the business model leap from cars sold miles minutes traveled are 
poised for long term survival see our april piece detroit kodak 
moment the end the auto sales model 
dealers previously mentioned flexdrive will soon begin partnering with 
dealers help manage their idle inventory this consistent with our 
expectations dealers experimenting with new business models find their 
fit the shared mobility ecosystem please see our insights piece from july 
birth the megadealer biggest consolidation story ever 
continue believe that the opportunity partner with disruptors like 
flexdrive favors the well resourced public companies with scale and balance 
sheet strength over the average mom and pop dealer groups this should help 
accelerate consolidation the space which seeing increase regulatory 
and technological burden for the average store prefer rated pag lad

car rental reserving vehicle flexdrive app cheaper than 
renting from htz car while puente mentioned that flexdrive isn 
really after the same customer leisure business traveler the fact that their 
primary business providing vehicles uber drivers suggests they are 
form competition albeit indirect remain htz and car see our
