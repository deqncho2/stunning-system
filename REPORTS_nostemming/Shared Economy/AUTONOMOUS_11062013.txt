autonomous cars 
self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
autonomous cars are longer just the realm science fiction they are real and 
will roads sooner than you think cars with basic autonomous capability are 
showrooms today semi autonomous cars are coming months and completely 
autonomous cars are set available before the end the decade 
this not toy the social and economic implications are enormous beyond the 
practical benefits estimate autonomous cars can contribute trillion annual 
savings the economy alone with global savings estimated over trillion 
there will undoubtedly bumps the road well including the issues liability 
infrastructure and consumer acceptance however none these issues appears 
insurmountable 
the auto industry business model could transformed and the collateral impact 
other sectors could significant well like the smartphone industry today 
see the auto industry reorganized into dedicated hardware oems software 
systems oems suppliers and integrated experience creators selling content the 
occupants the car who now have nothing else could significant new 
revenue stream believe early leaders the space have critical head start including 
audi mercedes benz bmw and nissan among auto oems delphi continental autoliv 
and trw among suppliers and tech players like google ibm and cisco non auto 
industries with high stakes this market include telecom services software media 
freight transportation semiconductors and insurance

executive summary 
few decades from now child from today will hardly believe 
that people used drive vehicles manually the march 
toward autonomous vehicles self driving cars well 
underway and though may few years until get there 
the destination may closer than most people think also 
means that society need start now fathom the 
enormous implications this transition that are ready 
for when comes 
over the course several months held intense brain 
storming sessions and interviewed futurists and top 
executives within the auto industry and potential disruptors 
outside the industry develop vision what future with 
autonomous cars will look like the result this blue paper 
collaborative effort across ten global research teams 
morgan stanley research 
this blue paper not meant comprehensive list 
every advantage and disadvantage use and obstacle 
adoption autonomous vehicles that already has been wellcovered other places and may write such topics 
more detail future follow reports 
rather than focus the topic what autonomous 
vehicle have instead focused areas that have not 
been addressed far have attempted lay out 
timeline for adoption determine what the global implications 
might quantify the socio economic benefits and most 
importantly examine the investment implications 
autonomous vehicles have attempted make practical 
case for the adoption autonomous vehicles and present 
solutions the most pressing concerns obstacles with the 
goal sparking the debate about whether need 
preparing for the future starting now 
prefer use the term autonomous car rather than selfdriving car driverless car this report because 
believe the term autonomous best conveys the amount 
technology and engineering that goes into making this system 
work also avoids the negative images rogue self aware 
vehicles that the term self driving driverless can imply 
autonomous cars are real and will ready for 
prime time sooner than you think 
any discussion cars mention the terms autonomous 
self driving and most people conjure images science 
fiction movies television shows like knight rider and 
batman the idea driverless car still fantastical that 
this topic struggles get respect even today broaching the 
concept something real still met with eye rolling and 
deep skepticism even among people within the auto industry 
who are actively working autonomous car technology 
true that there has been significant amount print media 
devoted the topic recently but believe there has been 
little serious dialogue even starting work this blue paper 
drew lot debate within our own teams whether this 
was topic relevance terms size the impact the 
timing potential realization and the ability generate 
actionable investment implications 
however now clear that not only are autonomous 
cars real but they are likely come around sooner than most 
people think with drivers driving billion hours year 
autonomous cars are also poised have much greater 
impact society whole than most people give them 
credit for 
getting the cars drive themselves may the 
easiest part 
why are convinced when even people closest the 
technology within the auto industry sound deeply 
skeptical simply because the uncertainty around timelines 
adoption for most new technologies the auto industry 
largely due having solve complex technological 
problems that not the case for autonomous vehicles the 
technology make self driving car happen largely 
available today and only incremental required mostly 
the area testing durability reliability and cost reduction 
all which have largely visible paths this one the few 
areas where there agreement across the auto industry the 
futurists and adjacent market players 
basic autonomous capability available cars today with 
semi autonomous capability coming months and full 
autonomous capability which exists prototype form today 
the path commercialization the end the decade 
the technology make happen not stretch and neither 
the cost premium estimate full autonomous capability 
will add only about the cost car today 
prices which expect will fall significantly the time the 
technology ready commercialized fact believe 
autonomous vehicle technology smaller leap than full 
electric vehicles which still need unknown battery 
breakthroughs lab significant macro disruption make 
them viable beyond being niche vehicles 
morgan stanley research

won happen because it too hard 
rather than the technology itself believe most the 
concerns obstacles mass adoption autonomous 
vehicles are largely practical procedural nature what 
more these issues appear relatively easy solve and 
have suggested our own likely solutions number the 
most pressing issues 
the main barrier autonomous vehicle growth the 
question liability who responsible the event 
autonomous vehicle crash the occupants the oem the 
supplier someone else not see this 
insurmountable issue fact believe the solutions are 
relatively straightforward talk about all states the 
going fault eliminate the need answer the above 
question the first place and believe the economics 
insurance can support the liability the event crash 
note that the liability issue has often been presented deal 
breaker ahead most the biggest technological leaps 
taken mankind but that has not stopped from flying 
airplanes building electric grid indeed inventing the 
automobile the first place other potential obstacles often 
mentioned include gaining customer acceptance building 
sufficient infrastructure government regulation and ethical 
issues 
believe the potential socio economic benefits 
autonomous cars are great that most the practical 
issues will quickly solved clear the path their 
implementation there will offsetting unfavorable impacts 
well for example whether will need many emts 
paramedics and law enforcement officers there are 
accidents however with other innovations the history 
mankind believe society must and will adapt 
global bust 
one the potential obstacles the success autonomous 
vehicles that does not come often enough our opinion 
whether can succeed emerging markets limited 
developed markets only almost every stakeholder have 
spoken seems believe that autonomous vehicles were 
achieve significant penetration all will only 
developed markets given the additional challenges facing the 
technology emerging markets top the challenges 
faced developed markets 
strongly believe that autonomous vehicles cannot 
limited developed markets alone they are become the 
fundamental business model shift envision the oems 
recent move common platforms and the need sell similar 
cars across all markets will ultimately mean that cars will 
either autonomous everywhere nowhere especially 
given the vast changes the design and engineering 
vehicle that are required give autonomous capability 
this blue paper discuss many the obstacles that 
autonomous vehicles emerging markets face and explain 
why believe not only that none them are deal breakers 
but also that there are many specific reasons why 
autonomous vehicles will actually work better those 
markets 
your time starts now 
see five phases the autonomous vehicle adoption 
curve starting with basic active safety capability today and 
ending utopian world which every car the road will 
autonomous while this utopia looks couple 
decades out envision scenario which mass adoption 
and full penetration could come much more quickly the 
need achieve the socio economic benefits autonomous 
cars compels the industry and governments force the 
adoption the technology and the socio economic benefits 
are indeed significant 
not just about making the world better place 
autonomous cars bring obvious social benefits fewer any 
road accidents reduced traffic congestion higher occupant 
productivity fuel savings and many many more however 
while the social benefits may nice autonomous vehicles 
need generate real economic return for both the 
consumers paying for the technology well the 
industry governments that will invest billions dollars 
developing happily though the economic benefits these 
social gains promise great have made high level 
attempt quantify these gains believe the economy 
can save trillion per year once autonomous cars 
become fully penetrated put that number context 
represents gdp extrapolating these savings 
global level applying the ratio savings gdp 
global gdp estimate global savings from autonomous 
vehicles the region trillion per year 
believe the promise achieving this level savings will 
compel the penetration autonomous capability vehicles 
pace quicker than natural demand pull

autonomous capability not just cool new feature add 
car brochure believe this technology can drive one 
the most significant transformations the automobile its 
history change this magnitude likely drive 
paradigm shift the auto industry well highlight two 
fundamental changes that see coming the auto industry 
the growth software value added part the car 
likely divide the industry into dedicated hardware 
makers similar oems today dedicated software 
makers includes oems suppliers and external entities 
new the auto industry and vertically integrated 
experience makers who control every aspect the 
automobile this industry structure analogous the 
smartphone industry structure today 
the consumption content the car occupants who 
now are free what they want opens new 
revenue stream for whoever that wants control 
this could the oem itself the autonomous system 
supplier third party 
believe the move autonomous vehicles could present 
existential threat oems who are lagging behind with the 
technology not have the balance sheets keep 
these oems could either away entirely become lowcost assemblers cars 
traditional non traditional players 
the importance thinking big 
the main advantages for the traditional players here are their 
familiarity with the automobile their control over the industry 
and their very high standards for testing and reliability that 
make them unlikely market with half baked product 
the main challenge that the traditional players face our 
view sustaining ability think outside the box and 
beyond rigid structure innovation and adoption our 
conversations found many traditional players unable 
unwilling think least share their thoughts about 
future with autonomous vehicles and how those vehicles 
might game changing beyond general expectation that 
morgan stanley research 
november 
autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
they are relatively inevitable the traditional industry appears 
morgan stanley blue paper 
thinking the autonomous car just another feature 
strapped adoption curve they appear unwilling 
think beyond and our view therefore risk being left 
behind 
the exact opposite for the new entrants companies like 
google ibm cisco systems and start ups these 
companies while playing their cards equally close their 
vests seem aiming for the same utopia universal 
adoption autonomous vehicle technology that envision 
with merely achieving high degree penetration being the 
downside proposition unencumbered the adoption curve 
planning the traditional auto industry these players seem 
want embrace risk and push the boundaries disruption 
and seem have little fear failure our view this may 
free them leapfrog the traditional auto industry players 
creators value this approach mirrors tesla attitude 
building cars which far has achieved remarkable success 
very short period time however this approach carries 
risk these non traditional players need learn the 
automobile and how its occupants like interact with build 
their products and systems automotive grade and 
embrace the cyclicality the industry 
autonomous cars can have significant implications for 
number adjacent sectors the morgan stanley freight 
transportation team believes that autonomous and semiautonomous driving technology will adopted far faster 
the cargo markets than passenger markets long haul 
freight delivery one the most obvious and compelling 
areas for the application autonomous and semiautonomous driving technology the telecom services team 
believes the industry could see revenue 
opportunity while the semiconductor team expects 
significant increase semi usage the media team sees 
incremental potential revenue for the media 
companies and the software team sees opportunity for 
complex software use and big data the insurance and car 
rental sectors may see binary outcomes from autonomous

summary key takeaways industry 
auto oems 
suppliers 
autonomous driving capability could change the auto industry fundamental ways 
shifting the value the car away from predominantly hardware software component well thereby 
allowing new players enter and forcing existing players reinvent themselves cede share this could allow 
oems shift away from vertically integrated asset heavy business model thereby changing the profitability 
structure the industry 
introducing new revenue model that monetizes the new drive time content opportunity within the car 
ultimately see the industry structure going the way the smartphone industry 
freight 
autonomous and semi autonomous driving technology will adopted far faster the cargo markets than 
transportation passenger markets 
conservatively estimate the potential savings the freight transportation industry annually 
collateral implications include competitive advantage large well capitalized fleets 
media 
autonomous vehicles have the potential materially increase total media consumption generating over 
net new media revenue video should take disproportionate share liberated drive time while radio 
and recorded music may lose key captive audience 
expect the largest beneficiary total dollar basis and home video benefit the most 
basis likely relative time share losers roughly radio and recorded music revenues could risk 
unclear impact outdoor advertising while the newly liberated driver may have more capacity view outdoor 
advertising outdoor ads will need compete with more immersive media for the driver attention 
telecom 
equipment 
today connected cars are modest near term revenue opportunity this could potentially reach 
with the rise autonomous driving positive for towers while carriers face opportunities and risks 
towers should benefit from the carrier capex requirements higher capacity broader coverage network further 
adding the potential duration revenue growth 
this could significant opportunity for carriers these customers could have low churn average life car and 
strong arpu though the network investments may quite costly 
semiconductors the increasing importance semiconductors car manufacture and operation has two key implications 
chip providers the compute networking and communications and data storage segments should benefit 
new wireless inter vehicle communication standards could provide significant opportunities 
software 
see three principal areas opportunity for software vendors 
near term 
demand for increasingly complex software auto design and manufacturing 
longer term 
standardization custom built software packaged platforms application sets 
managing big data resulting from increasing sensor counts vehicles 
insurance 
the autonomous car unlikely the death knell for auto insurance but the assignment insurance 
liability key unknown two key implications 
insurance prices are likely decline due lower accident frequency 
however accident severity costs may continue rise car complexity rises 
medical 
car rental 
autonomous vehicles should have limited impact hospital volumes and revenues with only car 
accidents resulting patient admission 
motor vehicle accidents mva account for hospital spending which translates all total 
hospital care and physician services costs 
two highly polarizing scenarios seem plausible

autonomous vehicle can drive itself with input from the 
driver while the technology needed achieve real autonomous 
driving has only emerged recent years test prototypes 
autonomous cars date back the and 
autonomous cars can have many advantages chief among them 
are lives saved fuel savings reduced traffic congestion improved user 
productivity economic stimulus and military applications 
autonomous cars also face challenges they include consumer 
acceptance high cost liability concerns legislative uncertainty the 
need convert large car parc non autonomous vehicles well 
security and ethical issues 
none these challenges appear insurmountable believe 
autonomous cars can change the world know increasing 
miles driven car usage and suburbanization well promoting 
emerging market rural area connectivity 
what autonomous vehicle 
autonomous vehicle can drive itself from point point 
with manual input from the driver the vehicle uses 
combination cameras radar systems sensors and global 
positioning system gps receivers determine its 
surroundings and uses artificial intelligence determine the 
quickest and safest path its destination mechatronic units 
and actuators allow the brain the car accelerate brake 
and steer necessary 
class project was the darpa grand challenge organized 
the defense department defense advanced research 
project agency darpa this competition brought number 
schools oems and innovators together create the 
autonomous vehicle the future initially aimed for potential 
military use but eventually with crossover civilian 
applications 
the darpa grand challenges were held open 
desert desert course and urban course while 
the participants had varying degrees success the first 
grand challenge saw participant complete the course and 
had winner the reliability and capability the machines 
improved dramatically with each iteration the first grand 
challenge winner was stanford stanley vehicle 
modified volkswagen touareg that earned the team the 
million winning purse the grand challenges got many the

history the autonomous car 
much like electric vehicles autonomous cars may seem like 
very recent initiative but were first developed decades ago 
these included both oem driven initiatives like the 
futurama exhibit the world fair and running 
autonomous prototypes from and ford the 
there have also been several independent attempts build 
autonomous cars over the years the japan and 
europe the through the most the early 
attempts autonomous driving needed significant help from 
infrastructure like special roads with metal guide strips and 
radio sensors point out the right way the cars but 
some also used early cameras remote sensors and 
actuators allow the cars control themselves much the 
same way semi autonomous cars can today the early 
self driving cars were able complete test routes but were 
largely untested real world traffic conditions 
the big breakthrough that brought autonomous driving out 
the fringes skunkworks programs and the odd science

advantages autonomous vehicles 
the main advantages come from the assumption that once 
artificially intelligent robots take over formulaic and 
mundane task like driving they will make fewer mistakes than 
human drivers this should result several socio economic 
benefits

driver errors are turn caused lack knowledge 
failure follow traffic rules driver distraction driver 
incapacity dui fatigue arguably autonomous car 
should more capable and consistent with its computerdriven ability determine and interpret its surrounding 
environment and apply traffic laws this should result 
significantly fewer accidents especially high 
percentage cars the road are autonomous this 
could even more beneficial emerging markets 
where limited driver experience weakly enforced traffic 
laws and poor road conditions result significantly 
higher ratio traffic deaths car population than the 
developed world 
gasoline saved the alone automobiles consume 
gallons oil per year use cost over 
cars that drive themselves based predictive 
capability and the ability alter the state the car based 
anticipated load conditions should significantly 
more efficient than manually operated vehicles just 
using cruise control car today can easily result 
fuel economy improvement manually 
operating the throttle this because the car knows what 
kind load will placed the engine and adapts 
accordingly 
the future autonomous cars with vehicle vehicle 
and vehicle infrastructure communication 
ability will have far greater understanding road and 
traffic conditions and should able predict even 
anticipated loads the engine allowing them operate 
cruise mode all the time this could result similar 
level fuel economy savings using cruise control all 
the time combined with push for more fuel efficient 
internal combustion engines and light electrification

have the potential effect the biggest transformation 
society since the internet 
obstacles adoption 
consumer acceptance first many consumers may 
reluctant put their lives the hands robot recent 
studies and surveys have shown split opinion whether 
people would like autonomous capability available 
their vehicles not therefore mass acceptance this 
technology could take long time this could the case 
particularly there are accidents involving even semiautonomous vehicles early the adoption phase whether 
was the fault the autonomous system not 
just the course researching this blue paper have 
had discussions with people about autonomous vehicles that 
usually elicits two reactions that awesome quickly followed 
that scary what don want share the road with 
autonomous car over time believe the autonomous 
capability cars will get more capable and reliable see our 
adoption curve part increasing the public faith and 
acceptance the system 
logically autonomous vehicles continue penetrate 
would soon approach point where ensure complete 
reliability phase vehicles all vehicles the road would 
need least partly autonomous this could mean that 
autonomous vehicles could mandated law and manual 
driving disallowed order reduce the number variables 
the road suddenly the question what don want 
share the road with autonomous car could become what 
don want share the road with someone driving his own 
car there could significant issues with telling people that 
they cannot drive their own cars there could significant 
privacy concerns well systems can track 
every car the road and store vehicle road traffic conditions 
central databases for long term access see few 
potential solutions this problem which discuss part 
cost our view the above reasonably high quality 
problem have because would mean the other obstacles 
this list mostly would have been resolved penetration 
autonomous vehicles among the early adopters tech 
fans wealthy consumers would full and the technology 
would knocking the door the mass market first 
get the early adopters board however the costs the 
system need come down each point our adoption 
curve part the ongoing phase should add more than 
the cost the car with the next phase 
adding not more than even with such limited 
cost premiums penetration could low and restricted 
high end trim levels mass market vehicles rather than 
across the board 
according recent power survey respondents 
first said they were interested purchasing autonomous 
vehicle but that percentage dropped once they were 
told would cost additional oems are already 
concerned that consumers may balk paying similar 
premium for new fuel efficiency technologies despite the 
lower running costs that would result net payoff over time 
addition newly mandated safety and consumer demanded 
infotainment systems together with the aforementioned fuel

how autonomous cars can change the world 
the ethical issue autonomous cars raise two kinds 
ethical issues 
miles driven should increase drivers drive 
approximately trillion miles year this number had 
increased almost straight line over the past years but 
peaked then declined sharply the economic 
downturn before stabilizing more recently however during 
the period growth the number cars the road rose 
even faster pace and miles driven per car peaked 
simply put americans today are driving less both 
absolute and relative basis than they were before 
there could number reasons for this the relative 
decline could result too many cars the road while 
the absolute decline could reflect macro weakness high 
unemployment high gas prices environmental awareness 
the rise internet services facebook seamless netflix etc 
which give people fewer reasons venture outside and 
declining youth interest the car the consensus view 
appears that miles driven will continue remain stable 
decline because most the above factors except macro 
are structural and not cyclical 
exhibit 
while autonomous cars are likely deliver significant 
socio economic benefits there also flipside terms 
number jobs being rendered obsolete 
miles driven billion miles 
miles driven trailing months 
can program autonomous car respond every 
single conceivable scenario the road including instances 
when may necessary break circumvent existing 
laws rules achieve favorable outcome breaking the 
speed limit the way the for example driving 
recklessly get out dangerous situation

regarding note that those same ethical issues exist 
today what happens the police stop the aforementioned 
driver speeding the does get ticket also there 
could workarounds the occupant could call get 
special dispensation and that car could then permitted 
via special instructions drive under different set 
protocols 
regarding this unfortunate potential outcome the 
adoption the driverless car but note that this has been 
issue since the industrial revolution and every single 
technological breakthrough ever since addition the 
believe autonomous cars can change this trend and boost 
miles driven significantly driving whether work

expensive public transportation systems reduce the resource

our view that the final outcome likely something 
between not see the extreme scenario almost 
car ownership playing out simply because have not seen 
car ownership today replaced massive fleets driver 
taxis car sharing services the desire own your own 
personal clean reliable method transportation too great 
our opinion believe the tendencies either downsize 
the household car fleet expand it because the higher 
flexibility autonomous cars will largely offset each other 
expect car ownership remain largely stable with more 
households having cars but with fewer cars per household 
cars will look different autonomous car needs look

management cost safety other reasons could now 
choose own their own cars instead the other school

technology 
the technology enable fully autonomous car capability already 
exists active safety systems that are commercially available today 
represent basic level autonomous driving fully autonomous 
functionality does not need much more incremental hardware 
software and testing where most the work needs done 
autonomous cars use sophisticated algorithms decipher the input 
received from sensory hardware determine the course action 
taken and how execute that action this will also need extensive 
testing ensure every possible scenario has been accounted for 
the cost premium not that high estimate that fully 
autonomous systems will add about the cost the car with 
the cost expected cut half the time the technology ready 
commercialized the end the decade 
practical considerations are the main impediment 
while the engineers put the final tweaks the hardware 
and software needed deliver full autonomous capability 
labs the long lead time commercial implementation 
likely the result practical considerations there 
are two levels practical considerations solving nontechnical issues like liability and regulation discussed 
elsewhere this report and making sure that the 
hardware and software have accounted for virtually every 
possible real life driving scenario the only solution for 
extensive testing the real world and 
simulations which takes lot time and resources and 
needs some level solved 
the industry poker face 
the first step toward getting autonomous cars the road 
get them work this may not large challenge 
some think because much the technology already exists 
our discussions with the players involved few things have 
become quite clear 
the hardware not the hurdle most the technology 
needed get fully autonomous cars work the real 
world already exists today and many fully functional 
prototypes have already been built and are being tested 
active safety systems which offer very basic level 
autonomous functionality have been sale for few 
years and are just starting enter the mass market full 
autonomous capability only needs automakers walk 
further down that path look many the hardware 
components that make the autonomous driving 
system this section 
software will the secret sauce here while the 
hardware situation appears relatively settled much the 
development work taking place today appears revolve 
around software autonomous vehicles use incredibly 
sophisticated algorithms interpret the sensory input 
coming from the hardware interpret the car 
surroundings anticipate upcoming events and predict 
the necessary reactions instruct the various hardware 
components the car perform the necessary actions 
this exponential increase the amount and 
sophistication software needed achieve autonomous 
capability probably the biggest change the 
functionality the automobile 
the section technology was both the easiest and the 
toughest part this blue paper for write and came 
together the very end the easy part was that most the 
content for this section physically exists already 
commercialized and easy write about with little need for 
the projection employ many other parts this report 
the hard part was trying penetrate the wall secrecy 
surrounding industry activities the technology side 
spoke with many companies currently operating autonomous 
vehicle prototypes and while most were eager discuss their 
broad vision future with autonomous cars there was little 
visibility into specific technological approaches even 
foot level some this understandably could 
result competitive concerns but believe the secrecy 
may also indicate lack clarity the precise path ahead 
found many the suppliers including autoliv delphi 
denso and trw much more forthcoming about their 
technological solutions 
there appear two broad approaches getting 
the car able drive itself 
the old adage give man fish and feed him for day 
teach man fish and feed him for lifetime good way 
describe 
the first approach the give man fish approach where 
the car told where imagine being blind folded and 
having walk through obstacle course with external 
observer passing instructions like turn left walk steps 
stop turn right etc that approximately what this 
approach like the input comes from infrastructure along 
the road sensors intersection management systems and 
morgan stanley research

autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
other communication and from comparing lidarobtained profile the surroundings the car 
comparing that image map database and identifying any 
differences between the two images obstacles that need 
navigated around 
the advantages this approach are that can made quite 
reliable over time covers relatively large distances and 
relatively low cost from the car perspective the 
disadvantages are high initial cost because the need 
build out infrastructure and detailed street view map 
database and potentially the car ability react sudden 
changes 
the second approach the teach man fish approach 
which similar tackling the obstacle course feeling your 
way around the course while blind folded without external 
navigation instructions this achieved stuffing the car 
with battery cameras radar and sensors that give the car 
knowledge the surrounding environment and 
allowing react proactively obstacles 
this approach allows the vehicle react quickly situations 
and focus only what important while ignoring everything 
else which one the most important and fundamental 
rules autonomous driving the downside relatively high 
car cost least the near term and sensitivity weather 
and other sources electronic signal blockage 
hardware components autonomous driving 
system 
cameras cameras need least monovision 
cameras which means they have one source vision 
monovision cameras are very simple devices and the 
video feed usually used for understanding basic 
surroundings typically fixed infrastructure like lane 
markings speed limit signs etc the hardware itself 
pretty simple and cheap automotive monovision 
cameras are less sophisticated and have lower pixel 
density than cameras smartphones however the 
challenge the software side which involves fast 
image processing recognize common roadside 
infrastructure from simple black and white relatively 
low resolution image the next stage stereovision 
cameras which use two video sources similar human 
eyesight this incorporates depth perception and can 
help the car better understand the relative position 
moving traffic and potential obstacles

radar addition visual confirmation its surroundings 
the car also collects sensory images using radar systems 
there are two typical types radar systems short range 
and long range which are usually mutually exclusive shortrange radar the name indicates feels around the car 
immediate surroundings especially low speeds while longrange radar used high speeds and over relatively long 
distances the combination long distance radar plus 
algorithm based processing images from stereovision 
cameras that gives the autonomous car the capability 
knowing with reasonably high degree accuracy exactly 
what front and how the positions and profiles 
external objects are changing all times 
autonomous car also likely have short range side 
radar already used blind spot detection systems and 
short and long range rear radar already used advanced 
active safety systems for pre crash warning and avoidance 
create view what around the car ultra wideband 
radar probably best suited for autonomous applications but 
the challenge with the technology today that standards are 
not harmonized and difficult secure permission use 
the spectrum needed for its operation however expect 
this change over time the technology matures and there 
more pressure governments approve monitor and 
secure communications bandwidth for autonomous cars 
the weather issue one the concerns surrounding 
autonomous car ability effective broad range 
circumstances the whether can reliable bad weather 
true that conditions heavy rain fog snow the 
autonomous car cameras would struggle pick familiar 
patterns objects while radar systems could become 
confused such cases autonomous car may not able 
function 
however there are few things keep mind 
this only happens cases really extreme weather 
where visibility drops very low distances similar 
whiteout conditions can argued that the human 
driver ability see may better than the car 
such circumstances and the best course action may 
indeed pull over and not drive all 
vehicle vehicle communication makes driving poor 
weather conditions safer than with manual driving cars 
know exactly where they and other cars are the road 
and differing speeds and driving styles will not 
issue autonomous cars will also unlikely drive 
manner unsuitable the conditions causing fewer bad 
weather accidents 
the end driving probably becomes like other modes 
transportation including air and train travel the 
weather conditions are bad that even car with 
advanced stereo and infrared cameras and long distance 
radar cannot see probably too dangerous drive

many industry observers believe that even autonomous cars

disagree think emerging market penetration 
autonomous cars essential because the volume boost would bring 
down the cost the technology and would support the strong push 
every oem achieve platform consolidation 
see several catalysts that can aid the adoption autonomous 
vehicles emerging markets 
basic infrastructure necessity make autonomous 
cars work the latest technology aims make autonomous 
vehicles independent fixed dedicated infrastructure 
several decades ago the early prototypes and experimental 
models relied upon roadside and connectivity infrastructure 
such under road metal strips and radio transmitters along 
roadways make the car aware its surroundings and path 
travel autonomous vehicles today seek use battery 
board cameras radar and gps get independent 
sense the surrounding environment this theory 
reduces the autonomous vehicle dependence 
infrastructure giving relative flexibility use 
states california and nevada granting licenses oems and 
suppliers test run autonomous vehicles public roads 
florida and michigan have also been supportive various 
government bodies like the national highway traffic safety 
administration nhtsa the department transportation 
dot and the environmental protection agency epa are 
thinking about future legislation already and several other 
corporate constituents appear open the concept 
europe appears proceeding more slowly this 
path which unusual given that europe traditionally has 
been the incubator birthplace cutting edge automotive 
technologies including active safety the predecessor 
autonomous driving indeed many european oems including 
audi bmw mercedes benz and volvo are among the 
pioneers the field autonomous driving but while much 
the may europe the also becoming 
center and increasingly the predominant test bed for the 
oems although these are signs that europe may starting 
catch well july the department 
transportation the united kingdom issued report 
approving the testing autonomous cars part 
billion plan ease traffic congestion japan also recently 
issued its first autonomous driving license nissan 
exhibit 
however while the autonomous car today can see itself 
there still needs something seen and this 
necessitates basic level infrastructure development even 
fully autonomous cars will depend road and lane markings 
and global positioning systems loaded with pre mapped 
roads they will also require sufficient field vision and 
connectivity for and communication 
appears autonomous vehicles are therefore best suited 
for developed markets least the near term are 
more likely have fully developed and mature road and 
communications infrastructure furthermore given higher 
average transaction prices and traditional familiarity with 
technology penetration curve developed markets 
acceptance and willingness ability pay for autonomous 
vehicles could also higher than emerging markets 
almost everyone the industry that have spoken with 
seems believe that and when autonomous cars start 
penetrate the car parc their growth will likely remain restricted

circumstances this critical step that distinguishes 
between true autonomous vehicle and car that can drive 
itself auto pilot achieving this final step also 
extremely important juncture the new business model 
where the winners can sorted from the losers the 
race for autonomous cars 
the traditional industry approach appears that most 
the auto oems and suppliers working the autonomous car 
are aiming late phase technology cars that can drive 
themselves variety circumstances without regard 
whether they are fully phase autonomous not these 
entities view the combined hurdles customer acceptance 
liability infrastructure and mass penetration too great 
overcome the foreseeable future while they acknowledge 
that there chance may ultimately get such utopian 
world they believe equally likely that not which 
makes not something they need worry about this point 
time what this means that they can adapt existing 
cars architectures for self driving capability without having 
design autonomous car from the ground this the 
incremental approach where active safety gets better and 
better until the customers decide which point they want the 
cars take over 
the outsiders approach unlike the traditional auto industry 
the outsiders like google and some start ups are directly 
aiming get phase fast possible they 
acknowledge that there might adoption curve initially 
but want skip over phases and 
the adoption curve 
see these four phases autonomous vehicles being 
implemented across adoption curve the first three phases 
will incremental increases the content and capability 
with steep increase get the utopian world phase 
the sharp slope the curve reflects the challenge that 
expect the industry face attempts achieve full 
penetration autonomous vehicles 
the risk settling for incremental active safety 
going for step function change 
the steep curve the last phase autonomous vehicle 
adoption also represents grey area the inflection point 
between phase and phase this the point crossover 
where the training wheels and adult supervision are 
removed from the autonomous vehicle and allowed 
drive its own the cars not really become self aware 
this point it just that they not need human 
intervention and can decide their own course action even 
there could three reasons for this 
giving customers the full benefit autonomous capability 
will drive maximum penetration once people have 
experienced the full benefits fully autonomous vehicle 
and what they can and what they don have behind 
the wheel this will automatically create positive feedback 
loop that can drive mass penetration incremental steps 
active safety may not accomplish this 
new entrants cannot really capitalize the intermediate 
phases being external the auto industry the googles and 
start ups the world cannot really participate the trickle 
penetration active safety the same way that traditional 
auto suppliers can this drives them reinvent the 
automobile their own terms helps that the approach 
toward the utopian vision needs extensive use mapping 
and big data capabilities something they are very good

department transportation levels 
autonomous car 
another way looking the expected evolution 
autonomous vehicles divide into different levels based 
capability this what the department 
transportation has done its initial guideline note 
autonomous vehicles this note meant guide for the 
states and government agencies when they have deal with 
the issue any context 
nhtsa defines vehicle automation having five levels 
automation level the driver complete and sole 
control the primary vehicle controls brake steering 
throttle and motive power all times 
function specific automation level automation this 
level involves one more specific control functions 
examples include electronic stability control pre charged 
brakes where the vehicle automatically assists with braking 
enable the driver regain control the vehicle stop faster 
than possible acting alone 
combined function automation level this level 
involves automation least two primary control functions 
designed work unison relieve the driver control 
those functions example combined functions enabling 
level system adaptive cruise control combination with 
lane centering 
limited self driving automation level vehicles this 
level automation enable the driver cede full control all 
safety critical functions under certain traffic environmental 
conditions and those conditions rely heavily the 
vehicle monitor for changes those conditions requiring 
transition back driver control the driver expected 
available for occasional control but with sufficiently 
comfortable transition time the google car example 
limited self driving automation 
full self driving automation level the vehicle 
designed perform all safety critical driving functions and 
monitor roadway conditions for entire trip such design 
anticipates that the driver will provide destination navigation 
input but not expected available for control any 
time during the trip this includes both occupied and

estimate that autonomous vehicles can save the economy

see five drivers the cost savings fuel cost savings 
accident costs productivity gain fuel loss from 
congestion productivity savings from congestion 
comprehensive and only represents attempt 
quantify the biggest areas savings 
not include the cost autonomous vehicles 
this analysis obviously one sided and only looks the 
benefits autonomous cars and not the costs this was 
done for two reasons for the sake simplicity the 
benefits being little more obvious than the infrastructure 
legal and other costs needed get the cars the road 
and view most the costs related autonomous 
cars front one time nature while the savings 
should ongoing making this more relevant 
not consider the offsetting losses there are 
two sides every story and has been the case since 
the industrial revolution every automated mechanized 
activity potentially eliminates existing jobs our analysis 
does not account for such offsetting losses for example 
there are virtually motor vehicle accidents there 
could fewer emergency rooms hospitals which 
could result less employment for emts doctors nurses 
another instance self parking cars could eliminate the 
need for valets 
not include the investment implications 
autonomous vehicles the number only 
includes the dollar cost the social savings and does not 
consider the value accrued the auto oems suppliers 
and external corporate entities directly indirectly 
involved with autonomous vehicles have attempted 
separate assessment investment implications part 
this report 
this will only happen phase utopian world the 
most important thing keep mind about our 
savings estimate that can achieved only 
phase utopian scenario laid out part this 
blue paper this means that the figure could 
purely theoretical until get point where 
cars the road are autonomous and manual driving 
virtually banned from the roads however could see 
incremental savings along the adoption curve 
this our base case estimate our bull case estimate savings 
year and bear case year 
this rough estimate does not account for the cost 
implementing autonomous vehicles one time offsetting losses 
and investment implications also assumes penetration 
autonomous vehicles achieve the full run rate potential savings 
the key selling point autonomous cars their potential 
reduce the adverse social and economic impacts 
transportation infrastructure here have attempted 
calculate the total potential economic cost savings that 
autonomous cars represent our view putting dollar figure 
the potential savings impact can help crystallize the 
benefits technology that viewed some even industry 
insiders pie the sky science fiction 
autonomous vehicles can save the economy 
trillion per year 
these cost savings would come from the improvement fuel 
economy the car parc improved productivity for 
autonomous cars occupants and the near elimination 
accidents and the resultant injuries and loss life 
autonomous cars can penetrate globally the global economic 
savings could many multiples higher applying the ratio 
savings gdp global gdp about trillion nets 
global savings estimate about per year from 
autonomous vehicles 
but here comes the fine print 
there are number disclaimers that must make very 
clear however 
this very rough estimate the savings 
figure makes number assumptions based data 
from variety government and non government 
agencies and studies furthermore some the sources 
date back the most recently available

autonomous vehicles self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
european commission for mobility and transport estimates 
that congestion costs europe about gdp each year 
according the texas traffic institute urban mobility 
report supported the dot the average 
driver lost hours congestion way from hours 
this was calculated the difference between traveling 
congested speeds rather than free flowing speeds that 
the equivalent almost five vacation days areas with over 
three million people commuters experienced higher 
congestion delays and lost average hours 
the report analyzed over million speeds 
roads across the the speed data was collected every 
minutes hours day hundreds points along almost 
every mile major road north america 
the report also estimates that there are about 
commuters the which means they are collectively 
losing congestion around billion hours year hours 
million commuters 
autonomous cars should able largely eliminate 
congestion due smoother driving styles and actively 
managed intersections and traffic patterns autonomous cars 
and especially driverless cars should also strongly 
encourage traffic pooling again assuming the cost time 
per hour hours saved congestion worth 
potential productivity generated 
only the time spent moving the road whereas the above 
congestion math uses only time spent stuck congestion 
when not moving 
there another aspect congestion saving the fuel 
wasted being stuck traffic will longer needed this 
was also calculated the texas traffic institute report 
which quantified congestion taking the free flow results and 
subtracting them from congested results first tti calculated 
the emissions and fuel consumption during congested 
conditions combining speed volume and emission rates 
then estimated the amount gas needed produce those 
emissions the average fuel wasted was gallons per 
commuter and total gallons for the entire

given the number headwinds facing autonomous vehicle penetration

autonomous vehicles fail gain traction then little will change 
the industry today the push toward widespread car connectivity

autonomous vehicles self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
next steps the path get there 
what are the next steps get there before see full 
penetration autonomous cars need resolve few issues 
outside the technology needed get there some these issues 
are relevant the near term some are longer term issues but all 
them probably need kick off now resolved time for the 
autonomous car ramp 
highlight four next steps 
building consumer awareness 
getting regulatory support 
resolving the liability issue 
building out the network infrastructure 
while the industry works perfect autonomous vehicle 
technology there are steps that need taken outside the 
industry ensure that the rollout will smooth and 
successful while these actions not necessarily have 
completed before the first autonomous car hits the road they 
will necessity achieve full penetration autonomous 
vehicles 
step building consumer awareness 
going take lot coaxing get people give 
control the steering wheel even the use cruise control 
viewed with skepticism many drivers today getting them 
give complete control not going easy that said 
probably have epidemic too many people driving 
while impaired whether texting some other distraction 
may easier get people embrace autonomous cars 
than give their smartphone the car 
believe the oems need begin familiarizing 
consumers with autonomous car technology and retraining 
their car related behaviors our view the best way this 
conducting road shows which people are driven 
around small tracks autonomous cars low speeds get 
them used the feeling oems can also set simulators 
dealers that customers can try out the autonomous 
experience safe environment 
step getting regulatory support 
the government going have get board with 
autonomous cars some point during the ramp phase 
believe the government can have large role the 
process including accommodating autonomous cars 
legislation issuing special licenses autonomous vehicles 
the early stage helping resolve the liability issue building out 
infrastructure and ultimately speeding adoption 
through mandate necessary 
step resolving the liability issue 
this the most frequently cited impediment autonomous 
vehicle penetration believe the liability issue needs 
comprehensively addressed soon this actually critical 
issue for even early adoption autonomous vehicles 
step building out the network infrastructure 
while vast only needed for part phase and 
phase the adoption curve the long lead times necessary 
for build out and spectrum approval means have get 
started pretty soon

autonomous vehicles self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
government role the silent referee 
the two hurdles the adoption autonomous vehicles that 
come across most often are determining liability and 
government acceptance the technology while the first 
very real and will need comprehensively addressed 
believe the second less obstacle than many people 
think 
stage not think the government will 
impediment autonomous vehicle 
adoption penetration 
the government rarely tends ahead the curve 
when comes adoption penetration new technologies 
sometimes impediment such the case audi 
active matrix led headlamps these are illegal the 
because law requiring that the driver must 
control switching headlights between high and low beams 
another example the lag time the epa ability adapt 
its fuel economy testing methods keep pace with new fuelefficient technologies 
the case autonomous vehicles however may not 
bad thing this because believe very little intervention 
needed from the government for early adoption 
autonomous systems while are still very early the 
process and there are several areas uncertainty there 
appear few laws regulations that prevent inhibit the 
use autonomous systems cars 
the driver license issue the biggest sticking point 
likely how handle licensing for cars without drivers 
far nevada california florida michigan and the district 
columbia have explicitly permitted and licensed fully 
autonomous cars for use their roads with few other 
states considering similar approvals however for the other 
states unclear whether driverless cars are legal and not 
having explicit approval does not necessarily mean 
cannot done simply put there are laws that 
specifically forbid the use autonomous cars there may 
legal impediment their adoption and the government 
might not need officially approve the technology ahead 
time for proceed and develop 
legal issues aside however there are practical 
considerations that governments may need address over 
time 
stage believe the government will 
eventually help facilitate rapid adoption 
autonomous vehicles 
while need little government intervention initially get 
autonomous cars the road the government may well have 
important role play over time between phases and 
stated part 
where autonomous cars will need government 
support 
stepping with intervention necessary the 
government unlikely ignore autonomous vehicles our 
view the dot has already issued guidelines for autonomous 
vehicles and the nhtsa and the federal government are 
working with individual states rules and regulations 
believe the government approach autonomous driving will 
similar its approach distracted driving connected cars 
that staying arm length and letting the technology 
evolve its own pace unless there are real world concerns 
adverse implications the technology that need policing 
regulation the case autonomous vehicles early selfdriving cars are involved unacceptably high rate 
accidents caused system unreliability and the general 
public becomes fearful sharing the road with autonomous 
vehicles then the government could step regulate the 
technology 
but the technology works hoped for and demand high 
the government could help accelerate adoption 
new automotive technologies typically penetrate 
fastest when they are mandated the government usually 
mandates technology when the benefits are clearly 
demonstrated and undeniable and the overall cost benefit 
mandate positive the actual socio economic benefits 
autonomous vehicle technology even remotely the 
ballpark our estimate part believe the cost benefit 
analysis will quite clear this could few years after 
fully autonomous vehicles first become available 
mentioned part get the full benefit need 
penetration the car parc which could take two decades 
more natural run rate government mandate the 
form accelerated scrappage program electric 
vehicle like cost rebate ratings cost penalty cars 
without the technology could significantly accelerate full 
penetration and consequently the realization full economic 
savings

helping resolve the liability issue who fault the

number one issue facing autonomous vehicles while part 
this needs resolved the insurance companies please 
see insurance implications elsewhere this blue paper the 
government could also help resolve this number ways 
note that are not attorneys and that the following 
discussion purely hypothetical 
from tort perspective and help lay the groundwork for the 
insurance companies might see all states adopting 
fault insurance regimens currently states are fault 
meaning the blame for accident and the insurance 
implications are equally shared the parties involved 
irrespective who caused the accident applying such 
regimen autonomous cars may remove the very need 
answer the question who responsible least from 
insurance tort perspective 
from criminal liability perspective because autonomous 
cars will carry array cameras sensors radar gps and

the revenue model still uncertain given the limited

structure carriers will ultimately use monetize the car and 
driver network usage one example have today the 
audi connect product which consumers purchase data 
based monthly service agreement

audi owners pay for monthly data plans

alternatively the tesla model does not have monthly fee 
for the car owner though buyers must pay for the tech 
package which includes gps navigation and other features 
ultimately there may two revenue streams for carriers 
one may wholesale arrangement with the automobile 
manufacturer for the vehicle navigation and diagnostic 
services and ultimately its autonomous driving usage while 
the carrier may deal directly with the consumer for 
infotainment services 
and verizon have early advantage given their 
data centric pricing leading national networks and strong 
spectrum holdings particularly low band which short 
supply that said mobile and sprint are aggressively 
building out their networks and may able improve their 
low band spectrum position via the broadcaster incentive 
auction expected next year 
this opportunity brings significant risk the increased 
investment capex and spectrum required make this

the new auto industry revenue model 
believe autonomous cars will drive paradigm shift the 
traditional auto industry see the emergence software key 
part the value the car dividing the auto industry into hardware 
specialists software specialists and integrated experience 
providers this analogous the hardware smartphone 
industries 
this could binary event for many players some could see 
existential threat from autonomous cars some could reinvent 
themselves leaders and others could enter the industry for the first 
time 
there are implications for oems and suppliers the traditional 
oems need lead the space reinvent themselves 
manufacturing specialists the secular suppliers who provide 
autonomous vehicle systems and other growing parts the car will get 
stronger while suppliers who are exposed static longer 
essential parts the car will challenged 
the content opportunity opens new potential revenue 
stream the battle control the content will waged the oems 
the suppliers and the external content providers 
there are significant collateral implications for other sectors 
examine the read across the auto space from the hardware 
industry google ambitions and the implications for media software 
car rental healthcare transportation and the semiconductor spaces 
the move autonomous vehicles likely bring significant 
social and economic consequences for the broad economy 
and even society general the investment implications are 
likely even greater the advent the autonomous car 
likely have investment implications for telecom 
infrastructure insurance services technology hardware 
software and course autos 
new revenue model for the auto industry 
may easy conclude that the reinvention the 
automobile autonomous will watershed event for the 
auto industry and that the automobile which one point 
the last decade seemed destined become insignificant will 
play new important role society this should 
significantly positive for the automotive oems and suppliers 
not quite 
see the emergence autonomous cars binary 
event for the auto industry some players will face 
existential threat from autonomous cars some will reinvent 
themselves leaders and others will enter the industry for 
the first time 
the battle for content 
most the attention surrounding autonomous cars far has 
focused the potential social and macroeconomic gains 
they represent autonomous cars seem all about making 
the world better place however not believe that the 
social practical gains necessarily will the primary driver 
the pursuit autonomous vehicle penetration 
social gains may good way get some parties like the 
government insurance companies and the general public 
board but rarely pay the bills the government might able 
use the social economic savings part justify spending 
significant resources building some level infrastructure 
support and writing legislation that supports implementation 
however autonomous vehicles will need deliver real 
economic returns the companies and entities involved 
able gain real traction 
the business side things the various players within and 
outside the auto industry are expected spend several 
billions dollars autonomous vehicle development over 
the next decade without any guarantee that the customer 
able and willing pay for have seen this with other 
penetration stories the group the oems typically tend 
push back against fuel efficiency safety emissions 
legislation until clear how they can monetize 
see are two primary reasons why the oems may 
championing push toward autonomous cars 
keeping with the cutting edge innovation 
addition the social benefits this the main reason 
hear from the oems and suppliers for pursuing this 
opportunity with even basic active safety systems and 
advanced infotainment systems two areas where the 
luxury oems used distinguish themselves spreading 
the mass market oems the luxury oems need 
move the next frontier which they believe cars 
the drive themselves 
the existing auto players also quite rightly view this 
one the biggest steps the functionality the 
automobile significantly greater than higher fuel 
efficiency infotainment once customers have 
experienced autonomous cars and have heard the 
positive word mouth the oems believe the demand

autonomous vehicles self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
pull for the feature going very strong and selfdriving capability not led daytime running light that 
can slapped the car hurry given the nature 
the product high levels experience knowledge 
required with extremely long lead times and very high 
level involved oem reacts and tries get 
the bandwagon after demand spikes may too 
late 
more importantly believe the real value here 
comes from selling content the occupants the 
car the emergence the autonomous vehicle opens 
new avenue revenue generation for all entities 
involved mentioned parts and collectively 
spend over hours per year our cars with the 
ability the car drive itself that time can now 
redirected other pursuits potentially creating new 
revenue stream the content can monetized way 
this content provider dream short air travel 
there are few other opportunities have captive 
audience for several hours time 
however make this happen critical that the 
car fully autonomous not practical have 
keep pausing movie every couple minutes 
manually take over the car and make lane change 
believe this may why some players are attempting 
straight for the ultimate goal completely 
autonomous cars bypassing the incremental stages 
the new auto industry paradigm 
autonomous driving capability not just cool new 
feature the car but rather powerful force that can 
fundamentally change the auto industry 
see two paradigm shifts the industry 
shifting the value the car away from predominantly 
hardware software component well thereby 
allowing new players enter and forcing existing players 
reinvent themselves cede share this could 
potentially allow oems shift away from vertically 
integrated asset heavy business model thereby 
changing the profitability structure the industry 
introducing new revenue model being able 
monetize the content opportunity within the car 
short see the industry structure going the way 
the smartphone industry 
the value the auto industry today about the car 
holistic product the oem the most important link the 
supply chain the biggest single contributor content 
which why the oems have the most visible brands the 
industry well the other parts the value chain tend 
incidental the automotive experience and not usually 
have branding power

also likely change with some companies trying

others trying vertically integrate across the spectrum this 
likely mirror the smartphone industry with hardware 
specialists software specialists and integrated experience 
creators 
the hardware business model 
believe the current auto industry structure can remain 
largely place with oems and suppliers making great cars 
even cars were drive themselves perhaps even more 
because it cars will have remain safe comfortable 
quick connected quiet and stylish the oems will continue 
the most influential players the industry through their 
design assembly distribution marketing and service 
capabilities the suppliers can continue add value and build 
sustainable business models focusing the growth areas 
fuel efficiency safety emissions and interior content 
however the gap between the secular and cyclical suppliers 
could widen with the value the automotive hardware 
declining part the overall value provided the 
autonomous car only the most critical hardware components 
within the car can continue command pricing power the 
metal benders and widget makers who are already facing 
significant challenges within the industry will particularly 
suffer the value the hardware whole declines 
the stability the hardware business model however does 
not mean that there will not major changes cars evolve 
from what they are today fully autonomous vehicles our 
utopian scenario envision several changes the form 
and function the various parts the car highlight 
part suppliers who make components that serve little 
function autonomous car will particularly risk 
the software business model 
the average car today contains reasonable amount 
software about million lines code the software 
car today typically regulates independent functions car 
including drive wire traction management active safety 
and infotainment however these systems act largely 
independent silos today with only few handshakes 
exchanges between components the autonomous car the 
future cannot work like this all the systems autonomous 
car will need brought together within central managing 
brain that can supervise and control almost every function 
the car all times the level system monitoring 
autonomous car significantly higher than that regular 
car given the fact that the main controlling factor regular 
car the driver absent autonomous vehicle the 
autonomous vehicle also cannot risk different sets code 
written different suppliers each component 
effect the central controller operating system will 
replacing the human driver the primary operator the 
vehicle autonomous car the car needs know what 
every function and feature within the vehicle doing all 
times because the car charge and has make decisions 
based operating conditions this means virtually very 
function the car will now have software component 
addition every function within the car will now need 
supervised and controlled the central computer which runs 
operating system similar personal computer within 
with each the different functions the car reside unlike 
cars today with independent functions the central 
controller operating system analogous the domain 
controller that described part will control all the other 
functions the car envision the autonomous driving 
brain being the most important part this central 
controller operating system 
expect players within the auto industry specialize this 
newly important software component build operating 
systems for cars these could existing auto oems auto 
suppliers quite possibly players from outside the industry 
such google apple microsoft other companies with 
computer operating system expertise see the automotive 
software operating industry being parallel the hardware 
industry where suppliers sell and install their operating 
systems into cars made different automakers much the 
same manner pcs today ship with options different 
operating systems these operating systems will then interact 
with the hardware components installed the vehicle using

the experience creator addition the software 
business model that revolves around the operating system for 
the car also emerging content opportunity one the 
key objectives getting cars drive themselves that 
the occupants the car including the driver can freed 
sell them content this allows several content creators who 
have only had limited access the car until now through 
infotainment systems such internet radio make full 
inroads into the car most content not car specific 
youtube netflix blogs news social media etc that 
developed for smartphones can piped into the car well 
with little incremental change this does not mean that 
youtube and netflix will now have automotive division and 
will become players the auto industry this does mean that 
these companies will able gain access new revenue 
stream addition smartphones and computers 
not believe that the traditional auto industry players will 
locked out the content opportunity that the hardware 
and the software business models are mutually exclusive 
however see some existing industry players trying offer 
comprehensive solution including hardware software and 
content give customers the most cohesive integrated 
experience possible for example auto oem will make its 
own car powered its own proprietary operating system 
developed house close relation with supplier will 
also control the content available within its cars this 
closest the apple model for smartphones and desktop 
computers see this being limited the most advanced 
and successful oems the ones with powerful brands large 
balance sheets and extensive resources that will allow 
them venture into areas they will have little expertise 
especially the software content side 
but why this why not let the software content 
handled those outside the traditional auto industry who 
know best think outsourcing the software will still 
the most common business model but the few oems who 
want the best experience for the customers will least 
attempt vertically integrate for two reasons 
the value importance the software content 
component the oems far have stayed out 
software largely because has been relatively 
small part the value the car and has been 
restricted components typically purchased from 
suppliers this will longer the case with 
autonomous cars with the software content angle 
accounting for the value the car our 
view addition selling the software autonomous 
capability other less vertically integrated 
automakers well monetizing the content 
opportunity within the car are two new revenue 
streams that the oem may unwilling ignore 
morgan stanley research

autonomous vehicles self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
the temptation replicating apple success with 
smartphones apple success design focused 
company that controls every part the hardware 
software and content its products and its ability 
translate that into better products quality and pricing 
should the goal every automaker industry 
where pricing and uniqueness have been hard 
come despite high transaction prices 
this may not farfetched sounds with many 
oems already developing house autonomous vehicle 
capability well infotainment system development their 
software capabilities may already much farther along than 
most people give them credit for for example recently 
decided stop outsourcing all its development and 
hiring computer professionals the next three five 
years bring all its capability house 
the oems are also not strangers the content business 
either recall that many oems already have smartphone 
apps available that allow basic car functions controlled 
via smartphone the past few years both bmw and audi 
have commissioned independent filmmakers direct indie art 
movies that feature their cars part marketing campaign 
and both oems have internal channels part their 
corporate dealer network 
while not expect oem emulate netflix and 
commission top hollywood director develop series 
for their vehicles only point out that this not impossible 
think more likely that certain oems team with 
media partners allow exclusive availability content 
their vehicles especially the case multi brand 
conglomerates like and generally act 
gatekeepers for what goes into their vehicles 
what does this mean for 
oems the oems will have range choices how 
vertically integrated they want their cars they can make 
fully integrated vehicles designing developing and 
assembling the body and the operating system including the 
autonomous capability and controlling the content available 
the car the other extreme would extremely assetlight completely outsourced model which the oem sells 
car under its brand and distribution network but apart from 
designing the vehicle its studios every other component 
outsourced this would include sourcing the engine 
transmission battery and other interior exterior components 
from other oems suppliers using software and 
autonomous capability developed other oems suppliers 
third parties and outsourcing assembly such magna 
steyr and maybe even distribution such third party 
distribution arrangement like penske smart 
while the oems could certainly adopt business model that 
looks like something between these two extremes over 
time see the industry coalescing one the other end 
the vertical integration spectrum the early years expect 
the oems that date have not been early leaders the 
development autonomous vehicle systems hardware 
specialists and design develop and build the cars 
themselves but purchase the software from outside suppliers 
those oems who have been autonomous vehicle leaders 
from the start are likely pursue full vertically integration 
soon possible our view 
the three oem business models 
the business models will quite different either end 
course the fully integrated oems will have massive upfront 
fixed costs for but will also likely have the strongest 
brands margins and roic given the value the automobile 
that they control the hardware specialist business model 
will likely come down cost model determined how 
cheaply car can designed and built while keeping 
capacity utilization the highest possible levels order 
generate adequate returns after outsourcing the value 
the car from external entities this likely business 
model for brands that are not strong operate mostly 
emerging markets the fully outsourced business model 
would basically brand licensing model where oem 
with strong brand and design capabilities would choose 
extremely asset light model which can relatively easily 
monetized even with outsourcing everything 
suppliers when first started thinking about autonomous 
vehicles had expected that the oems and companies 
outside the traditional auto industry like google would 
most successful and the existing auto suppliers would the 
most severely challenged this was driven our view 
shift the value generated the different components the 
car today and the relative exposure the suppliers today 
while remain convinced the shift value will occur 
our conclusion about winners and losers could not 
more different than our initial view see autonomous 
vehicles being highly beneficial auto suppliers and 
believe certain suppliers will see tremendous value creation 
from being early leaders the space these suppliers are 
likely enjoy extremely close relationship with the oems 
and will involved the design and development

especially true the supplier conglomerate that also

growth such fuel economy electrification active safety 
and comfort convenience the latter two being closely tied 
autonomous vehicle capability

advantage the new outsourcing business model 
entering the automobile will seen game changing 
event for the companies that are from outside the industry 
both good and bad ways the positive perspective that the 
automobile the most expensive item purchased 
individual after his home and the place where spends the 
most free time after his home the automobile also the last 
place that neither traditional nor new media have significantly 
penetrated still hear protests from some people about the 
death the car radio internet radio takes hold

the downside that the global auto industry one the

auto industry closed open approach 
closed systems launch new industries but open systems 
eventually lower costs and gain more market share albeit 
lower profitability levels 
the traditional auto industry fiercely protective its 
technologies patents engineering and production 
techniques while cooperation between oems currently 
exists relatively limited rarely successful and comes 
either the form one oem buying complete powertrain 
vehicle platform from another joint technology 
development from scratch and ford six and ninespeed transmissions for example neither sort 
cooperation applies the case true open source there 
are rare cases open source today auto industry from 
independent design studios good example legendary 
designer gordon murray and city cars 
some the most successful technology innovation cycles 
occur when single person company has full control all 
aspects product development hardware and software 
order best complete the vision refer this the 
closed approach which common the early stages new 
product cycles apple and aol are some the most wellknown examples closed approach during the early stages 
the personal computer desktop internet and mobile 
internet cycles however the initial vision materializes 
standards are set that typically lead lower cost and broader 
adoption microsoft proved this with windows and google 
beginning prove with android smartphones and tablets 
however closed system participants not necessarily lose 
value later stages they simply grow slower rates 
because they demand higher prices 
the closed approach often required the early stages 
new product category given the lack standards and 
uncertain market adoption that may require constant changes 
the product the closed approach limits market share but 
allows for premium pricing and higher profitability apple 
the closed approach typically yields better user experience 
but reduced economies scale building each component 
internally raises costs 
with the emergence autonomous vehicles however the 
auto industry may have start embracing open source 
world this would particularly true certain suppliers adopt 
business model offering their autonomous vehicle 
systems for free exchange for supplying the hardware 
controlling car content eventually the hardware car 
becomes commoditized that most the car value comes 
from the software even the hardware could become open 
source especially emerging markets the end the day 
however there relatively low limit how open source 
vehicle can given the unacceptably high risk failure and

auto oems 
the biggest impact within the auto industry from the move 
autonomous cars arguably going the oems the 
oems that have the most reliable and feature rich 
autonomous capabilities their cars are likely the ones 
that succeed while the ones that not will either forced 
out business will have reinvent their business models 
hardware only assemblers while buying the 
autonomous systems from other oems suppliers third party 
players believe this could really existential for the 
oems least once get world where autonomous 
capability widespread that non autonomous cars are 
longer allowed roads 
getting head start critical have outlined earlier 
this blue paper the technology enable full autonomous 
driving capability not really hurdle apart from bringing 
somewhat down the cost curve however there 
significant amount development work still needed 
particularly the areas reliability and scenario testing this 
something that can only gained with experience 
namely racking millions test miles prototypes 
controlled test and real world scenarios this could take 
several years complete and there short cut this 
this setup getting head start the testing and 
development critical while may tempting wait until the 
path forward little clearer few years believe that 
late entrant into the space will find playing catch either 
very expensive nearly impossible they are caught 
development years behind some competitors true that 
the oems may reluctant repeat their recent experience 
the electric vehicle arms race when gas prices were rising 
sharply before the economic downturn only reward the 
oems with weak demand little technological progress and 
underutilized battery capacity recent years however 
believe autonomous vehicles arguably have clearer path 
ahead than evs making them smaller leap faith 
the early movers will likely the most successful 
fortunately the race the early leader the oem race 
intense almost every major oem has least expressed 
interest the field autonomous vehicles not committed 
significant resources behind the project 
the german luxury oems are typically amongst the leaders 
innovation when comes most major technologies that 
have debuted the auto industry least the past 
years autonomous vehicles are different audi mercedes 
benz and bmw each have running prototypes 
autonomous vehicles the road with firm plans targets 
commercial roll out all three have been leaders 
implementation active safety the precursor autonomous 
driving over the past several years and the rest the 
industry the process catching the meantime the 
german oems have their sights set full autonomous 
capability 
audi was one the first oems obtain license for 
autonomous vehicle for its driverless prototype the state 
nevada its pikes peak prototype tackled the grueling 
and incredibly treacherous pikes peak hill climb challenge 
without driver the wheel audi parent volkswagen 
recent autonomous vehicle initiatives back even further 
the winner the darpa challenge was stanley 
touareg retrofitted with driverless capability collaboration 
with stanford university 
mercedes benz however will become the first oem 
commercialize semi autonomous driving its class will 
able autonomously navigate slow speed traffic jam 
situations well high speed highway cruising 
mph mercedes benz also recently demonstrated its 
completely autonomous intelligent drive vehicle which 
covered the mile journey between mannheim and 
pforzheim germany replicating the route driven the 
first automobile made karl benz years ago note 
that almost all the hardware used the intelligent drive 
already production based 
bmw demonstrated its connecteddrive connect cdc 
system series and engineers have racked 
several thousand test miles autonomous cars already 
while bmw says that the technology about years 
away from commercial production continues work with 
suppliers like continental further develop the system 
volvo trying make sure that the early lead the 
autonomous car field not exclusively german the 
upcoming expected come equipped with

general motors autonomous car history goes back several 
decades with some the earliest self driving prototypes 
developed the has not fallen behind the 
germans since then either cadillac will debut its super 
cruise feature around which can drive highway 
speeds and take corners this ability would make one the 
most advanced early autonomous systems the road 
ford was the first mass oem offer hands free parking its 
cars early five years ago since then has taken 
somewhat back seat speak the development 
fully autonomous cars compared some peers least 
the public domain however early october ford 
demonstrated self parking and obstacle avoidance 
technologies new prototypes earlier this year ford 
chairman bill ford stated conference that self driving 
cars will soon become reality 
toyota was the first oem commercialize hands free 
parking back with the lexus and continues down 
that path with small fleet autonomous prototypes 
including lexus and october toyota 
announced had developed advanced next gen driving 
support system for highway including car only highway 
driving that uses automated driving technologies the system 
called automated highway driving assist ahda ahda 
goes beyond technology currently the market such 
adaptive cruise control based cameras and 
millimeter radar provide advanced technology package 
that supports drivers for instance wirelessly 
communicating with vehicles traveling ahead plans

nissan much like did with its strategy appears have 
the most concrete and aggressive autonomous vehicle rollout 
plan despite being off relatively slow start nissan not 
only has prototype autonomous nissan leaf the 
road but has also announced target deliver the first 
commercially viable self driving system across 
several models its lineup and realistic price while 
the details what exactly this means are unclear nissan 
one the only oems set clear timetable for commercial 
introduction autonomous vehicles

hybrid the its world congress october the car utilizes 
honda unique technology developed its humanoid robot

been adapted vehicles tracks the movements 
pedestrians judges whether they are attempting cross 
the road not and provides feedback the driver and also

while these oems appear the early movers the 
autonomous vehicle space several others including fiat 
psa the small japanese oems and other emerging market 
oems continue either adopt wait and watch attitude 
not have this their radars for the time being there 
currently are about major global oems china and about 
another china with the leap autonomous 
technology looming over the next decade are not sure 
everyone can and should make 
the end comes down balance sheets and priorities 
oems that are dealing with severe macro declines their 
home markets and are barely able keep their regular 
product line profitable appear unlikely able invest 
significant resources what still regarded many circles 
fantasy especially when there are many other calls 
their cash including investing fuel efficiency safety and 
infotainment technology developing common platforms and 
growth concluded prior blue paper global 
auto scenarios the oems with the biggest balance 
sheets are likely the long term success stories while the 
smallest ones are likely face existential threats over time 
our view the haves and have nots will evolve such that 
the early start and the heavy investment made the haves 
will lead them eventually become experience makers and 
licensees their autonomous technologies

the have nots the other hand could either away 
become hardware specialists assemblers who license the 
autonomous system from other oems suppliers 
auto suppliers 
see suppliers fulfilling two roles within the autonomous 
vehicle space 
being tier supplier working with the oems their 
autonomous systems providing technology software and 
expertise 
independently developing their own autonomous vehicle 
systems license oems who are lagging behind the 
leaders and need bring the technology market quickly 
irrespective the role the diversified electronics and active 
safety suppliers have the best chance being the long term 
winners here companies that are already well down the path 
developing fully autonomous driver assistance systems 
conjunction with the oems include delphi continental trw 
denso and autoliv these companies are active safety 
suppliers who already make the cameras radar sensors and 
mechatronic units which will enable the autonomous car 
see and drive itself the suppliers who also 
infotainment telematics connectivity addition active safety 
delphi continental denso have additional leg with 
being able develop the hmi and content delivery systems 
continental has perhaps been the most vocal supplier when 
comes autonomous cars the company booth the 
frankfurt auto show was centered around the concept 
and continental announced partnerships with google and 
ibm for further development this not new venture for 
continental also has partnership with bmw get 
autonomous vehicles the road continental has 
also put interim stakes the ground with goal having 
partially automated cars the road and highly 
automated cars continental also has license 
operate its autonomous vehicle the state nevada 
delphi automotive plc has also devoted considerable 
resources relatively speaking the autonomous car project 
has been working with google its fleet self driving 
priuses believe delphi can benefit from its strong 
presence both the active safety and infotainment spaces 
together with its software expertise 
autoliv leader the passive and active safety space 
today along with trw progressive move into 
autonomous capability logical step for them while alv 
still approaching the technology from safety perspective 
increase the capability active safety enough remove the 
driver from the equation potentially and its main focus 
the owner the domain controller within the car remains 
seen whether alv will move out the safety domain into 
adjacent areas like infotainment and hmi which needs 
become end end autonomous vehicle system supplier 
that can license system box oem 
trw another safety leader that keenly interested 
autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems das 
trw working with mobileye private company that 
specializes vision assisted das 
sensata technologies holding leader automotive 
sensors though unclear what role they will play 
autonomous world while there likely meaningful 
increase the number sensors autonomous car 
most the incremental sensors are likely for active 
safety hmi applications which sensata does not 
participate sensata specialty the 
engine transmission powertrain area which could see modest 
incremental content increase but unlikely see big lift 
from the move autonomous vehicles 
non traditional supplies the autonomous vehicle 
opportunity also allows players who have not traditionally 
been part the autos space have look while google 
probably the most well known external player here others 
potentially include cisco systems ibm intel and others from 
the world well as for probably the first time several 
decades within the auto industry start ups these 
companies are effectively the path becoming tier 
automotive suppliers with focus electronic systems and 
software that will drive autonomous capability 
these external entities are not going have easy the 
traditional auto industry historically has been tightly knit and 
highly skeptical outsiders believing that automotive grade 
very difficult standard achieve indeed our discussions 
with various members the traditional auto industry about 
the role external entities play have the future 
encountered enormous degree skepticism dismissal 
and even hostility directed toward their ambitions however 
not believe automotive grade insurmountable 
moat around the industry 
likely true that the external entities cannot alone 
they will most likely have work with the traditional oems 
and suppliers find their way around the automobile

analyzing driving data from sensors and the like and 
determining how control the actual vehicle automakers 
essentially have the knowhow here many suppliers supply 
ecus that control individual systems such brakes airbags 
steering but only the major tier suppliers offer ecus that 
integrate control multiple systems that enable for instance 
safe driving and even within this group companies need 
software development capabilities build the architecture 
that links the systems together 
denso has the development and technological capabilities 
including software circuit design capabilities build 
integrated ecus that link navigation engine control brake 
control transmission steering and other systems 
september denso revealed that aims carve out

stronger cpv margins and eventually higher stock multiples 
the other hand with the hardware components the car 
decreasing relevance the non secular suppliers who not 
serve the growth areas efficiency safety and 
comfort convenience could the other direction and see

capability renders their parts virtually obsolete some these 
areas could body panels frames drivetrain axles 
exhaust lighting some interior components glass tires etc 
also note that the barriers entry the supplier space 
are high map databases tech hardware and software

how does the auto industry view google

future than just software based approach today 
ravi shanker 
the traditional auto industry views google efforts with mix 
suspicion and enthusiasm the one hand having company like 
google and its track record innovation enter the auto world could 
shot the arm for one the most mature and cyclical industries the 
world oems might also eager partner with google and potentially 
use its experience with the autonomous car systems the other hand 
google chooses make its own way the industry partner with 
outsider like tesla the entrenched oems could facing formidable 
new competitor 
the traditional auto industry watching google very 
closely the high level interest driven number 
factors google early lead with its autonomous vehicle 
initiative which probably forced number automakers 
follow suit interest what exactly google plans are and 
whether google can disrupt the automobile oem space 
much tesla has done with electric vehicles and the 
hope partnering with google use its expertise 
experience and especially its map database street view 
make mistake the traditional auto industry means 
dismissing google autonomous vehicle efforts misguided 
doomed and instead tracking them real competitor 
even there some skepticism whether google will 
ever actually become oem 
can google ever make its own car may not crazy 
sounds google pursuing the development its 
autonomous driving system with enthusiasm and 
determination while the perceived social benefits may 
helping the project down its path believe the auto industry 
firmly believes that the greater good not google only 
end game here one the possible outcomes this 
endeavor could google entering the auto business 
making its own cars surprising that might sound 
have spoken with top executives auto oems who not 
dismiss the idea out hand 
while have seen evidence that google intends 
become automobile oem there are few factors that may 
make easier for 
the growing importance software that 
discussed earlier would mean that google were 
use its own proprietary autonomous driving and 
operating system for the car would control 
discussed earlier the actual hardware the 
car could become more cost driven assembly 
business that can outsourced google need not 
build single car plant but instead could have its 
cars built third party assemblers similar the 
model taxi mentioned the previous page 
could enter into partnerships with certain oems with 
excess capacity and design abilities which there 
are least few europe today 
the tesla factor google and tesla appear have 
very close working relationship given their common 
silicon valley roots and already have connection 
the mapping infotainment side tesla ceo elon 
musk has spoken his intention have autopilot 
functionality future teslas and has engaged 
discussions with google over the idea may not 
farfetched expect google and tesla team 
car design and manufacturing 
still even though easier and more logical than ever for 
company like google enter the car making business 
not think this likely near medium term project 
it like android for cars believe the auto industry may 
more accepting near term solution that sees google 
license its autonomous driving system for other carmakers 
use similar android for smartphones envision google 
issuing guidance for the autonomous capable hardware and 
design necessary for the oems incorporate into their cars 
before the google driving system plug and played 
similar android this system could potentially free for 
automakers use though unlikely open source 
given the security concerns 
return for its system the oem may give google exclusive 
access the data into and from its cars this sensitive 
area today and most oems control the data that generated 
the cars they manufacture even supplier 
component that generates however return for not having 
spend billions dollars and many years autonomous 
vehicle development especially oem already behind 
its peers this area the oem could potentially give google 
data exclusivity with the car have discussed earlier 
this likely move two directions into the car where 
google may control supply the content that consumed 
the occupants during travel out the car where google

autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
anonymously given data about driving patterns and 
characteristics for its own use this dual stream data could 
open third revenue front for google addition pcs and 
smartphones 
this still entirely theoretical course the last thing 
that company the size caliber and profitability google 
may want enter the traditional auto industry 
industry still challenged extreme cyclicality global 
overcapacity fragmentation and questionable pricing power 
but that does not mean that google cannot bring entirely 
new approach especially the automobile undergoes one 
its most fundamental transformations its history long 
google fleet self driving priuses keeps plying the

the morgan stanley freight team believes that autonomous and 
semi autonomous driving technology will adopted far faster 
the cargo markets than passenger markets long haul freight 
delivery one the most obvious and compelling areas for the 
application autonomous and semi autonomous driving technology 
conservatively estimate the potential savings the freight 
transportation industry annually the savings are expected 
come from labor fuel efficiency productivity 
and accident savings before including any estimates from nontruck freight modes like air and rail 
collateral implications include competitive advantage large well 
capitalized fleets and improved customer service 
while the focus this blue paper primarily passenger 
vehicles the morgan stanley freight team believes that 
autonomous and semi autonomous driving technology will 
adopted far faster the cargo markets than passenger 
markets humans are far more comfortable with autonomous 
technology operating vehicles circumstances when human 
life not risk when risk human life introduced into 
the equation the bar safety rises exponentially while 
freight losses are rightfully viewed costly but acceptable 
within reason this helps explain why autonomous driving 
technology has already been applied and operation 
select non passenger environments such dump trucks 
australia mines military truck convoys war zones drone 
military aircraft and automated warehousing operations 
understand the excitement about the idea that everyone 
will have their own autonomous chauffeur some day but 
believe that freight companies are far more likely embrace 
refine and apply autonomous technology ways that will 
lead the passenger market where freight and passenger 
traffic interact safety hurdles will remain high this could 
limit the speed with which autonomous driving technology 
can applied class trucks interstate highways 
for example would argue that broad and complete 
adoption self driving freight trucks cannot occur 
passenger vehicles remain manually driven but there 
scope for semi autonomous technology and outside the 
mixed use environment would expect cargo companies 
move fast regulators allow the technology 
adopted 
long haul freight delivery one the most obvious 
and compelling areas for the application autonomous 
and semi autonomous driving technology our colleagues 
discuss elsewhere this report local and urban driving 
environments are particularly challenging for software 
engineers due the difficulties predicting the 
unpredictable behavior human drivers who occasionally 
choose violate basic traffic rules like running red light 
the way the emergency room the interstate highway 
system the other hand generally has fewer unpredictable 
outcomes 
believe that such environment could see the 
introduction semi autonomous rigs and potentially broad 
adoption the technology within years using 
technology that exists today truck operators could tether 
rigs together and move convoy fashion over long 
distances initially these convoys would involve lead 
human driver driving team followed close formation 
any number trailing rigs which are self driven follow the 
lead truck and are tethered through the technology call 
this semi autonomous still requires human lead 
manual driver team the convoy works well the 
monotonous environment long haul interstate driving 
and eliminates much the infrastructure needs addressed 
earlier this report the convoy self driving 
communication would self contained upon exiting the 
highway entry into congested urban interstate area 
human drivers would likely need reintroduced but the 
savings labor fuel and safety costs from this semiautonomous technology would significant for truck 
operators 
assessing the potential savings conservatively 
billion annually 
the discussion below intended mainly thought 
exercise rather than definitive analysis all the savings 
and investments required implement autonomous driving 
technology the freight markets the savings estimate 
are likely incomplete and reflect the utopian scenario 
which autonomous driving technology fully embraced and 
implemented the trucking environment and does not 
consider savings the technology were applied air rail 
interim steps that involve semi autonomous driving can also 
have significant albeit smaller savings than the utopian 
scenario

labor savings billion not simple eliminating 
the driver passenger vehicles transport the driver 
passenger his destination freight vehicles however 
require driver move the freight but carriers view the 
driver cost one that must eventually returned home 
base result most investors may believe that the 
concept autonomous freight vehicles certain way 
reduce eliminate labor costs which are the largest cost 
bucket for any freight carrier however based our 
discussions with industry veterans and technology experts 
don believe that the labor component fully eliminated 
while the number drivers required autonomous 
driving environment would drastically reduced labor will 
not entirely eliminated from carrier operations there will 
still need for programmers route planners maintenance 
experts fleet managers and most cases some human 
oversight the freight shipments the early years the 
technology these additional labor costs may run high 
moreover the cost introduce autonomous semiautonomous driving technology will exceedingly high 
some estimates put the cost per truck above the 
initial purchase price 
the real savings for carriers will come from fleet productivity 
the savings generated shifting hours per day days 
per week schedule for costly freight assets compelling 
gone are the concerns about new hours service rules 
which mandate rest periods for drivers carriers will 
longer need plan routes that eventually return truck and 
the driver home given that the long haul trucking 
industry faces driver turn over rates that often exceed 
annually there are also significant savings found from 
reducing recruitment costs 
given all the above labor savings are tricky estimate 
moreover unclear whether labor unions would have 
enough political clout block delay the introduction 
autonomous truck technology some jurisdictions over time 
not believe unions will able prevent adoption 
this technology but certainly possible that they could 
morgan stanley research

autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
delay for our purposes assume labor and regulatory 
issues are not impediments adoption the technology 
according the american trucking association ata the 
has approximately million professional truck drivers 
estimate that the average truck driver earns roughly 
annual compensation and benefits implying total 
industry driver labor cost billion 
unlike our colleagues estimates for the utopian vision where 
one drives expect that some driver role will still 
required even all vehicles were driverless there are many 
reasons some monitoring role for driver won fully 
eliminated consider just few the issues first what 
happens the vehicle breaks down flat tire engine issue 
etc the vehicle miles from the nearest maintenance 
facility that still long way bring maintenance engineer 
solution have driver monitor the road convoy and 
there are issues with any the vehicles there 
address the spot and call for support needed 
another issue consider security some trucks haul 
extremely valuable inventory trailer full ipads 
entrepreneurial thieves determined which trailers contain 
valuable inventory they could arrange hijack the vehicle 
and abscond with the inventory before any security could 
arrive for this reason believe that residual driver pool 
will remain which means scheduling and recruiting 
challenges will not fully eliminated 
mundane items like bathroom breaks rest periods meals and 
deadheading will all still required even vehicles are fully 
automated moreover some form slip seating scheduling 
would need introduced slip seating scheduling has 
drivers share trucks that the truck asset can realize 
improved operating utilization most truck drivers today 
strongly prefer use only one truck their truck for driving 
exhibit 
autonomous truck 
source new energy and industrial development organization japan 
strongly prefer use only one truck their truck for driving 
under automated driving regime technician drivers would 
need share the operating vehicle with other drivers again 
much like pilots share planes any case our best guess 
that fully automated driving regime could result twothirds reduction the current driver pool this would imply 
that the trucking industry could still save billion annual 
driver costs but there are other offsets consider 
for example the driver may need proficient the 
technology which could require higher education level 
well technical certifications much like pilot these 
certifications would restrict entry into the profession and would 
certainly result higher wages for the remaining pool 
driving technicians addition entirely possible that this 
higher level training eventually lead some form 
unionization the current long haul driver pool not 
thoroughly unionized given the large number owneroperators and the high turnover drivers unionization 
technician drivers could significantly increase the average 
cost per employee fact the carriers may look allowing 
unions play some role the new environment 
acceptable cost for unions agreement not use political and 
legal maneuvers delay and fight the technology 
implementation lastly there may other highly paid 
professional positions programmers route planners etc 
that are required manage these new high tech autonomous 
fleets 
given all the offsets simplistically assume that fulladoption scenario average driver wages increase 
implying annual labor cost billion resulting 
still impressive reduction total driver labor costs 
fuel efficiency gains could large billion 
according the ata there are more than million trucks 
all classes the truck fleet this approximately 
million are class tractor trailer trucks the ata estimated 
that the truck fleet drove billion miles 
miles per unit class trucks are estimated drive 
billion miles annually miles per unit the ata 
estimates that the trucking industry consumed billion 
gallons diesel fuel and spent billion fuel 
that year although these trucks are variety sizes and 
perform various roles the freight economy the implied fuel 
economy the truck fleet gallons per mile 
should note that ton mile per gallon actually better way 
measure freight fuel economy due the concept trip 
avoidance when using larger vehicles but remain 
consistent with the passenger vehicle section used miles 
per gallon

autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
believe that autonomous semi autonomous driving 
technology can vastly improve the fuel economy the 
truck fleet like passenger vehicles autonomous freight 
vehicles would operate primarily cruise control mode 
which under current technology can improve vehicle efficiency 
significantly moreover freight vehicles could move 
convoy format running large vehicles close formation 
tailgating carrier could effectively create train rigs 
the highway which results slipstream lower air 
resistance thereby improving fuel efficiency recent tests 
driverless trucks convoy format japan saw fuel efficiency 
gains the range which would imply billion 
annual fuel cost savings today dollars the 
department energy estimates that road train convoys 
are common australia can improve ton mile fuel efficiency 
over for our purposes assume 
improvement efficiency annual savings which 
far lower than what our colleagues believe possible the 
passenger vehicle market but should note that our 
estimate fails capture fuel savings from short haul truck 
moves such parcel delivery local pick and delivery 
vehicles and many other shorter moves such the fuel 
savings freight could substantially larger 
productivity gains come many forms savings difficult 
estimate but should billion minimum the 
productivity gains from the adoption autonomous driving 
technology could great but are also difficult estimate 
according study texas university congestion 
cost the trucking industry billion presumably 
this cost would virtually eliminated the broad adoption 
autonomous vehicles 
but there are other aspects consider long haul trucks 
could literally operate though the nature freight 
movements means that there will likely still significant 
downtime for trucks noted above the ata estimates that 
the class long haul truck fleet logged billion 
miles miles per truck assuming that the 
trucks operated days per year this implies miles per 
day per truck this average clearly understates the 
productivity dedicated long haul trucks that can log well 
over miles year though may overstate the mileage 
driven class trucks local pick and delivery 
operations the average also captures time when trucks are 
waiting pick drop off freight sitting congested 
highway refueling shop for maintenance etc although 
autonomous technology may help alleviate some highway 
congestion once full adopted refueling time spent waiting 
customer and maintenance time are clearly unavoidable 
for this reason most industry experts autonomous 
technology estimate that autonomous trucks would increase 
capacity congestion alleviated the shift 
autonomous vehicles the capacity increase could greater 
but start agree with the estimate 
even increase truck productivity would very 
significant according class truck 
sales were roughly and the average price new 
rig this implies that the industry spent 
billion capital new trucks addition the industry 
purchases trailers year each 
billion total spend increase truck productivity 
implies that the industry would need far fewer trucks haul 
the same freight but this too simplistic increasing trucking 
operations means each truck drives more miles each year 
more wear and tear truck age more function 
mileage than the passage time and miles most 
long haul trucks are reaching maximum age 
autonomous driving technology would certainly improve asset 
turns but would mean that the useful life truck would 
fall when measured years 
additionally the cost the trucks will materially 
higher some technology experts estimate that the cost 
installing the technology truck would add the 
cost addition the cost for manually driven 
truck while these estimates are surely fall over time 
the technology becomes more commercial this still 
significant investment for any carrier even the cost per 
autonomous truck drops one third the technology 
commercialized the implied cost replace the 
current fleet assuming productivity gain would 
still billion million trucks per 
unit obviously the transition wholly autonomous truck 
fleet would take years after the technology tested 
approved and commercialized but given the labor fuel and 
productivity savings the pay back from such significant 
investment would still impressive 
and that leads interesting ancillary conclusion 
worth mentioning according the ata there are over 
trucking companies the over which 
have fewer than trucks clearly for these small truckers 
capital expenditure three times high new class truck 
and many small carriers buy used trucks substantial 
discounts just prohibitive believe that this would give 
the large well capitalized carriers are significant opportunity 
create major barrier entry their business for the first 
time the history the industry large carrier that 
transitioned quickly autonomous fleet would generate 
significant labor fuel safety and maintenance savings 
morgan stanley research 
november 
autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
well huge gains fleet productivity this cost advantage 
would allow the carrier enjoy outsized and sustained 
market share gains moreover managing the technology and 
very large fleet trucks would take professional 
management and commitment and investment which 
would likely play into the strengths the larger wellcapitalized truckers such knight transportation swift 
transportation and werner enterprises just name few 
examples other words automated driving technology could 
theoretically turn the current long haul truckload business into 
more networked model resulting significant scale 
advantages and barriers entry 
large transport companies like ups and fedex have long 
eschewed the long haul truckload market given the difficult 
industry competitive dynamics autonomous technology would 
significant savings for them well given their very large 
fleet trucks and package delivery cars this could lead 
new business line for them well long haul trucking 
lastly it worth considering whether autonomous 
driving technology would improve customer service 
believe that autonomous driving adopted masse would 
lead far less road congestion relative today thus 
follows that truck carriers would improve time pick and 
delivery performance which could lead share shift back 
truck from other modes 
accident savings billion the dot 
reported that people were killed large truck crashes 
capping long period improving truck safety statistics 
march the federal motor carrier safety administration 
published study which estimated that the average cost 
reported crashes involving large trucks gross weight 
exceeding pounds dollars the 
latest date found and total cost billion the cost 
per fatal truck crash was estimated million per 
incident according the authors the costs indicated above 
represented the present value computed percent 
discount rate all costs over the victims expected life span 
that result from crash they include medically related costs 
emergency services costs property damage costs lost 
productivity and the monetized value the pain suffering 
and quality life that the family loses because death 
injury the cost estimates exclude mental health care costs 
for crash victims roadside furniture repair costs cargo delays 
earnings lost family and friends caring for the injured and 
the value schoolwork lost 
similar passenger vehicles most truck crashes involve 
some element human error using similar estimate our 
passenger vehicle colleagues namely that accidents 
are due human error autonomous truck and car 
technology could save billion annually when reach 
full adoption 
what about other modes autonomous technology has 
already been applied rail and air environments one 
example driverless train new york city jfk airtrain 
which are fully automated and operate without conductor 
aviation military drones have been widely publicized 
given the heavy regulatory overlay rail and air government 
regulators will play major role gatekeeper 
autonomous driving technology and the speed with which 
can adopted the other modes fail adopt the 
technology but trucking does seems certain that the other 
modes would over time cede market share back truck 
such fully expect that some close loop networks can 
quickly adopt the technology regulators allow the potential 
opportunities and savings from driverless trains and pilot less 
planes are similarly large carriers those industries but 
estimating the savings goes beyond the scope this blue

software from design today integrating sensors tomorrow 
adam wood 
keith weiss 
the move toward autonomous cars present three opportunities for 
software vendors 
oem design 
standardization software content within autos 
management and analysis large data sets generated 
increasing sensor count cars 
software has emerged key competitive dynamic 
hardware manufacturers seek differentiate their offerings 
see evidence this trend many verticals including 
automotive today the move towards autonomous cars would 
likely compound this effect 
see three principal areas opportunity for software 
vendors around the autonomous car trend near term 
automotive firms are dealing with the increasing complexity 
adding software functionality their design processes 
longer term see opportunities around firms 
standardizing today largely custom built automotive software 
environment packaged platforms application sets and 
leveraging the large amounts data likely generated 
increasing sensor counts vehicles 
dealing with software complexity 
software today has already become very important 
automobile manufacturers even without considering the 
potential from autonomous vehicles the increasing amounts 
software embedded products add huge complexity for 
manufacturers even before discuss the challenges the 
autonomous car see this increasing software mix 
providing large opportunity for certain software companies 
indeed companies such bmw and jaguar land rover 
half the engineers are already dedicated software and 
systems and the rest traditional mechanical design the 
challenge for manufacturers today that most this software 
custom developed and manually installed see 
significant opportunity for software companies help 
automate and standardize the software development 
processes already place automakers clearly this 
opportunity would likely expand significantly the industry 
moves towards autonomous cars 
what being done today traditional design software 
companies like dassault syst mes and ptc are already 
moving into the automotive software development market 
their design software has traditionally been used design 
the mechanical parts cars and the body white these 
vendors have also developed and acquired technologies 
help oem customers develop and test software and systems 
along with the mechanical design their products aid 
manufacturers with specifications software and systems 
architecture and the connections between the electronics 
software and control systems and the mechanical parts 
for example dassault syst mes offers catia systems 
which covers system architecture and engineering the 
technology partly internally developed and partly 
combination with the autosar embedded software tool 
developed recently acquired geensoft autosar 
already standard the german automotive industry 
has seen its penetration leading automotive oems increase 
due the catia systems offering which 
acknowledges probably covers only half the functionality 
required oems today this leaves significant market 
opportunity still come for the company 
ptc also has software and systems offering that post its 
acquisition mks includes the integrity software 
development alm application life cycle management suite 
now branded ptc integrity ptc also highlights the 
already significant software complexity many products and 
the risk failure that software bugs can bring what were 
purely mechanical products years ago the company 
also believes that compliance will increasingly 
significant driver the space and should benefit from greater 
regulatory focus 
what opportunity does the autonomous vehicle offer 
consider the autonomous car looking moving 
set goal posts the software component cars should 
increase materially from current levels 
how they succeed believe that among the design 
software companies and ptc stand benefit most 
the oems and suppliers that try develop the technology 
for autonomous cars and end dominating the market 
course highly likely that the oems and their suppliers will 
try build the systems needed for autonomous cars and 
the technology providers like and ptc likely face period 
during which these products grow quickly irrespective the 
end outcome the battle for control the autonomous car 
morgan stanley research 
november 
autonomous cars self driving the new auto industry paradigm 
also believe operating system integration will 
significant challenge technology providers such 
which already have experience the much more automated 
aerospace industry may have advantage helping auto 
oems design these systems 
standardizing and connecting custom software 
world 
the move from custom development toward the use more 
packaged infrastructure and application components may 
represent expanding opportunity for packaged software 
vendors 
this playbook we seen many markets before 
requirements and standards quickly evolve firms requiring 
new software functionality remain largely focused custom 
development the short mid term you are seeing today 
within the car industry the market matures vendors 
are less able drive differentiation from larger parts their 
software functionality the costs maintaining custom code 
rises and the need for interoperability with other 
functionalities and platforms drives software increasingly 
toward standards for instance today most vendors are 
developing their own dash infotainment systems over time 
would not surprised see use standard platform 
underpinning these systems analogous mobile phone 
operating systems like android 
within our software coverage group several vendors 
might benefit from this standardization trend microsoft 
and oracle both offer platforms for embedding software 
functionality non general purpose compute devices 
windows platform from microsoft and the java 
platform from oracle we seen with the sync initiative 
where microsoft built out broader infotainment platform now 
used many ford fiat nissan and kia models vertical 
market functionality can achieved addition the open 
source linux operating system underpins large proportion 
custom software work today 
the medium term may see automotive firms look 
supported security hardened linux distribution like that 
offered red hat recent collaboration between red hat 
and meteorcomm shows what that type standardization 
may look like the two vendors deployed interoperable 
positive train control communication systems for the railroad 
industry based red hat linux and messaging 
technologies 
these changes might seen challenge the providers 
tools that support more custom developed approach 
response that make two points very unlikely 
our view that any one vendor will able dominate all the 
electronics software and systems car even 
move from totally custom partly modular there will still 
need integrate the different modules with each other and 
with the mechanical parts the software vendors that help 
support system architecture and engineering may choose 
between continuing provide software support modules 
whether they could have role providing the module itself 
whether standalone partnership with others 
big data and the autonomous car 
with significant increase board computing power and 
the number sensors collecting data cars will generate 
even greater volume data over time this data likely 
utilized more connected way than today data 
collected and analyzed real time rather than service 
intervals 
the near term product lifecycle management plm 
software vendors like and ptc are already thinking about 
how this data could used for more proactive servicing 
vehicles part that has failed number cars could 
identified much earlier and then replaced the idea plm 
that the design teams could also learn from the experience 
cars the wild and incorporate live data performance 
into the design new vehicles analysis the data sets 
could also used predict potential failures and order 
preventive maintenance 
could also see this approach open new business 
models for the manufacturers recently have seen john 
deere add sensors its tractors and use analytics sap 
hana the data these sensors collect order help 
predict when problems will occur and add services 
maintenance business model their existing manufacturing 
model could imagine similar opportunity automotive 
longer term see big data analysis used lessen 
congestion the roads help drivers avoid hazardous 
conditions and more effectively find roadside amenities 
amongst other use cases the beneficiaries within software 
would companies involved providing the technology 
store analyze and use that data particularly real time 
the case store and analyze believe splunk tibco 
oracle sap teradata emc ptc not covered 
morgan stanley and dassault syst mes exalead appear 
well positioned they have the capabilities either ingest and
