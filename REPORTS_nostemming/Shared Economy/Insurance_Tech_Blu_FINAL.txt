this blue paper was prepared jointly morgan stanley research and 
boston consulting group bcg have collaborated globally 
involving the insurance and technology groups each organisation 
players that are slow implement new technology run the 
risk anti selection note that the worst quintile risks 
market can produce more losses than the best quintile 
deep dive the subject 
researching this report conducted interviews with senior 
executives insurers and technology providers globally addition 
commissioned proprietary global insurance consumer survey 
countries order gauge perceptions about technology 
overview 
believe that the insurance industry the brink major 
technology driven change this creates major opportunities for 
insurers that are looking embrace but poses significant 
risks for the laggards 
while some aspects technological change such better 
operating efficiency the need engage creatively with 
consumers digitally and increased disintermediation are 
common many industries others are specific insurance 
fundamentally insurance about the pricing and selection 
risk believe that the internet things iot and big data 
will change the type data that insurers use assess risk 
the way which information analysed and ultimately the 
size the actual risk pools

digital natives could threaten incumbents 
companies born the digital age can operate substantially 
lower cost due automation self service and efficient 
distribution models with substantially lower loss ratios driven 
better risk selection thanks new data sources claims 
management and loss prevention techniques 
business models with sufficient scale support the fixed 
costs building the infrastructure well marketing 
investment are proving highly competitive this shown 
the success geico the see case study pages 
risk pools are likely shift and shrink 
new risks are emerging for example cyber risk growing 
with the market set grow average per year 
according swiss potentially surpassing the size the 
aviation market within years 
encouragingly our research also shows that consumers are 
willing consider innovative products with younger and more 
affluent consumers showing the greatest propensity 
expect current technological trends drive profound 
shift risk pools 
insurance online experience lags behind 
today mobile key even more than the web and this 
requires engagement model specifically conceived for 
digital world believe that insurers are not yet there 
overall consumers are far less satisfied with their digital 
insurance experience than with other industries exhibit 
particularly when comes moments truth such 
paying claims consumers have significant unmet needs with 
many products perceived expensive and inflexible 
parallel see greater loss prevention especially 
traditional business lines which could lead sharp 
contraction non life premiums 
believe technology has the potential reduce risk pools 
materially have analysed the risk pools for the personal 
home and motor segments and tentatively calculated that they 
could shrink billion today terms this

equivalent global non life premiums excluding 
health similar argument can made think for 
commercial lines although have not quantified this 
those devices enable insurers collect new datasets gain 
much better understanding their customers and assess risk 
completely different way 
new digital models for consumer engagement well 
more flexible demand types insurance cover could also 
boost demand and accelerate penetration emerging 
markets 
however believe insurers will need orchestrate join 
ecosystems networks companies individuals and 
institutions that interact and provide services order 
promote supply installation and service those devices 
see exhibit they will also need ensure harmonious 
development insurance offers together with new 
applications and services link with those devices 
example this trend the partnership between state farm 
and adt for protected connected homes 
new entrants can cause disruption 
see risk that new entrants will disrupt existing 
equilibriums 
companies with strong customer relationships and hence 
deep knowledge their needs may able proactively 
identify and meet their specific insurance requirements 
rakuten the japanese online marketplace has moved into 
insurance acquiring underwriter and using its broad set 
consumer interactions platform identify sales leads 
and extensive source data 
such adjacent players operating industries with high 
degrees customer engagement are well positioned 
embed the insurance cover the product and services they 
sell 
ecosystems drive the need for partnerships 
cheap connected sensors have the potential transform the 
insurance offering motor home health insurance 
industrial settings 
technology companies are moving this direction build 
connected home offerings for example google has 
acquired smart home device maker nest labs and samsung 
recently purchased home automation company smartthings 
insurers need move quickly form partnerships there 
are finite number relevant potential partners 
the shift towards ecosystem based insurance also reinforces 
the risk adjacent entrants where non insurers with key 
consumer insights from their own core operations seek 
leverage that competitive advantage and offer their own 
insurance products

pace change should leave time adapt 
the pace change hard predict given that some the 
technology its infancy 
taking telematics motor insurance example while 
several pilots are progress globally the product has only 
made significant impact two discrete markets young 
drivers where premiums for traditional cover are very high 
and italy where claims fraud issue 
the core the digital transformation likely take time 
insurance largely stock business and replacing the 
portfolios will not quick 
facing these challenges insurers need focus 
consumer centricity insurers will need tailor their 
offers and services the real needs their customers 
for many this will entail radical shift their core 
processes such new product development customer 
contact and claims process design 
cutting across silos the new digital paradigm requires 
that silos between branches and functions broken 
partnerships insurers need identify sign suitable 
partners develop more immersive ecosystem offerings 
evolution digital technology needs systems 
operate different level consumer data must 
simply accessible operations need happen real 
time consequently systems have find way 
manage the evolution insurers core systems 
measured pace while enabling rapid absorption 
technological innovation short they need manage 
two speed it 
innovation adapting the digital world requires sound 
knowledge the technology offer ability develop 
test and pilot the right pace readiness fail 
entrepreneurial spirit and capacity all that without 
jeopardising the core business insurers will also have 
scan the horizon for new game changing technology that 
may too far ahead commercialise now but could 
have significant long term impact the industry 
data analytics new capabilities offered big data 
technologies need embedded within insurance and 
support most the underlying changes 
the frequency interaction low slowing down consumer 
push for change key disrupters have yet take the 
necessary steps toward targeting business that partially 
protected complex regulatory environment which often 
highly local nature 
which parts the industry will affected 
risk segments property casualty protection and health 
are likely see the greatest long run impact from technology 
believe the industry moves from actuarial risk 
assessment statistical techniques include new sources 
data big data techniques and new datasets from connected 
devices potentially real time risk observation and modelling 
savings business also likely significantly affected 
technology but similar way many other industries 
with digital channels driving greater price transparency and 
competing away frictional costs 
for consumer journeys our research shows high 
expectations for research purchase and claim experiences 
implications for insurance companies 
insurance companies face challenges several fronts 
their legacy systems are complex which limits 
insurers agility 
bias toward largely intermediated distribution and the 
technical nature products hinder shift towards greater 
consumer orientation 
complex insurers often siloed branch well longterm orientation within the industry tend have limited 
focus innovation 
many countries the economic environment creates 
significant pressure terms investment capability 
increasing the short term focus insurance companies 
implications for technology companies 
expect overall insurance technology spending grow 
modestly mid single digits with most insurers looking 
reallocate spend from legacy areas however technology 
vendors exposed priority spending areas should see 
double digit growth the main priority areas think will 
interaction distribution channels and analytics particularly 
contextualising data from telematics iot devices however 
believe insurers will also have invest core systems 
policy claims billings and middleware solutions wrapping 
the legacy systems they integrate with state the art 
capabilities benefit fully from the channels analytics spend 
expect spending here increase albeit not the same 
pace the key priority areas the technology landscape for 
insurers fragmented with many specialist products but 
established all encompassing solution that insurers are willing 
migrate completely today estimate the top 
providers have only market share today would 
expect some consolidation the market

insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
setting the scene 
the increasing pace technological change major challenge 
for insurers while the industry has some good examples adoption 
technology general has lagged other industries its response 
consumer expectations have changed much faster than the 
industry most cases expectations that stem from existing online and 
digital experiences other industries are not fulfilled insurers key 
insights from our global consumer survey carried out countries 
confirm that insurance consumers worldwide are ready for and expecting 
very different digital experience 
the insurance industry undergoing period unprecedented 
change other fronts too significant changes prudential regulation 
solvency the global bcr ics initiative conduct regulation 
prips and business models are occurring simultaneously 
this section provide some broader context for the challenges 
that are facing the industry 
consider three major challenges for the insurers 
evolving technology 
new consumer behaviour and expectations and 
changes regulation 
major technology changes 
series technology changes and adoptions having 
significant impact the insurance sector would group 
these changes around 
consumer channels see four main drivers change 
that challenge insurers consumer facing set 
internet adoption and broadening usage 
smartphone and mobile device penetration 
frequency and characteristics internet mobile usage 
increasing use and evolving role social media 
our interviews with insurers researching this report 
revealed that many are waking the fact that their 
consumers want engage with them very different ways 
from before consumers demand online experience and 
with internet penetration and usage increasing globally these 
demands will only increase 
however the web only part the equation when comes 
changing consumer interactions consumers are 
increasingly interacting with companies via mobile devices 
the banking sector for instance players now provide mobile 
app support most consumer needs consumers 
increasingly expect this from insurers say when changing 
address submitting claim fact some countries the 
market mobile first consumers skip fixed broadband 
and move straight mobile see exhibit insurers need 
find ways connect with consumers using this medium 
succeed the transition mobile insurers will need 
overcome structural challenge frequency interactions 
exhibit 
consumer channels many new technologies are 
evolving offering new options for consumer interaction 
iot big data analytics technologies open the door 
new ways assessing and managing risk and claims 
core systems requirements for new digital solutions are 
challenging legacy systems and new technologies are 
offering new options for system infrastructure

insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
average insurers have very low number interactions 
per consumer depending the geography the number 
yearly interactions varies between and 
however get consumers open and use web account 
download and use mobile application interaction 
frequency must significantly higher reaching multiple 
interactions per month insurance currently delivered 
through product lines does not require frequent consumer 
engagement say banking product which increases the 
risk that insurers are not top mind for consumers and 
consequently could squeezed others 
social media usage has increased dramatically consumers 
are using social networks more and more ways becomes 
place research purchases over time these sites may 
become place where the purchases are actually made 
and discuss consumers core needs and expectations 
their importance social media likely increase and 
evolve making essential that insurers develop clear 
strategy how manage them 
few figures illustrate the importance social media today 
the insurance industry our global insurance consumer survey 
shows that average respondents across 
countries have already shared recommendations insurers 
through social media have not yet but are likely 
the future 
similarly respondents already use friends and family 
posts social media very important source 
information for their insurance choice not yet but are 
likely the future social media usage tends 
higher asia and lower europe for example 
respondents shared recommendations through social media 
india and china versus the and 
germany 
insurers are aware this trend demonstrated their 
level activity social media each the top insurers 
the and has official account facebook 
twitter twitter accounts are more prevalent the 
insurers have one but just have facebook account 
however few insurers have demonstrated that they have 
social media management strategy that engages consumers 
through making active contribution 
iot big data analytics see two opportunities for 
insurers 
iot and connected sensors could revolutionise how car 
insurance telematics home insurance and even life 
insurance are sold and serviced 
big data analytics there has been revolution how 
companies can analyse data that combined with the 
new datasets from connected devices and potentially 
even from social media should enable insurers price 
risk better and different ways 
exhibit 
there huge opportunity social media sites 
given the rapid growth users since 
internet users each age group who use social networking sites over time 
iot could have profound impact the insurance market 
expect significant growth devices shown exhibit 
using data from sensors for risk avoidance 
the multiplication connected devices opens the door for 
new ways selling and servicing insurance products 
telematics car insurance obvious use case here 
however there are other examples using intelligent 
sensors reduce insurance risk

september discusses the impact big data for 
technology providers further detail 
while acknowledge these changes can sometimes take 
longer than might expect from the initial hype equally 
believe technology adoption will accelerate over time 
show exhibit 
changes core systems 
are also seeing change the core systems used 
policy administration claims management and billings and 
payments change here likely the way onpremise modernisation but software service saas and 
cloud infrastructure could also play role 
digital trends are putting lot pressure core systems 
multichannel integration the need for real time capability 
cross branch offerings and central data repository are 
mandatory adjustments existing legacy systems which 
are often require high cost addition flexibility 
for example one insurer told that takes more than 
days change simple field the internet front end and 
the signature people approve the change although 
acknowledge that this unlikely pure technology 
problem governance also plays part 
are seeing emergence new offers the market and 
new technologies that could encourage insurers change the 
way they involve suppliers well the way they address 
their core challenges 
cloud computing the long run could play role this 
cloud infrastructure could way for insurers lower their 
running costs free money for investment innovation 
ideal world insurers could migrate fully cloudbased core system but see evidence this the 
moment 
however the shorter term think more likely that 
cloud could help level the playing field between the largest 
insurers and small mid sized players 
the past the cost technology meant that very large 
companies had advantage for example only they could 
afford the best class systems needed perform the most 
complicated analysis 
they also benefited from economies scale the cloud 
could change this paradigm democratises computing

ever increasing speed technological change 
technological change accelerating astounding pace 
adoption curves are speeding rapidly for example the 
time taken reach billion users being halved for each 
new technology produced took years for fixed line 
telephones achieve billion users yet only years for 
televisions reach the same level population penetration 
examining more recent technology disruptions mobile 
phones took years while the internet achieved the same 
years more recently smartphones and facebook have 
both reached the billion users mark just years while 
this partly attributable population growth believe the 
speed change fundamentally increasing source

likely that the speed adoption even newer 
technologies such iot and continuing adoption current 
technologies the whole world will going mobile will 
continue accelerate 
this gives insurers less time react changes requiring 
would leaders respond technological improvements 
ever more quickly 
for example new hypothetical technology were launch

insurers need become more consumer centric 
the growing consumer expectation across other industries 
therefore has affected the insurance industry the past 
insurers did not really improve their digital capabilities and 
offerings creating gap with consumer expectations the 
result that today they are well behind other industries 
terms their digital offering and consumers consider 
one the lower performing industries this dimension 
while online insurance interactions are well established 
globally and have been for some time from consumer 
perspective there are many areas online service with which 
consumers are dissatisfied one cio from leading 
insurance company put well for years insurers have talked 
about being consumer centric they are now really beginning

implications for insurers 
insurance has lagged many industries its adoption new 
technology however this beginning change increasing 
number insurers are making technology key strategic priority which 
critical our view given that the industry failing meet consumers 
digital expectations 
all aspects the insurance value chain could affected from 
administration pricing underwriting and distribution while some 
this change arguably common all industries believe that 
insurance may disproportionately affected within financial services 
given the potential for the internet things reshape the product 
proposition and reduce the size global risk pools however also 
see opportunities for new more flexible products emerge 
believe the industry needs seize the opportunity build 
business models that drive more frequent consumer interaction 
otherwise see danger new entrants with strong understanding 
consumers entering the space 
ecosystems are likely become increasingly important think 
insurers should prioritise finding appropriate partners order 
secure access not see insurers natural ecosystem hosts for 
products some home and motor

near term the focus likely operational improvements 
industry has been lagging peers 
the insurance industry has been relative laggard its

also see some clear opportunities such the ability 
use technology create more engaging and compelling 
consumer offers which could increase cross selling and the 
insurance risk pool the short run application technology 
the existing business model can improve returns although 
over time presume this will competed away 
however insurers are weighed down cumbersome legacy 
technology which limit their ability rapidly launch new 
products and react the change the current model also 
typically delivers infrequent consumer interactions and often 
has inherent channel conflict for example agency versus 
direct 
believe technology increases the risk new entrants 
coming into insurance potentially leveraging far more 
detailed consumer insights than are currently available 
insurers not see insurers natural ecosystem hosts

implications for technology providers 
the insurance sector accounts for some all global 
spending relevant when considering the outlook for software 
and hardware vendors believe that spending likely increase 
insurers adapt changing consumer demands the need improve 
core systems and the availability new datasets however several 
insurers have indicated that they are reallocating spending critical 
areas 
integration remains major issue for the insurers expect the 
industry continue run variety modern and legacy systems the 
short medium term date there not single enterprise wide 
solution for insurers adopt although sap looking develop one 
also note that insurers remain nervous about replacing core systems 
given these are mission critical 
would expect see consolidation among the more specialist 
insurance technology vendors over time see fragmented 
market for core insurance systems with the top vendors having just 
combined market share this compares more mature and 
regulated market such erp enterprise resource planning software 
where the top five players control more than half the market 
from software point view see opportunities client 
interactions channels and core systems see the major consumer 
relationship management crm vendors such sap salesforce 
microsoft and oracle having opportunities here core systems 
see upside for the broad players sap accenture sapiens csc and 
oracle well more specialist vendors such guidewire 
ebaotech fineos oneshield and the innovation group 
insurance likely become key end market for the internet 
things where connected devices generate data analysed 
telematics the most relevant current example here however there are 
still major opportunities for vendors improve the data analysis 
particularly terms contextualising combining with location weather 
information etc and combining with claims data 
from hardware point view technology used help insurance 
companies better understand their consumers includes telematics 
trackers moving vehicles from cars trucks but also include ships 
containers and planes and connected homes set top boxes fire

areas opportunity

there are not many listed pure play technologies vendors 
insurance would highlight guidewire core processing 
suite for insurers sapiens core processing suite for 
and life and the innovation group software bpo 
for insurers with strong focus claims management 
the key companies this group 
after these companies see another group broader 
technology players that have strong offerings within the 
insurance space these all stand benefit from increasing 
insurance technology spend but given the mix their 
businesses there will other factors play the 
investment decision 
software plays insurance 
would split the software companies exposed the 
insurance industry into five distinct groups 
end end software there are software vendors such 
sap that offer end end solution for property and 
casualty and life insurance companies using 
almost exclusively their own technology developed 
internally and via the solutions include frontend crm core processing and big data analytics 
oracle also building such end end offering 
software services mix then there are services 
vendors such accenture csc and capgemini 
these companies also aim deliver complete solution 
insurers but the technology mix their own and 
integration partner software for example 
accenture can deliver its own duck creek software onpremise service and then use its integration 
expertise with partner software complete the portfolio 
csc would fit more closely with accenture that also 
has its own software offering with particular strength 
asia capgemini more focused partnerships with 
software vendors like guidewire and sap than its own 
software can also deliver the software service

management channel software big data analytics 
and addition offer infrastructure services either onpremise the cloud given the importance 
insurance sector spending several these companies 
have specific focus this vertical and tailor their 
offerings would highlight salesforce 
hardware plays insurance 
the hardware companies are usually the first benefit from 
new product cycle would highlight 
telematics components including wireless and 
positioning modules providing real time positioning 
assets the wireless network etc 
insurers can track more precisely the use assets for 
instance how many miles car driven and also how 
driven examples providers include cobra 
gemalto metasystem sierra wireless telit tomtom 
and blox there nothing new technologically here 
and tracking devices have been used for expensive cars 
for more than ten years now those modules can also 
used track other assets such trucks and containers 
but they rely the cellular network the barriers for 
adoption here are consumers attitude towards being 
tracked and the cost installation rolled out mass 
connected home components such set top boxes 
from cable companies the for example 
manufactured pace for xfinity offering cable 
wearables this sensitive issue even more 
perhaps than tracking devices cars but believe 
that there potential opportunity for insurance products 
that can take into account personal data such sugar 
levels activity levels even though the insurers and 
consumers may reluctant use such data 
technology such cloud infrastructure and big data

what technology providers need win with 
insurers 
our conversations suggest that insurers are looking for their 
technology providers cover more their requirements 
that they have less integration however not 
believe they are ready migrate all their systems partly due 
the risk doing this and partly because the perception 
that one vendor can cover everything effectively some 
cases such life insurance not see business case 
for doing 
however believe insurers will consider the vendors ability 
maintain and expand their offerings the medium term 
given the complexity the industry and the likely 
investments required would expect this drive greater 
consolidation fragmented industry the larger players 
may better placed 
not see widespread cloud adoption insurance but 
companies are looking lower infrastructure costs using 
cloud infrastructures and see this also potentially helping 
level the playing field between smaller and larger insurers 
when consider big data analytics what the current 
insurance spend 
gartner estimates that insurers will spend billion 
growing versus this represents total 
global spend exhibit shows the estimated split 
insurance expenditure

modular products that migration can gradual rather

our conversations with insurers and technology companies 
that provide software and services the sector suggest 
there has been uptick demand over the last years 
both sides also see very significant opportunity for vendors 
insurers seek transform their systems 
single version for consumer data that consistent 
across multiple systems this can easily shared and 
also analysed big data make this easier achieve 
across multi policy admin environments

microsoft and oracle sap already has strong presence 
the insurance sector and internal development and 
has been working build complete solution for the industry 
including front end systems policy claims and billing systems 
built the hana platform for big data analytics believe 
this broad approach the insurance sector should position 
sap well the front end given its ability integrate tightly 
the core processing systems and deliver analytics 
integrated into this 
salesforce should also benefit from increasing insurance 
spending especially vendors look saas solutions for

september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
there are also more regionally focused companies such 
cor fja bsb fadata edlund eis group and 
tia

platform 
microsoft also has strong focus the insurance industry 
and looking drive adoption its infrastructure

microsoft dynamics crm could benefit from this spending 
trend 
core systems insurers and broker agents 
still see very fragmented market for core insurance 
systems with the top vendors having just market 
share this compares more mature and regulated market 
such erp software where just the top five players control 
over half the market 
this means there are still many smaller companies and the 
lack consolidation far means that these companies tend 
specialists niche area insurance processing 
geography there also tends focus either the life 
health market consequently one software vendor 
may have offering that very well suited claims 
management with focus asia and insurance 
while another company may have the majority its business 
north america focused life and health policy 
administration 
however frequent theme from almost all the vendors 
spoke was that they are being pushed cover more the 
market are generally expanding the coverage their 
solutions 
the most common situation that company that strong 
policy administration will look strengthen its offering 
claims and billings but also see companies looking 
broaden their geographical reach and finally add life 
health along with their original proposition 
addition the software vendors that focus primarily the 
insurers core systems also have group that focus 
software solutions for the insurance brokers agents 
interestingly this area that have seen the strongest 
cloud based offerings 
when think about the core systems market would split 
the vendors into three main groups 
larger software services companies that have 
broad coverage the market companies this space 
include sap accenture sapiens csc and oracle 
software vendors focused more specific areas the 
market including guidewire whose coverage 
expanding ebaotech fineos oneshield and the 
innovation group 
broker agent focused vendors include applied systems 
vertafore and acturis 
not expect many any big bang replacements 
core systems given that these changes are high risk for 
insurers see change being more evolutionary than 
revolutionary 
with this trend mind believe insurers will consider not 
only the solution place today from the software vendor but 
also the vendor ability invest and innovate its own and 
adjacent areas future this could favour the larger groups 
that have the will and means invest for the longer term and 
think this may drive consolidation market that highly 
fragmented 
integration remains major challenge 
insurers look likely continue run variety modern and 
legacy systems the short medium term given this 
integration middleware software vendors and services 
companies will remain extremely relevant the industry 
believe that this bigger issue for life insurers for 
example south korea samsung life insurance working 
implement sap erp for launch which will cover 
around its business however owing the nature 
its long term contracts samsung life will need keep its 
remaining legacy system for business maintenance 
the other hand samsung fire marine carrier aims 
fully migrate all data new system given the short 
duration its contracts 
middleware and business process management vendors like 
pegasystems software ibm and tibco have strong 
focus the insurance industry these companies offer 
combination business process modelling and optimisation 
and integration technology link different software solutions 
meanwhile services companies can offer combination 
their own software solutions accenture and csc and strong 
integration capabilities capgemini accenture and 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
capgemini will also offer run these systems the cloud 
platform service paas model 
accenture traditional target market has tended tier 
insurance and has products that cover core processes 
and life health the acquisition duck creek has 
helped accenture make inroads into the mid market 
insurers especially initially policy admin but then 
also claims 
csc has very broad offering software consulting and 
outsourcing the company has strong presence asia with 
its insurance software assets while csc has one the 
largest installed bases the market large part this for 
its older products 
data challenges big data analytics and iot 
believe that all companies have been struggling get 
business value out the transactional data that they create 
and store for many manufacturing and consumer goods 
companies the challenge get the data out the 
transactional erp and other legacy systems they have 
existing database structures and hardware limitations have 
made the systems used for this often called data 
warehouses slow and inflexible 
the challenge could more complex for insurers the 
fragmented nature their core systems and the consumer 
information silos that have been created mean there even 
more integration and data cleansing done than for 
average enterprise this challenge covers everything from 
analysing consumer interactions make the right product offer 
the right time through the right channel improving the 
actual underwriting decisions using larger more varied 
dataset insurers need increase the amount data they 
analyse and this more quickly and more accurately 
however the goal posts are constantly moving more 
accurately widening new datasets emerge for example 
the analysis social media interactions may added that 
call centre interactions motor insurers are starting think 
about how they integrate telematics data this adds another 
layer complexity before even think about how telematics 
might serve new way engage with consumers how 
the iot could more broadly applicable the iot expands 
the datasets connected home insurance fire intruder and 
other sensors the home and even life health sensors 
tracking fitness metrics time insurers may wish able 
input social network data even consumer shopping 
data what type food you buy into their underwriting 
calculations 
microsoft brings strong industry knowledge business 
intelligence and analytics capability and the microsoft azure 
cloud computing platform see platforms like azure 
having the potential level the playing field between large 
and mid sized insurers that can now afford perform the 
same complex analysis using that platform 
would also highlight lexis nexis which brings strong 
analytics and databases claims and other information 
help insurers measure claims and prevent fraud more 
effectively 
sap propositions this space including all the core 
processing systems will based the sap hana 
platform which sap believes delivers dramatic improvements 
response times and flexibility the integration the core 
processing and analytical platforms also means that analysis 
can done real time live transactional data 
finally ibm and oracle offer combination strong 
business intelligence and database capabilities 
turning specifically telematics some technology vendors 
focus exclusively telematic data analytics such 
telematicus and the floow and others combine 
hardware offering with data analytics and other services such 
octo telematics cobra wunelli and tomtom 
while telematics solutions bring insurers whole new dataset 
that should help improve risk calculations and lower loss 
ratios believe they are still challenge for insurers 
date the insurers with large volumes claims data that have 
been linked relatively simple data collected from consumers 
where you live your age how long you have been driving 
which car you are driving and your claims history now they 
can collect large new set data where you drive when 
how quickly how aggressively and the big challenge 
correlate that new information with the claims data that are 
linked other information see significant opportunity 
for the technology providers and insurers that can deliver that 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
outsourcing business process outsourcing 
bpo 
while believe core system modernisation will become 
increasingly important for the insurers and will likely lead 
greater differentiation the industry still expect see 
insurers outsource more technology and processes some 
cases this will purely cost driven others could that 
oldco book business outsourced run off while 
modern system used for new business even easier 
envisage closed books business being outsourced 
lower costs while the for current business modernised 
however also expect some the outsourcing companies 
offer take the existing infrastructure and modernise 
while running the existing systems believe this type 
transformational outsourcing offering will prove more 
attractive over time insurers provided that the promise 
modernisation and transformation delivered 
another style outsourcing would highlight 
capgemini and accenture paas offerings where these 
companies host insurance core processing software and 
deliver service the insurers believe this targets 
mainly small and mid sized insurers today but could move 
the market accenture tends host its own duck creek and 
other software the platform while capgemini has 
partnership with guidewire software 
most the global services companies will offer technology 
outsourcing insurers but would highlight capgemini 
accenture wipro tcs capita xchanging and the 
innovation group having strong insurance focus 
could there one stop shop 
the history software one consolidation and economies 
scale innovation has traditionally happened with point 
solutions but over time these are integrated form more 
coherent suite solutions the economies scale work 
favour third party software adoption when software 
company only has one consumer large insurer will likely 
able outspend its software provider but when the software 
company has consumers one insurer will able 
invest much 
consumers and tends gain more and more market 
share over time believe there significant opportunity 
for the vendor that can provide such suite solutions 
the insurance industry 
however complete suite unlikely enough ensure 
adoption core insurance processing systems are their 
nature mission critical insurers are naturally very reluctant 
engage higher risk big bang changes result 
believe the solutions must flexible and modular order for 
insurers migrate over time 
who has the potential deliver such 
solution 
insurance complex industry and there huge breadth 
solutions needed deliver suite from consumer 
interaction through multiple core processing systems big 
data analytics believe sap own vision deliver 
sap for insurance the same way has delivered broad 
extended erp solution for other industries however will 
have overcome the challenges complex integration from 
its earlier erp days but clearly has the breadth technology 
and ability invest deliver such platform oracle would 
also position invest this way 
csc also has broad offering core insurance processing 
but believe will need drive adoption its newer 
offerings and will have partner cover other areas the 
solution 
believe that the services companies like capgemini 
and accenture that have focused heavily insurance 
could also construct offering this would likely cloudbased and the companies would package their own solutions 
and third party software 
slightly different way the services players 
companies that can deliver software platforms paas the 
cloud could also assemble offering salesforce 
already has the consumer channels element but could 
persuade third parties develop its platform 
believe microsoft could also work this with its azure 
cloud computing platform 
this also means that the software industry tends 
consolidate the vendor with consumers can also 
outspend all other things being equal the vendor with 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
cloud the answer 
with longer baseline stability trust will increasingly 
built with insurance executives 
insurer cios cite several reasons for not yet fully adopting 
cloud usage but many among those interviewed believe 
that ultimately this will the future state 
believe that two main fears hold back greater cloud 
adoption today 
data regulation and privacy considerations and 
the critical nature the systems insurer and 
whether this can trusted third party 
from both perspectives expect medium term resolutions 
three further reasons will drive cloud adoption our 
view 
cost and efficiency the costs cloud storage 
continue trend downwards and several the industry 
speculate that storage will eventually become free with 
the business model switching services such 
scenario will increasingly attractive from cost 
efficiency perspective use cloud infrastructure over inhouse infrastructure 
cyber attack risk cloud providers will increasingly 
have unique capabilities defend against cyberattack which will not able matched insurers 
believe that cyber attacks will come more and more 
frequent 
flexibility create new environments and scale 
within regulation cloud providers are rapidly gaining 
regulatory accreditation such article compliance 
european countries this holds back several cloud providers 
and critical for them they are gain share 
from trust perspective the greatest systems failures and 
breaches have been house over the last decade not 
from cloud providers

what role does cloud computing have 
first would split cloud computing into two main parts 
the provision infrastructure infrastructure service 
iaas and the provision complete software applications 
software service saas other industries 
believe iaas has been more broadly adopted than saas and 
see opportunity for insurers lower their hardware 
run costs taking advantage some this infrastructure 
where possible some legacy applications will likely have 
run specific hardware for example see microsoft 
working closely the insurance industry drive adoption 
its azure platform 
also see insurers adopting saas for common business 
processes has happened other industries saas has 
been able penetrate areas such consumer relationship 
management crm and some internal processes like human 
capital management hcm and travel expense 
management processes that are not insurance industryspecific 
have come across some examples more core 
processes being made available service for example 
the software provided into insurance brokers agents 
sometimes delivered service the insurance space 
accenture has agreed deploy its duck creek suite 
saas model berkshire hathaway for policy claims and 
billings 
however overall believe there still reluctance adopt 
core systems saas model part this likely regulatory 
driven there often data protection regulation 
demanding insurers implement data security measures and 
apply regulation when taking data outside regulated countries 
however also believe there not yet insurance 
company box software solution that can delivered 
service result still expect the majority core 
systems for insurers run premise the short tomedium term 
insurance computing platforms like microsoft azure and 
amazon web services can help level the playing field for 
small and mid sized insurers they give these companies 
access large scale computing infrastructure low cost 
based usage result these companies can theory 
perform data analysis that the past was only available 
insurers operating very large scale for the larger 
insurance companies these platforms offer greater flexibility 
and lower cost than would the case they maintained their 
own infrastructure 
could tech companies compete with insurers 
believe that internet and social network companies have 
very rich datasets about consumers that could huge 
value when making underwriting decisions indeed the data 
will often lot richer than the information insurance 
company has work with 
over the last years have also seen technology 
companies increase their value solving problems that 
industrial companies have been reluctant solve expect 
there will gaps for technology companies the traditional 
players are slow react and already have examples for 
example japan internet companies starting offer 
insurance 
believe the major barrier that technology companies face 
claims data the rich dataset from the internet and social 
networking can correlated with claims records there could 
compelling value proposition this issue also has 
bearing telematics directly technology companies 
generate huge datasets around driver behaviour and insurers 
struggle reconcile this with historical claims data simply

exploring scenarios for insurers 
given the degree potential change facing the insurance industry 
impossible certain about the outcome while can 
identify many issues that are likely affect the industry much harder 
precise about the impact and the timing 
address this have developed seven scenarios assess how 
the industry may develop explore trends that are likely shape 
the industry and categorise them according their potential impact and 
the degree uncertainty 
our base case developed looking high impact trends that 
have high degree certainty examples include changes 
distribution regulation demographics greater penetration mobile 
solutions data analytics and the internet things 
also analyse scenarios along two dimensions the extent 
development ecosystem based business models and the level 
presence adjacent entrants although uncertain these two trends 
could fundamentally alter the extent which insurers continue own the 
value chain unless they innovate and adapt 
key debate how well placed insurers are develop ecosystems 
arguably other players have natural advantage for example original 
equipment manufacturers oems motor insurance and potentially 
utilities for connected home solutions with the exception ping 
china most insurers have not yet developed proper ecosystems 
experiences from bancassurance globally and life illustrate the 
risks for the industry absent the impact technology have already 
seen examples insurers losing control over key aspects the value 
chain and financial returns declining consequence 
our approach 
have identified series key industry trends those that 
deem high impact and highly likely form our base case 
develop our scenarios have explored the potential 
impact two dimensions the extent which ecosystems 
develop and whether adjacent entrants could are likely 
emerge 
identifying key trends 
the key trends the insurance industry see are 
follows and are summarised exhibit 
the changing face distribution 
technology changing how consumers want engage with 
their insurers across the different distribution channels 
consumer segments with different preferences are emerging 
for example some want rich advice but others called selfdirected consumers are seeking simplicity convenience and 
speed 
developing regulation 
consumer focused regulation increasingly prevalent 
particular scrutiny commissions and other incentives paid 
distributors there increasing need for high degree 
alignment between distributors and consumer outcomes 
note growing concern about the sharing and use 
consumer data for example the european union general 
data protection regulation stricter prudential solvency 
requirements are also changing the relative attractiveness 
products for insurers 
changing demographics 
combination higher life expectancy and low birth rates 
has resulted increasing average age the population 
many different countries this creates greater demand for 
products related retirement income and care 
greater mobile usage 
consumers are increasingly turning online and remaining 
connected the internet via mobile phones and tablets and 
are therefore demanding online mobile presence from product 
providers 
rise platform based models 
platform based models offer all product service needs one 
place this should eventually result value migrating from 
manufacturers distributors

large amounts data combined enable better and real time

consumers can combine the agency service with online offers 
analytics optimisation 
are seeing trend whereby existing analysis static data 
refined particular developing more predictive models

reduced government and employer provision 
there growing trend towards lower retirement 
contributions and significant transfer risk individuals 
one could imagine car ecosystem where the system

assistance services and allows insurance purchased 
similar construct could imagined the home the host 
such ecosystem may may not insurer 
what mean adjacent entrants 
adjacent entrants are new competitors coming into insurance 
using key insights advantages that they have gained from 
their core operations examples include oems and digital 
players such google 
scenario the starting point 
adjacent entrants coming into insurance 
for example car manufacturers oems retailers could 
conceivably enter the insurance market 
integration insurance into wider ecosystems 
insurance becomes just one product offer within much 
broader suite which could theory undermine the position 
insurers depending how controls the ecosystem 
new categories for insurance 
examples here include the insurance autonomous vehicles 
and cyber insurance 
automated trading risk capital markets 
this could challenge insurers traditional role warehouses 
risk 
forming our scenarios 
underlying our scenarios the two most important trends 
both which could have high impact and are highly 
uncertain revolve around the extent which 
adjacent companies enter the insurance market and 
insurance integrated into wider ecosystem models 
this the status quo where most industry players are now 
there are only few adjacent entrants into insurance and 
ecosystems offering insurance 
scenario ecosystems developed 
insurers 
this probably the most optimistic scenario for insurers 
ecosystems become well developed but there are new 
entrants from adjacent industries 
example company that trying achieve this now 
ping which developing ecosystem attract and 
retain consumers while driving cross sales positions itself 
financial services supermarket where consumers find all 
their financial needs through one account consumers are 
attracted new business lines for example peer peer 
lending through lufax that drive interaction and convenience 
they are then cross sold more traditional products 
insurers here also have the potential boost revenues 
cross selling not only traditional insurance products but also 
related service led propositions 
scenario more traditional partnering 
from there have created seven scenarios for the 
insurance industry over the next years each leads 
very different end state for the industry and different insurer 
and technology provider strategies 
this scenario quite commonplace today where insurer 
and adjacent entrant jointly sell insurance 
what mean ecosystem 
traditional bancassurance would fit into this space the 
adjacent entrant the bank partners with insurer offer 
additional products its consumers 
ecosystem mean grouping different products 
services which may may not provided one provider 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
scenario opportunities for insurers 
think this interesting model insurers proactively 
seek partnerships order become embedded within 
broader ecosystems under this approach the insurer may 
not control the ecosystem but likely derive significant 
benefit from being part 
good early example here the property and casualty 
company state farm which has formed partnership 
with security and alarm company adt the aim offer 
connected home and insurance solutions for state farm 
installing and servicing dedicated boxes for connectedhome insurance offering would likely prohibitively 
expensive but partnering with adt which already carries 
out these roles the economics could transformed 
allianz has partnered with deutsche telekom aiming take 
similar approach create ecosystem combining 
information communication insurance and service offerings 
scenario insurers lose parts value chain 
under this scenario insurers work with partners but 
progressively lose elements the value chain owing the 
strength the partner consumer relationships 
can envisage scenario which the partner not only 
owns the consumer does bank but also has much 
insight into consumer behaviour that also takes the role 
pricing risk this scenario insurer could significantly 
squeezed 
example here could automotive oem where initially 
the insurer required price the risk but the oem builds 
capability the insurer becomes less relevant this scenario 
believe insurers than can partner globally with oems 
would best placed the oems would presumably 
looking develop telematics solution for example all 
major markets 
scenario threat insurers 
here assume new entrants come into the insurance 
market not only through ecosystems but also leveraging 
their existing knowledge their own consumers 
while have included this one our scenarios for 
technology driven change already feature traditional 
insurance markets 
the simplest level could argue that this includes affinity 
groups that may partner with insurer but white label 
basis rebranded appear made the affinity 
group 
there are some good existing examples the 
over business saga did not start out insurer 
but now derives most its revenue from insurance 
the used the strength its brand and knowledge 
its consumer base move into general insurance 
saga largely manufactures its own insurance product with 
the motor underwriting platform house 
may see more entrants this type perhaps initially 
partnering with insurer but over time bringing more 
activities house 
example this working reverse huk coburg 
germany where the business has used its roots insurance 
build one the country largest car servicing networks 
scenario worst case scenario 
under this scenario ecosystems become widespread and 
there are significant number adjacent entrants such that 
insurers are squeezed out significant parts the market 
and lose scale 
example adjacent company already moving into the 
insurance space rakuten japan largest internet 
company which bought life insurer subsequently 
rebranded rakuten insurance rakuten has strong crossselling skills and high degree penetration japanese 
consumers 
strong roadmap already exists 
while are considering future scenarios for the industry 
driven technology note that similar impacts have 
already been felt the past from changes more traditional 
business models there are many instances for instance 
insurers losing control elements the value chain 
losing control distribution has been highly detrimental 
insurers several jurisdictions globally 
the life industry good example here combination 
regulation poor risk management and mis selling has led the 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
industry move from being vertically integrated principally 
offering unit linked wrappers with third party asset 
management through brokers recently even the wrappers 
have been challenged non traditional competitors such 
platform provider hargreaves lansdown 
bancassurance another example although strategically 
sensible for many insurance players offering cost capital 
efficient access new markets new consumers and 
leveraging existing back offices bancassurance has 
weakened insurers control over the consumer 
while overall financial returns may have been enhanced 
owing the incremental nature the business most 
cases the margins for bancassurance business are less 
attractive than for sales through proprietary salesforces 
these examples demonstrate clearly how important 
developing ecosystem could without owning the 
consumer relationship the economics for the insurance 
industry are likely less attractive 
some variations business line exist 
shift towards the development ecosystems more 
frequent consumer product lines than business lines 
adjacent entrants have only come into insurance where 
they have clear advantage japan for example 
rakuten offers exclusively personal lines whereas the 
allianz partnership includes both personal and 
commercial lines 
but the geographical variations are greater this stage 
there much variation the extent which ecosystems 
have been adopted asia europe and north america 
asian insurers such ping and rakuten have 
embraced the ecosystem model these companies own 
their own ecosystems and provide insurance one 
many products services from single account 
europe the idea ecosystems catching with 
insurers making noises around building relationships with 
consumers and offering advanced services 
north america have seen adjacent entrants move 
such overstock and home ecosystem plays 
such the state farm adt partnership

the consumer view today 
our global survey results show that online channels are widely used 
consumers their insurance journey average 
consumers surveyed worldwide use more than one online channel 
social media are also broadly used with usage far more prevalent 
asia consumers already use friends and family posts social 
media very important source information for their insurance 
choice not yet but are likely the future 
face face interactions are still important over consumers 
use face face channels their journey but markets with higher 
internet maturity found lower use face face interactions 
however more than our respondents average were 
unwilling pay for face face interactions with life motor and 
home insurers those who were willing did not want pay more than 
premiums for the service the propensity pay varied between 
countries with asia the highest 
although insurers overall interactions with consumers rank 
average the level satisfaction with online interactions 
significantly lags other industries with notably large gap banks 
furthermore found that online satisfaction with insurers 
decreases along the value chain with the lowest satisfaction seen 
the claims stage where the net promoter score was minus 
believe the factors driving the weak scores are generally within 
insurers control for example lack better online chat and support 
along with simpler processes and personalised offerings 
better online experience may translate into brand advocacy 
found that consumers who were more satisfied with their online insurance 
experience increased their support for insurers much 
this section discuss the key insights from our 
global consumer survey focus the way which 
consumers interact with their insurers and their 
consumer satisfaction with the insurance journey 
our survey was conducted countries globally and was 
specially commissioned for this report for more detailed 
methodology please see appendix 
our two principal findings are 
consumers are willing increase the usage direct 
online channels demand for face face channels 
likely remain but challenged consumers low 
willingness pay for such services 
insurers stand benefit from higher brand advocacy 
and larger share switching consumers the 
online experience improved 
increasing interaction with insurers online 
the results our survey show that both direct online 
channels and social media are widely used consumers

this demonstrated exhibit the axis shows the 
proportion respondents that use more than one online 
channel each step their insurance journey research 
purchase modify claim and renew the axis 
show the bcg intensity index score which measures the 
relative maturity the internet each economy can see 
that average consumers surveyed globally use 
least one online direct channel 
exhibit shows breakdown interactions with insurers 
stage the insurance journey shows that online channels 
account average for total channels used when 
submitting claims and when researching for new 
policies contrast only consumers not use any 
online channel during their consumer journey called 
offline consumers 
social media are also broadly used consumers 
average respondents across the countries have 
already shared recommendations insurers through social 
media have not yet but are likely the future 
similarly respondents already use friends and family 
posts social media important source information 
for their insurance choice not yet but are likely 
the future social media usage tends higher asia 
and lower europe for example respondents had 
shared recommendations through social media india and 
china versus the and germany see

increase insurers improve the quality their online

significant evolutionary change under way 
across the insurance industry there are growing number 
interesting examples the creative adoption technology this 
section highlight some the best examples affecting the various 
aspects the value chain 
insurers are developing more consumer centric products using 
technology big data and analytics for pricing automating 
underwriting boosting levels consumer engagement reducing admin 
costs and improving claims management processes 
however believe that this change evolutionary with 
insurer yet having transformed its business scale across all 
aspects the value chain discuss later section there are 
practical constraints achieving faster change for example 
organisational structure legacy systems 
the relatively slow pace change has left the industry lagging 
others terms the quality its online offer our consumer survey 
suggests that consumer dissatisfaction increases along each step the 
value chain reaching maximum the claims management stage 
breaking down the value chain 
have identified some particularly interesting examples 
technological advances across the following elements the 
value chain 
product design 
pricing underwriting 
sales distribution 
policy administration and servicing 
claims management 
however have identified two interesting examples where 
insurers are creating new products specifically designed 
meet consumers needs and expectations they give idea

while technology will have impact all aspects the 
value chain insurers arguably one the most significant 
effects pricing and underwriting 
our interviews with insurers showed that big data 
consistently cited key area which companies have 
been investing recognising the value that drives pricing 
and indeed insight for product design 
traditional actuarial techniques have often used analysis 
various proxies order assess risk for example accident 
history home address and type vehicle for motor insurance

stages with the iot likely have significant applications 
insurance not just motor insurance telematics but also 
remote monitoring fire and water damage risk connected 
home and business solutions and health risks 
the medium term see the potential for the insurance 
business model change fundamentally these techniques 
become more commonplace 
big data analytics move structural risk modelling 
essence see shift toward structural risk modelling 
today risk assessment algorithms are statistically driven 
compiling data events and occurrences that have come 
pass and using statistics forecast yoy changes into the 
future that actuarial approach 
today these algorithms are either being developed and 
maintained internally insurers purchased through 
standardised risk assessment products 
however new models are emerging using not only statistical 
occurrence data but also analysing the actual structural 
drivers behind the occurrences especially catastrophe 
risk assessment for example the physics earthquakes not 
just the average damage following one structural modelling 
catastrophe risk examines not only former trends but also 
the science driving the situation and its consequences 
pandemic risk further example when using statistical 
models actuaries need look back historical pandemics 
see what happened however with structural model 
insurers can look the science how viruses mutate 
ways that they have not done before for instance how 
transmissible and virulent virus may they could even 
one step further into epidemiology and cell biology look 
what possible regarding vaccine efficacy and consider 
potential policy responses 
some examples big data and analytics usage 
while the shift towards structural risk modelling and real time 
risk monitoring still its infancy our interviews identified

digitally born insurer 
while many insurers are making evolutionary changes business 
models using technology none has yet done scale the 
previous section considered some interesting examples specific 
initiatives across different aspects the value chain 
here look what might possible one were able start 
insurer from completely blank sheet paper assume 
relatively traditional business model but design all the processes using 
state the art digital solutions 
this digitally born motor insurer allows explore the 
opportunity available have broken down our hypothetical motor 
insurer into the individual underlying business processes and used 
detailed benchmarking order create ground model 
estimate that digitally born motor insurer could achieve 
combined ratio approximately below traditional peer 
while debatable how much this could achieved existing 
organisation believe that provides good roadmap for assessing 
the opportunity 
the examples geico and progressive the demonstrate the 
opportunity that exists from modernising the existing traditional 
business model both players have consistently grown much faster than 
the industry with materially lower costs per policy 
while there are some excellent examples incumbent 
insurers evolving existing business models using technology 
and indeed disruptive new entrants are not aware any 
insurance company operating scale that has fully 
transformed its business model given this thought 
would helpful try scale the potential opportunity from 
wholesale adoption new technology 
believe that traditional models will become ever more 
efficient and effective with modern technology 
given this have created digitally born motor insurer 
which sizes the potential financial benefits that could 
realised from full technological transformation 
from traditional digitally born 
our exercise takes baseline pure play european motor 
insurer and transforms the business model through the 
adoption existing technologies 
based our analysis think possible substantially 
improve the profitability the model from combined ratio 
our base case digitally born 
insurer 
the improvement would driven reduction the loss 
ratio from around and decline non claims 
costs from keeping prices constant 
our analysis does not include the costs achieving the 
transformation and assumes all initiatives end state having 
delivered their benefit potential furthermore assume all 
benefits accrue the insurer rather than pricing discounts 
the end consumer reality would expect benefits 
partially competed away the whole industry over time 
moved more efficient model 
the starting point 
the starting point for our analysis generic monoline 
european motor insurer with billion annual premiums 
with average premium per policy around 
currently the insurer operates pure agency distribution 
model and profitable with combined ratio other 
words making small underwriting profit which then 
supplemented investment income 
the combined ratio breaks down into claims ratio 
and non claims cost ratio the non claims 
costs comprised percentage points ppts agent 
commissions and support functions and the rest 
divided among other core functions 
the opportunity the digitally born insurer 
order construct our new insurer have looked how 
much more efficient would each area the business 
were fully digitally enabled carried legacy 
systems technology and moved fully online distribution 
exhibit summarises the overall impact believe could 
achieved the combined ratio versus the traditional model 
reduction

savings are achieved adopting technology discrete

note our assumptions are based baseline motor insurer average european motor monoline with pure agent model excluding asset management results all benefits considered endstate initial investments included all technology benefits are translated into cost benefits assuming constant total premiums estimated benefits based market data for european insurers 
interviews with technology and insurance companies bcg benchmarking databases and bcg case experience source annual reports for european insurers interviews bcg insurance 
benchmarks database bcg case experience bcg analysis morgan stanley research numbers may not add due rounding 
the biggest two opportunities are improving pricing through 
the application big data and enhancing sales efficiency 
large part moving from agency direct distribution 
model taking the midpoint our analysis estimate 
these have the potential improve the combined operating 
ratio and respectively 
consider each these areas potential improvement 
turn 
using big data improve pricing 
are trying demonstrate the potential benefit 
remodelling traditional insurance business have not 
considered our example the possible impact adopting 
telematics the loss ratio 
however believe there are substantial opportunities from 
using big data and analytics improve risk assessment and 
pricing 
insurers with access prospective consumers purchasing 
patterns through retailers and banking information can 
assess different risk profiles different client segments 
there are examples where the use such techniques the 
has resulted reduction the loss ratio 
assume success rate applying the consumer 
base this reduces our assumed loss ratio from 
recent article the financial times insurers mine 
consumers finance records set premiums july 
highlighted that lloyds banking group was using 
banking information for example late payments and 
unauthorised overdrafts order price motor insurance 
automate product and underwriting processes 
see relatively modest overall opportunity here 
products and underwriting make smaller proportion the 
expense ratio however optimisation around product 
development and underwriting processes could reduce 
headcount leading savings 
while this could reduce product and underwriting expenses 
assume the absolute level expenses modest 
reducing the aggregate impact 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
enhance sales processes using digital 
along with the adoption big data for pricing underwriting 
see the biggest opportunity for our digitally born motor 
insurer transforming the sales process 
assume complete shift away from selling through 
agency selling through digital online direct channels this 
results reduction agent commissions 
however some these savings need reinvested 
digital marketing initiatives 
assume that costs our insurer acquire 
consumer through online channels such aggregator 
note this not paid renewal from zero assume 
these expenses reach 
removing agents and competing direct will require 
increase the general marketing expense allowance 
from 
aggregate therefore see net saving with 
agency commission saved but offset 
additional digital marketing spend 
leading edge solution could theory result 
reduction the number full time equivalent staff ftes 
required these functions 
management contracts for example amendments and 
processing associated mail could completely 
automated leaving ftes only for special cases 
collections disbursements and payment transactions could 
almost entirely automated 
aggregate believe there the potential reduce the 
policy administration and servicing costs from 
the combined ratio 
improve fraud detection using big data 
believe there substantial opportunity improve fraud 
detection using big data technology solutions that are 
available include netreveal experian hunter and sas 
increase the fraud detection rate achievable 
which has the potential improve the loss ratio 
from 
new team supporting online sales 
several insurers our interviews are already actively 
exploring this area 
removing the agency salesforce allows the elimination the 
distribution team that previously supported them however 
new team will have built support online sales 
automation claims management 
while the model online driven assume consumers will 
still need some form guidance over the telephone many 
consumers prefer multi channel experience where they start 
researching online and then complete the transaction over the 
telephone 
this may only for complex special cases but could also 
for routine business where for whatever reason 
consumer unable transact online 
net assume the cost the support team will increase 
consequence greater potential number total 
interactions with online consumers than with the old agency 
force 
the concept here that large elements the claims handling 
process can automated and moved self servicing 
model 
assume higher levels automation adopting systems 
such hexaware and matrix allow for the substantial drop 
levels ftes potentially much 
standard claims and mail processing can substantially 
automated with reduced numbers ftes servicing more 
complex bodily injury claims and other special cases 
lower reserve volatility using big data 
big data has the potential allow insurers establish more 
accurate reserves reducing the level volatility and overall 
reducing the amount reserves which need held 
automating policy admin service 
see significant opportunity for efficiency savings 
automating policy administration and servicing this could 
achieved using technology solutions such those 
developed ebaotech tech and guidewire

run modern systems 
specifically 
rather than relating specific initiative this reflects 
digitally born insurer having none the legacy 
infrastructure incumbent 
commission expenses exhibit shows geico 
pure direct model results immaterial amounts 
commission being paid while progressive hybrid model 
sits between that geico and the broader industry 
salaries benefits per policy both players have 
substantial advantage over the industry driven 
believe enhanced levels automation and modern 
back office infrastructures although difficult 
conclusively prove this point 
admin other expenses here progressive looks more 
line with the industry whereas geico outlier the 
upside presume the difference driven marketing 
expenses while the direct model likely require 
higher marketing spend given the lack agency 
broker distribution large degree believe that 
geico position active decision try grow the 
business and indeed the entire direct motor segment 
the rather than maximise short run profitability 
overall expenses per policy here geico runs lower 
than both progressive and the industry the saving 
commissions and lean infrastructure more than offset 
the company additional marketing expenditure 
assume that well operating modern flexible frontend platform which increasingly the case our insurer also 
operates with modern back end system 
modernising the back end systems should significantly 
enhance insurer ability rapidly launch new products 
and support new channels 
think possible reduce the expense ratio for 
insurer from around indeed this 
view was reinforced our interviews with insurers 
optimising support functions 
with the previous initiative this element business 
model improvement runs across the entire business rather 
than specific process area 
see the potential for automation various support 
functions order reduce the number ftes and overall 
expenses for example the finance function 
particular given the reduction headcount across other 
elements the business see potential savings central 
functions such human resources 
case study geico and progressive 
insurers geico and progressive offer interesting 
examples what possible achieve applying state ofthe art systems and processes largely traditional 
insurance business model although note that progressive 
the market leader the adoption telematics the 
market through its snapshot product see page for 
case study 
also believe that geico and progressive lower expense 
ratio could enable them offer lower priced product than 
peers for given risk they have the ability absorb 
higher loss ratio and produce the same combined ratio 
peers think this also likely factor behind their faster 
growth than the overall market see exhibit

spent advertising

model could offer real opportunities the industry

insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
updating systems painful process 
insurers were relatively early adopters the and 
however these legacy systems make hard adapt change 
most insurers operate highly complex architecture with 
combination systems developed house and various packaged 
software solutions 
legacy makes harder react change old systems often lock 
insurer into outdated business processes which may fall short 
consumer expectations making hard adjust new business models 
see three principal challenges that insurers needs able 
deal with changing nature consumer interaction broader 
number channels mobile data novel types data feeds 
iot telematics and big data analytics and need increase flexibility 
back end systems 
many insurers have responded this introducing new 
functionality wrapping the legacy systems while this approach 
maximises the historical investment the core systems increases the 
complexity maintenance and makes harder react change 
consider what modern platform could look like for 
insurer think single consumer view important well the 
ability improve consumer interaction across multiple channels strong 
data analytics capability including iot and the flexibility work with 
external partners for example build ecosystem and strong link 
between the business and function 
despite the challenges insurers are making progress annual 
bcg benchmarking study germany and france shows that the total 
cost ratio has been declining over the past years with change costs 
increasing less than run costs have decreased 
context insurers were early adopters 
challenges heterogeneous landscape 
while many companies may contend that erp adoption was 
painful once was installed the software vendor was 
responsible for keeping the software date and complying 
with regulatory changes 
however when company runs mix house developed 
systems and various packaged software solutions forever 
fighting integration battle try ensure the various 
systems can share data and communicate with each other 
the insurer also likely responsible for regulatory 
compliance which adds another burden further complexity 
that many the systems that insurers run were written 
older software code which tends much less flexible than 
modern software these systems can also tie the insurance 
company specific processes ways doing things and 
specific and generally more expensive hardware these 
systems become increasingly expensive maintain over 
time 
house developed systems can become more problematic 
they may not have been well documented when they were 
first written and the very least all the changes that have 
made over the years are unlikely have been fully 
documented the employees that understood how the 
systems worked originally and how modify them most 
effectively are also retiring now have already retired 
acknowledge that almost every industry faces these 
challenges large company architecture simple 
homogeneous but believe worse insurance given 
the timeframe when technology was initially adopted and the 
lack packaged software systems available that time 
insurance has always been industry well suited 
automation has traditionally manufactured product 
relies heavily data and those data have been largely 
managed paper the past 
islands automation created data silos 
insurers invested heavily the and the 
time the packaged software industry was its infancy 
insurers could not cover all their operations with software from 
one vendor insurers were forced develop their own 
individual systems with some packages emerging cover 
specific elements functionality 
believe this technology adoption led islands 
automation insurance insurers had many different 
software applications automate individual areas the 
business each system had its own database where the data 
specific that business reside this approach created silos 
data with limited communication between them 
contrast believe the manufacturing industry moved 
later was able adopt erp from packaged software 
vendors such sap and oracle the 
critically this means there was single view the 
consumer within the insurer which makes simple concepts 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
like cross selling group wide risk management much 
harder achieve 
some the challenges this type architecture brings 
include 
insurers are often locked into specific business 
process way doing something for example 
claims management system may have been designed 
years ago when paying claims quickly may not 
have been key goal the insurer may want take 
more consumer centric approach trying differentiate 
itself claims handling however changing the software 
enable this likely complex expensive and 
time consuming process 
consumers are constantly finding new ways which 
they would like engage this means that insurers 
need make constant changes and updates their 
consumer facing systems again this very difficult 
achieve with inflexible architecture both the front 
and back ends 
new channels also bring new data fields that insurers 
need include for example year old system 
unlikely have field for consumer mobile phone 
number let alone email address whatsapp also 
systems are generally set produce written 
documentation and letters rather than generate emails 
messages mobile applications 
legacy complicates the landscape 
demands have changed the intervening years have 
seen insurers add ever more layers their landscapes 
these new layers have enabled insurers protect the 
investments they have made legacy systems while also 
delivering new functionality 
however adding new layers existing systems tends 
increase the complexity maintaining the system 
increase the cost and 
lower the flexibility 
the major challenge that when many systems are bolted 
together this way becomes harder and harder add new 
things 
each time change made new system added 
significant testing required ensure the core process still 
works originally intended 
generic schematic this type architecture shown 
exhibit 
layering systems has stored problems 
new technologies have emerged insurance companies 
have tended add new systems manage them top 
the existing infrastructure rather than replacing the existing 
system with software that could cover all the requirements 
one 
some the new products are off the shelf third party 
packaged software some internally developed and some 
developed services companies custom basis this 
approach has created huge amount integration points 
that have maintained which turn makes the system 
very inflexible 
over time becomes harder and harder add new 
functionality due the challenges inherent testing the 
impact the changes 
there significant cost maintaining even basic level 
integration between the systems each time change 
upgrade made one system which can often 
regulatory driven all the integration points that touch that 
system have tested and potentially changed 
outsourcing bpo the answer 
some insurers have gone down the outsourcing business 
process outsourcing bpo route 
the outsourcing model services company takes over 
running the often the hardware and software and 
manages for the insurer based service level agreement 
sla the insurer passes the complexity running the 
over third party 
bpo agreement not only the handed over but 
entire business process for example several insurers have 
decided outsource their entire claims management process 
third party this case the partner takes over the and 
also the management the process again the complexity 
outsourced

source bcg analysis morgan stanley research 
this outsourcing approach may lower short term costs but 
believe akin kicking the can down the road the 
underlying architecture problems still exist but the problem 
managing them has been passed third party 
however the insurer hasn addressed the core problem 
the inherent limitations the systems and therefore risks 
becoming less competitive than peers that are willing deal 
with the challenges head 
another problem that believe outsourcing has created 
within the insurer own department our interviews with 
insurance companies revealed that the past junior 
employees were recruited for low level work before they 
gained experience and moved the hierarchy the 
outsourcing process has meant that lot that low level 
work now managed third party that recruitment 
stream has dried 
see consequences this 
the departments the insurance companies have 
some cases become top heavy the pyramid 
employees has not been refreshed with more junior staff 
there less internal expertise new areas for 
example digital channel management younger 
employees with these skills are not joining the business 
see three principal challenges for 
insurers 
changing nature consumer interaction 
consumers increasingly want interact with insurers 
broader and growing number ways not just via 
agent call centre but also via email the web social media 
and mobile applications the pace change the front 
consumer facing end made more difficult the legacy 
systems new consumer channel typically another 
integration point number back end systems that have 
maintained this increases the cost setting new 
channels 
believe consumer interaction one the biggest 
challenges facing insurers today 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
insurers average have interactions per year with the 
consumer this makes very difficult build consumer 
experience and brand loyalty consequently insurers are 
trying find ways interact with consumers more frequently 
but this aim compromised inflexible back end systems 
finally insurers would like single view the consumer for 
cross selling risk management and regulatory purposes 
again islands automation and the data silos legacy 
make this difficult achieve 
have been supplementing this with external data such 
credit rating retail purchasing habits and bank data 
social media also bring completely new dataset which 
could much richer and more valuable than the data 
insurers have traditionally worked with 
the challenge for insurers how access and use these 
data could see partnerships emerging with insurers 
even new competitive threat from internet companies with 
their differentiated consumer data 
data new analytics new sources data 
there have been major improvements the technology used 
analyse data and the variety data that are available 
insurance companies increasing 
for many years data analysis was one size fits all model 
companies had force whatever data they were trying 
analyse into relational database 
however over the last years have seen huge 
increase the technology available companies this area 
some coming from internet companies and the open 
source community and some from commercial software 
vendors this gives insurers much more flexibility analyse 
datasets whether drive better consumer engagement 
improve risk management 
internal processes lack back end flexibility 
believe that insurers back end systems need more 
flexible enable better consumer and data management and 
also run and change lower cost 
few examples 
the production system many insurers creating new 
policies and offerings remains expensive and inflexible 
difficult add new consumer channels back end 
systems 
claims processes are often expensive and poorly 
adapted the current environment 
lack straight through processing stp makes hard 
deliver real time information and processes 
consumers 
unfortunately data silos and the difficulty incorporating new 
datasets into existing processes make difficult for insurers 
take full advantage all these new technologies 
risks changing core systems are high 
insurers also often work batch for example overnight 
processes rather than real time and this can make more 
difficult act data analytics timely manner 
one the biggest dilemmas facing insurers that the core 
back end systems are mission critical they are not allowed 
fail 
the iot telematics brings whole new dataset that can 
used build new business models interact with consumers 
more regularly and lower claim and fraud ratios however 
insurers need able integrate the new data into 
existing processes that were not built with mind 
while insurers understand there would many benefits from 
changing these systems they are also very aware the risks 
that such change entails 
without single view the consumer and data from all the 
consumer channels difficult for insurers use new 
analytical tools increase consumer engagement 
from our discussions with insurers and technology providers 
believe modern insurance platform would need 
incorporate the following elements 
many sectors insurance companies have had relatively 
limited data which base underwriting decisions for 
instance name age postcode car model recently insurers 
single consumer view potentially central 
repository for all consumer data 
model for improved and increased consumer 
interaction across multiple channels

strong link between the business and 
exhibits and show illustration structure that 
delivers against these objectives 
structured data are shared all processes which feed and

getting positive results bcg benchmarking exercise

disruptive business models 
date the majority insurers have focused the evolution 
existing business models while this has involved some impressive 
applications technology the business model has not yet been 
transformed 
this section consider business models that 
believe offer significant potential for disruption the industry 
internet things connected devices 
believe that are now the cusp period rapid and 
disruptive change the industry there are revolutionary changes 
brewing that could fundamentally change the insurance business model 
way not seen date 
the iot likely have substantial impact the insurance 
industry over the long run while telematics the most 
documented example discussed separately below other 
forms connected devices are equally important 
use technology offers novel ways increasing engagement with 
consumers and reducing barriers entry direct distribution models 
could challenge incumbent distribution while the risk competition from 
adjacent entrants increases 
connected devices the home could fundamentally change 
the underwriting model offering the ability mitigate the cost 
claims through early detection risks such fire and 
water damage 
the combination mobile the internet things telematics and 
big data analytics has the potential fundamentally change the 
existing insurance underwriting model current actuarial pricing and 
reserve techniques could superseded new approaches peer topeer models could further challenge 
ecosystems are likely become increasingly important however 
means certain that such systems will controlled insurers 
for example oems may advantage motor while range 
players could well placed benefit from the home insurance 
opportunity for example telecom providers security firms utilities 
appliance manufacturers apple google 
this section look potential business models that offer 
significant potential for disruption the industry where possible 
provide live examples 
discussed already until now most insurers have 
focused evolving their existing models and dealing with 
challenging legacy environments 
now are seeing insurers talk about digital technology 
sometimes the same breath referring incremental 
changes their business such consumers ability selfserve online for example changing address enabling 
their agents with ipads while these are worthwhile changes 
that give efficiency boost they are evolutionary nature 
and miss the widespread disruptive change happening the 
industry 
leading innovators insurance however are doing much 
more than evolve they are developing innovative business 
models partnering and often leveraging successful models 
from other industries 
health devices are also likely make impact with 
wearable and smartphone monitoring devices already 
beginning gain adoption 
telematics 
present telematics having the greatest impact two 
specific markets the where addressing the 
prohibitively high cost insurance cover for young drivers 
and italy where adoption has been driven telematics 
ability reduce claims fraud 
however other markets telematics struggling take off 
consequence the cost implementing the solution 
and the uncertain benefit the loss ratio 
the importance telematics likely increase the 
analytics are able demonstrate more clearly that the data 
collected can accurately predict claims patterns 
argue the discrete telematics section that present 
the economics the product young drivers and italy 
support model where the insurer sells telematics 
premium product with additional features versus traditional 
insurance such theft prevention rather than way 
reducing the premium cost 
ecosystem based insurance 
ecosystem based insurance where the insurer moves 
having high frequency high value relationship with the 
consumer through platform services model ecosystem 
among all the disruptive business models insurance today 
believe the greatest paradigm shift for insurers 
develop service based offerings part ecosystem 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
however not believe that insurers are naturally well 
placed ecosystem owners for example oem might 
more natural host for motor insurance while other players 
could have advantage home insurance 
among the insurers think ping china particularly 
well placed launching ecosystem based offerings 
broadening and deepening the consumer relationship 
way that local national insurers monolines players have not 
yet started 
this trend strongly backed consumers our global 
survey exhibit who are very interested switching 
new innovative insurance models both the higher level 
ecosystem platform for managing their insurance portfolio 
and choosing specific policy elements meet their needs 
respondents our global consumer survey said they 
would switch would consider switching would like learn 
more about online flexible combined insurance solution 
which would allow them intuitively manage coverage for 
their own and their families risk demand for such platforms 
highest asia reaching over india and china but 
north america and europe also high above 
consumers are also willing collaborate operate such new 
models sharing the required data with insurers over 
consumers would share all types personal data that 
might required insurers with willing share 
some types sensor data house car wearables 
lower price would drive most consumers share 
personal information with insurers see great value 
that and would share the required information and see 
some value and would prepared share selected 
information 
looking non price related benefits better claims processes 
and more personally tailored products would drive over 
consumers share data around respondents were 
willing share the required information while additional 
were prepared share selected information

offering step change consumercentricity 
the insurance industry has reputation for offering products 
that not meet consumer needs well indeed one the 
traditional insurance maxims that insurance sold and not 
bought

insurers are also disadvantage they traditionally

engines weekly basis for banks the figure over 
but falls below when measuring consumers weekly

internet things telematics 
think that the internet things likely drive major changes 
the business model insurers cheap connected monitoring 
devices offer fundamentally different way assessing and crucially 
mitigating risk 
date telematics the most developed example this the 
application telematics motor insurance has been steadily growing for 
some time particularly italy and for young drivers the 
connected home solutions are likely become increasingly 
prevalent several insurers are piloting connected home solutions 
typically partnership with other players more broadly the connectedhome space note google recent acquisition connected home 
device player nest samsung electronics and apple are also increasingly 
active this space 
the development iot insurance model also presents risks for 
insurers they are not necessarily the obvious host for the ecosystem 
believe that insurance likely cross sold into ecosystem 
designed predominantly for another purpose entertainment for example 
building business case for telematics challenging for the mass 
market date the adoption rate for telematics has been constrained 
the technology cost the need offer upfront premium discount 
and the yet weak link risk reduction cross selling additional 
services will important financial success particularly for the mass 
market where the technology cost relative the premium highest 
the iot has significant application industrial risks just 
telematics has gained faster adoption the commercial market than 
retail believe similar trend could seen for iot there are lots 
potential ways which connected sensors could used reduce risks 
commercial lines insurance 
wearable devices could also become important see potential 
applications for remote monitoring health for more accurate pricing 
life and health insurance risk while there may privacy issues here 
note the increasing popularity devices such from jawbone 
apple will introduce the healthkit hub 
telematics hardware likely standardise and consolidate over 
time anticipate trend towards standardisation hardware solutions 
for telematics which likely result consolidation that space 
furthermore see significant prize for the analytics vendor that 
can successfully combine telematics and claims data quantitatively 
predict future loss experience present hard contextualise the 
data gathered from telematics devices for example for location 
weather conditions and combine them with claims data 
believe the iot has widespread application insurance 
more than any other area financial services 
connected devices have the potential fundamentally 
change the way that insurance risk measured shifting from 
actuarial style analysis risk proxies real time risk 
measurement the iot concept discussed length the

the connected home 
believe therefore that makes sense for insurers 
partner with other providers that already service infrastructure 
adaptable for iot applications for example the link between 
state farm the and the alarm and security company 
adt 
one the most obvious areas where the iot has 
application that relevant insurers the connected 
home remote monitoring sensors the home should 
allow risks mitigated reducing claims costs and 
improving the value proposition for consumers 
however there are some low cost solutions available 
note the agreement between french cellular networking 
company sigfox and insurer maaf maaf offers its 
consumers home security unit that sends sms alert 
when the sensor triggered the case intruder fire 
for example policyholder could contacted via 
smartphone fire leak detected and emergency 
response team from insurer public authority dispatched 
automatically 
the sigfox network uses free spectrum which slower than 
but still fit for purpose the costs are low the 
self monitoring system cost launch although this was 
introductory offer but with annual subscription fee 
only 
use connected devices cars and trucks via telematics 
has been around for some time going forward however 
expect adoption the iot far broader 
the iot also opens the opportunity cross selling other 
products and services are already seeing several 
insurers develop propositions here 
economics connected homes driving ecosystems 
while the benefits insurers better risk measurement from 
connected homes are clear the challenge how make the 
economics work 
given the smaller size home insurance premium versus 
motor hard achieve adequate payback the cost 
the hardware and cover the installation expense and 
ongoing maintenance 
insurers could sidelined 
conceivable that insurers will bypassed altogether from 
the connected home 
note google recent acquisition nest which could 
create very interesting ecosystem 
this could lend itself associated insurance solution but 
google would own the client reducing the economics for any 
future insurance partner

telematics benefits for consumers 
the major push back have seen telematics until 
now that consumers are often put off its big brother 
connotations that concerns around data privacy 
however our global consumer survey exhibit suggests 
that these concerns can addressed over time the 
benefits are clear more than consumers surveyed 
said they would willing share least some additional 
information with insurers they were able obtain price 
reductions 
discuss the first benefits are likely felt 
lowered cost the core insurance product further out 
however see consumers benefiting from additional 
services provided through telematics 
potential for sizeable savings insurance premiums 
instead pricing factors such age address and past 
driving record determining the premium driver current 
behaviour behind the wheel becomes the significant factor 
the value proposition for consumers simple the safer the 
driving established for example driving frequency

accelerate the claims payment process 
delivery other services 
telematics also allows the delivery additional services 
consumers alongside the core insurance product enhancing 
the overall consumer experience

and wide ranging some examples being

telematics benefits for insurers 
also see significant potential benefits for insurers who fully 
embrace telematics specifically 
pricing selecting low risk drivers 
telematics allows insurers select individuals from broad 
actuarial groups companies with the most innovative pricing 
models can identify the lowest risk consumers leaving higherrisk consumers with less sophisticated providers 
this anti selection effect could result increased premiums 
for non telematics products harming the competitive position 
providers that are slow adopt telematics solutions 
insurers that offer telematics coverage could thus benefit from 
influx consumers seeking lower premiums from reduced 
exposure risk and from retention low risk policyholders

should such constraints arise data gathered telematics devices could that much more 
useful 
safe drivers have incentive join telematics scheme 
current behaviour behind the wheel opposed age 
address past driving record and other traditional factors 
significant element determining the premium 
telematics also provides set personalised driving data 
that neither attainable through standard underwriting nor 
currently transferable other insurers drivers therefore have 
good reason stay with their insurer 
although insurers are just beginning use data gleaned 
telematics devices the data have the potential give them 
significant competitive advantage key challenge for 
insurers will building the internal skills capabilities and 
infrastructure take full advantage the technology 
claims management reducing costs 
telematics offers instant notification accidents more 
accurate assessments who fault detection and 
deterrence fraud and the ability settle claims more 
quickly ahead other interested parties such automakers 
and lawyers 
given this telematics has the potential revolutionise claims 
management processes and efficiency and lower insurers 
costs the same time 
motor insurer direct line has highlighted that sees 
significant potential for claims management cost savings 
through consumers self serving consumer can track realtime repair processes reducing the need for call centres 
the ability capture such benefits will not come overnight 
insurers must learn fully exploit the technology the long 
term though believe the results will prove well worth the 
effort 
our analysis suggests that telematics can have significant 
effect claims management pricing although 
far relatively few insurers have fully acted either 
opportunity 
loss prevention increased proactivity 
leading insurers recognise the need manage losses across 
the entire life the policy 
telematics can help them bridge underwriting and claims 
points several ways for example installation the 
telematics box gives insurers the opportunity collect 
additional information such the general condition the 
client vehicle such data can enable insurers alert drivers 
ahead time potential malfunctions that could 
dangerous for instance recently developed technology 
allows insurers inform drivers the tyres their vehicles 
are not adequately inflated 
moreover insurers can frequently provide driving feedback 
policyholders through web portal smartphone app 
thereby encouraging better driving behaviour and developing 
patterns meaningful interaction with the consumer such 
regular contact can also boost consumer loyalty and retention 
greater product and service differentiation 
believe that telematics opens the door for greater product 
and service quality differentiation insurers can devise the 
right service offering the right time for the right segment 
telematics gives them golden opportunity differentiate 
their value propositions 
this turn can have positive influence consumers 
perception policy value and drive higher brand value 
indeed leading players are trying make motor insurance 
more service based opposed primarily product and riskbased telematics with the range services that can 
provided the event accident lends itself naturally 
this strategic shift 
stronger relationships with agency salesforces 
telematics can also positively influence the relationship 
between insurers and their sales channels especially when 
agents are involved 
there physical element the product the black box 
manage also premiums evolve from the flow driving 
data commissions 
agents italy for example initially resisted telematics 
because they feared potentially lower commissions however 
many now see telematics based policies clear and 
concrete value propositions that they can leverage sell 
september 
insurance and technology evolution and revolution digital world 
additional and profitable types coverage moreover they 
perceive telematics way protect their consumer base 
from direct players 
bcg research shows that motor insurers interact less than 
times per year with consumers when selling renewing 
managing policies and when paying for claims 
additional non insurance revenue streams 
telematics allows for potential daily interaction generating 
more data and opportunities offer services and add value 
have discussed installed telematics devices open the 
door for supporting services offered consumers 
alongside the core insurance product that the 
development ecosystem offer 
the economics motor insurance could soon expand 
include service revenues such from advertisers even 
local government authorities wanting better understand the 
distribution and cause traffic accidents 
catalysts for future growth 
given the multiple benefits available consumers and 
insurers what will accelerate the growth telematics the 
motor insurance from the typical penetration critical 
mass possible catalysts include 
potentially game changing forces could provide 
momentum for example new regulatory measures such 
ecall could boost consumer adoption ecall

telematics systems standard equipment many have 
already invested heavily the development the

corporation over time believe telematics devices 
will viewed consumers standard cars just 
radios and satellite navigation systems started optional 
devices and are now more and more seen integral 
part cars 
can telematics improve consumer 
persistency 
think the likely impact telematics persistency 
complex and will change over time 
currently with lower penetration and standardisation 
technology believe telematics can deliver higher 
persistency for insurers 
given the information advantage provided telematics and 
the fact that users are typically better drivers these users can 
benefit from policy prices that other insurers may find hard 
beat and therefore they are unlikely switch insurers 
experience from italy suggests that telematics equipped 
policies have persistency ppts higher than the market 
average 
exhibit 
the medium term with higher penetration standardised 
boxes and data persistency likely fall consumers will 
able easily change insurer leveraging their personal 
driving history data which their property and the long

faster assistance drivers through telematics

with over years driving experience paying per

its installation assume but note that some insurers 
are already rolling out self install technology

issues facing this new technology 
our analysis does not consider the upfront investment needed

could significant and would detract from the telematics 
economics set out below

key conclusions from our modelling for young drivers 
this assumed reduction claims costs looks too 
ambitious even considering the potential for lower 
exhibit shows the break even point for the telematics offer 
underwriting risk from positive selection bias from better 
that the ongoing improvement loss ratio insurer 
needs assume offset the initial premium discount given 
younger drivers actively choosing telematics option 
expressed differently achieving this reduction loss ratio 
gives the same level profitability non telematics policy 
after absorbing the initial cost the box and installation and 
the ongoing data feed analytics expense 
the graph also examines the sensitivity around the initial 
telematics discount and loss ratio assumptions would 
expected the lower the initial discount the smaller needs

telematics discount falls rather than the loss 
ratio has improve more modest ppts 
our model considers the profitability over cumulative sixyear period assuming structural increase retention over

negative for insurance companies this reflects the need for 
this balancing act between the additional cost the 
telematics solution the upfront discount given and the impact

comparing our two scenarios 
telematics hardware several possible solutions 
exhibit compare the graphs for young and 
experienced drivers using our base case telematics 
there are three main types device the market today 
the most common the black box that has installed 
assumptions for each smartphone for experienced versus the 
full solution for young 
vehicle normally self contained unit sometimes the black 
box will double tracker device the vehicle can 
this demonstrates that the business case for telematics 
much harder make for the mass market given the costs 
the technology the requirement offer upfront discount 
and the still uncertain benefits the loss ratio 
tracked and recovered case theft indeed many the 
telematics hardware vendors came from this vehicle recovery 
background 
another variety hardware the dongle which can connect 
into the vehicle board diagnostics obd port 
telematics the technology angle detail 
telematics technology comprises three main layers 
the hardware the device that monitors and records 
how you drive 
communication layer that transmits that data back 
data store and 
the telematics services and big data analytics that 
take the data and hopefully turn into something useful 
for the insurers 
consider each turn 
telematics providers are also looking the smartphone 
method capturing driver information 
the products have quite different costs the black box tends 
the most expensive custom built for this 
application and needs have all the sensors built into 
including accelerometers and gyroscopes measure 
acceleration braking cornering speed and timing installation 
costs are also highest for black boxes 
dongles are cheaper alternative but sometimes will also 
need link into mobile phone for example via bluetooth 
for the data connectivity 
the smartphone often the lowest cost device there 
need for the insurer fund the hardware cost the 
consumer already has the device 
however there are differences between the devices terms 
the type and quality data they can capture the ability

the dedicated black box likely delivers the most detailed and 
highest quality data but the most expensive alternative 
this could relevant say the data leading and just 
after collision black box may able produce enough 
information identify who fault this may not possible 
smartphone where app data quality and reliability are 
variable 
the market tends more towards dongles whereas europe 
has been more black box market date 
estimate the black boxes cost around while 
smartphone solution may cost little set 
software services collecting and analysing data 
see two main layers the software side telematics 
first there the telematics service provider tsp which 
runs the boxes and collects the data behalf the insurer 
some these companies are integrated also provide the 
black box itself while others are standalone once the data 
have been collected the second element data analytics 
the amount analytics delivered the tsp depends the 
maturity and sophistication the insurer some insurers want 
complete analytics solution from the tsp and 
including driver scores which they then use calculate 
discounts 
the other extreme some insurers want the raw data and 
work with the tsp that the insurer own actuaries can 
work with and interpret the telematics data 
there also difference between the boxes the type 
data that they deliver some boxes event based already 
interpret the data basic way whereas others capture all 
the raw data and send for analytics the boxes that 
interpret only capture data per month whereas 
insurer may need much per month raw data 
make detailed analyses another challenge with boxes that 
make their own interpretation the data that the box 
changes the interpretation the insurer gets will also change 
slightly

data analytics here are far from simple data volumes are 
quite large and often insurers will want use these data 
tandem with mapping data order see where event 
happened 
see the potential for clear split the value chain 
between hardware and software data 
believe the complexity the analytics has persuaded 
pure play telematics analytics companies set which can 
dedicate themselves mastering this data 
the devices segment given the expected push towards the 
development industry standard see potential for 
consolidation this could include partnerships between oems 
and telecom companies for example 
from our interviews estimate the cost the tsp and 
analytics around per year although varies provider 
also see another major challenge for the data providers 
and insurers date insurers have made use very small

the challenge they now face avalanche driving data 
how many miles how fast how much acceleration braking 
cornering speed and which could highly useful 
but for which they not yet have existing correlation with 
claims data 
believe the insurer telematics provider that can 
successfully marry the new driving data with the claims 
data demonstrate lower claims costs will have major 
advantage large part the current benefits telematics 
comes from driver self selection which will reduce over time 
telematics broadly adopted 
several the telematics technology companies spoke 
also acknowledged that the overall cost telematics 
provision likely needs fall for the solution appeal the 
mass market 
software data believe new set companies focused 
collecting raw data from devices and providing insurers 
with useful and actionable information will increasingly gain 
importance such companies already exist for instance the 
floow but see their number increasing 
over time insurers may look capture this part the value 
chain themselves many supermarkets already with 
regard their customer information through the acquisition 
such expertise 
that end not surprising that insurer direct line

insurer developing ecosystem business model from its roots 
insurer the company now offers wide variety financial services 
including banking wealth management and other non financial 
services 
ping provides financial services alongside other new business 
lines that are intended grow the consumer base for example 
offers car and home marketplaces loyalty point programme and 
online payment system 
consumer centricity core the business model the company 
positions itself financial services supermarket where consumers find 
all their financial needs through one account with single sign on for all 
ping services consumers are then attracted the platform new 
business lines and offered traditional financial products 
ping makes innovative use financial technology supported 
flexible group structure the group has created large digital 
incubator outside the insurance businesses which has responsibility 
well relative autonomy innovate new ideas are tested through 
start ups within the mother company and are allowed compete for 
consumers within the group 
despite its roots insurer ping offers broad

ping unusual corporate structure 
ping an governance structure highly unusual with all 
subsidiaries operating independently each having discrete 
profit and loss account and budget 
for example the group has established ping 
technologies independent company focusing 
technology has its own and budget financed ping 
group given this each subsidiary under pressure 
perform with the pace innovation therefore increasing for 
example there are lengthy central approval processes 
this approach gives management the opportunity test new 
ideas through start ups 
attracting consumers through new business

consumers willing adopt new technologies 
encouragingly our global consumer survey suggests that 
consumers are keen consider new technology based business 
models and insure new risks more than consumers are willing 
least consider new technology enabled insurance policies 
began asking consumers their views technology 
adoption select sample possible new products across 
motor home and life insurance these were 
motor more flexible insurance policies enabled 
mobile apps online allowing for easy activation and deactivation and adjustment level cover according 
their needs for example reducing policy coverage 
automatically when the car parked secure car 
park 
consumers also appear keen adopt unified ecosystem based 
insurance where they can tailor products using online building 
blocks average would switch this new platform while 
further would consider interest was highest asia 
home installing smart home sensors that alert 
consumers potential damage and also prevent 
damage such water consumption monitors that notify 
leaks and shut down the water supply needed 
there willingness insure new risks with consumers 
prepared pay for identity theft insurance for example 
life mobile health data shared consumers which 
insurers can use detect healthy activities say regular 
check ups stopping smoking and price accordingly 
younger and wealthier consumers are most keen consider new 
products see very strong interest among younger consumers new 
products however majority over are also favour particularly 
the case connected health consumers with higher incomes show 
the highest degree interest new products 
trust insurers high consumers are willing share

price reductions chinese consumers were the most willing share 
followed south korea and the 
our global consumer survey asked respondents 
detail about their attitudes towards new technologies and their 
degree trust sharing increased amounts data with 
insurance companies 
our two main findings are 
consumers are keen consider new technologybased business models and insure new risks 
which could help increase the insurance risk pool both 
through the addition new risks and via increased 
penetration existing risks and 
consumers are willing share more information 
with insurers needed for new business models for 
price and non price related benefits and trust insurers 
manage their sensitive information 
consumers keen use new technology based 
products

the evolution insurable risk pools 
technology has always had important impact insurable risk 
yet think this could accelerate over the next years risk pools 
change due improvements safety 
new risks will doubtless emerge replace old ones areas such 
cyber liability are foreign insurers right now motor insurance 
would have been when the car was first popularised new risks have 
always raced replace old ones 
think that motor and home risk pools may shrink causing billion fall global non life premiums today terms global 
non life excluding health 
this could high billion take prevention 
technology nearly universal and works the upper limit our 
expectations global non life 
penetration and severity trends may reverse these falls and keep the 
risk pool stable over time but would expect market growth 
curtailed medical cost inflation particular hard predict but may 
driven upwards improving technology over time 
telematics particularly important for motor insurance while 
implementation may challenge see the section entitled internet 
things telematics telematics could alter driver behaviour reduce theft 
and improve accident monitoring reducing losses our working 
assumption that this technology will eventually work and reduce losses 
this implies billion lost premium income assuming 
adoption rates correspond those our global consumer survey 
home insurance benefiting from smart devices connected smart 
meters intruder and fire alarms could reduce the risk pool for home 
large portion consumers surveyed were interested 
investigating these types technology think this could reduce 
premiums billion today terms unless penetration rises 
penetration could rise due digitalisation more flexible and 
accessible policies could offset the decline risk pools and leapfrogging 
technology could make penetration rates grow more quickly than 
the historical curve suggests 
liability may change hands some technologies such automated 
cars could transfer liability from one group another that from 
drivers manufacturers software providers risk accumulates too much 
around one off systemic events some risks may uninsurable the 
future say the system caused all cars simultaneously crash 
existing treaties need reconsidered the wording existing 
treaties may affected ways that insurers not anticipate for 
instance contingent business interruption could exacerbated 
reduced based the technologies that the policyholder uses 
impact insurable risk pools 
technology will have profound impact insurable risk 
pools the future has always done through the course 
history identify five major impacts 
new risks will emerge which will need covered 
technology will shrink some risk pools over time 
insurance penetration growth should accelerate 
through better distribution and more flexible policy terms 
liability for risk will change hands 
existing treaties may unintentionally contain new 
risks ways that insurers not anticipate 
estimate that billion today premiums 
global non life premiums excluding health could 
disappear through less frequent and severe loss events 
home and motor insurance result improved technology 
over time 
our base case for billion fall based 
survey the willingness consumers adopt these 
technologies both estimates are gross offsetting 
penetration severity and new product growth yet think 
that penetration growth race with risk pools shrinking 
factor new risks will emerge 
ever since insurance was established industry the 
types risk that individuals and businesses face have been 
changing originally rooted marine cover insurance was 
extended new areas the industrial revolution advent 
motor vehicles and the aviation industry created new perils 
that needed covered 
today that process continues new types risk emerge 
and others shrink the prime example this cyber risk 
explored below yet there are many other emerging risks such 
undersea mining and liability insurance unmanned 
aerial vehicles some risks cannot conceive today may 
important for insurers the future 
have already explored consumers willingness pay 
cover new emergent risks exhibit shows the results

cyber risk case study 
the cyber liability market worth billion yet 
expected swiss grow per year 
average over the next years 
consumers seem highly willing potentially pay for cover 
data risk cyber risk and identity theft risk for example 
currently structured cyber liability covers externally 
generated business interruption excluding power failures 
and internet interruption this leaves significant areas 
uncovered 
technology has the capacity reduce existing risk pools 
expand them with strong implications for insurers the 
smaller the risk pool the smaller the premiums can 
generate affecting the revenues the sector 
the problem for the industry lies defining products 
way that can provide meaningful value for client without 
exposing the industry unacceptable accumulation

reduction accident rate through driver 
monitoring feedback and education many people 
believe telematics about risk selection but actually the 
use the black box has important effect driver 
behaviour drivers are more likely follow the rules with 
box the car 
the categories can afford and refused all insurers 
are potentially solvable through technology since new 
product types could offer solutions high risk drivers offer 
lower price point demand for infrequent drivers 
reduction fraud telematics can tell how accident 
happened which can used evidence deliberate 
crash one that could not have caused say whiplash 
similarly telematics makes car theft harder 
therefore think the overall impact global loss pools 
could partially mitigated those technological factors 
motor trends more generally 
based the above estimate that the risk per policy could 
reduced with telematics equipped car based 
our consumer survey estimate potential take 
rate which leads our conclusion billion 
reduction premiums over time assuming stable loss ratios 
the safety record transport has improved considerably over 
time reducing frequency accidents and the number 
fatalities part this trend due better safety rules and 
enforcement but technology has also played role 
yet the offsetting trend particularly motor that severity 
trends have offset much the frequency gains the core 
drivers severity are 
believe that demand insurance for car policies may 
popular trend the future which could help insurers more 
accurately price the risk policies however unlikely 
change the risk pool and therefore will not reduce the overall 
size the motor market 
the reason why think demand will not change overall 
premiums that should not change the amount losses for 
the whole industry people only buy insurance they drive 
that doesn necessarily mean that they will drive less 
medical cost inflation 
more expensive replacement parts and 
lower number deaths per accident 
technology has played large part each these 
instances 
for instance the type material used cars has improved 
over time and for most insurance companies the cost 
replacing windscreens typically higher than that theft 
the 
the industry still needs charge losses plus premiums 
make technical profit which suggests that ondemand not likely change global risk pools such

water leak detectors can reduce the damage that

technology has also had profound impact survival post 
accidents one company interviewed told that the 
late noticed that its losses from motor accidents had 
increased substantially but didn know why 
connected intruder alarms could reduce theft 
think that well reducing risk the advent ondemand policies could have mixed impact risk pools 
the end the company discovered that the advent mobile 
phones meant that accidents were reported more quickly 
people survived more often that course very good for 
drivers yet increasing the survivability severely injured 
motorists wrong footed actuarial assumptions the time 
some currently insured homeowners could trade down 
covers that attach the specific time periods they are worried 
about such leaving the house empty holidays the 
other hand currently uninsured people may attracted 
the overall impact could fall either way 
telematics has the potential hasten the response time for 
victims car accidents saving and improving lives but 
potentially cost insurers 
for home insurance expect the impact even larger 
than for motor with reduction the risk losses 
would also highlight the potential autonomous cars

estimate that most pools should stay stable absolute 
terms with only italy screening market that likely

increase premiums but believe they are also likely 
achieve that the long run 
ultimately technology threatens increase reduce the 
absolute level potential non life penetration that 
achievable for each market 
home insurance 
property insurance also facing wave technological 
improvements which could affect losses for insurers 
connected fire alarms can reduce the instance and 
severity fires alerting the owner and authorities 
soon one happens connected alarm more reliable 
than battery powered one more likely 
functioning when needs 
unlike motor would not anticipate that severity trends 
would offset this the same degree since medical costs are 
not major part homeowners risk 
our survey found that consumers aggregate would 
switch having smart home devices and would 
consider however would like hear more about 
which means that the economics are strong cheaper 
premiums safer houses the take rate could very high 
similarly high proportion respondents said they would 
consider switching demand while this may may not 
change the risk pool could have profound impact risk 
selection and therefore the shape insurance covers 
home insurance penetration needed 
repeat our exercise show the required growth home 
insurance penetration over time achieve stable base 
premiums the outcomes are similar those for motor with 
the exception that the would need have stronger 
increase penetration than would need motor this 
suggests that the particular risk disappointing 
growth new technologies are adapted exhibit 
commercial property 
not include the potential fall risk pools for 
commercial property our study only that homeowners 
smart device technologies are already more prevalent 
commercial properties partly because the value stake 
higher but also because they dovetail with other business

factor more flexible cover may help 
penetration 
the digitalisation insurance processes the back end 
together with the rise digital distribution platforms could 
have interesting implications for the way that insurance cover 
sold the future 
one possible outcome that policies become lot more 
flexible what they cover and how they cover 
one application telematics and avionics the creation 
pay per use policies when car the garage does not 
generate liability claims consumers who rarely drive may 
over paying for their policies demand products may 
more attractive solution 
while motor insurance third party liability usually 
compulsory other forms insurance may increase 
penetration with the advent demand policies for 
example home theft insurance the chance theft 
much higher when vacation demand insurance cover 
could purchased just for the periods when people are away 
from their homes 
demand policies could reduce purchases full policies 
but also believe that consumers who not buy insurance 
the moment may tempted come this more 
affordable basis 
similarly policies can have more flexible inclusions and 
exclusions which again allow for greater customisation and 
potentially therefore higher sales the future 
the speed buying cover already fast for motor home 
online many countries could become even faster and 
simpler than today 
leapfrogging emerging markets 
technology could hasten penetration insurance some 
emerging markets two important ways 
reducing the costs distribution certain types 
covers can become economical for wider audience 
through faster transfer information technology could 
speed sales new areas 
old mutual has number programmes place africa 
where mobile phone payments are used purchase life 
savings and protection products 
swiss re sigma issued report highlighting that the 
protection gap uninsured mortality risk was 
globally the consequences the death worker 
emerging markets can have disproportionate impact the 
lives loved ones and the ability provide effective cover 
very important such communities 
mobile phones become more sophisticated lower price 
point the distribution capacity emerging markets also 
improves some markets mobile phone payments already 
act quasi banking system and insurance could easily 
find new avenues growth through this channel 
show exhibit the curve development non life 
insurance the theory that initially people cannot afford 
insurance but middle class emerges demand for 
protection rises 
however once society sufficiently rich can afford 
self insure either through generous welfare net because 
the loss car home does not have much impact 
the financial wealth individuals companies 
the potential leap frogging technologies may accelerate 
the progress emerging markets the curve since the 
sales process simpler than ever before and efficiencies 
improve the viability products for smaller risks 
factor risk transfer from one party 
another 
changes technology can affect the liability parties who 
need purchase insurance cover 
while not anticipate that autonomous cars will 
major feature the motor market the next years they 
serve useful example this instance 
cars were drive themselves the culpability human 
driver would likely fall the case accidents crashes might 
rarer but there would risk that the machines would 
fail and people would injured property damaged 
however autonomous car crashed who would 
ultimately liable maybe the manufacturer software 
company would found liable taking the liability risk away 
from individuals 
many airplanes today effectively fly themselves and 
should one those fail the manufacturer might conceivably 
also find itself liable rather than the airline depending the 
circumstances

useful for high frequency loss pools such motor where 
actuarial techniques can very accurate year year 
far more difficult apply that theory cat modelling 
such events tend infrequent such the california 
earthquake august affected near term factors 
for example weather losses 
most modelling now done prospectively with effort 
made near term forecasts for instance risk management 
solutions rms model has both five year forward forecast 
and long term forecast for the probability loss events 
and the two can very different depending weather 
expectations 
the next improvement cat modelling the granularity 
the data used previously location was the key driver for loss 
expectations now highly detailed building standards are 
applied loss models order more accurately price the 
risk 
the moment the best cat models are for wind events the 
although similar models for europe and asia are also 
available flood modelling has proven one the most 
difficult areas measure technically the flow water 
across topography harder predict than wind losses 
the economics cat modelling are improving such that new 
models for smaller and smaller perils are gradually becoming 
possible

clear limitation the moment the availability and quality 
data certain markets anecdotally hear that some 
markets there may clear building standards for given 
geography but the insurer will also need check about 
enforcement well such discrepancies matter lot when 
natural catastrophe hits region 
cat modelling economic because the loss impacts are 
usually very large accurate prediction pays off still the 
prohibitive costs keeping with the three large modelling 
agencies rms air worldwide and eqecat have led most 
the industry outsource and use their services rather than 
develop their own approach this has allowed deep pool 
resources concentrated three organisations that are 
pushing the boundaries risk selection ever further 
ancillary cat modelling risk selection knowing the 
limitations the models 
digitalisation insurers 
the digitalisation insurers has had strong impact the 
flexibility and speed with which new products can come 
market this also having effect risk selection 
the past market inefficiency was detected used 
take six months fully roll out product the market 
now can take just few weeks 
the reasons for the improvement include digital distribution 
electronic processing and better integration between pricing 
and underwriting systems 
the speed market should enable those that improve risk 
selection gain from that sooner should also allow 
companies experiment more with product innovation try 
improve the products they sell 
either through human experience underwriters through 
digging out anomalies the models actuarial the 
insurance industry trying outsmart this new technology 
and gain advantage risk selection
