ride sharing not the only phenomenon that points deflationary 
trends mobility and car rental other players are leveraging 
technology try improve the overall mobility experience while 
attempting solve age old problem autos utilization 
take skurt for example 
autos shared mobility 
north america 
industryview 
cautious 
the auto disruptors series initiative the morgan stanley autos 
shared mobility team that focuses disruptive technologies and business 
models the private domain that can potentially have real impact the 
public companies our coverage 
what they skurt skurtapp mobile app that allows 
users rent cars lower price than traditional car rental hertz avisbudget enterprise the experience appears more seamless and user 
friendly versus car rental today our view recently spoke harry hurst 
one the founders skurt alongside josh mangel aaron peck and avi 
zolty get better understanding the business model and its place the 
rapidly expanding mobility pie according hurst skurt has access 
fleet size vehicles the los angeles area not inconsequential 
for start comparison avis budget zipcar has nationwide fleet size 
cars 
what different about skurt for starters the company doesn consider 
itself traditional car rental company instead hurst frequently used the 
term fleet manager describe skurt platform which connects consumers 
underutilized excess inventory given area the company does not own 
maintain the vehicles that rents unlike the traditional players rather the 
fleet essentially aggregation cars from mom and pop independent 
owners fleet looking get better return their underutilized assets 
hence the secret sauce lies the software and its ability optimize the fleet 
management process 
how does work after downloading the skurt app you first choose 
between having your rental delivered you the airport lax picking 
yourself location nearby skurt yet another example new 
mobility player that has been able overcome airport seemingly high 
barriers entry after selecting the pickup return time and date you choose 
from offering vehicles ranging from compact car toyota corolla all the 
way luxury suv cadillac escalade you then receive invoice for your 
rental and complete the transaction that pretty much skurt appears 
cheaper than renting car from one the dominant players htz car 
ent for example based quotes from the company calculate that 
day rental for toyota corolla with delivery the airport curbside prices out 
with taxes and fees included comparable car rental from hertz has 
rate add the airport concession fees taxes and other charges 
and the rental prices out that excludes loss waiver insurance skurt

appears less than the cost traditional car rental underscoring the view 
that mobility may deflationary and that the incumbent players will have 
increasingly difficult time raising prices despite their oligopolistic status 
competitors barriers entry according hurst skurt main 
competitors are hertz avis budget and enterprise which make the 
car rental market would broaden this include car sharing and ridesharing apps well given the increasingly blurred lines between various 
verticals mobility don see the barriers entry particularly high 
other mobility players with enough scale resources and technological knowhow could also develop such platforms the same time acknowledge 
that skurt may one the first its kind deploy technology and use idle 
inventory such way moreover the value proposition coupled with the 
app ease use seems stand out among dozens emerging mobility 
business models ultimately see auto disruptors like skurt posing 
legitimate challenge incumbent players and the status quo way doing 
things 
implications relevance for our stocks 
car rental the example provided above skurt appears more than 
cheaper than renting from htz car noted earlier not just 
ride sharing that points deflationary trends mobility and car rental 
players like skurt that are leveraging technology improve the overall rental 
experience while reducing the cost providing these services 
depreciation interest maintenance expense remain htz and 
car see our insights piece from september rent car meets 
tech head collision 
dealers there may opportunity for skurt grow its fleet and expand 
into new markets teaming with dealers who sit underutilized 
inventory flexdrive which written about previously planning 
doing just that and fully expect other players take advantage this 
opportunity well this consistent with our expectations dealers 
experimenting with new business models find their fit the shared mobility 
ecosystem please see our insights piece from july birth the 
megadealer biggest consolidation story ever continue believe that 
the opportunity partner with disruptors like skurt favors the well resourced 
public companies with scale and balance sheet strength over the average mom 
and pop dealer groups this should help accelerate consolidation the space 
which seeing increase regulatory and technological burden for the 
average store prefer rated pag lad sah and 
oems skurt and other mobility start ups are attempting solve what 
believe one the biggest flaws autos utilization these players are 
inadvertently challenging the mass market automakers whose business model 
may not selling cars individuals one day companies like ford and bmw 
are already beginning rethink their end markets completely those who can 
make the business model leap from cars sold miles minutes traveled are 
poised for long term survival see our april piece detroit kodak
