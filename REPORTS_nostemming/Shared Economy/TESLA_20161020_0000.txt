tesla accelerating life saving technology its cars fleet 
that will soon the time the model launch travel 
million miles per day each mile unprecedented global 
application machine learning safety the message 
regulators governments are the audience 
key thoughts following last night product announcements that all its cars 
will equipped with fully autonomous hardware 
the first swarm tesla wants equip all its cars including all its 
model vehicles with hardware and software capable fully autonomous 
driving this does not mean that these cars will actually driving autonomously 
first fact reckon very few them will driving completely 
autonomously but the development autonomous car tech requires massive 
amount data capture compute lower and learning connected swarm this 
development must done real driving conditions within many varied 
environments and scenarios possible even tesla cars aren actually selfdriving any the miles the network constantly learning with each mile the 
system can become more capable and more valuable 
accelerate regulatory attention self driving cars may their infancy but 
the analysis the collected data will soon begin surface see great 
urgency from the proponents the technology present the statistical 
outcomes their self driving cars regulatory bodies and governments soon 
possible tesla any other form can prove that cars are safer than 
human like for like driving applications factor even 
this may put the regulators position accelerate rule changes 
required for mass market commercialization expect such data could 
conspicuously accessible the scientific community and the public through 
the velocity social media 
all about safety each day more than people die traffic related 
accidents and more than per day globally traffic fatalities are 
more than through more than the growth vehicle miles traveled 
believe public health and safety implications that can addressed 
affordable safety tech will emerge the primary vector determining the pace 
adoption regulators insurance companies and consumers will all play role 
look for tesla management intensify its focus the role its company 
technologies can plan improving public safety traffic deaths are the cause

death for people aged through the 
tesla confirmed using its proprietary vision software tesla vision and 
not using any party software mobileye 
thoughts from our semiconductor team the hardware implications nvidia 
tesla relationship drives production revenue sooner than expected oct 
significant positive for nvidia they just keep coming though still 
trying unpack the details there are still some peculiarities the relationship 
the use high power consumption titan chip designed for extreme gaming 
rather than nvidia autonomous driving solutions and the fact that tesla has 
hired chip designers who likely intend more than design hardware for 
nvidia chips nvidia quite period and wouldn comment the details 
not sure exactly where this going and wouldn surprised see the 
relationship evolve over time but expect this announcement have 
positive impact nvidia stock price given small but material revenue impact 
and more importantly clarifies potential for nvidia play role 
potentially enormous market years from now for the central processor

valuation methodology 
our represents the midpoint our base and bull case valuation 
and respectively and incorporates our view that while mobility app 
likely announced within months there degree uncertainty 
when and how this product unfolds and how much the market will pay for 
risks achieving price target 
tesla may never make the leap shared mobility model limiting itself 
niche premium brand with low volumes 
investors should assume reasonable level execution risk the many 
unprecedented innovations brought market the model including neverbeen done before attributes like the double ringed doors 
volatility commodity prices such oil materially changes the economic 
benefits electric vehicles particularly when commercialized lower price 
points and higher volumes 
expansion into non auto business like grid solar energy storage exposes tesla 
operations untested cost competitive and regulatory forces 
dealer franchise laws may prevent tsla from operating its own stores
