complacency and general apathy risk aversion toward adopting technology 
the existing ltl carriers are not looking over their shoulders they could 
quickly overtaken 
the trucking industry will have wade through very challenging macro the 
near term without taking their eyes off the long term prize for now based

doing enough behind the scenes for now keep pace with developments 
believe the large public and ltl carriers are likely the biggest 
beneficiaries this technology revolution swft wern knx odfl and xpo 
are our top picks all freight transportation fdx and ups could also 
beneficiaries their freight business are however concerned about the
