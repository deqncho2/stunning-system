one may expect the results are quite devastating earnings 
couple quick notes some simplifying assumptions made 
this analysis first assume that companies behave rationally 
and reduce expenses response weaker sales however due 
fixed cost deleveraging particularly the bear case expense reduction does not keep pace with top line erosion resulting margin 
terms growth rates the base case scenario eps for the three 
companies would still grow but would moderate average 
current estimates that embed eps growth the bear 
case eps would outright decline down average given the 
magnitude comp pressure 
offset the top line pressure 
lower absolute earnings and growth rates would represent only 
part the risk multiples would also compress the table 
below shows estimated multiples that apply the used car 
price base and bear cases average the base case multiples 
would decline about and bear case multiples would 
decline roughly believe these ranges are commensurate 
with the reduction earnings power 
below are the theoretical eps impacts for each company presented

uber launching autonomous ride hailing cars september 
uber business model centres app which enables consumers and taxi drivers connect directly removing the need for either 
centralised booking system for cab hailed the street its growth has been rapid with uber now operating countries 
and over cities believe that the high value the asset car combined with the low car utilisation rate are two key characteristics that are driving uber success the shared economy 
uber introduced self driving fleet volvo pittsburgh usa september 
there strong economic case automate the ride since the cost ride sharing trip the cost the human driver 
therefore automating the ride key expanding affordability and access 
also gives the mass consumer first hand experience autonomous driving which think important hurdle winning over 
the public local government and regulatory bodies believe firms like uber are trying use early accumulation and analysis 
the data produced their self driving fleet change consumer and regulator perceptions fully unassisted human driving 
potential public health and safety hazard our consumer survey the main reason that drivers did not want use autonomous cars 
was due perceived safety concerns 
uber started map out its street data starting with the and now the its state that may share mapping 
data with third party vendors consultants marketing partners and other service providers therefore think that uber could use 
the data build proprietary data analytics capabilities and for example could sell the data uber current technology uses 
google maps waze but this way uber will have its own database and own its own data 
note that ford has also recently that plans mass produce fleet fully autonomous cars for ride sharing 
whilst uber cars will initially require human operator which will phased out over time the technology being deployed 
years ahead ford furthermore uber appears oem agnostic the volvo arrangement not exclusive 
think that other technology and auto partnerships autonomous cars may follow and they may provide the catalyst for more 
widespread penetration and acceptable the technology 
what about the insurance 
under the current uber model with manual driving from insurance perspective the boundaries are arguably undefined uber 
provides insurance while live there low level liability insurance active when the app turned but before the trip starts 
with higher coverage once the trip has started however there debate the adequacy personal insurance for off duty drivers 
discuss insurance this coverage gap call action and strategic plays also discuss the potential for uber write
