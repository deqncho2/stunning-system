hotel distribution shifts 
overall lodging companies perception 
while are still the early innings the direct booking push the general view 
among the hotel brands that they are beginning gain traction shifting 
distribution towards direct channels all major brands reported meaningful increases 
loyalty program sign ups hilton honors hyatt gold passport 
growth and app downloads hilton these incremental sign ups 
appear successfully driving more business towards direct mobile channels hilton 
commented that its direct distribution share increasing direct revenue outpaced otas 
hyatt discussed increasing penetration hyatt well 
improvements customer engagement and ihg noted shift growth rate 
direct web from ota 
however the resulting impact top line results appears mixed among the hotel 
operators and hotel owners hilton believes that its owners are benefitting terms 
net rate across all segments transient distribution and hyatt said that 
members who click through the discount offer end booking higher rate which 
mitigates the impact the member discounts the other hand marriott believes its 
direct booking push was drag revpar growth and will for 
commentary that was echoed host hotels the largest lodging reit and sunstone 
hotels who didn quantify the impact but highlighted the negative impact broader 
discounting the hotel owners reits suggested that they were fine with the negative 
impact they saw short term pain for long term gain 
overall otas perception 
the two global otas expedia and priceline generally believe they are not seeing 
negative volume impact from chain hotels direct booking efforts despite the hotels 
insistence that they are shifting distribution towards direct channels 
expedia dismissed the threat posed chain hotels direct bookings efforts but noted 
they are seeing shift their bookings mix away from some the chains that are 
discounting and towards independent hotels and hotel chains that are not 
discounting which helping margins expedia also reiterated marriott comments that 
the brands discounting negatively impacted adrs that said expedia 
organic hotel room night growth decelerated significantly from 
and while expedia pointed orbitz integration issues headwind 
and expected deceleration from comps easter headwind the 
drivers behind this deceleration given estimated expe bookings come from 
large chain hotels one could surmise the brands direct bookings push was another 
factor the deceleration this will important monitor for given believe 
many investors believe expe room night challenges are now behind them 
priceline emphasized continues have strong partnerships with the major hotel 
chains but cautioned that their direct booking efforts could ultimately backfire and 
result industrywide adr pressure the hotels are cultivating consumer that 
promotionally driven and expects discounted rates priceline also noted that 
believes could also compete price and adrs and eventually occupancy 
drop hotel chains may have more incentive participate the ota 
channels benefitting otas the long term few the lodging companies 
sunstone did highlight that the industry whole appeared shifting down 
terms rate cohorts more discounted channels corporate transient has continued 
soften 
overall gds perception 
sabre and amadeus continue see the hotels otas distribution battle 
opportunity the software side these vendors will place hotel content their 
networks compliment distribution mix but their focus remains providing hotels 
with the software help them win the fight for control their customers amadeus 
recently entered the battle with its acquisition newmarket and continues pursue 
the development new platform with intercontinental hotels group ihg sabre

macro views 
overall lodging companies perception 
hotel companies generally came the low end their revpar guidance and 
cut their full year outlooks longer expecting recovery corporate transient 
business was again weaker than expected marking the quarter row leisure 
trends continue remain solid illustrated both corporates commentary and the 
fact that choice and hyatt select service portfolio revpar outperformed this could 
also highlight the relative strength the low end mid high tier consumers and 
corporations host did call out leisure weakness florida but suggested was 
primarily function the strong usd negatively impacting international visitation 
especially canadians and the rest the year appeared stronger neither host nor any 
the other companies suggested zika was having material negative impact 
domestically yet markets that appeared especially weak the quarter were 
houston and other oil markets houston revpar and well 
new york city and leading companies with high exposure 
these markets cutting guidance instead 
terms international markets the europe middle east africa emea region remains 
challenged result terrorist attacks and security concerns with notable weakness 
belgium france and turkey and the timing ramadan also negatively impacted 
results revpar trends asia pacific remained positive partially helped korea which 
was lapping the mers outbreak last year mainland china strength shanghai and 
beijing continued and did weakness hong kong and macau latin america 
caribbean the spread zika poses growing risk and was cited reason for the 
sequential slowdown growth

overall otas perception 
neither expedia nor priceline are seeing material slowdown leisure travel demand 
rather the macro situation for now seems causing more shift travel 
demand wit both expedia and priceline called out weakness some markets due 
the recent terror attacks such france belgium and turkey but they are seeing 
stronger than usual bookings into other markets such spain and ireland further 
around brexit expedia seeing strong travel demand from the london similar 
response what they have seen historically around big currency moves 
corporate travel expedia egencia asset continues see evidence trade down 
activity especially europe transaction values were down year over year but 
volumes held nicely this trend consistent with what they saw 
overall gds perception 
the gds vendors had mixed commentary travel volume related the macro 
environment while primarily focused air travel volume across the global market 
was most mix shift between vendors was due geographic mix rather than 
execution the quarter leisure travel channels saw good growth while corporate 
travel was more muted the quarter post quarter commentary indicated movement 
travel volume europe with travel shifting toward spain and ireland additionally 
brexit boost was noted for travel july and august currency moves made the 
region more attractive while apac growth remained strong gds air booking volume 
the was relatively moderate according midt areas growth for included the 
netherlands sweden france spain and uae areas decline included russia 
switzerland norway italy and saudi arabia 
what could get more less bullish our sectors 
lodging could get more bullish 
the lodging companies continue gain traction the otas discussed our 
may report global insight hotel brands otas who will win the war 
lodging companies being successful shifting distribution back direct channels 
especially brand could drive considerable upside for lodging stocks 
largely the form rating would further emphasize the impact power 
necessity brand equity distribution 
revenue continues its momentum have long held the belief that corporate 
revenues are the strongest indicator for corporate transient trends when companies 
are outperforming revenue they feel confident send more salespeople the 
road while when they miss they cut what likely their most variable expense travel 
from more companies missed revenue expectations than beat 
which has driven hotels corporate transient demand disappoint for five quarters 
row the ratio was even and date companies have beaten topline expectations this improvement could spur companies start sending salespeople 
the road again

gds could get more bullish 
see indications better global gdp stability travel network volume tends 
grow multiple gdp share shift between vendors typically the result 
geographic exposure rather than company specific execution generally speaking 
believe better growth north america would benefit sabre more than the other 
vendors while growth europe would likely benefit amadeus more travelport more 
geographically diversified than the other two and therefore more broadly affected 
global economic conditions travelsky focused primarily the chinese market and 
would benefit from better travel expansion efforts that country 
hoteliers more aggressively upgrade their reservation and property management 
systems sabre and amadeus invest platforms address shortcomings legacy 
hotel reservation and property management platforms see these vendors 
benefiting the extent hotels focus owning their customers through investment 
upgrades their infrastructure and software platforms 
gds could get more cautious 
see persistent macro economic uncertainty gds vendors have greater mix 
corporate travel opposed leisure during periods economic uncertainty 
corporate travel budgets can among the first experience spending cuts this 
dynamic would equate headwind for the gds vendors 
lodging companies decide face the threat otas using internal resources gds 
vendors are attractive for hotels they offer the opportunity spread the cost 
development across multiple vendors while still gaining favorable brand specific 
experience however there are times when hotels decide that customer focused efforts 
are best handled house and the control over software solutions worth the extra 
cost customized application development 
ongoing threats terrorism provide more persistent threat travel have 
historically seen the travel industry recover quickly from threats such ebola bird flu 
and the paris attacks with minimal impact volume however some investors remain 
concerned that global threats terrorism remain more persistent than they have been 
the past the extent that could see corporations curtail their overall global 
travel spend with concern for protecting employees could see negative impact 
overall global travel volume which would turn negatively impact the volume across

since the launch preferential honors pricing february the program has generated significant incremental revenue the system and meaningfully increasing honors 
enrollments and share system occupancy 
the pace honors enrollments was nearly year over year adding million new members for total membership over million 
honors share occupancy was nearly over 
guests are also responding shifting business our direct channels with revenue growth from our web channels outpacing otas factor nearly five the quarter 
and our share mix meaningfully increasing while ota share decreasing 
our fastest growing channel the hhonors app also our lowest cost channel the hhonors app now accounts for all our direct web traffic and the pace 
hhonors app downloads continues increase nearly downloads almost doubling our growth rate from 
you look what going consequence the channel shift that has occurred our direct channels net rate basis our owners across the board every segment 
our transient distribution are doing better net rate basis this continues successful and certainly plan think the net rate benefit going 
accelerate and that the objective think our ownership community quite supportive 
hyatt hotels 
the member discount program continues drive engagement our hyatt gold passport members while increasing penetration our hyatt distribution channel 
which cost effective channel for importantly not believe member discount negatively impacting our top line fact majority hotels utilizing member 
discount rates are gaining share both adr index and revpar index compared prior year 
those clicking through the offer are not actually booking the member discount rate but are instead booking other existing rate classes hyatt such only 
those who click through and book actually booked the discounted rate 
the pace online gold passport sign ups has increased over new previously inactive members have made repeat booking with these data points 
confirm that are driving engagement with our customer base and succeeding our efforts increase their loyalty hyatt brands 
room revenue booked through hyatt has increased double digit rate and the overall channel mix related hyatt has increased since launch 
marriott resorts 
continue see strong year over year growth marriott rewards sign ups see that the occupancy contribution from the rewards program the high 
see strong growth apps download and marriott business and mobile bookings and all those things are encouraged that 
has had modest impact think revpar probably the range which sense you could look and say that negative impact but this 
long term question for 
revpar headwinds program ramps wouldn think going get any worse but reflected our guidance 
choice hotels 
are benefiting from significant number new members joining choice privileges the results being that those are probably lot those are incremental think 
that net net the direct booking push will real positive for and the long run when you think about what costs you have room booked through ota versus 
through our channel can afford give our customers discount and through the incremental customers get that are booking with channels that are dramatically more 
expensive are going benefit net net 
haven seen revpar drag think least being offset the revenue contribution these channels year date increased basis points compared 
the same period last year this quarter had our highest central reservation system crs revenue date ever june surpassing million prior had never 
surpassed the million mark for crs revenue any day our the amount revenue delivered through our crs continues set new milestones and reach new all time 
highs weekly basis 
choicehotels also continue grow significantly and generates the largest share revenue our distribution channels our direct online channels choicehotels 
and mobile had days with over million bookings compared only last year hit our first ever million day for choicehotels and mobile june 
bookings via our mobile applications continue grow fast pace and have yielded increase revenue

about direct booking met with the folks the brands recently the last month and think they would tell you the same thing which too early tell 
have not seen anything how the dynamic between hotel brands and ota affecting independent hotels the ota search order otherwise 
about the effect hotel brand direct booking push its still little too early tell but have seen shift our ota commissions they were down which really 
equates the fact that seeing little bit less ota our portfolio 
are very supportive the brand initiative these efforts channel shift think long term that absolutely the right way 
regarding lowered occupancy compared peers don think the direct bookings have any material impact making conclusions 
think that the discounts that the brands are offering rewards members having slight negative impact revpar guess that think marriott was quoted 
yesterday saying was about basis points 
initially right now are bearing some hit for the implementation those programs and think the expectation the long run though that they will accomplish share

the short answer that haven seen any real correlation our performance chain heavy markets versus chain light markets you would think that market that has lots 
chains you would see some conversion degradation performance degradation the extent that inventory quality lessening but haven seen any that whatsoever may 
happen may not happen but date have not seen any correlation all 
what have seen shift our bookings from some the chains that are discounting independents and chains that are not discounting there has been certainly share 
shift and maybe that was affecting marriott adrs and the share shift actually interesting way giving some margin upside 
the big chains are marketing aggressively far competitive brand marketing activity probably not good for but haven seen any direct effect result their 
actions 
priceline 
over the long term the efforts the chains others essentially starting drive consumers expect book only discounted prices rather than published retail prices that the 
ultimate impact that hotel adrs probably not going great for the chains and companies like ours and other large competitors are the space are very well positioned 
advertise substantial discounts well and comment there some point actually might not great idea push the market and push consumers into expecting book

lodging macro trends comments 
first you will not surprised that economic growth has been slower than anticipated when the year began 
fact over the last three quarters room sales our nearly largest corporate customers have gradually weakened from growth year over year the fourth quarter the first quarter and less than the second 
quarter 
group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked the slack 
would continue expect that leisure travel going stronger than business travel and that business travel will kind flattish maybe point two 
you will see relatively greater strength the tech world than you will see pick the other extreme the oil patch 
would expect that will see group more powerful driver revpar growth than transient business 
with the stronger dollar are seeing fewer international guests coming our hotels with the impact most pronounced few key gateway markets estimate the number room nights occupied international guests 
comparable hotels new york and miami declined the second quarter for the whole the number room nights from international guests our hotels declined roughly 
terrorism brussels paris and istanbul zika the caribbean and latin america oil prices houston and oil prices and unrest the middle east had meaningful impact revpar growth 
hilton worldwide 
believe that there generally amongst the development community and happen agree with this fair amount optimism and that optimism based the fact that the economy picking little bit earlier 
comments that eventually that has flow through corporate transient demand any historical standards 
everybody has been experiencing the fourth quarter particularly first quarter weakness the macro environment think has been sort general dampening demand across most industry 
the bright spot the west coast and the much less bright spot would the oil patch sort energy patch but otherwise not notable exceptions for corporate travel 
leisure been good and generally sort trending mid single digits pretty consistently over the last couple years this summer think going higher than the average our overall transient growth rate let say 
this range 
asia pacific will clearly lead the world with continuing strength reasonable relative strength china and still japan while japan has cooled off bit still relatively strong 
you going see europe weaker you going see middle east africa weaker when you blend strong asia with weaker the other regions against america guess going about the same 
hyatt hotels 
outlook for group business although group activity weakened the second quarter net the easter impact our outlook for the third quarter and beyond remains positive 
the timing ramadan the spread zika and the terrorist attacks and security concerns turkey france and other locations across the globe were challenges the quarter 
the wake the terrorist attacks nice did see understandably rather significant cancellations reservations that had been made for the months july and august and when look general market data for the upper 
scale segment nice what seeing that the market down about since those attacks and seeing similar outsized impacts you will turkey 
attribute our second quarter revpar out performance against the overall industry and the primary chain scales which complete primarily due the continued strength leisure travel 
the consumer confidence and unemployment being where they are today has really made the leisure traveller much more resilient than the business 
choice hotels 
intercontinental 
our americas strategy presentation last month spoke about the powerful tailwinds that will continue drive hotel revenue growth across the globe includes growing disposable income ageing population and globalization 
travel driven low cost airlines and emerging market expansion these will with for many years notwithstanding the current shorter term disruptions that seeing some markets 
clearly there continues some macro uncertainty the world the moment but have presence almost countries and have one the most resilient models the industry 
terms travel plans think bit steady she goes and certainly seen increase demand peak ish occupancy levels pushing rate and although not massive piece our business seeing 
very positive pace group bookings for example 
london has had strong july seen that london hotels have been very busy but putting your finger exactly what driving that hard right now 
extended stay 
the corporate market has slowed down significantly 
corporate travel business reaction time lags what happening the macro level but that what see primary headwind come into the second half 
what happening the san francisco market and seattle market well that those regions are just not performing strong they were the past 
the southeast the other hand indicated the remarks has been strong and has continued 
leisure didn see any significant changes this quarter versus prior year quarter not something that factor into our performance 
quinta 
some softness business transient demand has impacted our operational results well our outlook for the remainder the year 
markets such houston south and west texas and parts louisiana continue impacted the ongoing effects significant pullback oil production 
coming into certainly didn expect see the pullback corporate transient demand that occurred and has been widely talked about during earnings seasons

the strong drop business suffered paris was partly offset the french provinces but still need time assess full impact nice brazil remains very uncertain country 
brexit which assume will create more uncertainty for the finance community than for any other will still impact the hospitality industry even though definitely early assess the full consequences for the short term all 
know for sure the currency effect which likely foster leisure travel the the low sterling will also reflected our profits 
turkey another question mark even though have very small presence there the situation actually affects the border region and creates additional uncertainty germany was the latest country get hit series violent 
incidents all know and all this keep working protecting performance and bottom line much possible and transforming our ops that the part that control and that the part that well can

outlook for generally optimistic led the positive forecast spanish resorts taking into consideration the current otb after the summer break the outlook for spanish cities remains healthy while the rest 
europe the situation highly variable depending the city mantaining cautions stance paris 
the excellent tourism figures for this year will certainly allow provide more great news especially given melia excellent forecasts for our mediterranean resorts not only due increases occupancy but more 
importantly due significant price improvements that will allow strenghtening company bottom line 
the disconcerting recent events terrorist attacks brexit etc oblige maintain cautious stance bearing mind their direct impact the tourism industry 
the americas division was impacted weather conditions including late onset winter the primary source markets mainly the and canada and high amount rainfall the caribbean the depreciation the 
canadian dollar the impact the zika virus which resulted some group cancellations and postponement some reservations slowdown the latin american market especially brazil and argentina 
was impacted the decline leisure segment terms impact brexit difficult see what impact this might have for the time being there have been some group cancelations and slight reduction the volume 
business travel which can offset the adverse impact brexit has had the currency 
france was also impacted decline leisure segment due recent terrorist attacks 
the referendum vote leave the european union together with recent terrorist activity has further intensified uncertainty over the direction the global economy 
the group has history successfully navigating difficult economic environments given its broad geographic exposure and strong balance sheet against backdrop economic uncertainty are adopting prudent strategy 
protect the group strong financial position including review capital expenditure whilst taking appropriate steps strengthen areas operating weakness 
both london and paris have seen significant reduction tour groups and individual travellers visiting the cities compared previous years 
wtb premier inn 
leisure and business actually seeing the softness market across both those both leisure and business the moment 
not speculating about the leave vote said probably number occasions got plenty levers should wish use them and think very carefully about what our reaction would whatever the 
outcome

the two more positive indicators were unemployment and enplanement unemployment remained steady just below and enplanements were also steady with planned capacity increases from several carriers 
corporate profits have continued disappoint and gdp estimates have also been the less encouraging side when look the gdp estimates with the estimates they have continued weaken 
people had grander expectations for the transient customer and they are just not coming strong 
noted our call april how inaccurate these estimates have been for the last nine years pleasantly surprised see this corporate profit slide end corp profits were turn positive for few quarters row 
expect that may help ease some the weakness have been experiencing from corporate demand 
most you are aware the outlook for revenue growth the lodging industry has moderated demand increasing slower rate growth and supply starting catch many markets 
our reduction primarily relates lower expectation based soft july weaker transient trends and continuing weakness out hotels located houston 
transient moderating little more than expected leisure very solid group which had been holding showing some hesitancy with upticking cancellation and slowdown the short term funnel 
the positives remain consistent elevated consumer sentiment and the low unemployment confirmed this morning job report 
remain cautious industry fundamentals and our adapting the business plans our hotels adjust for this environment 
forecast lower overall travel demand for the rest year 
conservatism these days and most other hotel reits have cut their guidance pretty significantly both topline and ebitda and ffo 
expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve which suggests that business transient demand will remain soft alternatively continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggests 
that leisure demand will remain solid 
investment activity higher travel seems business transient seems stronger and while didn have much time absorb the gdp report that came out early this morning did note that business investment was off 
the second quarter and think might have even been off more than 
are assuming that will see weakness corporate demand consequently push more toward some the more price sensitive segments leisure discount business 
while consumer spending was relatively robust and unemployment low modest gdp growth and most importantly from perspective four consecutive quarters corporate profit declines have created macro 
environment that not currently generating robust business transient lodging demands 
remain hopeful that the overall environment will improve but longer feel comfortable forecasting pickup transient demand the second half the year 
seeing macro trends moderating there bit more price sensitivity and demand has become little bit more inelastic and think revenue managers just need lot more thoughtful and focused how layer 
business rather than just chasing rate because that kind demand growth doesn seem emerging 
without lot visibility into our fourth quarter and the uncertainty that seeing the overall macro environment felt like was prudent bring down guidance bit 
group continues have pretty good year based primarily off healthy convention calendars across most the major markets 
business travel trends which began noticeably weaken last year softened further seems that the combination declining corporate profits and rising economic and geopolitical risks has taken its toll business 
travel 
leisure remains better than business travel but really just okay leisure customers have become more technologically savvy monitoring rates canceling and revoking changing properties rates decline promotions are offered 
international inbound travel remains weak due the strong dollar and weakening global economies 
due the strong dollar and substantially cheaper international airfares the growth citizens traveling abroad has been robust with the latest year date statistics through march showing overseas travels over and travel 
abroad including mexico and canada citizens almost 
citizens that can afford travel abroad are many cases choosing those trips over domestic travel particularly major cities which partly accounts for the weaker performance urban markets versus the industry 
while active violence foreign countries may divert some this travel the dollar has only strengthened since the brexit vote 
rlj lodging trust 
the low unemployment rising home values and improved household balance sheets are keeping consumer confidence high and leisure travel steady 
now while still have those positive tailwinds for the second half the year increased economic uncertainty weakening demand and lack visibility are leading enter the second half the year with more cautious view 
the dollar projected remain strong and will continue headwind for international travel 
ryman hosp 
appears that the industry overall currently experiencing some choppy waters which seems driven primarily macro events that have unfolded over the past few months 
whether the economic uncertainty caused brexit the tragic events that witnessed both europe and here domestically communities such orlando dallas and louisiana the craziness this election cycle just 
the anemic gdp the current mood the country not good 
seen little softness recently the relatively short term the year for the year smaller group bookings primarily concentrated the corporate segment 
there very limited new supply coming into the large group space for the foreseeable future and the overall group business demand beyond the very short term remains healthy

presently see spain destination being incredibly strong why that obviously because france destination weak turkey weak bunch other summer sun 
destinations that europeans used travel are down now with all the terror activity here that having overall effect the travel market can only say maybe don 
see general 
are seeing places particularly places spain ireland etc are seeing increasing volume there clearly people are shifting the places that they are traveling but are 
cautious that this could put negative tone overall least european travel trends 
the frequency recent terror events giving reason incrementally cautious 
the brexit response was similar what see anytime see currency moves and was really currency related soon the pound devalued versus the dollar saw 
bookings particularly into london out the increase pretty significantly but beyond that haven seen significant impact and think for now are not expecting see 
one 
priceline 
are pleased with the growth performance for europe and year date there were impacts france and belgium from terrorist attacks but overall the region still 
growing well 
while recent terrorist attacks impacted gross bookings and cancellations the markets affected they did not have significant discernible impact our overall growth 
have seen some relative strength the south europe spain and portugal have been very strong markets turkey has not turkey has been impaired market between 
terrorist attacks and then the attempted coup some the other markets that have been strong are ireland and germany people shying away from some the markets where 
terrorist attacks have been taking place the past and where maybe they have more fear safety for traveling there the moment 
there nothing that can see from our results that indicates major trend corporations pulling back travel because safety concerns certain there are some business 
travelers who have canceled trips the immediate aftermath some these events but broadly speaking major pullback least not obvious the numbers are looking 
feel good about our outlook for the third quarter albeit global travel market that certain remain volatile due economic uncertainty and the scourge terrorism
