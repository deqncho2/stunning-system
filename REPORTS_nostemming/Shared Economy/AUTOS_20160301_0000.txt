way they value auto stocks 
lessons from the gilded age for investors who wish understand how 
shared autonomous electric mobility networks can take shape recommend 
trip your nearest public library study the roll out the electric grid

technology side and believe cost longer limiting factor however 
see powerful political behavioral legal and economic forces that must 
addressed one solution public private partnerships between local 
government transport authorities and well capitalized and ambitious 
corporate sponsors for the applied tech have reason believe 
policymakers and regulators the federal state and local levels are 
approaching the topic autonomous cars with more urgency than one might 
expect self driving cars the public domain expect potential 
important developments these areas announced soon early 
this year with commercialization targets 
what this could look like frequently ask our clients the following 
question when the earliest you could expect see the roll out 
small scale fleet fully autonomous vehicles public roads major 
city the answers typically range from years rarely hear 
never sometimes hear not lifetime while certainly not forgone 
conclusion based our discussions with regulators scientists academics and 
business executives the automotive and tech software hardware disciplines 
are prepared for announcements potentially soon this year fact 
the impression are getting that there actually quite wide range 
competition between firms and cities the first roll out next gen

what might the first autonomous city look like 
keep austin weird and autonomous for illustrative purposes only let start with the example austin 
texas one the cities where alphabet covered brian nowak current testing fleet autonomous 
cars for development the other city being mountain view please google selfdrivingcar 
for some fascinating details about this research effort austin benefits from mild weather decent infrastructure 
and accommodating local government for advanced mobility start ups wide variety oems and tech 
firms have used austin test bed for ride sharing car sharing and semi autonomous networks austin has 
also seen significant population growth recent years and suffering from growing pains the form 
stubborn traffic jams expect the first commercialized autonomous transport have the following 
attributes 
the vehicles should have driver steering wheel pedals just seats for passengers 
vehicles hailed via ride sharing app from your smartphone 
small fleet number few cars 
speed limited expect maximum speed cars more than mph enhance safety the 
public the vehicles would not capable speeds excess this limit 
range limited expect fixed geographic area electric dog collar the order square 
mile maximum square miles 
electric powertrain autonomous cars must react nano seconds which lends itself fully electric 
powertrain evs also work better shared model overcome limitations such charting time range 
anxiety and economic payback imagine wheel electric motors for highly agile riding 
experience buckle 
funded large highly capitalized tech firms who can approach such venture pure where 
front financial losses would potentially less than rounding error 
the first cars should quite over engineered with redundant safety systems while some autonomous 
applications can cost little car expect these first units multiple the cost 
normal car potentially hundreds thousands dollars including back end software and development 
costs expect such cars equipped with suite lidar radar encrusted with cameras and 
sensors driven connected super computer capable continuous software updates and machine 
learning cost autonomous applications and payback periods 
minimal infrastructure augmentations required the governing metropolitan area least 
first expect the fleet will initially owned the private entity 
vehicles summoned via smart phone app with cost per mile potentially little mile initial 
financial losses absorbed expense the sponsoring private entity 
expect the private entity guarantee the safety the vehicles and need self insure the cars 
the event injury and death with payouts far more generous than your typical auto policy 
expect the private entity guarantee revenue the city even though the initial fleet size may 
extremely small 
second stage implementation higher speeds larger areas and new routes between transport hubs 
airport runs etc can rolled out over time

what for the city job growth and public safety are for grabs jump ball entice group 
willing government participants the state and local level would expect initial roll outs the shared 
autonomous electric fleets accompanied commitments establish broader physical presence the 
local community the form research and development centers testing facilities data warehousing and other 
facilities the roll out google fiber select cities may hold some clues how the private sector teams 
with the community the aim would bring the early adopting communities into the forefront next 
generation sustainable transport while showing the local electorate that they are committed for many years 
potentially many billions dollars investment and potentially many thousands jobs for the local 
population such benefits would addition the aim improving traffic congestion productivity use 
natural resources new revenue opportunities for the city and most importantly potentially dramatic reduction 
traffic accidents injuries and fatalities have reason believe policymakers and regulators the federal 
state and local levels are approaching the topic autonomous cars with more urgency than one might expect 
self driving cars the public domain 
adverse scenarios could cause hesitation not every city mayor local transit authority will accept such 
early opportunities sign off such audacious applications robotics and artificial intelligence not unlike 
the roll out the electricity grid early cities where there was great concern for public safety from 
electrocution and fire risk late last summer hundreds business people and scientists including stephen 
hawking elon musk and bill gates signed letter unveiled the international joint conference warning 
outcomes with threats human civilization not for one moment wish make light the serious moral 
and ethical issues that surround increasing levels responsibility vital human functionality network 
connected robots that can work intelligently write its own programming certainly mayor wants the 
first elected official blamed for the death citizen robot even that robot correctly followed its software 
program this leads interesting dilemma which city will first 
truth data the race let the statistics speak for themselves soon possible following the 
potential early adoption gen candidate cities roll out shared autonomous electric mobility networks 
expect great urgency collect and analyze much the driving data possible make the case the 
general public the safety these vehicles the first million miles data collected even from small 
selection communities may sufficient present data analyzed firms who have high level skill 
such analysis that can presented regulatory bodies such the national highway traffic safety 
administration nhtsa our view the burden proof will the tech firms show that their early 
autonomous cars are not just safer than human driving but potentially many thousands times safer per mile 
than human driving

including nevada california michigan florida north dakota tennessee and washington 
states introduced legislation related autonomous vehicles from states and states

regulators nhtsa 
the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa agency the department 
transportation the main regulator pay attention this topic early february the nhtsa 
responded letter from the head alphabet self driving car unit outlining range definitions and 
interpretations related autonomous testing and deployment the nhtsa will now recognize alphabet selfdriving system sds driver were surprised how soon the federal agency has given such 
recognition this technology potentially replacing human operator such critical transport system 
our view this points the agency desire address the large and growing incidence motor vehicle related 
fatalities and injuries the road 
nhtsa leaves open the possibility for alphabet seek exemptions current safety standards still 
required for human operation through well supported petitions nhtsa response still included 
number conditions and equipment levels needed comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards 
fmvss including things like steering wheels and brake pedals however added that may possible for 
alphabet show that certain standards are unnecessary for particular vehicle design date however 
alphabet has not made such showing our interpretation this language that initial deployment fully 
autonomous vehicles may require steering wheel and foot operated brake pedal that can operated the 
sds system one challenge this application could the unnecessary and dangerous outcome human 
intervention with the vehicle there may many temporary engineering solutions mitigate such problems 
secure physical barrier the driver compartment like many today taxis ensure that only the driver 
can operate the vehicle the sds system this case until the data can prove that they are longer 
necessary 
nhtsa issues federal standards that set performance requirements for new motor vehicles and 
related equipment oems still self certify nhtsa does not provide approvals specific vehicles and does 
not make determinations whether product conforms the fmvsss outside nhtsa compliance test 
the united states manufacturers are required self certify their vehicles conform the applicable 
fmvsss that are effect the date manufacture our opinion self certification provides manufacturers 
potentially great room maneuver within the context rapidly changing applied technology and definitions

fully autonomous system the range costs human chauffer taxi livery driver given there 
single agreed upon standard combination redundant technologies use cases have run cost 
scenarios autonomous cars from unit incremental unit scored this versus range 
driver costs from per year including benefits per year the least favorable this range 
outcomes tech cost replace annual driver cost implies payback period years and 
months given the useful life the machine could well excess years fleet manager could reasonably 
justify adopting even this least favorable outcome achieve higher levels productivity and efficiency the 
most favorable range outcome tech cost and annual driver cost implies payback days 
picking midpoint scenario over this range variables tech cost annual driver cost implies 
payback period year and months while early versions fully autonomous vehicles may err the side 
over engineering and redundancy our understanding that incremental costs per unit for level fully 
autonomous system can far lower over time 
the extremely large size the market for global miles traveled provides great incentive for 
variety firms including non traditional automotive tech players apply the principles 
autonomous driving human substitution the economic model with likely high benefit the 
consumer even many billions dollars front spending this area can rationalized the 
trillion miles equal light years addressable market automating the fleet critical development 
reducing the cost shared mobility from range mile today potentially little 
mile 
the technology make autonomous cars available today and relatively low cost the 
technology for fully self driving car largely available today and believe not exorbitant cost 
premium even when including required incremental mostly the area testing durability reliability 
and cost reduction all which have largely visible paths this one the few areas where there 
agreement across the auto industry the futurists and adjacent market players 
when first published our blue paper autonomous cars november were surprised 
find out that autonomous systems are likely cost significantly less than initially thought 
today prices estimate that the various hardware components needed achieve full autonomous capability 
cost less than per car which means that together with and other costs the customer would pay 
premium less than believe this reasonable premium pay over regular car given the 
benefits the customer car that can drive itself the time fully autonomous cars are ready 
commercialized years expect the cost cut least half with higher volumes and more mature 
technology pressure from tougher safety standards that compel the oems put these technologies into their 
cars even not mandated the government could see the oems squeeze profit margins the incremental 
content and bring cost down even further fact believe autonomous vehicle technology smaller leap
