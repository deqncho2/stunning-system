russian advertising doesn meaningfully grow with muted recovery 
economists forecast and growth consumption 
after major share shift over just years the internet peaking overall 
advertising this means online advertising growth will meaningfully sub 
after strong relative performance search accounted for online advertising russia

yandex share mobile significantly below its current desktop share
