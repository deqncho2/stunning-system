our proprietary global consumer survey which conducted 
external technologies which could lead better accident analysis 
countries around the world supports these trends and provides

some fascinating insights

heavy disruption scenario

voluntary retro fitting safety features into older vehicles driving even faster penetration collision reduction technology 
and reduction accident frequency 
regulatory stimulus government scrappage schemes further increasing the rate which collision reduction technology permeates the market 
the early introduction shared driverless electric vehicles especially urban areas further propelling feedback loop 
safer cars and lower pollution which leads faster introduction newer cars new mobility players have strong economic incentive 
roll out shared driverless fleets removing drivers could materially improve their profitability 
the short term the decrease total claims could lead 
boost profitability markets where premiums not fall 
quickly claims for example regulatory constraints price opacity 
and low levels competition can lead stickier pricing selected

uber launching autonomous ride hailing cars september 
uber business model centres app which enables consumers and taxi drivers connect directly removing the need for either 
centralised booking system for cab hailed the street its growth has been rapid with uber now operating countries 
and over cities believe that the high value the asset car combined with the low car utilisation rate are two key characteristics that are driving uber success the shared economy 
uber introduced self driving fleet volvo pittsburgh usa september 
there strong economic case automate the ride since the cost ride sharing trip the cost the human driver 
therefore automating the ride key expanding affordability and access 
also gives the mass consumer first hand experience autonomous driving which think important hurdle winning over 
the public local government and regulatory bodies believe firms like uber are trying use early accumulation and analysis 
the data produced their self driving fleet change consumer and regulator perceptions fully unassisted human driving 
potential public health and safety hazard our consumer survey the main reason that drivers did not want use autonomous cars 
was due perceived safety concerns 
uber started map out its street data starting with the and now the its terms state that may share mapping 
data with third party vendors consultants marketing partners and other service providers therefore think that uber could use 
the data build proprietary data analytics capabilities and for example could sell the data uber current technology uses 
google maps waze but this way uber will have its own database and own its own data 
note that ford has also recently announced that plans mass produce fleet fully autonomous cars for ride sharing 
whilst uber cars will initially require human operator which will phased out over time the technology being deployed 
years ahead ford furthermore uber appears oem agnostic the volvo arrangement not exclusive 
think that other technology and auto partnerships autonomous cars may follow and they may provide the catalyst for more 
widespread penetration and acceptable the technology 
what about the insurance 
under the current uber model with manual driving from insurance perspective the boundaries are arguably undefined uber 
provides insurance while live there low level liability insurance active when the app turned but before the trip starts 
with higher coverage once the trip has started however there debate the adequacy personal insurance for off duty drivers 
discuss insurance this coverage gap call action and strategic plays also discuss the potential for uber write

the exhibit below have outlined very simplistic scenario where potential savings from autonomous vehicle technology could 
fund scrappage scheme for the car parc the according the who there were road traffic deaths 
the and the cost death the car accidents are caused human error our base case 
simplistically assume that fatal accidents are reduced saving for the year assuming that this saving 
used for car scrappage scheme older vehicles could enough potentially scrap cars the 
car parc 
note that the oecd will launch paper october implementation the safe system urging member governments act 
because huge gdp loss road crashes the working paper based the underlying principles that human can make mistakes 
leading road crashes and that shared responsibility between stakeholders including manufacturers take action 
from our consumer survey found that consumers expect roughly the cost the safety feature subsidy order for 
them install their current car purchase this feature add their future car market the subsidy expectation

alternative and shared mobility over time will see gradual shift private miles public transportation and shared miles 
accident proofing technologies adoption advanced car safety features consumers widespread and have strong consumer 
support 
autonomous cars consumers are generally open riding and owning driverless car for respondents who would embrace 
the technology safety was the main benefit for those who resisted safety was the key concern 
consumers insurance journey improving insurers digital experience notably claims processing would drive more efficient customer acquisition and engagement 
threat new entrants from consumer perspective insurers still have slight advantage but there significant openness 
purchasing insurance from non traditional player 
usage based insurance adoption has been low far but could accelerated connected cars

perceptions differ greatly region age urbanisation and household income generally consumers emerging markets that

willing adopt new technologies and forms mobility 
car ownership and relationship 
car ownership slightly lower urban areas but surprisingly

implications for insurers assessing the value risk 
see four key disruptive threats facing the motor insurance market contraction insurable risk pools shift premiums from 
personal commercial lines new entrants with access data and distribution seeking disrupt the traditional competitors and 
emerging markets continuing grow premiums while developed markets experience contraction consider the third threat more 
detail the next section see deep dive potential disruptive competitors 
the combination these disruptive threats places significant proportion billion motor insurance linked market value 
risk for the major insurers globally motor represents anything from premiums believe that insurers may 
become increasingly marginalised disruptive forces and that significant proportion this motor insurance related market 
cap could risk given the scale premium declines foresee heavily disrupted scenario for example fall japan motor 
premiums significant restructuring would required order avoid ongoing losses 
although motor often not the most profitable line business shares expenses with many other product lines and some 
markets loss leader and therefore losing market share motor would result larger impact than that measured through pure motor 
profits distribution one such area where motor insurance often anchor product which underpins the viability expensive face toface agency models for multitude other products including life and savings many markets 
see the most risk insurers having the following features high overall exposure motor insurance limited capabilities 
commercial motor iii business mix skew developed markets within developed markets mix skew more price transparent markets 
such the and limited track record establishing partnerships with likely disruptors such oems 
model major motor insurance markets bottom both limited and heavy disruption scenario heavy disruption 
scenario combination technological regulatory and social factors accelerate the reduction market size mature markets reducing 
and 
believe that the size the premium pool will shrink dramatically but also expect the shape the remaining risk pool will look 
very different the adoption active safety technology significantly reduces accident frequency given that accidents are caused 
human error external technologies facilitating speed control and accident analysis will also lead safer driving although claims severity 
could rise think that the impact will small because the higher cost repairs for advanced cars will counterbalanced lower bodily 
injury costs collisions happen slower speed not all the remaining risk pool will addressable traditional players due the

although the dynamics vary market our key conclusions the

limited disruption scenario are follows 
see the following trends playing out 
motor premiums the short medium term are quite resilient but premium growth will still lower than historical 
initial phase wave today 
trend will take some time for accident preventing technology and 
the move shared mobility work through the vehicle fleet partly 
low penetration shared mobility which not expected have 
also see miles driven continuing increase and some growth 
material impact the size the car parc there are some level and 
the car parc combined with naturally rising motor claims inflation 
vehicles the road telematics gaining traction and data better 
however the end state will look very different based our fore 
utilised with digitisation under way 
casts think that the largest decline will japan with fall 
premiums think china premiums will continue grow but 
transition phase wave 
much lower rates than trend 
new mobility starts have stronger impact volume and prod 
shift from personal motor premiums commercial the 
ucts higher penetration level vehicles introduction level 
market for example forecast overall premiums decline 
vehicles which significantly reduces accident frequency claims 
however think personal premiums can decline 
severity will increase the cost repairs higher for advanced cars 
but commercial premiums may rise exhibit 
but bodily injury costs may lower collisions happen slower

that the impact will much more profound for the insurers with

policy change the who estimates that car accidents cost

gdp globally accidents are caused human error mak 
limited disruption scenario think that although premi 
ing autonomous driving safer transport method have estimat 
ums per mile could fall over time safer cars come the road 
that the economic cost fatalities the could 
the car parc and total miles driven are still growing enough 
year see key trends impacting the motor insurance mar 
more than compensate for this 
ket these costs could avoided the potential savings are 
sufficient fund car scrappage schemes allowing drivers trade 
premium development still affected existing frequency 
their car for one with more safety features wider externalities also 
and severity trends that affect natural claims inflation for exam 
include fewer harmful emissions and improved fuel consumption 
ple japan deflationary whereas france has higher claims inflation 
various scrappage schemes the past exhibit similar basis 
and this partly explains the difference the end state premiums 
have generally been very successful and some schemes were 
extended due high demand 
however entirely possible that policy regulatory change 
the early introduction shared driverless electric vehicles 
are catalysts for heavy disruption scenario which sees much 
especially urban areas further propelling feedback loop safer 
faster change motor premiums this scenario forecast 
cars and lower pollution which leads faster introduction newer 
higher scrappage rates more investment shared mobility provid 
cars new mobility players have strong economic incentive roll 
ers leading faster adoption level driverless cars and higher

there could period supernormal profits before the mar

discussed the previous section think the structural changes that envisage the motor insurance market create 
significant opportunities for disruptors challenge the incumbents this section consider the response date from the 
traditional players and assess the threats from potential new entrants 
the value insurers proprietary data and traditional expertise diminishes the traditional motor insurance model likely 
heavily disrupted expect data become major point contention the years come traditional insurers may very 
well find themselves forced pay access driving data unless they can secure directly through much stronger customer relationships 
the industry not standing still are seeing increasing signs innovation across the value chain from incumbent motor 
insurers however while many these initiatives are novel and create points differentiation for example direct line day motor 
vehicle repair promise the they not represent transformation the business model our view 
organisations with access data insights and customer relationships are particularly well placed disrupt the industry this 
could include retailers telematics providers aftermarket players and other financial institutions 
among them believe that four types organisations present the most credible disruptive threat and have analysed possible entry models new mobility players tech giants oems and telecom companies 
new mobility players could significantly disrupt the insurance value chain these players could choose self insure use 
insurer purely the capital provider insurance partnership discuss hypothetical example using uber have not attempted 
model market share estimate partly think that there potential overlap with oems given that several oems are seeking 
establish shared mobility operations however consider the impact the size the car parc and global motor insurance revenues the previous section implications for insurers assessing the value risk 
have attempted size the threat from the three other sectors arguing that together they could credibly capture 
the global motor insurance market this potential market share would not addressable traditional insurers without 
the use partnerships 
tech giants explore conceptual example for tech giants use driver smartphone data from location services maps app 
push tailored insurance offers 
oems car manufacturers could use telematics information price insurance products and distribute directly the dashboard 
driver connected car note that oems already have large financial services balance sheets 
telecom companies using smartphone data collected via downloaded usage based insurance app combined with other customer 
insights could allow telcos make attractive insurance offers think this less likely than the first two disruptors but outline

uber potential disrupt the insurance value chain 
uber has vast amount vehicle travel data december uber announced that was doing million trips per day and 
think that acquiring the analytics capacity use the data for risk pricing for example note that uber hiring for actuarial 
analysts with function listed supporting uber actuarial price and reserve monitoring processes update build and enhance 
recurring actuarial forecasts and analyses and select and test actuarial assumptions whilst data analytics core uber and this 
can provided actuary well being used analyse insurance partnerships believe that the skill set could ultimately 
deployed for uber own insurance purposes 
uber currently uses maps data from google maps waze but think its increasingly evolving into data company also 
collecting its own maps data the from the from reducing reliance other service providers 
also think that uber could potentially provide pre packaged data for insurers use their risk pricing models 
uber has access customers and distribution believe that the uber brand stronger than insurance brand and uber 
also has access vast base customers through its uber and ubereats services this scenario envisage that the insurance 
company could purely become the capital provider its ability add value much lower 
historically commercial motor fleet insurance has not been profitable line for insurers with the asymmetry data 
think that profitability for insurers will further deteriorate think that the fleet cars could become increasingly commercial 
nature given the move autonomous technology 
uber could self insure uber has announced that will roll out fleet autonomous cars from september pittsburgh 
usa think that this pool risk may initially too niche for traditional insurers write too difficult price and see the 
potential for uber self insure the fleet this scenario think that insurers could miss out collecting valuable data driving 
behaviours the fleet over time the insurer becomes sidelined uber collects more and more its own data well growing 
its own analytic capability however one disadvantage see this option the potential for cyber accumulation risk connected 
cars are prone data hacks and one fleet vehicles being hacked could amass potentially unlimited losses addition 
possible that given the amount third party capital the market uber may choose insure itself through alternative capital

model methodology 
our motor model runs from where use the observed data 
owned used for personal use only assume that the markets 
for each market for each market have two scenarios 
would shift towards more sharing and thus there would growth 
limited and heavy disruption the primary difference between the 
the number commercial and personal shared vehicles though 
two scenarios that heavy disruption assume faster adoption 
would come the expense personal owned vehicles show 
advanced cars higher scrappage rate and retrofit assumption 
composition vehicles the limited disruption scenario 
example exhibit 
car parc use the observed data our starting point for 
which then split technology levels through with level 
assume the penetration new vehicle sales such that over time 
being the least advanced whilst level constitutes very advanced 
the sales start tilt favour higher level vehicles new technol 
fully autonomous cars 
ogy adopted this can seen from the split vehicles exhibit 
for the limited disruption scenario whilst assume 
assume natural growth rate for the car parc which somewhat 
level car sales none for levels and all new 
offset adoption alternative mobility believe that due 
vehicles sold are level and above 
increased sharing miles going forward there would less need 
for second third car also assume higher scrappage rate for 
heavy disruption scenarios also assume retrofitting 
levels and vehicle versus the other levels believe there 
vehicles which are least level once retrofitted assume the 
would quicker uptake higher level vehicles once they become 
vehicle would move the next level for example level retro 
available 
fitted vehicle would move level 
the car parc composed commercial vehicles including taxis 
frequency severity exhibit shows our assumptions for col 
buses and light goods vehicles personal shared primarily used for 
lision reduction for each level level also assume 
personal use but also shared with others when feasible and person 
reduction frequency each level due fraud avoidance technology for severity assume increase severity between each

lower bodily injury costs better technology these vehicles

would allow better enforcement driving limits which would lead
