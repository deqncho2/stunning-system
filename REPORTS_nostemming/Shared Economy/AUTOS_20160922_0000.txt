the investment significance shared and automated transport the yearold auto industry business model facing unprecedented technological 
disruption starting with the very definition the market itself moving from 
millions units sold trillions miles traveled annually the global car 
parc shared autonomous and electric mobility addresses many the 
shortcomings the current industry model including low utilization cars are 
used day with available seat mile utilization barely 
consumption finite resources cars consume gallons fuel per year 
accounting for global oil demand and public safety roughly 
traffic fatalities per day globally what there were drug that could save 
million lives and prevent serious incapacitating injury tens millions 
people annually what would that drug worth shared and automated 
transport also unlocks the more than hours driver and passenger time 
currently spent vehicles equal million years time annually itself 
representing economic opportunity for content and data worth potentially 
trillions dollars 
see announcements imminent with commercialization targeting 
the first applications should take the form small fleets traveling 
slower than fully autonomous fully electric and geographically limited 
little square mile see the rollout shared autonomous electric 
transport not unlike the rollout the early electric utility grid the 
and when names like edison and westinghouse were engaged city bycity transformation public policy and the right partnerships will critical the 
outcome for city economic growth population development and public 
health and safety while many the full benefits shared electric and 
autonomous ecosystem may take decades fully play out believe industry 
developments and investor appreciation the technological path can have 
material impact share prices select companies even over three year 
horizon 
the industry implications for recasting the global mobility model extend far 
beyond just the auto industry affecting large tranches the economy and the 
investment landscape arrive the shared autonomous asked our 
research colleagues simple question they are familiar with from prior 
collaboration this theme which the names under your coverage would
