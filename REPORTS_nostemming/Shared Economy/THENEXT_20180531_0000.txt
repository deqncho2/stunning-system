air pollution urbanization and the looming passenger vehicle sales boom set the stage for india pivot into autos 
india home nine the most polluted cities the world according recent study the largest urbanisation wave the 
century set play out creating megacities with people further exacerbating the problem rising incomes 
are poised drive surge the car fleet internal combustion engine ice vehicles make the bulk this 
growth our bear case believe urbanisation will stifled with negative implications for india growth story further india 
low cost ice linked auto manufacturing manufacturing gdp could also under threat the world moves towards evs 
see three factors enabling the transformation indian mobility public policy lower autos costs and low penetration believe intensifying public debate pollution and urban congestion will spur more forceful government action 
investment the trillion global opportunity for autos reducing the cost electric vehicle batteries and advanced 
driver assistance systems automated vehicles avs our base case evs reach parity with ice vehicle cost and adoption 
will lower the cost shared miles the small base india the global car parc means that new buyers driving most 
the projected growth over the next years can leapfrog ice cars into century technologies india represents half incremental global car demand over the next two decades and global oems that are investing heavily autos will likely chase this 
growth contrary general perception believe the move autos will add job growth india while lowering the 
trade deficit 
india global car sales now but will drive half the incremental global car demand over thus role india 
the global auto linked debates will rise 
our analysis envisions three scenarios for autos india looking the components autos see clear path for 
india become the global leader shared mobility with evs gaining traction the medium term and avs following 
base case taking the lead shared mobility miles driven will via shared mobility and new vehicle 
sales will electric with cost per mile served the industry tam rises auto related emission levels 
reduce gradually india embarks sustainable growth path 
bull case india global autos hub regulatory reform and falling battery prices lift evs the car market 
significantly lowering pollution across key cities shared mobility penetration reaches miles driven and automation 
gains traction faster rising scale new technologies low cost manufacturing skilled labor and economy open foreign investment combine make india the low cost base autos the industry tam rises 
bear case choking off growth low emission mobility fails gain traction india but the auto fleet grows from current levels 
india mix and emission levels double shared mobility penetration automation absent hence roads 
remain severely congested and unsafe prolonged exposure high auto emissions worsens public health calling india growth story 
into question the back human capital flight

urban productivity and india takes the lead low cost autos 
solutions 
bear case choking off growth low emission mobility does not 
gain traction india the auto fleet still grows from current levels 
and ice technology dominates india mix 
just and emissions double from current levels automation 
nonexistent and shared mobility penetration just keeping

while diversifying india energy mix and reducing imports 
global universe with terminal growth rate upside potential 
over time will improve india terms trade per our estimates 
the cost the imports related the entire lifecycle shift towards 
where india stands relative the world the indian car fleet 
electric vehicles will lower than for ices and this will 
around while china annual car sales are around and 
improve terms trade for india the bulk energy 
fleet size believe the indian economy 
needs will met renewables thus cutting lifecycle emissions 
will close trillion near where china stands today but 
however still expect oil consumption double ice 
given the rise car sharing better asset utilization the indian 
miles will continue rise and thus oil tax revenues now 
car fleet will reach china level project india car fleet 
gdp will still grow but their share percentage gdp will 
will reach and annual car sales will 
decrease 
today just telecoms india skipped the landline journey 
and retail the country leapfrogging the construction retail 
india open economy enables foreign participation and foreign 
malls and moving online shopping autos adoption should also 
direct investment fdi autos rise india unlike china allows 
able move faster exhibit highlights where expect india 
foreign ownership autos and most global oems are present 
stand relative the world terms and sharing adoption 
india the auto sector already the fifth largest fdi contributor 
india and the growth opportunity ahead will attract further investment addition india starts lead low cost sales

policy clarity rising pollution pushes india cut import 
duties government support critical initial stages set the 
stage for the private sector grow for instance now oems are 
awaiting policy clarity new charging standards treatment evs 
measuring weighted average fleet emissions all policy related issues are not resolved and oems delay investments then 
pollution rises india will forced import solutions chinese 
oems with their impressive low cost scale would likely key win

economics have work for evs viable against gasoline run

key drivers for autos 
bluepaper 
see three key drivers for india move into autos 
record high levels air pollution key urban centers india will key public debate coming years our view and 
this turn should drive policy action think policy shift towards cleaner mobility will encourage adoption 
india gdp set rise from trillion trillion according our economist and rising 
incomes should drive sales boom with low legacy ice fleet india should able pivot faster into autos 
autos technologies are deflationary nature and expect car costs similar ice car cost better 
economics convenience ride sharing and benefits driver assistance technologies will also drive autos growth 
vehicles are arguably among the most underutilized polluting 
dangerous according the world health organization approxi 
time consuming and potentially dangerous machines earth 
mately indians die every year traffic related accidents 
nearly one person every four minutes one the highest such rates 
underutilized globally estimate cars are operation for 
the world even adjusted for population india road accident 
average one hour per day implying vehicle utilization around 
fatality rate among the highest the world and the toll rising 
per day from the perspective public transportation airlines car 
utilization available seat mile basis little more than 
overall given morgan stanley research forecast for rapid gdp 
growth and almost growth miles driven expected over 
polluting estimate that the average car india travels 
believe india current growth automobile use unsustainable 
miles per year and all vehicle mobility collectively contributes 
and think the country has the opportunity pivot towards 
around one third the particulate matter creating air pollution the 
cleaner deflationary and more consumer friendly autos vision 
country key cities light vehicles account for roughly india 
connected shared and electric mobility 
vehicular oil demand and overall miles traveled and thus 
sizeable contributor the pollution mix 
india had fleet passenger vehicles pvs and 
two wheelers according our estimates based sales data 
time consuming estimate that cars india travel 
from the society indian automobile manufacturers siam and 
average speed implying that drivers spend hours 
collectively all vehicle categories combined the country travels 
per year miles operating their vehicles and doing 
around trillion miles per year per our calculations which include 
little else then add our estimate for the hours pas 
cross checking against fuel consumption forecasts from our oil 
senger time spent within the confines today unconnected car 
gas team estimate that passenger vehicle miles equate about 
assuming half the trips taken are with passenger this equates 
miles out that trillion miles and the country 
significant amount time wasted using range economic 
economy grows expect miles rise sharply consumers 
values for one hour travel time suggests the value this time 
upgrade from two wheelers four wheelers and new buyers 
alone could worth many trillions dollars 
enter the market overall expect miles traveled pvs grow 
over estimate india share the global 
fleet will and almost incremental new 
vehicle sales during will come from india turn driving

given that the automotive sector characterized high intensity

past decade the autos sector india has consistently attracted 
higher investment job growth higher income and higher
