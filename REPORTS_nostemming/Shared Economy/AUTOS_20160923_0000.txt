cautious 
president obama september self driving yes but also safe the 
pittsburgh post gazette required reading just pages for investors seeking 
understand the role government the development shared autonomous 
transport networks key thoughts from the publication initial regulatory 
guidelines autonomous cars from nhtsa 
autonomous cars are seen social and economic security priority 
national level the obama administration acknowledged the ability for 
automated driving help save lives per day improve access 
affordable and safe transport and address congestion and environmental 
concerns the potential for job creation well job obsolescence was also 
highlighted our april blue paper global investment implications auto 
highlighted the many potential advantages china has over the united states 
implementing such systems these advantages include among other factors 
the ability for the national government move with more speed and 
decisiveness 
the periphery impacts shared and autonomous mobility variety other 
industries such beverages media and chemicals name few also present 
compelling investment opportunities see our september report the 
shared autonomous for our ideas stocks that offer exposure the 
ecosystem expect develop around the new model transportation 
the risk overregulation while new announcements seem come daily 
are still the very early stages developing and testing this technology 
investors frequently ask what the government should help which 
reply where possible stay out the way and don overregulate also argue 
that data becomes available for analysis and investigation the safety our 
citizens should measured both individual level and with attention the 
greater good are encouraged see the risk overregulation echoed the 
president the initial dot guidelines for automated vehicles released 
this week and recent commentary from transportation secretary anthony 
foxx that said expect there will significant and far reaching regulation 
over both the testing and commercialization autonomous cars 
morgan stanley does and seeks business with 
companies covered morgan stanley research

conflict interest that could affect the objectivity

not underestimate the moral implications using public roads test 
autonomous cars acknowledge the profound moral differences between this 
and many other national technological projects americans gave their lives 
building the transcontinental railroad and the nation bridges and highways 
advancing the space program and working the manhattan project the 
dangers such work were real but were isolated the western plains 
experimental spacecraft and top secret nuclear laboratories and people 
working those efforts autonomous cars must tested and developed 
real roads bringing the potential danger the public unprecedented way 
autonomous cars are driven decision making algorithm some these 
decisions will involve minimizing death maximizing survival the inevitable 
event something goes wrong even autonomous cars reduce traffic 
fatalities that would still imply person dying each day roads 
robotic car driven artificial brain will the public accept the moral 
tradeoff will the public ask more moral allow americans die 
each day when there are technologies available substantially address 
although not eliminate these deaths accept such tradeoffs account 
the greater good with products like medicine and airbags many hundreds 
people have lost their lives accidental deployment improper design 
airbags but not remove airbags from all cars because know they save tens 
thousands more lives each year 
the power data and the velocity social media look for complication 
and analysis the data accumulated the various autonomous fleets 
socialized the public and congress within the next couple years the 
first tens millions autonomous vehicle miles are accumulated expect 
potential autonomous car act further accelerate development regulation 
and taxpayer funding the same time see the proven safety benefits 
even the semi autonomous adas vehicle fleet serve accelerator 
focusing the public acceptance and urgency addressing our transport 
infrastructure safety grounds alone 
key investment question how get the timing right when thinking about 
the event path for the reinvention transportation the lens appears relatively 
sharp the horizon months and years it the period between that 
nearly impossible predict autonomous cars are really coming the changes 
our economy and how live our lives may eventually exceed all contemporary 
expectations but the steepest part the curve could much later than 
all expect the interim believe the current car population may need 
replaced multiple times over and soon with semi autonomous cars that can 
reduce the changes your vehicle causing deadly traffic accident 
even the path reduction fatalities noble pursuit that 
according the growing list experts the public and private sector well 
within the reach applied science investors may have accept the difficulties 
getting the timing and telemetry right and the difficulty picking the winners 
and losers too soon government policy and regulation itself represents 
significant proportion the variables that will ultimately dictate the path 
this development the timing its widespread implementation and value 
created for investors consumers and the economy 
dot policy guidelines are not mandatory but have broad implications dot 
released preliminary agency guidance for what they are calling highly automated 
vehicles havs fair amount attention paid lower levels automation 
such adas and the policy applies light medium and heavy vehicles 
although nothing mandated yet dot recommending that manufacturers 
undertake point safety assessment for havs they produce test and 
deploy dot said that would grant exemptions manufacturers expedite 
testing new types vehicles months which significantly faster than 
would ordinarily take dot also reiterated that they may recall unsafe vehicles including those lower levels automation they present risk public 
safety the future dot said they may ask for new regulatory tools including 
new federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss for havs required data 
recording mandated premarket testing data sharing regulation post sale 
software changes 
believe these trends technological disruption impact each stock our 
coverage universe varying degrees future transport where the value 
added may potentially delivered suppliers the software and consumer 
electronics ecosystem introduces number challenges that contribute our 
cautious industry view since much the skepticism over autonomous vehicles 
concerns regulatory and consumer acceptance rather than technological 
feasibility efforts regulators bridge the gap between existing 
transportation policy and technology may help enable shared economy 
automobiles which even with human drivers would affect significant change
