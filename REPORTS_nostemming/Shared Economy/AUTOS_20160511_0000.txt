what they juno gojuno ridesharing company that 
plans compete with uber lyft and other services with better treatment 
its drivers juno has yet confirm any fundraising other than say they are 
very well funded and sufficiently well funded launch new york but 
the company has been targeting highly rated drivers other apps new 
york city for months currently these drivers are being paid weekly just 
turn the juno app while they drive for other ridesharing services juno 
can learn more about driver patterns traffic and speed throughout the city 
before launches founder and ceo talmon marco announced beta launch 
taking place few days tech crunch disrupt with full launch soon 
enough 
how juno different the name juno comes from ancient roman 
protector goddess juno considers itself protector the drivers and 
marco has described the app social mission and business the same 
time amidst legal battles over uber and lyft designation their drivers 
independent contractors rather than employees and mounting conflict 
between the companies and drivers over increased commissions and price 
cuts juno seeks make its platform partnership between drivers 
and juno this end they have reserved its founding shares for 
drivers that they will earn accordance with hours spent driving the 
platform and vest after two years juno will also take only commission 
from drivers compared uber and lyft 
who are they juno was founded talmon marco israeli american 
businessman who sold his previous company viber messaging app 
february for million least some which directed towards 
funding juno given the current proliferation ridesharing companies may 
worth noting that viber entered into crowded messaging space and was 
able find success juno has roughly employees offices tel aviv

going toward driverless cars said when cars become driverless uber 
drivers are just going home our drivers are going home happy 
because they shareholders and they will own piece every one the 
self driving cars we going put the road 
why important the shortcoming the automotive business model 
the very low utilization vehicles over the course hour day the 
average car used less than hour day for utilization rate around 
slightly more than utilization available seat mile basis dense urban 
areas are ideal for pooled vehicular transport particularly during peak 
commuting hours the morning and afternoon the shared economy and 
connected cars offer consumers far greater array options the 
traditionally limited set subway and public buses using every available seat 
car available capacity also helps keep the cost low for passengers while 
reducing traffic congestion strain metropolitan infrastructure shared 
mobility networks expand and become more automated see deflation

drastically reduced creating potential disruption the automotive landscape
