the auto disruptors series initiative the morgan stanley autos 
shared mobility team that focuses disruptive technologies and business 
models the private domain that can potentially have real impact the 
public companies our coverage 
what they local motors localmotors the world first 
manufacturer printed cars while the concept printing isn new 
the industry automakers typically rely the initial design and 
prototyping phases development local motors has taken things step 
further developing vehicle that printed with the eventual 
goal reaching aside from key components like the powertrain 
substantial portion the car including the chassis and carbon fiber body 
panels printed november the company unveiled its first model 
available the public called the swim fully electric vehicle almost 
reminiscent beach buggy price point built 
using less than parts versus nearly pieces found conventional 
vehicle the expected available the public late post its 
launch see below for time lapse video local motors printed 
car 
why printing recently hosted chief strategy officer justin fishkin 
our auto tech summit las vegas learn more about local motors 
according fishkin printed car can produced speeds 
faster than that traditional car the first vehicle produced took 
hours print that quickly improved hours and roughly half 
that today the time the cars are ready sold the public the goal 
print them under hours addition efficiencies derived from speed 
the cost producing the vehicle has the potential being substantially less 
than that comparable car safety obviously key concern however 
early crash test results suggest the has the potential safe not 
safer than traditionally manufactured car once ready for the public 
what different about local motors the management team vision 
extends well beyond producing cars more cheaply and efficiently via 
printers the ultimate goal create microfactories cities around the 
world that allow for the creation cars with the local community that 
entails partnering with innovators the city which the microfactory resides 
develop and engineer product that well suited for the community 
hence the name local motors from that angle virtually agnostic

things like choice powertrain ice and other materials components 
well 
also proposes complete end end solution for its customers similar 
tesla approach not only does plan sell and service its own vehicles via 
microfactories the company plans afford its customers high degree 
customization while keeping the underpinnings its models uniform for 
practical reasons such safety fishkin offered glimpse into what the 
future purchasing car could one day look like imagine seeing local 
motors microfactory off the main highway your city you walk choose 
your base model and then customize key attributes the vehicle such 
powertrain along with interior exterior elements and cosmetic features the 
microfactory team inputs your specifications and the printers work 
hours later your car ready for pick further imagine that years down the 
road new technologies better offerings comfort and design render your 
car less desirable you could potentially take your car back the microfactory 
and get refitted with new content opposed buying brand new 
local motors potential foxconn autos when first learning about 
local motors our immediate thoughts were that its strategy using 
printers produce cars faster and more efficiently could lend itself 
contract manufacturing model our view has been that contract 
manufacturing outsourcing the design and assembly operation thirdparty player akin foxconn role manufacturing the apple iphone could 
viable production model the future especially silicon valley entrants 
contemplate taking major role autos when asked whether could end 
being contract manufacturer for major oem tech company 
fishkin suggested that despite being well positioned the company 
aspirations extend well beyond that 
implications relevance for our stocks 
oems local motors another example new entrant the automotive 
space seeking take year old way doing things appears 
unique that making the case that the way which cars are currently 
produced what most ripe for disruption oems focus trends such 
shared mobility autonomous driving and the connected car unlikely that 
printing garnering much attention these days perhaps should the 
future oems may very well lie contract manufacturing where production 
processes become all the more important would also highlight the level 
vertical integration taking place automakers like and tesla and the 
attention the overall customer experience 
suppliers the rising number use cases for printing evidenced 
local motors raises several questions for the auto suppliers most notably 
what other components beyond chassis body panels etc could theoretically 
printed perhaps tires even powertrains could one day printed 
beyond just prototyping one hand this could result improvement 
suppliers cost profiles while simultaneously enhancing productivity and 
efficiency the same time today more advanced higher content per 
vehicle components may increasingly viewed commodities allowing 
oems further pressure suppliers margin would note that multiple 
suppliers spoken suggest that printing the more technical

components the car still long ways away and that traditional means 
production still the most cost effective approach 
dealers similar tesla local motors striving offer complete end 
end solution its customers that includes the selling and servicing its own 
vehicles and not relying dealers general would highlight that newer 
entrants tesla potential silicon valley player appear less inclined 
rely dealers for the marketing and selling their vehicles this poses 
long term risk the core business dealers which selling new and used 
cars the same time such disruption could accelerate consolidation one 
the most fragmented industries favoring the most well resourced players 
continue believe these dealers have even bigger role play megafleet 
managers focusing the maintenance the car parc and adjacent service
