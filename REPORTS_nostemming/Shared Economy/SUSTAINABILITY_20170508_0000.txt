combining the circular economy 
and affordable healthcare 
selling refurbished medical equipment can create 
incremental revenue stream for oems whilst helping 
reduce waste and provide more affordable healthcare 
refurbishing equipment can increase access healthcare challenges facing 
the healthcare sector are well documented with demand rising and budgets 
increasingly constrained refurbished healthcare equipment can help mitigate 
this problem giving providers access the latest technology and products 
heavily discounted prices average this could also help towards the 
achievement sustainable development goal sdg good health and 
wellbeing 
and have positive environmental benefits technology rapidly changing 
making certain types healthcare equipment out date before all its 
components have reached end life updating the software replacing worn 
parts and then reselling the machines the amount waste sent landfill can 
reduced sdg responsible consumption and production there are 
also resource savings from refurbishing versus manufacturing new machine 
whilst driving incremental revenue stream for oems there little 
disclosure the revenues generated from this area medical devices but one 
study tforg estimates cagr ensuring quality 
service and customer safety paramount and oems typically offer post sale 
warranties 
philips the most explicit its approach the circular economy with 
revenues generated from this area growth yoy and targeted 
for its diamond select range refurbished products important part 
this strategy other elements include incorporating recycled materials into its 
products and philips retaining ownership the products whilst they are being 
used order maximise efficiency and duration service 
other companies offering refurbished medical equipment include siemens 
and johnson johnson our research suggests imaging systems ultrasound

executive summary 
expanding and ageing population combined with rapid growth non communicable 
diseases are putting pressure healthcare budgets healthcare percentage gdp 
has been rising globally most notably from the between the outlook for capital expenditure the healthcare sector mixed globally 
recent alphawise survey hospital executives showed substantial drop 
capex spending expectations from this may due 
uncertainty over the potential repeal replacement the affordable care act though 
our analysts believe that cutting operating costs hospitals more focus than 
capital costs however focus healthcare may pressuring hospitals delay 
capital spending other categories our analysts continue prefer profit centric 
capital exposure which can tied procedure volumes and replacement cycles 
rather than capital that primarily tied facility discretion for more detail see 
hospital survey aca faded its impact didn 
europe across europe capital expenditure the healthcare sector heavily linked 
gdp growth and the economic outlook particularly given the dominance government 
funded healthcare schemes and compulsory health insurance schemes medical savings 
accounts recent commentary from companies active the healthcare equipment 
sector suggests flat market terms capex spend the election uncertainty across 
the also has negative influence the outlook for the sector 
emerging markets there appears significant untapped opportunity for 
healthcare equipment emerging markets however economic slowdowns and 
currency headwinds will impact realised growth such our european medtech 
analysts believe that the current high single digit growth more likely longer term 
rather than return double digit growth

one way help with the provision more affordable healthcare the purchase 
refurbished machines and equipment rather than brand new equivalents these 
products can sold with warranties and post sale servicing giving customers 
confidence over safety and reliability they are also typically installed with the latest 
software and can even adapted the customer own specification 
the refurbished medical equipment market expected grow cagr 
until reach around according medtech business intelligence 
providers tforg north america and europe currently dominate but emerging markets 
should grow quickly the coming years this could contributor achieving the 
sustainable development goal good health and wellbeing 
the stages refurbishing imaging system 
the equipment stripped apart basic frame all the parts are inspected with 
some scrapped everything cleaned used parts are reworked and some new 
ones are added software upgraded the customer specification the machine 
then reconstructed before being put through the oem own quality tests which 
are identical those for new systems finally each refurbished machine 
checked and signed off for safety image quality performance functionality and 
appearance these refurbished machines typically have warranties the same 
duration new machine 
the benefits for the companies offering refurbished equipment are 
new customer base time tightening budgets refurbished machines may allow 
new customers access with prices cheaper than new versions 
cost efficiencies there are benefits for oems too with many the components 
machine still able used current end life refurbishing machines cheaper 
than manufacturing them from new 
plus there are social and environmental benefits discussed above refurbished 
healthcare equipment and systems offer more affordable way healthcare thus 
potentially increasing the population accessed addition reduces the volume 
waste send landfill helping the shift towards circular economy sustainability the 
shift circular economy mar 
one the key challenges though perception over what refurbished healthcare 
machine actually now with all markets there risk huge variation 
standards depending how the machine has been sourced and serviced ready for 
reuse many people may perceive used products out date not performing 
their optimum level 
there are number players the refurbished medical device market including oems 
independent service organizations isos healthcare facilities clinical engineers and 
technology professionals whilst all these groups have highly competent expert 
personnel there also risk equipment being refurbished untrained individuals 
using inadequate replacement parts the the fda has been considering whether 
refurbishing reconditioning rebuilding remarketing remanufacturing and servicing 
medical devices needs regulated more closely ensure safety standards whilst 
keeping the equipment affordable for healthcare providers 
not all types medical equipment are going suitable for refurbishment 
believe high ticket items with multiple components that can used and replaced 
are most suitable for post use refurbishment and resale more and more healthcare 
providers aim implement technology into their treatments there also need 
able update software the latest version that the machines and equipment 
aren out date our assessment the characteristics the different sub sectors 
suggests that imaging the product category that has far seen the most successful 
adoption refurbished machinery business model however other product lines also 
are being refurbished post use show below 
philips has set target generating revenues from circular products and 
solutions with achieved and this implies that the 
circular economy revenues increased and based our analyst 
forecasts for achieving the target requires cagr between important part this the sale refurbished products systems and
