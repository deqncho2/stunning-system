are adding equipment and drivers still behind 
our customers demands flatbed good for the 
time year 
capacity tight contract rates moving the 
range spot market out control rates 
much over the same cost last year 
years this business have never seen 
anything like this many our spot rates have more 
than doubled the past two weeks takes times 
much effort book loads and even then 
often more about cost mitigation than fit are 
finding shipper customers limber and 
accommodating rate and schedule 
capacity tight and great many carriers waited 
until the last minute comply with eld those 
carriers are struggling make the same runs they 
were making 
flatbed experiencing typical surge the beginning 
the year heightened weather delays 
market will stay tight supply will not ramp 
much the past demand keeps growing and 
demand stalls will still against backdrop 
tight supply 
never seen anything like this 
have not seen the winter slowdown this year 
flatbeds 
the market continues tight with relief 
sight 
rates being offered are higher than have 
experienced the past our brokerage division has 
witnessed capacity shrink and faces daily struggle 
secure equipment while maintaining our projected 
profits 
thought the polar vortex was bad but 
between the hurricanes and eld mind boggling 
how much carriers and brokers are using those issues 
platform for incredible rate increases carriers 
always use climatic and rule changes 
opportunity for the throat rate increases 
when things soften never goes back where 
was 
the market tighter than ever experienced 
are paying premiums what would 
considered historically normal carrier rates this 
should subside the holiday and weather impacts 
fade but eld have definitely set new rate 
standard 
shippers are finally waking the fact that they 
need shippers choice carriers have 
many more choices today 
market extremely tight across entire country 
brokerage capacity extremely tight and carriers are 
even not wanting commit additional volumes 
the open truck market out control capacity 
all time low and prices are astronomical 
the quarter was excellent but demand the first 
two weeks january typically quiet period has 
been the strongest more than years just 
announced our second substantial driver pay 
increase the last couple years smart shippers 
know allow increase their truckload 
budget this year 
looks like and brokerage carriers are feeling 
some pain from the eld mandate and the tightening 
the market since seen more asset carriers take 
the lead our business 
the truckload market appears tight was 
during peak tender acceptance seems falling 
since most carriers are looking for increases rates 
are seeing only minimal let following the big 
rates busy trucks that experienced right before 
christmas also the bids starting win often 
have rates that thought were going take out 
the running they too high meanwhile 
simply cannot find enough drivers who want run 
all this extra freight 
january truck supply tight which not unexpected 
unusual for this time year unclear how 
much weather related and volume hangover 
from the holidays when customers were not 
receiving versus ongoing market changes due 
driver shortages elds other factors 
there has been january lull the market eld 
have further tightened the market more than people 
are expecting runs that drivers were pushing one 
day are now taking two reducing the number 
turns driver can week 
the refrigerated truck market the tightest have 
ever seen and have been this industry for 
years 
the worst market for shippers that have seen 
many years 
are experiencing short term hope uptick 
spot pricing our contractual stable 
carriers brokers seem think that this just 
temporary certainly hope but have taken 
precautions substantially increasing our assetbased carrier inventory
