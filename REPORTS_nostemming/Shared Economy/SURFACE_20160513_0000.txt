what the retailers are saying 
summary key take aways from the conference 
wal mart senior director international saeed anslow 
online grocery key strategy for wal mart and growth driver according anslow who said that 
achieving transformational change capitalise this growth around the customer before retailers 
operated push model supply chain where they anticipated demand then determine supply this has 
however changed pull model where supply provided response customer demand helping 
minimise inventory carry 
understanding consumer behaviour and catering for their preferences vital wal mart expects 
multichannelling become retailing customers are channel agnostic consideration must also given for 
differences geographical markets for both consumer choices and physical infrastructure and thus the most 
suitable delivery options for example china thinks online shopping will mainly mobile driven given 
high use mobile phones therefore there straight app approach desktops china also has relatively 
low car ownership and focus pick delivery and use trikes japan large buildings provide 
challenges there need for real innovation delivery options anslow noted one model cannot 
work across the globe having the right people with local knowledge and insights crucial the 
last mile will require spectrum delivery offerings different markets 
his view that important play strengths and with great physical assets possible win the 
intersection physical and digital world said wal mart open working with tech start ups and 
innovate 
ocado chairman lord stuart rose 
before customer was considered king now they are master the universe lord rose view was 
that companies have historically been complacent and inward looking but that innovation and entrepreneurs 
are the rise instacart the such sees massive overcapacity rising costs wider choices for 
consumers and deflation among retailers said the hierarchy needs has changed demand for clothes has 
declined and now the focus more creating lifestyles with more income spent travel and mobiles with 
more demanding customers there great need respond and innovate believes the rate change 
accelerating and important look every trend anticipate think like consumers and look every 
demographic change making very dangerous stand still 
ocado testing the use automated robots its andover site where army robots will move around 
compact vertical stacked structure called hive replace the human picking system the robots will move 
along the crates and rails grabbing items then delivered human who will pack the items for delivery

provider demand software service solutions for logistic intensive businesses 
descartes conducted benchmarking study and found that home delivery technology has become 
important part the omni channel strategy retailers from survey the most important priority for 
retailers was improve the overall customer experience jones said they found consumers will pay for 
differentiated convenience and that free overstated value added services helps generate incremental 
revenues and making value added services easy access should help drive sell through descartes notes key 
examples value added services installation removal and returns most cited delivery fee but 
incremental charges for basic installation and delivery and free delivery but charged incrementally for value 
added services and premium delivery windows 
descartes also highlights the notion dynamic booking static booking where the consumer given 
unique delivery choices based upon their delivery address products and services being bought delivery 
network capacity and orders already the booking system they believe omni channel the next big 
opportunity and has just seamless the back end the front end dynamic pricing based 
customer stratification was also discussed though retailers said yes this examples include 
customer stratification based customer loyalty program and historical spend basket size and dynamic 
pricing uber style taking into account time day capacity constraints and costs serve that customer key 
question raised whether customers would want selective pricing

corbelin agreed that the key with home delivery manage expectations believes amazon really 
driving growth the commerce market and people are aware speed reaction key what relayed 
the otto group companies the need for decentralisation minimise idle time focus should speed and

pressures website orders believes managing expectations vital allow more time operations clear 
backlogs 
collect ceo neil ashworth 
click and collect provides essentially the free delivery option retailer portfolio according ashworth 
with the reaching full employment there need deliver weekends and evenings which can create 
immense pressure and stretch resources unevenly believes click and collect services provide ideal service 
for customers pick delivery and time that suits them but reliability key 
shopdirect head logistics paul miller 
shopdirect pure play online retailer miller believes convenience and comfort from shopping online 
influence consumers hedge their bets with orders given ability simply just return the item doesn 
fit not right returns are therefore fundamental part the shopping experience for customer satisfaction 
and confidence the experience think retailers tailers should make returns accessible simple and free 
and notes that important that retailers have efficient and cost effective reverse logistics flow especially 
returns options are necessary for statutory requirements

innovation 
advances technology and more connected world have paved the way for innovative solutions problems 
the rise the sharing economy and versatile business models enter into growing markets 
with the parcels delivery market being very attractive given ongoing growth volumes and now further 
fuelled mobile generation entrepreneurs are being drawn this industry additionally delivery firms want 
reduce the costs given pricing and margin pressures have seen companies test and trial the use drones 
facilitate local delivery amazon google dhl walmart robots are also being tested help streamline 
activities warehouses amazon the and ocado testing robots described above but now have 
also come across the possibility firms using robots for the last mile 
sharing economy giants such uber have proved the openness people using such services and thus 
seems have somewhat inspired start ups replicate this collaborative eco system the delivery market 
where they see opportunity connect people and transfer goods via matching platform this likely 
target the and market segments understand however that potential regulatory and legal approvals 
may needed such businesses are reach critical scale 
summary key take aways 
delivery disruptors crowd sourcing peer peer delivery 
nimber ceo ari kestin 
nimber norwegian company which began operations years ago kestin said the business was 
inspired the concept that everyone going destination and there existing capacity spare capacity 
nimber provides connecting platform where customers who wish send product can 
post your delivery receive offers bringers will contact you with offers when they can deliver your 
shipment strike deal agree details about pickup and delivery choose bringer 
likewise those who wish make money from commute can 
introduce yourself tell nimber bit about yourself fill out profile for the community meet you tell 
nimber where you are going and make offer send offer the sender and make deal 
the rationale this model monetise movements and solve problem kestin said people like help 
each other but trust key issue solve and fundamental the success the platform however allows the 
community judge each other nimber insures every item and mainly focused intra country 
travel nimber sees differences consumer behaviour across geographics most items delivered have been 
furniture mobile phones tyres and the hard package item 
kestin sees potential for nimber considered access partner branded disrupter and could 
work with the likes dhl ups tnt their last mile and even have direct partnership with retailers 
nimber monetises the business via transaction fee however the company acknowledges there work 
done resolve potential regulatory and financial issues regarding the business transactions nimber said 
currently liaising with hmrc for example

piggybee began operations and operates similar model nimber but focused international and 
long distance shipments and purchases currently piggybee free service which takes commission 
transactions various revenue streams have been considered such subscriptions but for now the number 
priority grow its community 
vuylsteke said piggybee focus the market the market currently proves challenging 
tap into given need guaranteed reliability scale must achieved obtain critical mass provide regular 
and reliable services for major retailers 
said trust and safety also key priority provide security and build trust the company rates users 
and enables users mention their reputation profiles from traity and famust sites that help verify 
users these platforms gather all the comments and ratings received popular collaborative websites 
ebay carpooling etc and verify the identity users email check passport telephone number and different 
social networks accounts more background checks maybe possible but are expensive said they could 
implemented once the company scales and starts generate revenues 
vuylsteke said legal issues pose one the biggest challenges overcome for example restrictive rules that 
govern the transportation goods cross border but the company cites lobbying efforts the likes uber and 
others change laws which thinks seem inflexible and not applicable for the sharing economy business 
model piggybee joining forces with other crowd sourcing businesses help place pressure change laws

dhl frieght ceo dhl freight sweden peter hesslin 
hesslin said traditional retail hasn been growing but commerce creating new volumes dhl open 
crowd sourcing widely but level trust needed which very difficult dhl has already tested crowdsourcing stockholm via myways platform which was piloted back customers can use the myways 
app arrange deliveries city residents and facilitated through dhl freight network service points 
stockholm where mywayers can pick the parcel the service point showing only his her and giving 
the parcel number the mywayer delivers the parcel the recipient and any time they can talk the 
recipient via myways chat once the parcel handed over the mywayer earns points credit which can 
turned into cash and paid directly into bank account the tariff structure decided between the mywayer and 
consumer crowd logistics particularly appeal university students provides easy way make money 
peter does not think drones will take over the industry they have purpose but not majority thinks you 
can hide away from innovation and driverless trucks are here the shift from places pressure 
the conventional delivery windows people aren home innovation the last mile needed and 
can already been seen the rise asia gogovan lalamove and uber cargo

shared network last mile 
was unanimous amongst postal players that last mile costs must reduced stay sustainable however 
was debated that there one solution for the last mile and such the aim should manage the last 
mile costs the best way possible additionally customer expectations have boundaries this also needs 
managed walter trezek ceo consultancy document exchange commented that demanding 
consumers are increasing the need for consolidation and this highlights the need for shared collaborative 
network especially digital economy 
are moving towards highly connected infrastructure vehicles connected within the network and social 
media sensors attached vehicles can used help with better fleet management and route optimisation 
this should consequently help increase convenience and quality service offerings and help maximise 
shipment density big data will help drive optimisation the delivery chain management providing the most 
cost effective and efficient offering for the consumer 
collaborative networks potential way forward 
document exchange ceo walter trezek 
tezek pointed out are now data driven environment previously items were delivered then data was 
received this has now reversed data will received first and then the parcels this can seen the example 
the ability consumers track their parcels before arrives trezek commented that the internet 
things logistics will evolve items are gaining more intelligence additionally with personal data couriers will 
essentially becomes trusted services providers 
the universal postal union upu special agency the tasked with regulating the universal postal 
services and ensuring efficient and accessible for the entire global population the postal industry has seen 
structural change with declining mail volumes growth domestic and cross border parcel volumes thanks 
growth commerce this has consequently required change the global postal network and need for 
digital infrastructure items can exchanged marginal costs 
trezek highlighted that the new communications logistics industry rapidly growing thanks boundaries 
being broken down between sectors such postal logistics telecommunications commerce marketing 
electronic delivery and multichannel communications market thus requiring more innovative and 
collaborative network his view that delivery model digital economy which consists competing 
monopolies reserved areas interest and closed standards has future demands consumers are driving 
the need for consolidation and shared logistics space 
emerging model lead growth delivery chain management particularly the last mile where 
the delivery service provider selected based ability meet customer delivery preferences discussed 
gfs above this requires data exchanges between online retailers and delivery firms will therefore also 
lead transparent tariffs 
according trezek the delivery the final product the most important and who delivers the first 
mile second and third does not actually matter long the service fulfilled this leads the notion 
creating collaborative network where traditional players can more frequently outsource the last mile local
