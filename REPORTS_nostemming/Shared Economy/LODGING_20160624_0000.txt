lodging industry specifically around the relationship between otas and 
hotels and hotel branding general has researched and wrote

travelers likely for grabs between otas and hotel brands 
dev estimates that travelers are brand loyal based analysis 
that similar proportion are willing automatically book hotel after 
staying and supported the fact that people say they wouldn stay 
hotel wasn for that brand loyalty program also estimates 
travelers are brand agnostic and loyal otas given the otas market 
share and estimate how frequently people use otas for travel research 
this leaves travelers remaining the opportunity for the hotel 
brands and otas grow their businesses with 
otas strength marketing testing and mobile sees three 
pillars for otas recent success taking share distribution marketing 
clout which hotel brands can only compete against being smarter and 
more targeted with their marketing testing which has not historically been 
the hotels dna but they are getting better given the richness their data 
but maybe not robust otas and mobile which the hotel brands are 
late the game but now realize the importance and are investing 
dev also talked the otas scale advantage compared other players 
including meta search engines and any potential new entrants 
precedents suggest there won clear winner between the hotel 
brands direct booking push and otas dev referred back the 
when resort hotels and tour operators waged war over the customer 
relationships the end the resort companies realized that the tour operators 
delivered valuable customers especially less popular destinations their 
system however also taught the resort hotels how better manage their 
inventory

the hotel industry overly dismissive alternative 
accommodations dev noted the risk hotel management teams acting 
like ostriches with their heads the sand when considering the threat 
alternative accommodations drew historical comparisons allsuite hotels and boutique hotels which many hotel companies initially 
ignored dismissed only eventually see the size those segments increase 
and become active players each them 
how will the alternative accommodation monetization evolve while 
away pcln booking and other sharing economy alternative 
accommodation sites have different and some cases changing 
monetization models charging the consumer charging the lister 
charging both dev expects the alternative accommodation 
monetization models continue evolving and over the long term 
likely regress the current ota model with the lister not the consumer 
paying the fees this notable for away given currently working 
push out incremental consumer fee and pcln which already only 
charging lister fee dev also believes all these platforms will need 
develop ways generate wider consumer and lister acceptance and bookings 
throughput this also plays pcln advantage given its alreadyleading scale and conversion expertise 
rate parity europe case study for the rate parity 
europe set end with the competition authorities many western 
european countries attempting dismantle dev believes only 
matter time before unravels the well the elimination rate 
parity europe being explained way let smaller otas compete with 
large otas but our view could potential profitability headwind the 
industry travel players begin use pricing their primary differentiating 
factor other words some players dramatically cut their hotel rates drive 
transactions and compete with players that have more scale and traffic this 
could lead decline hotel industry economics and brand dilution 
branding potential meaningful opportunity for hotels 
especially when hotel leaves brand family his branding studies 
dev found that hotels were able achieve average occupancy 
increase from branding though with wide range results much 
more productive for hotel brand down chainscale than and 
profitability increases even lower rate brands general provide value 
independents and better brand another brand family than 
brand within family related the announced merger between 
mar and hot dev highlighted that the combined company can 
basically brand internally different brand family given the two 
sizeable networks also highlighted the unit growth opportunity giving 
existing franchisees more brands develop his concerns were brand 
bureaucracy too much overlap and regression the mean 
result expects major hotel brands continue growing units 
meaningfully dev expects continued growth for hotel brands 
highlighted that becoming more challenging independent hotel 
that his analysis over hotel found that profitability was higher 
for branded hotels even after branding costs and given that brand penetration 
much lower asia and europe than north america

suggests years growth potential for brands globally 
the ftc requires upfront disclosure resort fees will likely have 
initial negative impact revpar dev saw unlikely hotels that 
charge sizeable resort fees will able immediately pass that fee directly
