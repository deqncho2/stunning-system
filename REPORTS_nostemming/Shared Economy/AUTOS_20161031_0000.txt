when was unable find train ride home for the holidays between paris and 
western france blablacar says that has over million members and was 
reported september sources including wsj and forbes valued 
billion 
how different blablacar distinct from other ridesharing platforms such 
uber lyft via the service does not seek provide alternative 
taxis but rather intercity transportation such trains according ceo 
fr ric mazzella the average blablacar ride miles estimates that the 
cost per mile lower than for typical uber ride drivers not profit 
from riders rather they share the costs the trip riders pay for portion 
the expenses related gas depreciation etc blablacar takes transaction fee 
the total ride the company believes that this has helped blablacar 
avoid many the regulatory challenges faced uber like models

growing markets 
why isn blablacar the blablacar executive team has said that they 
not believe their platform fit the market this time management has 
cited three chief reasons for this 
relatively low cost driving the cost driving the united states 
significantly lower than europe and other regions driving the 
cheaper due lower car purchase prices taxes reduced tolls congestion 
pricing and lower gas prices higher tolls congestion pricing and gas prices 
may particularly significant these are the variable costs that drivers 
share with passengers through blablacar 
relatively poor first last mile options blablacar drivers select common 
points which pick and drop off their traveler often 
major metro station and near the outskirts the city minimize 
congested intracity driving given the lack public transportation options 
many cities and particularly residential suburbs this may less 
appealing for example one was looking for ride home rye 
would possible find one scarsdale minute car ride away 
however this would over one hour bus requiring least one 
switch believe that intracity ridesharing options including uber 
lyft juno via etc could significantly mitigate this challenge providing 
first last mile solutions travellers 
lower density major cities the size the country and distance 
between major cities the relative europe makes driving between 
the cities less attractive option 
have previously written about the regional barriers and opportunities that 
affect potential penetration shared electric and autonomous see our global 
blue paper published april global investment implications auto for 
projections and conclusions 
blablacar rent car one the biggest pushbacks get from clients and 
companies the potential for ridesharing impact car rental companies that 
uber like models compete with day rentals rather than longer trips which make 
the bulk transaction days the avis ceo has publically responded 
concerns about uber lyft etc impacting that business saying that the 
average rental car trip days and miles this look very different than the 
average uber trip but much closer the average blablacar trip given avis 
management commentary around weaker pricing europe recently and the 
stock reaction worth noting the potential threat transaction days and 
pricing blablacar could present 
airline implications there also potential read across airlines with short haul 
exposure topic explored our october note with the airlines 
team will auto disruption travel airlines this note found real 
disintermediation risk short haul flying from intercity ridesharing course 
the dynamics the european market are quite different high speed rail has 
been viable competitor airlines europe for quite some time for example 
eurostar rail holds the london paris market this and other factors have 
already driven short haul fares levels about lower than the 
benchmark that car ridesharing service may hard pressed meet 
believe these trends technological disruption impact each stock our 
coverage universe varying degrees future transport where the value 
added may potentially delivered through marketplace part software 
ecosystem introduces number challenges that contribute our cautious 
industry view however important remember that autonomous 
technologies are only part the disruption facing the space shared mobility 
not just the intra city uber models well known the key enabling 
component the disruption and part that can develop even without 
autonomous technology for some time efforts companies solve lower 
utilization may help enable shared economy automobiles which even 
with human drivers would affect significant change the year old mobility 
model driving our ratings names like dlph mbly and mga and uwratings car ten har and
