time for new bull case for car rental for almost year now have 
written extensively various ride car sharing companies that have the 
potential push traditional rental car the brink meanwhile hertz and avisbudget have only become more resolute their rhetoric surrounding price 
increases last week hertz effectively announced price increases for 
airport leisure customers which just the latest attempt inject pricing 
discipline into the industry see our note from may hertz global

the rational oligopoly thesis put forth the bulls unlikely garner much 
traction given the presence privately held market share player

our oct note car rental fake oligopoly 
has the top shareholder htz identified elegant synergy between 
the traditional model and the new mobility model that can extend

perhaps this the new bull case for car rental for long been around 
the car rental industry has faced the challenges unpredictable demand and

not fast though are investors prepared for the bull case pivot

potential newly formed hertz lyft partnership any rent car ride share 
combination would have compete alongside oems dealers and numerous 
start ups vying for piece shared mobility demand this especially 
important the model would change from cars sold miles traveled with 
oems and dealers likely being forced make the leap mega fleet
