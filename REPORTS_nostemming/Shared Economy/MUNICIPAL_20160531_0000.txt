municipal governmental entities including both general governments and public enterprises typically maintain capital improvement plan cip the plan maps out all planned capital expenditures 
for some future period typically years the plan also lays out the 
system may not pursuing expansion their coverage 
area but could seek expand ridership providing more 
intermittent stops along transit route given our earlier 
argument that shared mobility can expand access current 
transit stops this may poor strategy constructing new 
transit stops costs money and can increase transit times

retail reits malls could see increase demand for space 
showcase driverless cars furthermore the reduced 
demand for parking customers increasingly share rides 
and over time utilize autonomous shared solutions which 
freight for the long haul 
may not require onsite parking may improve the shopping

lesser space the road compared the same number 
conventional trucks reduction the utilization 
office reits may benefit from increased need for office 
and space for example hudson pacific properties 
west coast office reit recently reported seeing increased 
demand from mainstream car companies such toyota 
volkswagen but also from several others such google 
apple and zoox the location and need for parking may also 
impacted office and retail reits 
trucks will also significantly increase without the need for 
finally several triple net reits these companies own free 
hos rules and the ability trucks run this should 
standing single tenant real estate own convenience stores 
help significantly reduce highway congestion
