the competitive moat around the car rental business 
may not impenetrable the market thinks 
have spent more than five months conducting interviews with 
variety market participants including auto 
manufacturers car rental companies and taxi and livery 
companies assess the disruptive implications from new 
business models mobility offered players like uber 
depending who were talking the perceived threat 
level ranged from we keeping eye uber but we 
not all worried uber and companies like will 
massively disruptive force the auto industry changing how 
cars are used bought and made uber google trojan 
horse into autonomously driven future the discussions 
have been most lively indeed 
not time relax the car rental business model 
for grabs futurists focused the long term 
development the auto industry we naturally intrigued 
financial analysts trying determine the earnings power 
and earnings multiples pay for hertz and avis budget 
are very concerned this stage cannot conclude that 
the car rental oligopoly about disintegrate perhaps 
what concerns more the sheer volume discussions 
are having with investors who believe the car rental 
business has unassailable barriers entry and longer 
subject competition the contrary think there 
awful lot going silicon valley think about the spirit 
this report help ask the right questions 
car rental easy fleet management hard 
ostensibly car rental not complicated you form 
company buy few cars launch snazzy website and off 
you go perhaps providing mobility service remote 
alaskan village known for its spectacular bear watching and 
salmon migration however managing hundreds 
thousands cars across hundreds airports and 
thousands off airport locations different skill set 
altogether mastering fleet costs involves optimal buying 
optimal selling and optimal utilization the vehicle 
population enterprise mastered the art fleet management 
becoming the dominant player the insurance 
replacement car rental business block block struggle 
that took decades build what today share 
the segment one point other established car rental 
companies with strong positions airports felt there was 
little threat from enterprise presence seemingly 
unrelated vertical today enterprise the undisputed fleet 
cost leader sitting share the car rental 
market investors are hoping enterprise can rest easy its 
dominant position but what they don 
you solve the riddle fleet management you solve 
the cost item and barrier entry for the car rental 
business advances technology are working eliminate 
many traditional aspects the car rental business such 
human interface airport counter accessing the vehicle 
and determining vehicle status and location the industry 
incumbents are making significant ongoing investments 
improve the convenience the rental experience from the 
moment customer gets off airplane enters offairport parking garage our discussions with senior 
executives avis budget and hertz indicate acute 
awareness that the traditional airport counter disappearing 
soon replaced mobile technology htz and car 
want get customers inside their vehicles soon 
possible without having waste even one second their 
lives standing line millions lines code harmonize 
the historical inconveniences the car rental experience 
one physical reality will remain the most powerful 
differentiator the business model the depreciation the 
rental fleet fleet cost the single biggest input cost for 
car rental company accounting for nearly revenues 
the bull case for the car rental business simple 
players control over the car rental market and 
therefore enjoy significant pricing power going further 
find many investors who believe that fleet cost volatility 
and top line cyclicality matters little oligopoly that can 
pass through any conceivable business cost customers 
who already pay little for car rental overall 
percentage family vacation business trip its heart 
the bull case takes for granted that the industry 
consolidation after hertz purchase dollar thrifty group 
makes the car rental industry substantially less 
competitive not price setter this the easiest ceo job 
the world one investor recently told 
have very different spin the oligopoly bull case 
notwithstanding increased consolidation believe industry 
competition remains heavily dependent enterprise 
pricing strategy more specifically for the bull case 
harmonious opetition enterprise must raise prices much 
more than what required offset its fleet cost inflation

with investors and senior industry management who suggest 
that rising fleet costs would even better for the industry 
longer term forces collective discipline and that 
anything industry pricing can gravitate the high cost 
producer htz car rather than the low cost producer 
ent this not agree with 
the barriers entry for car rental are not high you 
think our view the prevailing view that the car rental 
business cooperative friendly ecosystem assumes that 
the barriers entry the car rental business are high 
say domestic airlines telecoms even railroads but 
what the barriers entry weren high put 
ourselves enterprise shoes are extremely concerned 
about how advances software mobile technology big data

mobility the morgan stanley global auto team has written

however the more learn about silicon valley 
intensifying focus crowd sourcing mobility the more 
are convinced that the market interpretation the near 
invincibility the traditional car rental business 
misunderstood profoundly misunderstood 
our prediction the airport counter dead long live the 
smartphone let just get this point out the way right 
front does anyone really enjoy waiting line for anything 
especially for rental car it not fun wastes time and 
ultimately it unnecessary we not exactly sure what

when thomas edison demonstrated his

perhaps uber founder travis kalanick motto should 
will make taxis cheap that only rich people will

this statement not absurd first seems the

world operation average only hour per day the 
current paradigm auto ownership based world 
unconnected cars and unconnected drivers where the only 
way guarantee reliable individual mobility through 
outright ownership the physical asset consumers simply 
put with the inherent inefficiencies owning 
machine that turned off for hours per day small 
price pay for reliable transportation but just think the 
scale the aggregate wasted capital deployed here there 
are roughly billion cars operation globally representing 
aggregate asset value trillion more than the gdp 
the united states yet this huge investment the product 
much labor and earnings consumers roughly trillion 
hours work per hour achieving capacity 
utilization barely 
seen another way take the billion cars the world driven 
hour per day days billion hours driving per 
year that big number but masks the trillion 
hours that cars are not driven per year all know cars 
are depreciating assets and expensive maintain but seen 
this way appears consumers are destroying massive 
amounts value owning their vehicles applied 
trillion global vehicle fleet our calculation suggests trillions 
dollars wasted value then consider the ancillary costs 
vehicle ownership such insuring parking and maintaining 
car that actually used rather infrequently now we not 
suggesting that cars can achieve utilization 
may theoretical maximum but surely can 
better than right 
trillion miles driven per year and rising with many 
trillions dollars value arguably wasted consumers 
globally it understandable that new entrants applying new 
technologies are trying get piece the action 
let revisit the billion cars the road today can help 
but think that this number unnecessarily large why 
need vehicle for every people earth the same time 
the roughly trillion miles driven per year this fleet 
anything too low the consumer population were relieved 
the burden unnecessary ownership perhaps we all spend 
more time cars throw the transformational 
improvements convenience and safety autonomous cars 
and the benefits being driven could quite significantly 
increase the number miles driven rough cost per

encourage you make your own calculation how much 
spend cars annually million new cars multiple more 
used cars billion gallons fuel per car 
insurance maintenance taxes and parking and you get

regarding capacity one could argue that could measure

what the incumbent mobility service players have 
say the views differ but uber has clearly got their 
attention over the past few months have conducted 
series interviews with variety industry participants 
including car manufacturers car rental firms htz and car 
and leading chauffer livery firms carey worldwide flyte 
tyme asked them for their views about the impact 
ride sharing firms like uber and their impact the existing 
market the challenges and the opportunities 
the following paragraphs share some the highlights from 
these discussions which produced wide range opinions 
frequently contradictory nature that have categorized 
into three groups 
unconcerned feedback 
our response nobody above the law any 
infractions will policed over time with any 
business 
unconcerned pushback against the most extreme 
reaction believing that business models like uber will only 
limited the taxi market 
opportunistic typified firms who acknowledge 
companies like uber may the face technological 
revolution but who also believe incumbent players are well 
positioned profit from the change other words the 
growth the pie should more than offset the growth new 
entrants and 
uber runs major risk with uninsured drivers 
you don want get into accident uber 
car they carry the bare minimum coverage 
allowed law assuming they have any 
insurance all 
uber has poor standards driver and car 
quality livery companies provide more 
reliable higher quality service 
our response the consumer has choice and will 
ultimately choose the best value for service 
uber has massive unmet demand with 
hundreds thousands unfulfilled trips 
our response doesn this suggest that demand 
outstrips supply 
respectful for what uber attempting with 
acceptance that the industry vulnerable disruption 
uber will never own its fleet infrastructure 
costs are high and rising including drug testing 
insurance etc exposes the company 
unwieldy masses drivers employees 
our response how many cars must uber own 
before considered owning fleet and for 
how long will driving actually profession 
owning the cars would destroy uber high 
tech asset light multiple 
our response tech firms like google are willing 
get physical solve bigger problems 
the taxi lobbies are too powerful

industry lobby over century ago

opportunistic feedback 
too are rolling out new technology 
match driver with passenger demand 
respectful feedback 
our response there can room for incumbent 
players win both htz and car are making major 
tech investments improve utilization the fleet 
and fluidity the consumer experience 
uber can change the consumer mindset 
rent rather than own this broadens the 
addressable market for the and off airport 
rental market which can profit from 
disarming consumers their owned vehicles 
then have new rental opportunities that never 
before existed 
our response the taxi livery market far larger 
than car rental even global share would imply 
the largest fleet the world 
uber can partner with use the many 
billions dollars vehicles our balance 
sheet leverage its network win win scenario 
for both uber and traditional car rental firms 
see uber exploring the possibility 
owning some their fleet outright possibly 
experimental basis 
our response ride sharing firms will need own 
the cars when the drivers longer exist 
our response vehicle ownership should indeed 
collapse but also creates room for new competition 
and models time will tell growth the mobility pie 
can absorb potential flood new entrants 
uber mission professionalize the taxi 
industry have lost many drivers uber and 
need our game 
the traditional taxi industry has not done 
themselves any favors limiting medallion 
supply and raising prices 
our response excessive rents from incumbents 
provide even greater opportunity for new technology 
players offer superior service better value 
our response new players may have even better 
ways reduce fleet costs consolidating the taxi 
vertical could put new entrants position manage 
mega fleets their own without tying with 
today traditional rental fleets

key question will ride sharing become fleet owners 
when thinking about how dominance the global taxi market 
renting car with somebody else driver for few 
minutes can migrate into position the traditional daily 
rental market renting car with you the driver for few 
days gravitate towards one crucial question will ride 
sharing companies like uber become fleet owners the 
answer this question describes the link between taxis and 
daily rental cars through the common denominator fleet 
costs it important note that whether uber and similar 
companies own cars not and think they eventually will 
there are other ways for them get closer the asset 
without consummating legal ownership more that bit 
note our references uber business model technology 
platform may apply those other ride sharing companies 
including lyft sidecar hailo etc 
believe there are multiple reasons why ride sharing 
companies will eventually get into the fleet management 
business one rental car ceo recently explained his 
view that uber software technology actually rather simple 
but that the firm greatest value the large network 
professional drivers that this fast growing network effect 
offers uber the chance set the hegemony global ride 
sharing while are not any position judge the efficacy 
uber proprietary technology engine agree with 
the assessment that the driver network effect may the 
most powerful component the service and the brand 
promise 
however what happens and when the driving 
profession goes extinct the not too distant future ridesharing services won based network drivers but 
network cars cars driven computers guided 
sensors cameras and micro motors woven together 
complex software algorithms our view any car service 
firm that grows too dependent human drivers could 
doomed car service firm with medium long term 
horizon must embrace the asset and may incentivized 
usher new era autonomous vehicular mobility 
key reasons believe ride sharing companies get into 
fleet management ownership 
cost the per mile price uber trip the consumer 
varies materially between city class car and time day 
surge pricing but price around per mile 
appears representative figure key markets while 
the cost structure not disclosed estimate the driver 
salary easily accounts for the per mile cost uber 
currently takes the fare compensation for lead 
generation for the driver the driver expenditures for fuel 
insurance maintenance taxes and fees account for the 
balance according uber its average driver new york 
city working hours per week earns salary over 
per year this number seems reasonable can get 
salary after expenses assuming driver logs 
miles service per year per mile generate gross 
revenue which after uber cut from 
this adjusted gross income balance the driver pays for fuel 
insurance depreciation financing cost 
maintenance licensing fees miscellaneous 
think like driver since driver cost far the largest 
discrete cost component the ride sharing journey not 
clear majority the interest uber and similar 
companies explore ways help minimize the driver own 
costs front acquisition cost the vehicle and subsequent 
depreciation and finance charges related the vehicle 
represent the largest expenses the driver extracting fleet 
cost savings either through ownership otherwise 
influencing the acquisition and disposition the fleet can 
help provide more breathing room lower driver costs our 
discussions with drivers and car manufacturers such 
general motors suggest uber making significant efforts 
arranging better financing terms for its drivers one auto

growth many livery drivers have poor credit history and 
could benefit from the negotiating power financial and 
reputational backing large and established organization

estimate the global market for taxi livery services 
broadly defined high million vehicles today 
highly fragmented market 
expansion into higher end premium segments like the 
corporate chauffer market where carey worldwide the 
leader may require more consistent and reliable level 
product fleet where more direct control the condition 
and type car important execute best service 
way around legal hurdles some markets uber and 
others may not have choice but take more active role 
operating its fleet and drivers the taxi lobby major cities 
like new york and london powerful enough stop ridesharing its current most free for all form operating the 
fleet and owning the drivers may way around the issue 
while still leveraging the technology platform offer 
competitive alternative 
quality control and safety our discussions over the past 
several months with various industry participants we heard 
lot pushback with respect passenger safety one 
executive car rental firm said wasn comfortable 
putting his family ride sharing company car another 
alluded the incompetence some the drivers didn 
know where the airport was got lost while such 
experiences can happen with any traditional taxi owning the 
fleet could allow the firm with its brand the windshield 
exercise more control over the driver and the overall 
experience potentially mitigating some press legal issues 
etc 
usually yellow and black cars are black you have good 
idea what expect every time 
expertise believe successful consolidator the 
global taxi fleet could create competitive advantages the 
three skills fleet management buying better using 
better selling better even modest share the global 
market implies fleet size large larger than the biggest 
fleet managers today naturally this offers chance 
purchase negotiate volume new vehicles from the 
oems unprecedented scale through global buy uber 
drivers operate fleet constantly gps monitored 
connected cars predominantly through their smartphones 
very basic level the vehicle status location condition 
mileage occupancy can monitored through the current 
network going step further automatically collect and 
share data from uber the cars from the cars uber and 
from the cars each other should create valuable data that 
could help optimize the maintenance repair and economic 
performance the asset can also provide greater security 
and utilization for the driver and safer more reliable 
experience for the passenger 
goober can help but think about google 
involvement backing uber and the potential offer 
unique differentiated customer experience while enhancing 
the data capabilities for uber google has made secret 
about its interest penetrating the light vehicle space with 
the autonomous car its most visible effort imagine the 
wealth data created the trillion vehicle miles travelled 
annually the global light vehicle fleet and significantly 
more trillions passenger miles travelled could uber 
google trojan horse into the auto industry win win 
partnership applied technology monetize the mobility 
consumers everywhere 
global branding while currently there are some different 
firms all scrambling for piece the ride share mobility 
market early stage think the space could get 
extremely competitive within few years firms like uber 
lyft hailo and sidecar may grab the most headlines but add 
the countless more localized ride sharing companies that 
can sprout niche cities and now there ton 
competition building global brand and competing going 
forward may require more uniform homogeneous service

key question what can threaten uber and other ride share 
services 
this report not meant give the impression that car 
sharing firms like uber are unstoppable path 
auto industry domination the advent other technologies 
that democratize mobility even greater masses without the 
burden ownership will create some shockwaves that even 
new players like uber must make room for take 
advantage taken advantage our opinion 
the greatest potential change all the rise the 
autonomous car trend our team sees path that 
cannot stopped 
peers but how will better defined what metrics will 
determine how cheap the service can and who will the 
peer group consist eliminating the human driver element 
from the equation effectively means the best service 
dictated some combination having the best robotic car 
driven the best software the best price the scale the 
network and condition the fleet location maintenance 
cleanliness will also critical just are 
describing the fleet management business its purest 
form 
imagine world without drivers where nearly every car 
the road can hailed why using 
uber the most enduring companies are ones that embrace 
change that change consumer tastes and behavior 
change the regulatory environment change 
technology envision change all three these 
vectors the autonomous car makes its journey from 
laboratory experiment nevada desert proof concept 
your neighbor garage the only way future generations 
could ever imagine traveling four wheels highway 
ultimately believe uber business model 
inextricably linked with autonomous cars and fleet 
ownership maintain competitive advantage uber and 
its peers must pioneer the autonomous revolution not just 
keep with with google assistance and being 
potentially the single biggest fleet operator the world 
whether through direct ownership influence believe 
ride sharing firms could pole position accelerate the 
revolution 
today uber moves people good price common 
heuristic when assessing the strength enterprise 
ask oneself does this company make something better 
cheaper both compared with its competitors 
profitable basis seen from today vantage point it easy 
see how uber and other companies offer convenient mobility 
reasonable price there may cheaper options but 
perhaps not convenient there may more convenient 
options but perhaps not cheap this ride sharing thing 
really seems onto something 
now let move forward time say years 
world where streets are full autonomous roving pods that 
can beckoned the touch finger this point the 
concept crowd sourcing mobility should democratized 
point where the many tens trillions dollars invested 
capital and infrastructure representing the auto industry 
was incarnated the previous century high alert not 
full blown panic mode the competitive dynamic the ridesharing business will still defined whether firm can 
provide better cheaper service than those its 
biggest threat uber human drivers 
disappear 
biggest opportunity for uber human 
drivers disappear 
the car manufacturers don want get marginalized 
either one the key long term industry outcomes our 
team work autonomous cars even more tumultuous 
time for traditional car manufacturers resulting high levels 
investment even greater downward margin pressure and 
consolidation see future where oems move away from 
selling cars individuals selling cars very large captive 
and third party fleet management firms auto 
company own fleet large and concentrated enough 
certain cities regions could they not enter the autonomous

key question there role for incumbent car rental firms 
see scope for today car rental firms maintain 
relevant presence the future individual mobility but 
only radically adapting the current business model 
our discussions with investors paint consensus picture 
the car rental industry highly disciplined stable 
oligopoly with very high barriers entry and nearly unlimited 
potential for future price increases over time contrast 
see the forces technology discussed this report lowering 
the barriers entry rapid clip our view there has 
never been easier time for new player enter the 
car rental market than right now fact the bull case 
significantly higher rental car rates charged htz car and 
ent only improves the business case for new entrants get 
the action 
rent car for full days when you may only need 
for miles driving what the cost having 
driver take you around was little per mile 
what about per mile we not saying 
everyone will use ride share and certainly airports 
will remain important hubs for inserting pedestrians 
vehicles but the range convenient and cheap 
choices exploding can appreciate why the car 
rental companies may just little concerned 
about the sustainability the oligopoly its 
current form 
see fleet management and price being 
even more important over time not surprisingly 
price currently ranks the top consideration when 
choosing rental car provider our view car rental 
commodity service that will even further 
commoditized over time technology making scale 
and price even more important vectors for 
competition expertise fleet management enables 
lower price while lower price enables larger 
more capable fleet 
significant reduction staff levels any car 
rental employee not directly involved fleet 
management risk including counter staff 
off airport reservation specialists and shuttle bus 
drivers such restructuring actions could generate 
significant savings the car rental firms boosting 
profitability all else equal point out that the 
future this industry may very different from 
what today some ways better larger and 
some ways worse more competitive 
far greater levels tech spending maintain 
optimal utilization the network hertz and avis 
already spend decent sums enhancing the 
technology getting people their cars easily 
possible and optimize fleet management and 
utilization believe this trend will not just 
continue but must accelerate adjacent mobility 
players pour many billions dollars into the same 
areas whether know not the friendly 
oligopoly thesis implies that each the big 
players makes similar advancements car rental 
technology broadly equal strides lest one player 
gets too far ahead and gains share upsetting the 
new era price discipline the prisoner dilemma 
the addressable car rental market far 
larger but competition far greater 
there can still bull case for car rental but just 
totally different bull case than what investors have signed 
for the rent car pie may massively larger than what 
exists today software and automation liberate the shortterm rental model the entire trillion miles driven globally 
the challenge that many key elements car rental 
competition must dramatically change the industry moves 
from airport sourced human driven cars crowdsourced 
autonomous cars some these adaptations include 
see vehicle location and availability being 
less barrier the physical network car rental 
locations still resembles era when people used 
phone books and telephones find businesses 
enterprise pioneered the concept we pick you 
up decades ago overcome this inconvenience 
the not too distant future we have cars that can 
pick you and drive for you for very reasonable 
price 
the airport counter will less important

broader auto industry conclusions from crowd sourcing mobility 
understand there are much farther reaching implications 
the global auto industry than just disrupting the car rental 
market our research team committed updating you 
the rapidly evolving technological strategic and regulatory 
changes that impact individual mobility among large host 
variables that see changing over the next 
decades we highlight the following 
far greater asset utilization connecting cars with 
people continuously large numbers can help utilize 
stranded capacity sitting idle roadsides and 
parking decks all over the world given the need 
flex peak travel periods rush hour and times 
day average utilization rates are likely 
not possible perhaps possible 
today 
collapsing vehicle ownership historically 
speaking car ownership was the only way 
guarantee individual mobility unconnected 
world this longer the case the risk not 
having reliable transport hours day declines 
expect households will gradually make the choice 
not own that third second car some may decide 
give vehicle ownership altogether 
fewer cars road our simulations strongly 
suggest the global car parc over populated due 
lack connectivity and autonomy driving see 
scope for utilization rise much that there need 
not any more cars accommodate the 
population mobility needs more efficient use 
each vehicle say hours use per day 
today could auger for dramatic reduction the 
number vehicles before allowing for more 
unpredictable outcomes greater time spent 
cars 
more miles per car annually the the 
average car driven around miles per day 
miles per year believe future 
generations will look back this incredibly 
low number new technologies should over time 
take annual miles travelled closer taxi rates 
usage per year more today private 
consumer 
shorter useful life cars when measured 
years more efficiently utilized car should able 
rack today definition end life mileage 
miles just few years while the car key 
systems are running more optimally resulting 
longer useful average odometer reading but perhaps 
shorter useful life terms years the the 
average age car scrapped around years 
fully optimized fleet would replaced far sooner 
greater churn replacement demand there are 
scenarios where the impact lower vehicle 
ownership fully more than fully offset the 
impact higher miles traveled per car shorter 
useful lives and greater replacement demand 
theory car parc million million 
today can trillion miles annually trillion 
today supporting million unit saar 
new entrants must mega fleet managers 
vehicle ownership falls from today low 
the future the obligations the auto 
industry from the manufacturers all service 
providers move fleet management structure 
consumers don own maintain the cars 
somebody else must 
fleet rises percentage sales retail 
most mature auto markets like the europe 
fleet runs high excluding retail 
leasing car sharing ride sharing technologies 
could lift this figure over before fully 
autonomous vehicles lift fleet well over all 
cars the road our estimate 
car rental oligopoly significantly challenged

mobility today that longer holds the same 
weight the islands are everywhere mobile and 
available would expect many airport

software improved consistently exploit the available 
compute power over time software would exhaust all the 
available compute power and that would turn drive

that the number transistors dense integrated circuits

emerging examples improved efficiencies 
are already beginning see early examples such 
implementation via services like google maps apple maps 
inrix etc through largely crowd sourced traffic information 
many applications are beginning provide surface street 
traffic detail along with the minute arrival time 
estimates along with dynamic rerouting options the lag time 
becoming good that some cases traffic flow was 
being updated within minutes including showing the clearing 
minor backups after signal disruptions etc 
recent trip from san francisco meeting the 
mountain view california area distance roughly 
miles found that google maps initial estimate ended 
being within about minute the actual drive time even 
though the trip was taking place during the peak morning 
rush hour interestingly google maps not only routed via 
which added about miles travel distance the 
more typical routing but dynamically sent 
through variety surface streets which the application 
claimed saved minutes over the original route choice 
ultimately the trip took about hour minutes drive 
time that are relatively confident not only took less time 
than had taken the more common route despite its 
increased length but was less frustrating than being stuck 
slow moving traffic watching the minutes tick 
other potential features from improved communications and 
tracking are helping plan departure times around predicted 
travel times which can heavily influenced occasional 
disruptions like sporting events changes school schedule 
construction etc see the proverbial smart city 
developing even being put together hoc 
basis 
while are quite excited the prospects for improved 
utilization the entire road network can imagine that 
there may some municipalities and neighborhood groups 
that will raise their voices objection and they realize 
that google and others are actively routing travelers 
through their quiet neighborhoods when traffic primary 
corridors gets heavy can certainly see google and other 
traffic monitoring solutions working more closely with local 
groups assure that the objectives all are improved

timeline for adoption 
expect fully autonomous vehicles the road the end the 
decade this view more bullish than the traditional auto industry but 
slightly more conservative than some the external players 
the path autonomous driving has already begun 
and cannot stopped 
our own view timing somewhere between the 
bulls and bears believe confluence supply push 
and demand pull will see fully autonomous vehicles

penetration autonomous functionality the vehicle 
not binary but rather curve that started few years ago 
see four phases adoption autonomous vehicles phase 
already underway phase will see introduction fully autonomous 
vehicles years phase may take couple decades until full 
penetration achieved 
however phase could come sooner than think the 
government the auto industry and other entities choose accelerate 
adoption access the full socioeconomic benefits autonomous cars 
tesla believes can offer vehicles where the 
driving can done autopilot within years the 
same financial times interview musk added opinion 
it bridge too far fully autonomous cars it 
incredibly hard get the last few per cent 
there appears broad consensus that are not 
heading toward minority report world self driving 
modules zipping around autonomously highly coordinated 
pattern ferrying blissfully ignorant occupants their 
destinations any time soon while that may the ultimate 
utopian goal the first target get fully autonomous 
vehicles the road here where see more diversion 
opinion the most aggressive bulls autonomous vehicles 
see the first fully autonomous vehicles sale years 
with steady penetration through the car parc from that point 
probably not coincidence that most these bulls 
are outside the traditional auto industry most auto oems and 
suppliers the other hand are agreement that the first 
fully autonomous cars are least years away

why this will take years the large time gap between

autonomous cars the roads before this scenario can

cars the road need have basic autonomous and 
capability before can think the utopian

build out that will take lot time and money complete 
this infrastructure will include side lanes highways where 
autonomous vehicles can pull out case technical issues 
fully networked intersections and traffic monitoring capability 
fully mapped roads with real time updates and massive 
network capability handle the data needs several 
hundred million autonomous vehicles the roads etc 
however mentioned earlier this report believe 
the significant socioeconomic benefits autonomous cars 
could accelerate their adoption and this phase could 
realized sooner than expect 
removed from the autonomous vehicle and allowed 
drive its own the cars not really become self aware 
this point it just that they not need human 
intervention and can decide their own course action even 
the case emergencies one million chance 
circumstances this critical step that distinguishes 
between true autonomous vehicle and car that can drive 
itself auto pilot achieving this final step also 
extremely important juncture the new business model 
where the winners can sorted from the losers the 
race for autonomous cars 
the traditional industry approach appears that most 
the auto oems and suppliers working the autonomous car 
are aiming late phase technology cars that can drive 
themselves variety circumstances without regard 
whether they are fully phase autonomous not these 
entities view the combined hurdles customer acceptance 
liability infrastructure and mass penetration too great 
overcome the foreseeable future while they acknowledge 
that there chance may ultimately get such utopian 
world they believe equally likely that not which 
makes not something they need worry about this point 
time what this means that they can adapt existing 
cars architectures for self driving capability without having 
design autonomous car from the ground this the 
incremental approach where active safety gets better and 
better until the customers decide which point they want the 
cars take over 
the outsiders approach unlike the traditional auto industry 
the outsiders like google and some start ups are directly 
aiming get phase fast possible they 
acknowledge that there might adoption curve initially 
but want skip over phases and 
the adoption curve 
see these four phases autonomous vehicles being 
implemented across adoption curve the first three phases 
will incremental increases the content and capability 
with steep increase get the utopian world phase 
the sharp slope the curve reflects the challenge that 
expect the industry face attempts achieve full 
penetration autonomous vehicles 
the risk settling for incremental active safety 
going for step function change 
the steep curve the last phase autonomous vehicle 
adoption also represents grey area the inflection point 
between phase and phase this the point crossover 
where the training wheels and adult supervision are 
there could three reasons for this 
giving customers the full benefit autonomous capability 
will drive maximum penetration once people have 
experienced the full benefits fully autonomous vehicle 
and what they can and what they don have behind 
the wheel this will automatically create positive feedback 
loop that can drive mass penetration incremental steps 
active safety may not accomplish this 
new entrants cannot really capitalize the intermediate 
phases being external the auto industry the googles and 
start ups the world cannot really participate the trickle 
penetration active safety the same way that traditional 
auto suppliers can this drives them reinvent the

toward the utopian vision needs extensive use mapping

autonomous vehicles divide into different levels based 
capability this what the department 
transportation has done its initial guideline note 
autonomous vehicles this note meant guide for the 
states and government agencies when they have deal with 
the issue any context 
nhtsa defines vehicle automation having five levels 
automation level the driver complete and sole 
control the primary vehicle controls brake steering

function specific automation level automation this 
level involves one more specific control functions 
examples include electronic stability control pre charged 
brakes where the vehicle automatically assists with braking 
enable the driver regain control the vehicle stop faster 
than possible acting alone 
combined function automation level this level 
involves automation least two primary control functions 
designed work unison relieve the driver control 
those functions example combined functions enabling 
level system adaptive cruise control combination with 
lane centering 
limited self driving automation level vehicles this 
level automation enable the driver cede full control all 
safety critical functions under certain traffic environmental 
conditions and those conditions rely heavily the 
vehicle monitor for changes those conditions requiring 
transition back driver control the driver expected 
available for occasional control but with sufficiently 
comfortable transition time the google car example 
limited self driving automation 
full self driving automation level the vehicle 
designed perform all safety critical driving functions and 
monitor roadway conditions for entire trip such design 
anticipates that the driver will provide destination navigation

quantifying the economic benefits 
estimate that autonomous vehicles can save the economy 
trillion per year believe the large potential savings can help 
accelerate the adoption autonomous vehicles 
see five drivers the cost savings fuel cost savings 
accident costs productivity gain fuel loss from 
congestion productivity savings from congestion 
trillion nets global savings estimate about per 
year from autonomous vehicles 
but here comes the fine print 
this very rough estimate the savings 
figure makes number assumptions based data 
from variety government and non government 
agencies and studies furthermore some the sources 
date back the most recently available 
information this estimate also means 
comprehensive and only represents attempt 
quantify the biggest areas savings 
not include the cost autonomous vehicles 
this analysis obviously one sided and only looks 
the benefits autonomous cars and not the costs this 
was done for two reasons for the sake simplicity 
the benefits being little more obvious than the 
infrastructure legal and other costs needed get the 
cars the road and view most the costs 
front one time nature while the savings should 
ongoing making this more relevant 
not consider the offsetting losses there are 
two sides every story and has been the case since 
the industrial revolution every automated mechanized 
activity potentially eliminates existing jobs our analysis 
does not account for such offsetting losses for 
example there are car accidents there could 
fewer emergency rooms hospitals resulting less 
employment for emts doctors nurses self parking cars 
could eliminate the need for valets 
not include the investment implications 
autonomous vehicles the number only 
includes the dollar cost the social savings and does 
not consider the value accrued the auto oems 
suppliers and external corporate entities directly 
indirectly involved with autonomous vehicles 
this will only happen phase utopian world 
the most important thing keep mind about our 
savings estimate that can achieved only 
phase utopian scenario this means that the 
figure could purely theoretical until get point 
where cars the road are autonomous and 
manual driving virtually banned from the roads 
however could see incremental savings along the 
adoption curve 
this our base case estimate our bull case estimate savings 
year and bear case year 
this rough estimate does not account for the cost 
implementing autonomous vehicles one time offsetting losses and 
investment implications also assumes penetration 
autonomous vehicles achieve the full run rate potential savings 
believe evs and autonomous cars complement each 
other development one area helps enable the progress 
the other creating momentum that can further work 
favor car companies purely dedicated electric vehicles 
fact permanently connected autonomously driven 
vehicle helps address some the key practical limitations

imagine you running late for work and your battery 
running low your autonomous car will optimize driving 
behavior ensure you arrive with enough juice when you 
exit the car drives itself the nearest supercharging

before the big meeting 
the key selling point autonomous cars their potential 
reduce the adverse social and economic impacts 
transportation infrastructure here have attempted 
calculate the total potential economic cost savings that 
autonomous cars represent our view putting dollar 
figure the potential savings impact can help crystallize the 
benefits technology that viewed some even 
industry insiders pie the sky science fiction 
autonomous vehicles can save the economy 
trillion per year 
these cost savings would come from the improvement 
fuel economy the car parc improved productivity for 
autonomous cars occupants and the near elimination

for average about miles per vehicle per year 
the alone consumed billion gallons gasoline

information administration eia cost billion 
gallon divided over vehicles that works out 
gallons gasoline per year for effective fuel 
economy mpg can better the corporate 
average fuel economy for the vehicle fleet almost 
mpg above the car parc average number per 
the new fuel economy standards set forth the nhtsa 
and the epa the cafe standard needs mpg 
clearly cars are set become massively more fuel 
efficient the coming years and the country gasoline bill 
set drop significantly 
none this has anything with autonomous 
cars yet think autonomous cars can add further leg 
fuel efficiency today cars even using cruise 
control driving smoothly can easily deliver 
improvement fuel economy manually controlled 
surging brake throttle autonomous cars will run cruise 
control the time add this aerodynamic styling 
and light weight plus active traffic management and can 
potentially get improvement fuel economy 
from autonomous cars top the fuel economy 
improvement from new engine and transmission 
technologies that are going incorporated cars 
anyway order conservative assume 
autonomous car can more efficient than 
equivalent non autonomous car empirical tests have 
demonstrated that level fuel savings from cruise control 
use smooth driving styles alone were reduce the 
nation gasoline bill that would save 
there catch here because these savings would 
realized over span several years the parallel increase 
fuel efficiency the cars will already reduce that fuel bill and 
potentially reduce the apparent benefit autonomous 
vehicles for example the average miles per gallon the 
goes the end the decade from today the 
total gasoline bill would from thirty 
percent autonomous car savings this figure only 
bn still significant but less than the have 
considered however believe the number 
relevant because based today gallon cost 
gasoline cost believe likely increase the coming 
years also assume that the convenience autonomous 
cars will result more miles driven and therefore higher 
gasoline consumption the car parc note that the

according the texas traffic institute urban mobility 
report supported the dot the average 
driver lost hours congestion way from hours 
this was calculated the difference between 
traveling congested speeds rather than free flowing 
speeds that the equivalent almost five vacation days 
areas with over three million people commuters 
experienced higher congestion delays and lost average 
hours the report analyzed over million 
speeds roads across the the speed data 
was collected every minutes hours day hundreds 
points along almost every mile major road north 
america the report also estimates that there are about 
commuters the which means they are collectively 
losing congestion around billion hours year hours 
million commuters 
autonomous cars should able largely eliminate 
congestion due smoother driving styles and actively 
managed intersections and traffic patterns autonomous cars 
and especially driverless cars should also strongly 
encourage traffic pooling again assuming the cost time 
per hour hours saved congestion worth 
potential productivity generated 
there another aspect congestion saving the fuel 
wasted being stuck traffic will longer needed 
this was also calculated the texas traffic institute 
report which quantified congestion taking the free flow 
results and subtracting them from congested results first 
tti calculated the emissions and fuel consumption during 
congested conditions combining speed volume and 
emission rates then estimated the amount gas needed 
produce those emissions the average fuel wasted 
was gallons per commuter and total gallons for 
the entire billion dollars were wasted 
just sitting traffic this waste could also eliminated

the new auto industry revenue model 
believe autonomous cars will drive paradigm shift the 
traditional auto industry see the emergence software key 
part the value the car dividing the auto industry into hardware 
specialists software specialists and integrated experience providers 
this analogous the hardware smartphone industries 
this could binary event for many players some could see 
existential threat from autonomous cars some could reinvent 
themselves leaders and others could enter the industry for the first 
time 
there are implications for oems and suppliers the traditional 
oems need lead the space reinvent themselves 
manufacturing specialists the secular suppliers who provide 
autonomous vehicle systems and other growing parts the car will get 
stronger while suppliers who are exposed static longer 
essential parts the car will challenged 
the content opportunity opens new potential revenue 
stream the battle control the content will waged the oems 
the suppliers and the external content providers 
there are significant collateral implications for other sectors 
examine the read across the auto space from the hardware 
industry google ambitions and the implications for media software 
car rental healthcare transportation and the semiconductor spaces 
the move autonomous vehicles likely bring significant 
social and economic consequences for the broad economy 
and even society general the investment implications are 
likely even greater the advent the autonomous car 
likely have investment implications for telecom 
infrastructure insurance services technology hardware 
software and course autos 
new revenue model for the auto industry 
may easy conclude that the reinvention the 
automobile autonomous will watershed event for the 
auto industry and that the automobile which one point 
the last decade seemed destined become insignificant 
will play new important role society this should 
significantly positive for the automotive oems and suppliers 
not quite 
see the emergence autonomous cars binary 
event for the auto industry some players will face 
existential threat from autonomous cars some will reinvent 
themselves leaders and others will enter the industry for 
the first time 
the battle for content 
most the attention surrounding autonomous cars far 
has focused the potential social and macroeconomic 
gains they represent autonomous cars seem all about 
making the world better place however not believe 
that the social practical gains necessarily will the primary 
driver the pursuit autonomous vehicle penetration 
social gains may good way get some parties like the 
government insurance companies and the general public 
board but rarely pay the bills the government might 
able use the social economic savings justify spending 
significant resources building some level infrastructure 
support and writing legislation that supports implementation 
however autonomous vehicles will need deliver real 
economic returns the companies and entities involved 
able gain real traction 
the business side things the various players within 
and outside the auto industry are expected spend several 
billions dollars autonomous vehicle development over 
the next decade without any guarantee that the customer 
able and willing pay for have seen this with other 
penetration stories the group the oems typically tend 
push back against fuel efficiency safety emissions 
legislation until clear how they can monetize 
see are two primary reasons why the oems may 
championing push toward autonomous cars 
keeping with the cutting edge innovation 
addition the social benefits this the main reason 
hear from the oems and suppliers for pursuing this 
opportunity with even basic active safety systems and 
advanced infotainment systems two areas where the luxury 
oems used distinguish themselves spreading the 
mass market oems the luxury oems need move 
the next frontier which they believe cars the drive 
themselves 
the existing auto players also quite rightly view this one 
the biggest steps the functionality the automobile 
significantly greater than higher fuel efficiency 
infotainment once customers have experienced 
autonomous cars and have heard the positive word

mouth the oems believe the demand pull for the feature 
going very strong and self driving capability not 
led daytime running light that can slapped the car 
hurry given the nature 
the product high levels experience knowledge 
required with extremely long lead times and very high 
level involved oem reacts and tries get 
the bandwagon after demand spikes may too 
late 
more importantly believe the real value here 
comes from selling content the occupants the 
car the emergence the autonomous vehicle opens 
new avenue revenue generation for all entities 
involved collectively spend over hours per 
year our cars with the ability the car drive itself 
that time can now redirected other pursuits 
potentially creating new revenue stream the content 
can monetized way this content provider 
dream short air travel there are few other 
opportunities have captive audience for several 
hours time 
short see the industry structure going the way 
the smartphone industry 
the value the auto industry today about the car 
holistic product the oem the most important link the 
supply chain the biggest single contributor content 
which why the oems have the most visible brands the 
industry well the other parts the value chain tend 
incidental the automotive experience and not usually 
have branding power 
world autonomous vehicles see the value the 
auto industry coming from three different sources 
hardware define hardware the car know 
today the powertrain unibody exterior panels 
interior lighting seats etc today estimate about 
the value the car the customer comes from 
the hardware see that falling about 
autonomous car environment 
software believe autonomous cars will need use 
all encompassing software operating system unlike cars 
today these operating systems will control and 
monitor every function the car from the powertrain 
the infotainment system human machine interface and 
course autonomous functionality effectively 
replacing the human driver the car today 
estimate that about the value the car comes 
from the software see that rising about 
autonomous car environment 
content see the emergence house oem and 
third party created content for use autonomous 
vehicles including for entertainment productivity and 
functionality this content could come the form 
audio video apps other forms today very little 
value the car the customer comes from the media 
content see that increasing about 
autonomous car environment 
however make this happen critical that the 
car fully autonomous not practical have 
keep pausing movie every couple minutes 
manually take over the car and make lane change 
believe this may why some players are attempting 
straight for the ultimate goal completely 
autonomous cars bypassing the incremental stages 
the new auto industry paradigm 
autonomous driving capability not just cool new 
feature the car but rather powerful force that can 
fundamentally change the auto industry 
see two paradigm shifts the industry 
shifting the value the car away from predominantly 
hardware software component well thereby 
allowing new players enter and forcing existing 
players reinvent themselves cede share this could 
potentially allow oems shift away from vertically 
integrated asset heavy business model thereby 
changing the profitability structure the industry 
introducing new revenue model being able 
monetize the content opportunity within the car

the traditional oem supplier auto industry business model 
likely change with some companies trying specialize 
each the three functions describe and with others 
trying vertically integrate across the spectrum this likely 
mirror the smartphone industry with hardware 
specialists software specialists and integrated experience 
creators 
the hardware business model 
believe the current auto industry structure can remain 
largely place with oems and suppliers making great cars 
even cars were drive themselves perhaps even more 
because it cars will have remain safe comfortable 
quick connected quiet and stylish the oems will continue 
the most influential players the industry through their 
design assembly distribution marketing and service 
capabilities the suppliers can continue add value and 
build sustainable business models focusing the growth 
areas fuel efficiency safety emissions and interior 
content however the gap between the secular and cyclical 
suppliers could widen with the value the automotive 
hardware declining part the overall value provided 
the autonomous car only the most critical hardware 
components within the car can continue command pricing 
power the metal benders and widget makers who are 
already facing significant challenges within the industry will 
particularly suffer the value the hardware whole 
declines 
the stability the hardware business model however does 
not mean that there will not major changes cars 
evolve from what they are today fully autonomous vehicles 
our utopian scenario envision several changes the 
form and function the various parts the car suppliers 
who make components that serve little function 
autonomous car will particularly risk 
the software business model 
the average car today contains reasonable amount 
software about million lines code the software 
car today typically regulates independent functions car 
including drive wire traction management active safety 
and infotainment however these systems act largely 
independent silos today with only few handshakes 
exchanges between components the autonomous car 
the future cannot work like this all the systems 
autonomous car will need brought together within 
central managing brain that can supervise and control 
almost every function the car all times the level 
system monitoring autonomous car significantly 
higher than that regular car given the fact that the main 
controlling factor regular car the driver absent 
autonomous vehicle the autonomous vehicle also cannot 
risk different sets code written different suppliers 
each component 
effect the central controller operating system will 
replacing the human driver the primary operator 
the vehicle autonomous car the car needs know 
what every function and feature within the vehicle doing 
all times because the car charge and has make 
decisions based operating conditions this means 
virtually very function the car will now have software 
component addition every function within the car will 
now need supervised and controlled the central 
computer which runs operating system similar 
personal computer within with each the different functions 
the car reside unlike cars today with independent 
functions the central controller operating system analogous 
the domain controller will control all the other functions 
the car envision the autonomous driving brain being 
the most important part this central controller operating 
system 
expect players within the auto industry specialize 
this newly important software component build 
operating systems for cars these could existing auto 
oems auto suppliers quite possibly players from outside 
the industry such google apple microsoft with 
operating system expertise see the automotive 
software operating industry being parallel the hardware 
industry where suppliers sell and install their operating 
systems into cars made different automakers much the 
same manner pcs today ship with options different 
operating systems these operating systems will then

the experience creator addition the software 
business model that revolves around the operating system 
for the car also emerging content opportunity one 
the key objectives getting cars drive themselves 
that the occupants the car including the driver can 
freed sell them content this allows several content 
creators who have only had limited access the car until 
now through infotainment systems such internet radio 
make full inroads into the car most content not car specific 
youtube netflix blogs news social media etc that 
developed for smartphones can piped into the car well 
with little incremental change this does not mean that 
youtube and netflix will now have automotive division 
and will become players the auto industry this does mean 
that these companies will able gain access new 
revenue stream addition smartphones and computers 
operating system developed house close relation with 
supplier will also control the content available within its 
cars this closest the apple model for smartphones and 
desktop computers see this being limited the most 
advanced and successful oems the ones with powerful 
brands large balance sheets and extensive resources 
that will allow them venture into areas they will have little 
expertise especially the software content side 
but why this why not let the software content 
handled those outside the traditional auto industry who 
know best think outsourcing the software will still 
the most common business model but the few oems 
who want the best experience for the customers will least 
attempt vertically integrate for two reasons 
not believe that the traditional auto industry players 
will locked out the content opportunity that the 
hardware and the software business models are mutually 
exclusive however see some existing industry players 
trying offer comprehensive solution including hardware 
software and content give customers the most cohesive 
integrated experience possible for example auto oem 
will make its own car powered its own proprietary 
the value importance the software content 
component the oems far have stayed out 
software largely because has been relatively 
small part the value the car and has been 
restricted components typically purchased from 
suppliers this will longer the case with 
autonomous cars with the software content angle 
accounting for the value the car our 
view addition selling the software autonomous

capability other less vertically integrated 
automakers well monetizing the content 
opportunity within the car are two new revenue 
streams that the oem may unwilling ignore 
the temptation replicating apple success 
with smartphones apple success designfocused company that controls every part the 
hardware software content and its ability 
translate that into better products quality and 
pricing should the goal every automaker 
industry where pricing and uniqueness have been 
hard come despite high transaction prices 
this may not farfetched sounds with many 
oems already developing house autonomous vehicle 
capability well infotainment system development their 
software capabilities may already much farther along than 
most people give them credit for for example recently 
decided stop outsourcing all its development and 
hiring computer professionals the next three five 
years bring all its capability house 
the oems are also not strangers the content business 
either recall that many oems already have smartphone 
apps available that allow basic car functions controlled 
via smartphone the past few years both bmw and audi 
have commissioned independent filmmakers direct 
indie art movies that feature their cars part marketing 
campaign and both oems have internal channels part 
their corporate dealer network 
while not expect oem emulate netflix and 
commission top hollywood director develop series 
for their vehicles only point out that this not impossible 
think more likely that certain oems team with 
media partners allow exclusive availability content 
their vehicles especially the case multi brand 
conglomerates like and generally act 
gatekeepers for what goes into their vehicles 
what does this mean for 
oems the oems will have range choices how 
vertically integrated they want their cars they can 
make fully integrated vehicles designing developing and 
assembling the body and the operating system including the 
autonomous capability and controlling the content available 
the car the other extreme would extremely assetlight completely outsourced model which the oem sells 
car under its brand and distribution network but apart from 
designing the vehicle its studios every other component 
outsourced this would include sourcing the engine 
transmission battery and other interior exterior components 
from other oems suppliers using software and 
autonomous capability developed other oems suppliers 
third parties and outsourcing assembly such magna 
steyr and maybe even distribution such third party 
distribution arrangement like penske smart 
while the oems could adopt business model that looks like 
something between these two extremes over time see 
the industry coalescing one the other end the vertical 
integration spectrum the early years expect the oems 
that date have not been early leaders the development 
autonomous vehicle systems hardware specialists 
and design develop and build the cars themselves but 
purchase the software from outside suppliers those oems 
who have been autonomous vehicle leaders from the start 
including the likes tesla motors are likely pursue full 
vertically integration soon possible our view 
the three oem business models 
the business models will quite different either end 
course the fully integrated oems will have massive upfront 
fixed costs for but will also likely have the strongest 
brands margins and roic given the value the 
automobile that they control the hardware specialist 
business model will likely come down cost model 
determined how cheaply car can designed and built 
while keeping capacity utilization the highest possible 
levels order generate adequate returns after 
outsourcing the value the car from external 
entities this likely business model for brands that are 
not strong operate mostly emerging markets the fully 
outsourced business model would basically brandlicensing model where oem with strong brand and 
design capabilities would choose extremely asset light 
model which can relatively easily monetized even with 
outsourcing everything 
suppliers when first started thinking about autonomous 
vehicles had expected that the oems and companies 
outside the traditional auto industry like google would 
most successful and the existing auto suppliers would the 
most severely challenged this was driven our view 
shift the value generated the different components

advantage the new outsourcing business model 
while remain convinced the shift value will occur 
our conclusion about winners and losers could not 
more different than our initial view see autonomous 
vehicles being highly beneficial auto suppliers and 
believe certain suppliers will see significant value creation 
from being early leaders the space these suppliers are 
likely enjoy close relationship with the oems involved 
the design and development vehicle even earlier 
stage than today this will especially true the supplier 
conglomerate that also leader other parts the car 
that will see rapid content growth such fuel economy 
active safety and comfort convenience the latter two being 
closely tied autonomous vehicle capability 
entering the automobile will seen game changing 
event for the companies that are from outside the industry 
both good and bad ways the positive perspective that 
the automobile the most expensive item purchased 
individual after his home and the place where spends the 
most free time after his home the automobile also the 
last place that neither traditional nor new media have 
significantly penetrated still hear protests from some 
people about the death the car radio internet radio 
takes hold infotainment systems this could accrue 
tremendous value entities that can sell content the 
consumers within the automobile 
the less vertically integrated the oem chooses the 
greater will the value accrued the suppliers and 
expect see significantly higher level outsourcing over 
time could also see the emergence new breed 
suppliers that specializes low cost manufacturing like 
foxconn for smartphones finally expect see value 
erode existing suppliers components that will less

the downside that the global auto industry one the
