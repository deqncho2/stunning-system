billion hours worth 
driving represents large portion non productive consumer time 
that could liberated shared mobility and autonomous cars 
fundamental changes the mobility experience may potentially 
create multi trillion market opportunities for content and 
experiences unfamiliar today auto firms 
driving has long been seen synonymous with personal freedom but 
among the costs this freedom what estimate approximately 
billion hours non productive time gripping steering wheel and trying 
concentrate the road ahead what the future automotive transportation 
afforded consumers with all the traditional benefits personal freedom 
mobility while using that precious hour per day for other activities what the 
value hour your time given the opportunity how would you spend 
the hours you currently spend driving you didn have actually drive 
would you continue drive your current miles would your stare 
out the road watching traffic would you sleep work shop learn 
connect with friends the choice may one day yours thanks the growth 
ride sharing services robot driving isn required for this experience 
affordable growing number consumers have written extensively 
the topic shared autonomy the fusion shared mobility and 
autonomous cars may progressing faster and broader front than the

implied number driver hours spent cars annually billion 
hours trillion miles divided billion hours have run 
this calculation past wide number industry consultants and senior auto 
industry executives who validate this estimate order magnitude some 
are higher some are slightly lower have not heard any figure below 
billion hours 
this just the amount time spent the driver behind the wheel 
this excludes the value time for non driving occupants who while not 
tasked with the responsibilities driving have diminished ability conduct 
daily activities using today conventional mobile technology according 
census data the bureau transportation statistics and the university 
michigan the average occupancy rate for vehicles the united states 
per car occupancy rates europe are also average slightly more than 
per car 
what the value billion hours let start thinking about the 
value hour time course depends who you ask and 
influenced any number subjective factors try quantify this 
simple way possible economic level have looked the relationship 
between gdp per capita and vehicle penetration globally and worked with the 
morgan stanley economics team analyze global gdp per hour worked and 
income levels for car owners non car owners the united states and 
china the world two largest car markets 
global gdp per capita around per waking hour 
according the imf world bank and the cia world factbook average gdp 
per capita data constant this equal per day 
per waking hour hour waking day applying this figure the 
billion hours would result trillion but this for the world entire 
population automobile penetration rates imply that average only 
the world population owns car leaving the world population not 
owning car what the monetary value hour time for that relatively 
more economically fortunate note the economic value hour 
may not precisely related the economic value what you earn some 
people choose earn less order have more free time etc 
globally each gdp equates vehicle penetration the 
total population average looking gdp capita vehicle penetration 
data reveals clear positive relationship between economic value and vehicle 
penetration this relationship has some variation across countries but not 
wildly looking countries regions with high vehicle penetration gives 
some indication far higher gdp capita than the global average for 
example the united states where vehicle penetration total population 
gdp capita nearly europe where penetration 
gdp capita japan vehicle penetration and gdp capita 
meanwhile china where vehicle penetration gdp capita less 
than india gdp capita less than with vehicle penetration 
exhibit 
looking deeper the the gdp capita premium for car owners noncar owners correlation between wealth gdp capita economy and 
vehicle ownership may seem intuitive however the absence census

the population car owners throughout the world one cannot calculate 
precise gdp capita for the world car owning car driving population help 
add more data the discussion morgan stanley economics team has 
provided with information income levels for the car ownership 
population the united states and china the world two largest car markets 
quintile they estimate that china the income premium car owners 
over the average population conservatively while that premium the 
our economics team analyzed gdp capital isolated for the global labor force 
trillion world gdp divided global labor force billion 
resulting gdp per person labor force nearly adjusting this 
further for world unemployment rate implies gdp per employed 
person just under for gdp per working hour assumes 
only working hours are productive the gdp per waking hour total 
population brackets the low end our sensitivity analysis the value 
hour and the gdp per working hour brackets the high end our 
analysis our economics team believes the true economic value hour 
time the world driving population closer the high end and prefers 
more conservative benchmark for its estimate gdp per hour 
the team went further obtaining data from surveys china mckinsey and 
the consumer federation america estimate the rough range the 
gdp premium for car owners its low estimate for the premium the carowning population the where owners generate the pretax 
income non car owners its high end estimate for the premium the carowning population china where based estimates households that 
own premium car have disposable income several times large that 
non premium car owners conservatively the team believes the income 
premium car owners over the average worker china while the 
the premium one must then consider that the and china are far 
the world two largest car markets individually europe collectively 
together accounting for over the world light vehicle population 
applying conservative premium the hour benchmark 
gdp hour worked would yield value hour 
one can use many methodologies estimate the value hour time 
currently spent the world driving population rather than depend one 
point estimate inexhibit placed sensitivities around value 
hour using gdp hour estimates that range from assumes all 
waking hours per day are productive the high end prefer 
exercise conservatism and use for our estimate average gdp per capital 
multiplied driving hours which yields hypothetical economic 
value 
assuming the economic productive value time drivers currently 
spend behind the wheel anywhere near trillion 
how much this time can converted into business opportunities 
what could this potentially worth companies with access

opportunity increased amounts consumer time 
how can companies with historical relationship with 
autos transportation approach this opportunity 
how can established auto companies capture the value this time 
it time start thinking about time the morgan stanley global auto 
team partnership and collaboration with our colleagues across wide range 
other industry teams focused exploring the fundamental changes 
the auto industry business model with implications that extend well beyond 
the traditional thematic and corporate framework traditional analysis 
what about those who just enjoy the pleasure driving themselves 
while this report attempts identify the amount and potential value the 
time spent inside the world collective automobile population have not 
attempted divide this time activity root consumption our 
writings about the future mobility speak with many investors and 
consumers who simply enjoy least portion their driving and not 
want sacrifice this activity computer perform least not 
the time cannot say what percentage miles traveled drivers will 
continue execute under their own manual control and judgment the 
future what can say that from today perspective nearly miles 
traveled are human driven with practically alternative choice the 
future believe there will very likely least some choice the same 
time believe the industry will witness significant parallel development 
semi autonomous technology allow consumers enjoy some the 
pleasures and control driving while overlaying sophisticated technologies 
help prevent accidents caused human error while not completely driving 
the vehicle the miles for you such technologies may able 
execute enough the driving function allow consumption more 
experiences offered driver future environments level fully 
autonomous transportation human driving may not choice all 
investment significance for the auto industry increasingly our 
discussions with auto companies are focusing much broader topics than 
just selling cars and trucks oems are exploring the value offering suite 
mobility services and how offer passengers enhanced experience beyond 
driving including ride sharing car sharing other connectivity the car 
and other areas content the auto industry were move incrementally 
towards market catering passengers rather than drivers successful firms 
may required offer integrate new revenue generating services into their 
existing models supplier profits and growth rates may tied delivering 
the experience inside the vehicle while taking full control the 
athletic performance attributes outside the vehicle many firms that today 
not offer transportation services may possibly justify targeting the market for 
miles time spent vehicles capture the value the data collected and 
services offered very large captive and mobile population our opinion 
today auto manufacturers may need contemplate the potential for 
the model change point where some new entrants may able 
offer the pure transportation portion the experience cost belowcost capture the adjacent revenue opportunities afforded them these 
are increasingly relevant considerations about which find ourselves
