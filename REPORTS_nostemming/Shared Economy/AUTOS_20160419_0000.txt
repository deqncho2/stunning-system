drive growth the market over the next years while the requirement second car for the family will compete with shared 
mobility plays 
evs the penetration rates are less than and expect high battery prices and low level car prices india hinder

high level private vehicle ownership coupled with high levels consumer debt make sharing more attractive than ownership even implies profound changes consumer lifestyles legal and political challenges not appear insurmountable 
and are outweighed the potential public safety environmental and infrastructure benefits 
private car ownership can any higher average household owns cars with almost households owning 
more cars vehicle utilization drops significantly for each incremental car the household 
consumers spend significant portion their median income transportation costs vehicle transportation costs account 
for average household expense 
relatively low urbanization may preserve private ownership rates for longer implying full transition that may slow but

approach using public private partnership framework
