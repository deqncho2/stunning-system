bev development proves too expensive technically not viable and 
are our key conclusions 
governments are forced delay regulatory tightening this case 
new bev models grow global share but fade after

from our base case 
ageing developed markets and china populations likely 
hybrid and plug hybrid penetration grows very quickly through 
slow down the rate ownership growth urbanisation 
but starts fade sharply bev sales pick and oems 
continues grow but more slowly than before assume 
switch focus for emissions purposes

new evs why think they really 
coming this time despite major hurdles 
still ahead 
political and scientific pressure oems 
about ices has risen sharply 
many many hurdles remain there still 
bear case 
despite the very sharp increase bev focus and news flow and 
nevertheless are fully aware the potential objections that 
increasing number strategic oem investments and launch plans 
investors may have our assumptions and highlight those key 
for bevs many investors continue have question marks over the 
hurdles here have reflected much more bearish view these 
viability and eventual likelihood battery technology taking over 
developments our bear case model not exclude such 
the automotive drivetrain why have battery electric cars never been 
eventuality 
successful before why different this time think the key 
answer that political and scientific concerns about and 
don high battery costs make evs uneconomic 
particle emissions impacts public health have risen sharply 
and this driving regulatory change which sharply raising the 
battery costs remain very high battery electric powertrain costs are 
cost development and production the internal combustion 
heavily dependent the cost the battery much which driven 
engine petrol well diesel and may set targets that ice 
the cost battery cell materials although economies scale 
drivetrains simply cannot meet least economically 
could substantially reduce cell manufacturing and packaging costs 
battery energy density has improve reduce the material cost 
soon bevs become cheaper not only viable way for global 
content not clear that consumers are willing pay higher prices 
oems meet long term emission targets the oems will 
for bevs relative ice vehicles 
incentivised sharply improve their bev consumer offerings and 
incentivise consumers buy those bevs they previously did with 
energy density really sufficient 
diesel europe think this change happening now 
evidenced recent strategic changes announced and 
battery range remains too small and batteries are still too heavy 
daimler particular but now followed other global oems 
battery energy density improving but not yet good enough can 
including hyundai toyota and honda 
current material energy density improve sufficiently allow the 
more aggressive bev targets met with the battery material and 
cell capacity plans that are place current energy density 
last european ice platform 
current bev plans will start consume high proportion global 
material production for some materials 
one the largest global auto parts suppliers continental 
suggested its recent powertrain strategy presentation that the 
last ever european ice based platform would launched around 
tier suppliers bid for new model contracts three years out 
and for need look substantially beyond this take this 
view very seriously direct insight into product strategy across all 
the global oems conti bev penetration base case 
ahead the base case have modelled here thus our base 
case this report that bev market share penetration rises quickly 
after new products are launched and then accelerates 
technology improves and consumer acceptance rises 
foundation 
where all the charging infrastructure going 
come from 
subsidies are being phased out can you sell bevs 
without them 
battery charging infrastructure has not been sorted out many 
bev subsidies may ending governments have been subsidising 
countries high levels bev adoption are likely sharply increase 
bev and low emission cars many countries some those 
the demand for electricity charging rates that may well exceed the 
subsidies are now being phased out china look likely run out 
capabilities the existing infrastructure oems are starting invest 
the subsidies have helped consumers bridge the acquisition 
more heavily new infrastructure plans especially europe with 
cost differential for their bev purchases without which bev demand 
tesla well ahead the evs are mostly leased owing 
could lower still 
uncertainties over long term battery values and most packages 
come with home chargers included 
why would governments incentivise when tax 
revenues from fuel duty are significant 
there really any consumer demand for evs 
the impact tax revenues with governments especially europe 
demand for bevs seems have been very limited for most models 
receiving significant income from fuel taxes and electricity often not 
launched date excluding tesla the fact remains that few bevs 
taxed follows that sharp rise bev penetration would lead 
with commercial range have yet been launched fact global bev 
sharp gap tax revenues think this could lead pressure 
sales approx units driven china are dependent yet 
tax electricity instead that said with more than fleet 
very few fully electric models the major oems launch their 
penetration our model more severe impact tax 
current bev model plans and the bev range expands 
revenues may years away 
miles and beyond believe the consumer proposition will change 
swiftly and with tesla consumer interest will improve quickly 
the other side the sharp declines diesel powertrain demand 
europe recently 
are bevs actually environmentally friendly given 
through life cost and environmental impact 
while current regulatory thinking focuses the reduction 
and nox the total impact the environment electricity 
production and the production and eventual disposal battery 
materials may reduce the net benefit from bev emissions however 
our discussions with regulators have convinced that tailpipe 
emissions reduction their key focus 
won evs mean substantially more electricity 
demand 
electricity generating capacity significant rise bev penetration 
could have material impact global electricity demand the 
average bev uses per average annual mileage 
approximately would add approx average 
household electricity consumption europe 
and average china just over persons per 
household full bev penetration could lead higher 
electricity consumption these assumptions and would likely

bev trend driven emission regulations 
have highlighted above many the reasons most often cited why 
the real change our view that may have informed and 
investors believe bevs will not succeed have noted 
daimler strategic changes that wltc and rde worldwide 
believe that many these issues can overcome especially given 
light duty test cycle and real world driving emissions testing 
the long term nature the changes the fleet look here 
regimes coming europe over the next two years are likely drive 
various different reasons why large oems such daimler and 
significant increase the cost complying with the standards 
have moved towards their new strategies and why even japanese 
compared the oems original assumptions for the cost ices 
oems such toyota and honda long opposed bev technology 
recent years have seen several changes 
are now looking introduce bev models soon possible 
adding the global customer preference for larger and 
higher emissions suvs 
cost regulatory compliance for 
current ice engine 
the gradual but accelerating decline lower diesel 
the costs compliance for ice engine technology are rising sharply 
the new rde targets combining and nox standards 
the introduction the new wltc much tougher for nox 
europe and china 
show this analysis below regulatory oversight increases 
sharply post recent industry revelations remember that diesel was 
model these changes exhibit below while the falling cost 
key part the oem strategy for future performance the 
battery technology remains question mark dependent future 
change regulatory focus nox and the related fall diesel 
technological chemical breakthroughs and timing this seems 
penetration changing that strategy altogether 
uncertain maybe the rising cost ice that proving the real 
driver oem strategy show below how the two cost scenarios 
with the help european government incentives diesel went from 
interact have little concept the exact shape each curve 
just overall market share well over 
the exact timing the cost changes but our chart clearly 
see reason why evs should not similarly incentivised just 
highlights what happening the original cost regulatory 
diesel incentives are removed with the change political 
compliance assumptions the ice engine and the fact that higher 
emissions policy remember also that while may our focus 
ice costs cross over with falling battery drivetrain costs earlier 
many these companies are thinking about and beyond 
whether not our chart proves accurate its exact timing 
just the first step how can oems achieve future 
would not like speculate 
targets even lower with existing ice engines will 
regulators some regions even push towards zero emissions

seems that rde testing may reduce the engine downsizing

cost curve calculations around ice and the recent announcements 
higher penetration targets seems that oems are shifting 
towards managing targets via mix hybrids evs and away 
from reducing internal combustion engines

believe that automakers not have wait for demand for their 
future regulations and incentives 
vehicles pick strongly believe that leading oems use their 
distribution arms and financial services business proactively 
key parts our arguments favour the are not necessarily just 
generate demand for models and when they need think that 
the regulations laws and incentives that have today car 
globally lower interest rates have sharply contributed their ability 
companies have manage generations vehicles that will 
oems have been able control monthly spend 
launched over decade from now and may continue selling and 
converting savings from lower interest costs into higher average 
operating various guises until this means that auto 
selling prices and content per car believe oems can achieve 
oems are looking future changes and political trends much 
the same feat with evs they are incentivised 
current laws thus many auto oems strategies are 
already set stone unfortunately being affected new test cycles 
the example above might possible for oems bundle total 
and real world driving emissions tests these have clearly increased 
cost ownership tco for consumers capture the through life 
the need reduce nox emissions further 
savings offset some the initial capital cost the bev phev 
alternatively oems face significant penalties for non compliance 
germany banning ices however initial industry 
with emissions legislation then again would quite possible for 
negotiations regarding european emission standards are 
oems cross subsidise evs from their existing ice business and 
another huge step and seems unlikely these trends will ease 
yet still maximise business profitability politicians are starting 
significantly much less reverse thus even germany the german 
understand incentives for consumers may not the only way 
bundesrat has passed resolution ban the ice starting 
raise penetration levels 
the bundesrat resolution calls the european commission 
approve only zero emission passenger vehicles for use european 
what clear however that key variable this debate the level 
roads while the bundesrat representing german states has 
residuals that assume new evs although have already 
legislative power its recommendations clearly help shape the 
allowed for significantly worse performance residuals than 
overall european debate the resolution suggests the stimulation 
current ice vehicles performance may even worse depending 
emission free mobility the use taxes and stimulus boost 
battery performance the other hand the availability much 
zero emission vehicle sales 
lower tco evs could similarly have sharply negative impact 
residuals current ice vehicles consumer demand switches 
china quotas for evs phevs soon certainly seems 
quickly the market will face glut off lease ice cars which could 
that diesel tax advantages will ended europe soon contrast 
severely depress their residuals 
germany approved subsidy for electric car purchases only 
may allowing consumers subsidy for full vehicles 
thus seems clear that oems will have agile managing their 
and for phev with goal getting vehicles the road 
total financial services lease exposure seems likely that given the 
any debate around zero emissions must concern for 
uncertainty consumers will choose lease initial models 
european oems providing further fuel for recent strategy 
leaving the oem take the residual risk this suggests that fast 
conversion further development german environment minister 
conversion rate from ice models consumers would require 
barbara hendricks was quoted bloomberg november 
significant growth market lease penetration requiring further 
saying she backed aggressive new targets for sales china being 
growth oem financial services balance sheets and adding 
proposed draft legislation from china industry minister miao 
their risks however given that many these launches won 
wei now china considering legislation requiring all automakers 
happen until after first real residual risks won appear until 
sell specific quota zero and low emission vehicles starting 
the earliest however may have impact and 
overall deliveries almost vehicles this proposed 
leasing strategies before then 
target then set rise and oems that 
fail meet the targets would face penalties forced buy 
credits from competitors meet the targets for the german oems

risks the automotive oems from bevs 
this section highlight the key changes the automotive supply 
oems lose content without the control over the ice powertrain 
chain and the implications and risks the global oems focus 
and with the potential for far greater sourcing bev components 
the change powertrain battery electric rather than the changes 
oem content the vehicle declines further without the right level 
that could also brought about parallel developments 
content oems face question marks over the way that they can 
autonomous driving and shared mobility which could bring more 
brand the vehicle the barriers entry the decisions they need 
radical changes the global ownership model and fleet well 
make regarding existing workforces and the level future 
the distribution and ownership chain have addressed some 
outsourcing they can afford 
these issues detail before see autos shared mobility future 
car earnings risks nov 
further can oems afford are they able build the software 
skills they will need maintain control over the future integrated 
battery electric vehicle fundamentally different product from 
and autonomous car operating system 
the current production car the bev drivetrain substantially 
simpler build and design than combustion engine with far fewer 
technology electronics and software gain content with 
regulatory hurdles fewer parts and much lower capital intensity 
future bev arguably built around central vehicle operating system 
however not only the drivetrain that needs change increased 
and with sharply higher content from autonomous driving functions 
electronics content and connectivity combined with increasing 
electric drive and connected systems the value 
security risks that electronic connectivity mean that the whole 
future bev may come from the technology sector not automotive 
electronic architecture the car could change from loosely 
recent acquisitions samsung and intel have already seen some 
assembled domain based network more centralised network 
the consumer electronics and technology leaders enter directly into 
based central computing capability this the way tesla designs 
the automotive parts markets potentially disintermediating 
its electrical architecture 
existing tier suppliers google and apple have also made their 
automotive ambitions clear
