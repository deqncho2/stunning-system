level 
circular economy retains the value products materials and resources within 
the economy for long possible and minimises the generation waste 
why should investors focus the circular economy now increasing efforts 
combat climate change post and meet sustainable development 
goals shifting consumption habits and continuous development new 
technology are driving the move towards circular economy outline the 
benefits and drivers this primer and series accompanying reports 
starting today with circular economy metal recycling solution stocks 
explore the implications the sector level and identify solution stocks 
the environmental benefits circular economy are obvious extracting and 
using finite resources energy intensive damages biodiversity and emits ghgs 
into the atmosphere but population growth and urbanisation are likely 
increase the overall demand for metals minerals and fossil fuels transitioning 
circular economy would reduce the amount primary extraction that takes 
place this can achieved through higher asset utilisation rates repairing 
refurbishing remanufacturing worn products and recycling waste rather than 
sending landfill incineration using more renewable energy and increasing 
energy efficiency also important part the circular economy 
but there economic benefit too for resource dependent countries 
circular economy would reduce total expenditure primary resources with 
direct positive economic impact lower selling prices create incremental benefits 
through higher disposable income and consequently employment the outlook 
may more challenging for those often developing economies that generate 
high share gdp from extracting finite resources the transition would likely 
require diversification into new more sustainable business models 
far regulatory involvement most advanced europe the european 
commission has adopted circular economy package addition new 
proposed legislation for waste packaging waste recycled 
launching two innovation deals help remove legislative 
obstacles battery recycling and sustainable waste water treatment the 
also aims drive innovation through finance support platform 
but innovation and technology are facilitating new circular business models the 
internet things makes easier minimise waste and extract maximum value 
from assets technology also finding better ways designing producing 
remanufacturing and recycling products enabling companies increase the 
amount value they create and retain

what the circular economy 
circular economy one that restorative and regenerative design and which 
aims keep products components and materials their highest utility and value 
all times distinguishing between technical and biological cycles ellen macarthur 
foundation 
the global economy currently works strategy extraction production and 
abandonment although this has generated growth has inherent limitations the 
long term with certain resources finite increasingly constrained particularly when 
coupled with growing population that becoming wealthier the risk higher and 
more volatile costs rising while the negative impact the environment also clear 
the circular economy provides solution this global problem increasing the 
utilisation materials and products keeping them circulation for long possible 
and finding new uses for them the end life essence minimises waste thus 
reducing the need for new primary resources extracted and consumed 
this not new but are living through number major trends that could 
accelerate change focusing attention preventing climate change the 
sustainable development goals demand focus responsible consumption and 
production the sharing economy altering consumption habits and technological 
innovation disrupting business models together these could combine drive the 
circular economy forward 
prioritising renewable over finite resources the case power generation 
designing products that can more easily disassembled and reused 
increasing the utilisation rate assets via collaborative consumption 
minimising waste both through the production cycle and end life 
what needs happen for the circular economy become reality 
consumer demand the sharing economy has gained significant popularity through 
better utilisation their resources the sharing economy enables asset owners 
provide temporary access goods and services consumers generally exchange for 
fee two the most notable examples line sharing platforms are uber and 
airbnb the transport and tourism industries but there are growing number 
examples different types goods and services being shared the broader economy 
labour services taskrabbit non durable goods such handbags bag borrow 
steal wifi fon durable goods such boats boat bound innovations the 
financial sector include the growth platforms for crowdfunding and peer peer 
lending for more detail please see worth sharing june 
this model temporary ownership also extends into business business transactions 
philips for example has created service model for some its healthcare customers 
providing and maintaining equipment and services whilst retaining ownership 
but other areas there more done make attractive for consumers 
embrace the circular economy take mobile phones for example relatively easy for 
consumers recycle them end life whether through municipal recycling facilities 
specific mobile phone recycling companies however our online poll over 
adults conducted via alphawise the end february respondents said 
they kept their old mobile phone despite longer using while just threw away 
just returned the phone retailer recycling company this line with the 
findings our consumer focus group which showed general apathy among consumers 
when considering sustainability factors how important sustainability consumers 
january 
driving substantive progress towards circular economy therefore likely require 
changes instigated corporates and legislators that turn incentivise different 
consumer behaviour whether this through product innovation incremental taxes 
legislation the most encouraging signs are coming from europe where the circular 
economy package was launched see page for detail this follows the weee 
waste electrical electronic equipment directive introduced with the aim 
increasing the recycling and use consumer electric and electronic items sweden 
has introduced the most advanced legislation europe with reusing and recycling 
encouraged through tax reform value added taxes repairs bicycles clothes and 
shoes are being cut and there new tax break more expensive repairs fridges 
dishwashers and washing machine additionally will become more expensive buy 
new electronics due additional chemical tax certain products 
subsidies may needed help transition circular economy though for example 
the environmental services association estimates that fully efficient reuse and 
recycling system would cost billion establish the which implies 
billion for europe overall this level subsidy not unprecedented indeed the 
renewables transition germany cost billion feed tariffs renewable plant 
operators between and source mckinsey while global subsidies 
for renewables stood with further for biofuels and for fossil 
fuels source iea 
elsewhere japan introduced the law for the promotion efficient utilization 
resources whilst the over states have extended producer 
responsibility erp place for electronics 
innovation accelerating the shift circular economy requires corporates invest 
innovation and develop products and services that are economically sound but also 
resource efficient the benefits for companies are numerous and centre increasing 
the amount value they create and retain minimising waste reduces cost while 
changes product design can make refurbishment and remanufacturing more viable 
keeping ownership assets can extend their useful life and refurbishing products 
opens access technology for customers who may have constrained budgets for 
example thus also driving revenue growth 
some examples innovation include 
textiles chemical processes are being developed separate blended fibers and 
recycle the raw materials into new clothes 
appliances refurbishing secondhand machines reduces costs for manufacturers 
and opens new customer base 
plastics multi material packaging that difficult recycle needs replaced 
with single material that has the same functionalities but easier use end 
life 
batteries focused making more economical recycle lithium 
batteries demand for hybrid and electric vehicles accelerates 
agriculture phosphorous could recovered from meat and bone meal create 
closed nutrient loops 
mobile connectivity already widely adopted this technology facilitates the 
sharing economy thus raising the utilisation rates assets such cars 
accommodation and luxury goods 
identifying the circular economy leaders the circular economy unlikely key 
fundamental value driver for many stocks this stage but think that the move 
more circular economy will disruptive trend the next few years companies 
that move first innovate and adapt should well placed 
over series reports starting today with circular economy metal recycling solution 
stocks will consider what the circular economy means for different industries and

for the circular economy success needs make economic well 
environmental sense 
the most direct economic consequence would reduction commodity use but the 
impact this will vary significantly between countries six the largest economies 
are net importers metals and seven are net importers oil for these countries the 
successful adoption circular economy would reduce commodity imports price 
volatility geopolitical risks and general supply chain risk however for resource heavy 
exporting countries the consequences higher resource efficiency would very 
different zambia and chile for example metal exports averaged respective and

the economic benefits the circular economy for europe fall broadly into four 
categories 
reduced primary resource expenditure many large economies are net importers 
commodities with primary commodity imports representing gdp average for 
the countries for example circular economy would reduce this dependency 
with study mckinsey concluding that there could reduction resource 
spending europe adding trillion euros net economic benefit outside 
europe though there would negative impact those economies that rely heavily 
commodity exports 
higher disposable income the reduction primary resource spending should lower 
selling prices thus boosting disposable income and raising the potential for increased 
consumption incremental jobs due more spending and higher gdp mckinsey argues 
that circular economy europe could raise disposable income additional 
percentage points 
lower externality costs this includes range factors such carbon emissions 
pollution and land use these negative consequences the linear economy can have 
implications for health and thus lower productivity and economic growth furthermore 
the negative impact the environment and particularly climate change can have 
consequences for economic growth and prosperity over the medium long term 
new types jobs the circular economy will reduce demand for certain business 
models raw material extraction and production new product manufacturing but 
increase the need for other forms employment for example recycling and 
remanufacturing addition the increase consumption outlined above would drive 
job creation across multiple sectors due incremental demand for products and 
services growing use automation and artificial intelligence raising the prospect 
fewer skilled jobs while some the new circular economy jobs would lower paid 
unskilled jobs collecting and sorting materials for recycling there should also 
skilled jobs areas such remanufacturing closed loop recycling and bio refining 
what are the enablers 
the circular economy differentiates between technical and biological cycles exhibit 
shows there are two different circular economies one focused renewable 
resources and one finite materials for renewables there need maximise 
utilisation rates and ensure the resources are regenerated for finite materials 
arguably more complex cycle with the goal minimise the need for extracting new 
primary finite resources through increased utilization longer asset life reuse and 
refurbishment and finally recycling 
design 
circular economy requires rethink how products are designed and created 
present products are rarely designed with end life mind however circular 
economy products are structured make possible both technically and 
economically disassemble them end life and reuse the parts recycle the 
materials 
hitachi redesigned washing machine minimise the number components 
within the product could manufactured with just six screws thus reducing 
the length the production process improving its reliability for customers and 
making easier remanufacture recycle end life more recently apple 
has created liam production robots disassemble old iphones and recover the 
valuable components within the devices 
finite resource extraction 
obvious consequence truly circular economy would reduction the volume 
primary resources that need extracted addition though the process 
resource extraction can follow some the principles circular economy minimise 
waste 
use new technology make processes more efficient 
reduce energy and water consumption 
use renewable energy 
norsk hydro karmoy pilot plant will begin operation producing 
aluminium with the world most energy and carbon efficient technology aims 
more energy efficient than the global average for aluminium production 
thus also saving costs for norsk hydro 
asset ownership 
manufacturing companies work the basis buying raw materials components 
assembling product and then selling there are consequences for the 
manufacturing company once the asset comes the end its useful life but what 
this changed and the washing machine company mobile phone manufacturer had 
take back the product what they retained ownership through the asset life 
along with responsibility for maintenance and servicing this would have profound 
implications for business models there are some small examples this type 
production already 
philips lighting worked with architect thomas rau develop pay per lux 
intelligent lighting system several features the system lead reduction 
total energy consumption the installation led lights focus natural 
sunlight and iii sensor dim brighten the artificial light depending how 
much natural daylight entering the building addition the lighting system was 
provided service the customer with philips lighting retaining ownership 
the assets and providing maintenance upgrades and end life recovery 
creating value from waste 
all manufacturing processes create waste finding secondary use for unwanted 
materials and products could create additional revenue stream while also reducing 
costs 
testing various technologies find new uses for whey which 
extracted during the production greek yoghurt the company already uses 
whey protein its early life nutrition business but also looking use for 
animal feed fertilizers and energy 
consumption 
consumption behaviours are changing with less emphasis owning and more 
sharing the autos and hotels industries are the best examples where the sharing 
economy has improved the utilitisation resources with asset owners providing 
temporary access goods and services generally exchange for fee 
the shared mobility model moving the transportation business from privately 
owned and operated model professional service run large firms engaged 
mega fleet management this addressing the key inefficiency the autos 
industry cars are typically used for less than hour day with utilisation rate 
less than hour day basis and only utilisation available seatmile basis occupancy rates out available seats the average car 
multiplied 
remanufacturing 
remanufacturing retains much the material and value included the original 
product this saves costs for the manufacturer with the potential for higher profit 
margins and returns capital also potentially creates new customer opportunities 
making expensive products more affordable 
healthcare providers are often managing tight budgets remanufacturing 
machinery philips can offer high quality products such mri systems its 
customers reduced price compared with brand new equivalent elsewhere 
data center servers deployed google were remanufactured 
machines 
recycle reuse 
recycling should the last resort within circular economy but the most 
prevalent example the approach present large element the transition 
circular economy simply reducing the amount stuff that gets end life and 
thus needs either discarded recycled far household waste and certain metal 
commodities are probably the most common examples recycling 
and kering are collaborating with innovative company worn again 
improve the recycling textiles currently many clothes end landfill but 
new technology from worn again allows polyester and cotton separated 
and extracted from clothing and textiles the aim then for these materials 
used the manufacture new products
