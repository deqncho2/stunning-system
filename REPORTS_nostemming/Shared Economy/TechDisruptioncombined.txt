key thoughts the future automation innovation and disintermediation 
believe that the global transportation industry the early innings secular change brought new 
technologies and new players 
the case other sectors that have seen similar secular change there remains healthy amount investor 
skepticism the timing and pace change well likely winners and losers resulting from the transition traditional 
business models are indeed being challenged but for now companies suggest they can invest adapt such shifts 
support their business positions 
road the advent platooning could have most near term impact followed autonomous trucks with beneficiaries 
able invest and adapt quickly the intro the new technology believe this could also introduce barriers entry 
the trucking space for the first time need for capital and drive significant consolidation over time 
logistics the entry new startups trying the uber freight well insourcing giants like amzn and 
uber asset based carriers and even oems could also pressure net revenue margins north america but there are 
distinct challenges set such models europe the which may allow for current key players like dsv and 
dpdhl push advantage more than peers 
parcel the network setup and pricing models dpdhl allow for better positioned competitive structure that should 
see lower risk disruption than peers however are cautious our view the legacy parcel names esp 
ups believe the twin competitive threats logistics insourcing ecommerce giants and the omni channel shift 
could pressure volume pricing and margins 
rails not see much potential for direct technology disruption but believe that lower costs trucking driven 
new technologies could challenge growth the intermodal business
