autonomous uber fleet for 
public use end this month 
see the roll out shared and autonomous car fleet city 
city expansion not unlike the introduction the electric utility grid 
the likes edison the late look for more announcements 
other firms tech and auto partnership with cities around the 
world 
uber will introduce its self driving fleet volvo pittsburg for public 
use the end this month see this important milestone the 
development shared autonomous and electric ecosystem for number 
reasons our key thoughts 
ride sharing firms see autonomous cars existential technology ride 
sharing firm network human drivers what happens when the humans 
away what network somebody else autonomous car our 
september report rent car meets tech head collision said 
biggest threat uber human drivers disappear biggest opportunity for 
uber human drivers disappear bloomberg interview uber ceo travis 
kalanick said needed make sure there alternative self driving car 
because there not we not going have any business 
uber scale daily miles traveled offers unique advantages for the required 
machine learning autonomous car development over the past several 
years google has accumulated more than million miles autonomous 
driving uber drivers log approximately million miles per day while 
practically none these miles are fully autonomous today just point out 
the scale experience that can accelerate the development the mapping 
and learning for autonomous cars uber logs many miles minutes 
google autonomous cars have logged their existence also note that the 
million mile number would represent share the trillion miles traveled 
market nearly believed this number was closer little more 
than year ago and estimate was approximately around years ago 
see vehicular mobility highly deflationary over time roughly one half 
the cost ride sharing trip the cost the human driver one the keys 
expanding affordability safety access and utilization shared mobility 
services substitute the responsibilities the human operator over time 
culminating into its logical conclusion estimate the economic payback 
fully self driving car can little weeks less our global miles model 
published this past april the morgan stanley global autos and shared mobility 
team global miles traveled grows nearly cagr from around trillion 
miles today light years approximately trillion miles please

first ford now uber look for others get the act hurry ford 
got the market attention this past tuesday with the announcement that 
plans mass produce fleet fully autonomous cars without steering wheels 
pedals for use ride sharing application while uber cars will 
initially require human operator observe the car performance and take 
action when necessary the timing commercialization autonomous car 
fleet with human oversight years ahead ford plans may attract more 
attention uber appears oem agnostic the volvo arrangement not 
exclusive 
first time civilians can experience autonomous driving important hurdle 
winning over the public local government and regulatory bodies believe 
proof reality the technology wide audience possible fast 
possible the essence here the bloomberg interview kalanick says 
are going commercial this can just about science believe firms like uber 
are trying use early accumulation and analysis the data produced their 
self driving fleet change consumer regulator and even investor perceptions 
fully unassisted human driving potential public health and safety hazard 
look for city city expansion gather steam mayors and city councils 
face important urban planning revenue and policy considerations municipal 
department transportation wants left behind please our may 
america insight note published michael zezas and our municipals team 
partnership with the autos and shared mobility team cities shared 
mobility policymaker investor guide 
another example the intense fight for talent the battle for human minds 
autonomous cars may progressing even faster than the technology itself 
again from the bloomberg interview found travis kalanick comment 
the fight for autonomous driving talent very telling uber wants catch 
google and the leader autonomy have have the best minds have 
have the great minds point this out yet another example the 
challenges faced traditional auto companies the business selling human 
driven internal combustion propelled privately owned vehicles bring the 
right external talent the right time the right structure
