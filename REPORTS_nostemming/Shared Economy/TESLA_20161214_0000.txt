alphabet formation waymo symbolizes less ambitious 
diversified approach accelerating accident free transport 
networks believe this may reflect well the position 
established oems tsla assert their value both 
physical and data level the automotive ecosystem 
background alphabet has moved its autonomous vehicle project from google 
stand alone entity within alphabet and shifted the emphasis from fully 
autonomous cars without steering wheels robo taxi service that open 
commercial applications and partnerships throughout the transport stack 
ride sharing logistics trucking personal use vehicles including licensing with 
automakers addition the existing partnership with fca 
some key thoughts from tesla perspective 
the autonomous car race function collecting miles estimate 
tesla global fleet drives approximately million miles per day with many 
these miles autopilot also estimate the pace daily miles traveled 
double just over year this puts tesla unique position pursue state 
the art algorithmic driving and machine learning personal transport key 
pillars accident free driving analysis aggregated tesla driving data that 
reveals statistically significant positive safety outcomes could have potentially 
powerful impact the perceptions regulators consumers and investors for 
comparison uber recently disclosed its global fleet travels approximately 
million miles per day while data from google self driving car project suggests 
that their fleet drives just thousand miles per day exhibit 
and it also function collecting brains software engineers over the 
past months had expressed increasing concern that tesla was facing far 
greater competition for human talent join and stay within its organization 
time when many other competing firms the public and private markets were 
also the hunt for the best software and hardware engineers alphabet 
creation waymo may suggest reduced ambition longer time horizon 
develop completely autonomous vehicles and related architectures house 
true this could suggest turning the tide for least portion the talent 
battle that players like tesla have been confronting the past few quarters

perhaps the greatest and least appreciated value within the tesla 
organization the value its ability collect and process data scale 
machine learning environment real roads with real cars and pedestrians 
according experts have spoken this topic simulations are important 
but there substitute for driving real roads with real cars real weather 
and real pedestrians see the model important this company 
future multiple levels that they really have get right one could 
reasonably expect tesla emphasize the investment community the 
opportunity has accelerate the launch what could the world safest 
automobile and one that represents potential step change real world 
machine learning and the subsequent social and economic benefits 
some auto companies may choose work with waygo autonomous car 
development but expect many firms would rather not tie with the tech 
giant preferring develop proprietary solution our many discussions with 
oem management teams this topic have discovered high degree 
sensitivity over the sharing vehicle and passenger data see fca decision 
partner with alphabet driverless cars exception that not 
expect followed right away least other large oems who are 
developing proprietary solutions while subject change currently see tesla 
firmly the camp wanting control its own autonomous transport 
ecosystem and its associated data 
what does this mean for alphabet see these moves signal 
googl efforts scale its autonomous vehicle offering while controlling 
incremental costs and investment which believe will positive for 
googl earnings power that believe googl auto based partnerships 
and asset light model are likely more efficient way scale its miles 
driven and develop iterate improve its auto technology and the market 
strategy addition googl potential spinout waymo from could also 
increase waymo ability compete and attract top talent waymo 
employees compensated waymo equity would have greater potential 
benefit financially from waymo success particular compared being 
compensated with googl equity where autonomous vehicles are immaterial
