the prevailing view that ride sharing represents only 
minor tangential threat traditional car rental firms part 
due the uniqueness the airport presence which accounts 
for car rental profit believe the airport presence 
vulnerable 
our discussions with ride sharing firms both independent and oem 
sponsored suggest airports represent critical hubs which strong presence 
must established for end end mobility service our understanding 
that uber and lyft view airports strategically important given their persistence 
pursuing city city agreements for airport access even when they already 
operate legally the broader metro market note that the city newark 
and uber reached deal for uber pay front part deal for access the newark airport recently july the 
busiest airports the didn allow pickups drivers without chauffeur 
licenses and livery plates uber has since reached agreements some these 
airports including boston logan feb and atlanta dec uber still 
not legally allowed operate the orlando airport finally note there has 
often been lag between uber operating city and being able fully operate 
the airport years between uberx launch and full airport service the case

oem backed efforts shared mobility put car companies direct 
competition with traditional car rental firms there are growing number 
efforts auto manufacturers fund and commercialize car rental car sharing 
and ride sharing services shared mobility stand alone basis without 
any cooperation partnership with the traditional car rental firms 
shared mobility fleet management king car rental firms have 
physical fleet management competency real estate assets but they are not the 
only ones with expertise this field our discussions with oems suggest they 
also have the house capability deliver vehicles demand directly retail 
and fleet customers including ride sharing drivers per mile basis flexible 
model 
increased efforts from new entrants shared mobility coincide with 
systematic trend car rental firms missing investor expectations transaction

asked avis budget ceo larry shon about the trend oems entering the 
car rental business last november during their capital markets day summary 
the exchange taken from the webcast transcript was follows 
jonas almost every major oem kind launching some kind mobility 
initiative they seem taking very seriously the level board level 
creating separate legal entities rebranding themselves mobility companies 
what would your message your oem vehicle suppliers today saying warning them telling them what they should should not guess they 
attempt this transformation that they seem taking seriously 
larry shon course you are oem looking some the statistics that 
talked about earlier about how car ownership going moving more 
pay per use model you are going looking number different ways 
which how you are going play mobility think that completely appropriate 
and trust have had these conversations with our oem partners 
continue have these conversations not here warn anyone mean 
everyone knows how talk about the capabilities that managing that have 
managing very very large fleets how that applies some the things that they 
are looking talked about how could partner those types 
opportunities think over time perhaps you will even see some those ideas play 
out not here warn anyone just here say that have been huge 
part the ecosystem plan stay big part the ecosystem mobility 
have number brands and products that play number different use 
cases will the business all use cases mobility won don 
belong all those places but can certainly partner with people who and 
leverage what they bring the table and leverage what bring the table and
