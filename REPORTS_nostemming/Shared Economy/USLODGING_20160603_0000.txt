our past two analyses suggested that the number compression 
nights were not being heavily impacted alternative 
accommodations sept our main finding was that the number 
compression nights had surpassed the peak and 
was course grow another jan found that the number 
compression nights had grown suggesting still 
meaningful impact however that may have changed ytd through may 
there have been compression nights over the same period 
decline 
average daily rate premiums during compression nights are holding 
steady difficult compare rate each compression night has its own 
circumstance the impact the super bowl much different than large 
convention however analyzing compression night regular night 
premiums market the average premium has stayed relatively stable 
since the average premium was and ytd the 
average premium steady fact comparing ytd the 
same period the premium has actually improved from 
reason suggest may reading too much into the ytd data 
conventions are one the main drivers compression nights despite strong 
expected convention pace mgmt teams have been highlighting since 
the beginning the year that citywide convention calendars had slower 
growth with the outlook that scheduled much 
stronger that said our analysis through includes the shift easter 
out and 
methodology using smith travel research str data look daily hotel 
occupancy and rate for each the top lodging markets annual data set 
unique nights assume that compression nights periods peak 
demand were when markets occupancies were there were 
compression nights all potential nights had occupancy
