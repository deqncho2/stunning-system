demand for same day shipping 
market view 
faster shipping and fulfillment including same day are key ecommerce adoption and will put 
upward pressure the ecommerce players cost structures 
our view 
globally continue see low and decreasing demand for same day delivery and further evidence 
that free shipping the most important factor driving incremental online purchasing speed still 
matters but globally free more important and less than consumers would pay more for faster 
shipping this our view speaks amazon entrenched position and behavior modification causing 
customers expect free shipping though there remains dichotomy between amazon same day 
investment spending and consumer demand 
that said faster delivery priority for consumers china and india which speaks the difficulty 
international competitors face trying grow those markets 
where could wrong 
consumer shipping expectations may change over time and the large ecommerce companies like 
amazon may continue invest same day delivery despite apparent lack consumer demand which 
could pressure margins 
see low and decreasing demand for same day delivery and faster shipping free shipping still 
most important factor according our latest survey data free shipping the most important factor 
driving incremental online purchasing around the world nearly respondents globally indicated they 
would buy online more offered free shipping roughly unchanged from our survey results 
and although online retailers especially the and china are focusing more same day delivery only 
global consumers indicated they would buy more online retailer offered same day 
shipping down from our survey further consumer willingness pay for faster shipping 
remains relatively low global consumers only respondents would our 
survey 
short from these data conclude that one the biggest drivers forward ecommerce penetration still 
the offering free shipping rather than same day faster shipping through this lens online retailers offering 
free shipping will better positioned win and take share within their respective markets

same day shipping becoming less important all countries except china and india 
looking the data country see that the percentage consumers that would buy online more the 
retailer offered same day shipping and the percentage consumers that are willing pay for faster 
shipping have both decreased from our last survey all countries except china and india our alphawise data 
show that chinese and indian consumers value online delivery speed more than the global average even 
though they already enjoy some the fastest global shipping times 
despite the poor logistics infrastructure both countries online shoppers china and india are 
some the most demanding terms delivery time according our alphawise survey 
online purchases china and online purchases india are delivered fewer days the global 
average for more details shipping times see appendix global shipping times country 
believe this due population density extent china route density the most important factor 
the logistics industry and india the dense population the largest cities means several online retailers 
and shops are often nearby resulting short delivery distances and times 
result same and next day delivery have become important ecommerce battlegrounds china and india 
china given alibaba dominant market share the space some smaller players compete offering 
better services such next day hour delivery services differentiate result believe chinese 
online shoppers might spoiled ecommerce players china due fierce competition india most 
the large indian ecommerce companies are contemplating same day delivery several new indian startups such 
grofers peppertap and roadrunnr have come into being provide hyper local delivery while still 
early conclude consumers will willing pay for quick deliveries the takeaway that indian startups 
may use this hook attract new users and drive growth

what does this mean for brick and mortar stores 
hardline retailers have different thresholds regarding order size warrant free shipping offer for 
example within home furnishings companies offer range free shipping opportunities bed beth beyond 
williams sonoma the container store and pier imports free shipping offer the 
competitive broadlines space target recently lowered its free shipping threshold from while 
walmart recently introduced pilot shippingpass unlimited free day shipping for year 
our overall view that there will multiple brick and mortar winners within hardlines early movers such 
williams sonoma are well positioned and will continue enjoy advantage while companies 
like walmart home depot and lowe have come long way fast believe these businesses are 
omni channel ready today and have among the best prospects for future gains 
williams sonoma business anchored its commerce expertise after years significant 
investments its commerce platform williams sonoma has become the quintessential example retailer 
that can operate and thrive omni channel business its success starts with management channel agnostic 
view the business and entails deep focus having the best website functionality and shop ability for 
customers williams sonoma commerce platform first launched and has grown become the 
leading platform the industry not only does williams sonoma have the highest level traffic also has the 
global ecommerce july 
highest conversion rate among its peers what makes williams sonoma platform stand above the rest the 
consumer friendliness its easy navigate website the uniqueness the products sells and web content 
that complements its store layout and strategy think what williams sonoma has built more 
sustainable and will require less investment over time which should provide consistent ebit margin expansion 
view the home improvement segment relatively well protected from online competitive 
pressure given the high level service and exclusivity though tailers have started gain traction the 
market over the last few years estimate online retailers have grown share from since 
while not significant portion tailers capture more the home improvement market than several nationally 
recognized brands 
similar other hardline retailers with industry leading infrastructure the success ecommerce platform 
ultimately lies within management attitude home depot leadership knows physical retail its backbone but 
recognizes must learn embrace omni channel former home depot ceo frank blake said best the 
internet has evolved from being external threat being part and parcel our portfolio strategy 
believe home depot has done solid job walking the walk investing heavily interconnected retail 
technology improve efficiency and offer multi channel experience the company takes experimental 
approach with its newer technologies like its skype like virtual services and appliance kiosks which better 
engages the customer and creates simpler shopping experience these technologies have elevated the 
interconnectedness between retail and eccommerce with online orders originating retail store for 
the buy online pickup store customers home depot allocating space quickly fulfill customer orders 
streamline the fulfillment process 
one the largest investments home depot has undertaken the addition three direct fulfillment centers 
the intent for these dcs enable same day shipping with the help new warehouse management systems 
and new material handling systems the dcs will stock skus beyond the current retail assortment and are 
capable holding skus versus skus store 
also look favorably lowe among the most omni channel ready businesses our coverage this 
reflects lowe leading mylowes platform store technology logistics capabilities mobile payments and 
its ability digitally interact with customers lowe also focused flexible fulfillment unleashes its 
store network distribution weapon with the heavy lifting and infrastructure labor investments largely 
behind flow through should start improve over the next few years 
for specialty retail and department stores free shipping likely become requirement for all 
retailers over time only three retailers our softlines coverage universe nordstrom michael kors 
lululemon offer unequivocally free shipping every order every day with minimums 
surprisingly double that number offer free return shipping every order gap jcpenney nordstrom michael 
kors macy tiffany however almost every other softline retailer cover other than anthropologie 
offers free shipping every day over given threshold most the range 
our survey work suggests certain categories lend themselves more multi channel business model the 
softlines category being one them apparel intimate apparel fine jewelry accessories however simply 
because consumers choose shop for certain categories store least part the time does not suggest 
retailers aren required omni channel savvy believe brick and mortar retailers who have omnichannel inventory capabilities single crm system across channels and employee incentives aligned 
encourage cross channel conversion are best positioned please find more our report insight the 
changing path purchase who best positioned view urban outfitters the best positioned 
specialty retailer and macy the best positioned department store 
macy began investing omni channel capabilities nearly decade ago and their learning curve still has yet 
flatten out think macy omni channel initiatives will difficult for competitors copy given the 
financial resources and talent required macy places its investments into three buckets merchant strategy 
where place inventory making easier for customers shop and fulfillment 
urban outfitters management has embraced the emerging internet change opportunity more than many 
global ecommerce july 
others our view urban outfitters has continuously improved online customer acquisition customer retention 
analytic capabilities database management and granular marketing over the past few years and its online sales 
penetration proof efforts are paying off peers addition investing online operational 
abilities urban outfitters focused expanding its web exclusive product offering increasing online style 
breadth assorting locally and integrating stores with websites urban outfitters ceo dick hayne believes 
ecommerce sales can represent the company total sales from today 
who offers the best consumer shipping experience 
given the global importance shipping believe ecommerce companies that offer superior customer 
shipping experience will best positioned the long term competitive landscape shown exhibit our 
survey data shows that the ecommerce players with the best shipping experience among consumers their 
home countries were amazon the satisfied flipkart india and and tmall china 
each the high importance shipping global consumers combined with high shipping satisfaction 
among local amazon flipkart and tmall consumers speaks the competitive advantage these retailers 
have their respective home markets and the challenges traditional brick and mortar retailers and nondomestic ecommerce companies face 
the see evidence that amazon strong shipping has set high bar and arguably changed 
consumer expectations with regards online shipping our survey consumer satisfaction with ebay 
satisfied and etsy shipping experiences lagged that amazon our view this speaks 
the challenges ebay and etsy face amazon continues set the standard for shipping speed and satisfaction 
the however for ebay note that its consumer shipping satisfaction still among the highest 
globally and only consumers have shopped its site which view evidence its loyal 
customer base 
china see and tmall have pretty similar satisfaction rate for shipping experience although 
tmall has much higher penetration rate among respondents not surprising that consumers are 
happy with delivery given the majority orders are fulfilled house the other hand tmall 
satisfaction ratio shipping experience higher than our expectation given all the fulfillment done through 
third party logistics companies which are typically selected sellers the platform this might viewed 
evidence that alibaba effort upgrading customers experiences working also believe alibaba china 
smart logistics network cainiao playing important role improving the overall efficiency the logistics 
industry china 
india highlighted our alphawise survey february see decoding what india does the 
internet fast delivery was key differentiating factor across websites primarily for electronics and apparel the 
two largest segments within indian ecommerce both flipkart and amazon ranked high due their own

japan distribution networks have been developed already possible this point for consumers 
enjoy high level convenience regardless which ecommerce platform they patronize some bottlenecks 
still arise the delivery stage especially receiving goods the ecommerce shopping experience japan

progressing 
market view 
mobile adoption continues grow but being driven largely tablets consumers still feel more 
comfortable purchasing tablets than smartphones 
our view 
see mobile share ecommerce increasing around the globe mobile penetration ecommerce 
now driven increased smartphone adoption our survey shows that 
consumers globally are increasingly comfortable transacting mobile devices and specifically 
smartphones where ecommerce penetration rose from over time believe increased 
willingness and arguably comfort purchase items mobile devices the smartphone globally 
will drive faster overall ecommerce growth moreover believe increase smartphone shopping 
behavior will drive more dollars onto mobile platforms transactions will more directly 
linked spend this likely benefit google facebook twitter and pinterest with google likely the 
biggest near term beneficiary more smartphone driven purchases will help close the company 
mobile desktop monetization gap 
where could wrong 
consumer comfort willingness transact mobile devices could increase more slowly than 
anticipated 
why does mobile matter general consumers are comfortable purchasing items their desktops but 
given the global smartphone and global tablet install base over time believe increased 
willingness and arguably comfort purchase items mobile devices will drive faster overall ecommerce 
growth essentially see the combination consumers that are increasingly always connected 
shop with higher willingness make purchases mobile devices bringing larger share 
consumers wallets online 
mobile ecommerce trends matter for online advertising companies too believe increase mobile 
shopping behavior will drive more advertising dollars online onto mobile platforms facebook twitter and 
pinterest could benefit here they experiment with buy buttons bring consumer and advertising dollars 
online but google likely the bigger near term beneficiary increased mobile purchasing 
intent more mobile purchases would help close the company mobile desktop monetization 
gap

what about the difference between smartphones and tablets 
but mobile penetration growth only tells half the story exhibit break apart the mobile transaction 
data between smartphones and tablets knowing which devices are driving mobile penetration matters because 
the global smartphone install base larger than tablets and the more comfortable consumers become 
shopping smartphones the more likely they are spend more money online which positive for 
ecommerce 
increased consumer willingness purchase smartphones matters online advertising players like google 
too that large part the estimated cost per click monetization gap between smartphones and 
tablets desktop due lower smartphone conversion and fewer transactions 
the good news our data show increasing consumer willingness purchase items their 
smartphones see that the percentage purchases done smartphones increased 
from this material increase over short period time considering smartphone 
penetration only increased from 
fair not all this smartphone purchase adoption appears incremental tablet penetration fell 
from but this our view trend monitor because smartphone purchase adoption 
continues ramp likely drive faster overall global ecommerce growth again due the larger 
smartphone install base and the notion being able shop online anytime anywhere mentioned above

shipping times remain sub optimal which speaks amazon competitive advantage 
somewhat surprisingly delivery times are the slowest any country surveyed with orders 
delivered days less this down from since our last survey decrease and the 
largest slowdown after brazil this speaks the challenges and costs retailers face shipping across 
less densely populated country particularly outside the major coastal cities this also reinforces our view that 
amazon well positioned maintain its dominance ecommerce with significant investments 
distribution and sortation amazon already has the most extensive ecommerce fulfillment network the 
and perhaps globally free and fast shipping increasingly becoming requirement compete 
ecommerce amazon already has the infrastructure place which has allowed amazon establish its prime 
loyalty program amazon prime day free shipping and prime now hour shipping sets high bar for the 
rest the market where day shipping more typical than other countries see this one 
amazon competitive moats the scale and breadth its fulfillment network unlikely replicated its 
competitors without significant time and cost investments 
chinese consumers enjoy the fastest shipping times globally our survey work shows that chinese 
consumers get their online packages the quickest with nearly online orders delivered days less 
roughly unchanged since our last survey fact the more densely populated countries our survey china 
germany the and japan reported the fastest online shipping times with more than online orders 
delivered days less china specifically believe this result local ecommerce companies

competing investing offer shorter delivery times and better consumer experience gain market share 
japanese logistics operators and retailers are already undertaking new measures for improving 
convenience further japan consumers are able enjoy same next day delivery services for most 
orders other than certain long tail items however delivery service providers and retailers continue work 
improve convenience further recently some companies have introduced early morning late evening delivery 
services for single person double income households where there often one home during the day 
services that allow hour pick ordered items designated collection point such convenience 
store near the customer home softbank rakuten such efforts are likely reduce lead times between order 
and delivery for ecommerce users 
brazilian shipping times are bad and are getting worse brazilian consumers reported waiting the longest 
for their online deliveries with only online orders delivered days less notably this down from 
since our last survey decrease and the largest slowdown any country our survey 
believe the deterioration was highly influenced national strike truck drivers that were protesting 
against increases fuel and toll prices but overall the long delivery time brazil speaks many 
infrastructure challenges faced continent sized country where the majority transportation done 
trucks that drive poorly maintained roads and the rising penetration international websites especially 
chinese which the standard delivery time days they ship their products overseas
