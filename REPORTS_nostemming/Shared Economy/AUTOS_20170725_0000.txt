shared mobility autonomous driving and electric transport 
auto world shared mobility autonomous driving electric transport 
expect the futuristic vision world filled with electrical vehicles where 
self driving cars deliver occupants and from homes relieving them driving 
duties they arrive almost without noticing become reality year 
already financial statements japanese automakers cite self driving and 
electrical vehicles areas addressed management policies 
environmental measures and this leaves doubt that the vector 
autos industry management resources turned toward auto 
paradigm shift spells tough battle for the autos industry the business model 
paradigm shift means two changes first the response auto environmental 
regulations and autonomous driving will change the definition automobiles 
themselves and change the level requirements particular environmental 
regulation the national level and sets the rules engagement these 
markets becoming impossible stay contention with internal combustion 
vehicles alone and all firms are likely forced have hev phev 
lineup second the scope monetization expanding include ride sharing

stocks but the following scenario possible wider adoption automated 
vehicles likely increase outside trips seniors and patients requiring care 
think this development might have number favorable outcomes easier 
access hospitals that stimulates demand for injection drugs that require hospital 
visits benefits for chugai and ono with relatively high injection drug ratios 
stronger demand for otc drugs such allergy medicine because easier use 
drugs with drowsiness side effect and increased use drug therapy for

its relatively large exposure neurological disorder drugs 
transport takuya osaka seino holdings fukuyama transporting families 
shrink and the population ages japan the domestic trucking industry confronts 
shortage drivers that likely become increasingly serious under these 
conditions the wider use self driving functions likely major boon even
