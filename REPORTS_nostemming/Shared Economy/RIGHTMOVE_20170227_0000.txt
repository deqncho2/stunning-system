structural drivers mean rightmove revenue could still double from here 
estimate estate agents the are spending their revenue online 
classifieds rightmove has share time spent classified sites has 
agents subscription and more listings than zoopla and therefore 
benefits from strong network effect after all when onthemarket launched 
agents dropped zoopla even though zoopla subscription cost was around half 
rightmove the time 
and rightmove has attractive strategy drive revenue growth uses 
combination products and price rightmove delivered increase 
arpa average revenue per advertiser confident will able deliver 
least and has history overdelivering the optimiser package 
could have contributed growth the company sees upside for 
move from its current penetration which would add another 
rightmove free data tools for estate agents help them understand the 
value these products and drive stickiness the company also expects its 
predictive sales tool the outside view uses algorithm help agents identify 
potential future sellers start contributing revenue growth the back half 
longer term shift towards dynamic pricing some its most popular 
products should also offer upside rightmove believes that product could still 
drive revenue growth excess the medium term driving 
growth from here and believe realistic long term target 
the new ceo signals changes the current company strategy believes 
the company still offers great value for estate agents and sees great upside from

however halifax still expects property prices supported 
ongoing shortage property for sale low levels housebuilding and exceptionally 
low interest rates the wider than normal range reflects uncertainty around the 
economy countrywide before changed reporting reported that its ebitda 
margin rental properties was for its non london estate agency sales and 
for london premier there does seem room for margin compression 
forecast agents going out business for charts the property market 
see property data 
what about the rental market some investors have raised concerns that the ban 
tenancy fees could significantly hinder rental agents profitability the change under 
consultation and unlikely get approved until september most agents 
charge least commission rentals with higher percentage for managed 
properties assuming yield average property price would imply 
annual income per property addition agents can also charge fees for services like 
inventory checks electrical gas safety certificates property inspections income 
expense reports etc see foxton here for example this means that the average 
tenant fee estimated the autumn statement might more than single digit 
percentage agents rental income addition slowdown sales activity typically 
drives increase rental demand rightmove agents are lettings 
only and the rest also rentals which combined represent 
rightmove agent revenue 
forecast agents declining pts and arpa growth remain around 
the next two years beyond that structural growth online and low takerate from agents should allow for high single digit arpa growth through the end our 
year forecast period 
leave our price target unchanged raise our forecasts reflect 
the better than expected results but our assumptions remain broadly 
unchanged value the business dcf with fcf yield given subscriptionbased model and strong competitive position and long term growth rate and 
wacc our price target implies and fcf yield the 
valuation expect outside recessionary periods the key downside risks our 
price target are sharp property downturn driving more agents out business leading
