why apple and alphabet 
delayed plans make cars 
key takeaway from ces was that fully autonomous car 
development involves miles data and time from real driving 
conditions the oems are landlords this mobile real estate 
but who pays the rent 
the secular flaws and cyclical challenges are well known but the oems 
deserve just bit more respect the race develop autonomous car while 
still envision future which the world transportation network likely 
dominated nontraditional players designing vehicles that bear little 
resemblance those sale today one the biggest developments this 
past year has been the marked step back ambition make complete vehicles 
the world tech giants identify key reasons think apple and 
alphabet have pulled back from plans make their own cars least the 
near term 
harvesting you need lots and lots real world driving data capture and 
process discussion about the future transport elon musk once described 
autonomous car one would describe baby infant child begins its life 
with highly tuned sensory capacity and brain designed for rapid learning from 
its environment each day the baby life brings exposure ever more stimuli 
triggering further brain development autonomous car born with 
sophisticated blend computing power and sensory capability feed and 
develop its artificial brain like baby the autonomous car may inherit important 
functions instincts its software from its ancestors while also designed 
learn driving further improvements that can passed onto current and future 
generations 
capital capacity making cars massively capital intensive and there 
already much darn capacity out there run large number firms that 
may willing business surprisingly reasonable terms whether 
vehicle autonomous human driven internal combustion engine electric 
drive these devices must manufactured high scale combination 
men women and machines tech firms have pushed the model contract 
manufacturing the realm mobile phones extreme levels 
understandable that the same firms may seek outsource such activities 
cover over auto oems globally morgan stanley supplying close 
million units light vehicle demand with well over million units light 
vehicle capacity 
liability the development and testing autonomous cars could involve 
potentially significant numbers civilian casualties believe many players 
this field and the investment community may underestimating the legal

regulatory moral and ethical factors work even fully functioning driving 
policy algorithm designed maximize life will likely involved fatal 
accidents possibly some cases where the car had choose between two 
difficult alternatives while the greater good improving public health and 
safety may powerful motivator theory practice the real world 
messy and litigious place auto companies are familiar with such risks terms 
defects recalls mostly mechanical devices airbag inflators gas tanks etc 
the rules change when casualty results from software that was doing what 
was programmed one thing sue auto company with gross 
margins and market cap that made product with defect it another

time they have time large government certified vehicle network may 
take lot longer than people think while not question the end result 
transportation network shared electric and ultimately fully autonomous 
machines believe the investment community and the popular financial media 
may potentially overestimating how soon this form transport will become 
the hegemony however qualitative believe more thorough consideration

stock implications oems over suppliers oems may have greater relevance and 
time horizon remaining than the market currently gives them credit for 
reexamination key economic inputs has forced investors reconsider their 
exposure autos deregulation lower taxes and improved consumer 
confidence and recovery financial institutions could this auto cycle continue 
longer than anyone thought 
key thoughts the potential for further rotation into the auto sector and 
why prefer oems suppliers 
the sentiment starting point very low our discussions with investors reveal 
strong aversion exposure autos the list reasons long and serious 
peak auto cycle overextended credit conditions risks used car values offlease vehicles and technological disruption from shared autonomous and 
electric cars 
you feel more positive about the next years the auto cycle postelection our economists have raised their gdp outlook and materially 
reduced their probability recession over the next months autos are 
classic deep cyclicals with volume and mix expressing strong correlations 
factors such housing and oil patch according the oems energy and 
account for much pickup truck demand texas the world 
largest pickup truck market investors tell they are concerned about the 
potential for higher interest rates stunt the availability auto credit 
however note more than auto lending from the captive finance 
subs who have number other tools their disposal terms approvals loan 
value residual value assumptions manage monthly payment levels 
beyond just interest rates 
interest rates are just one many factors impacting vehicle affordability the 
impact interest rates auto loan fundamentally different than say 
home loan the early years the interest component year mortgage 
payment can easily the principal payment for month fully amortizing 
auto loan the principal payment typically higher than the interest 
portion auto loans are typically one fifth one sixth the term home 
payment we not saying interest rates don matter but there are many other 
factors with larger impact the monthly payment for auto loan 
consider providing reasonable doubt the near term certainty the next 
cyclical downturn may enough encourage some investors consider 
increasing exposure the sector least temporarily moreover auto credit 
comes down financial institution willingness lend potentially rising rate 
environment must balanced environment where financial institutions 
may experiencing other potentially offsetting favorable changes their ability 
take incremental risk 
new cash for clunkers around the corner have been writing since 
the first half believe step change vehicle safety brought about 
adas automatic emergency braking aeb could according growing amount 
data from suppliers and national insurance institutes potentially reduce the 
chances vehicle causing vehicle vehicle vehicle pedestrian crash 
cities and highways much more expect these technologies 
will standard equipment nearly all new cars sale the within 
years cost less than the price vehicle per month 
additional monthly payment while this may very good for new car 
demand would create income inequality problem for consumers who 
cannot get access credit purchase new and far safer vehicles the income 
inequality problem fold lower income consumers left more dangerous 
used cars these consumers face rising auto insurance premiums and 
the consumers will confront greater negative equity from degradation the 
residual value their car while the situation may take number years
