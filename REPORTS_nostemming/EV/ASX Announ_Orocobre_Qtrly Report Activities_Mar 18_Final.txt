operational update 
the lower production rate the march quarter was due lower evaporation rates the period below those 
caused reduced solar radiation from cloudy conditions and above normal rainfall particular the february mean 
evaporation rate was the lowest recorded since and less than half that february resulting lower than expected 
brine concentrations the beginning march concentrations improved during march but did not recover the level 
expected affecting production performance during this period and into the current quarter 
pond harvesting 
towards the end the quarter the first cycle salt harvesting commenced from the harvestable ponds the final eight ponds 
the pond system this process will occur approximately every three years and involves the removal the majority salt 
mainly halite and sylvite which has precipitated through the evaporative process construction the salt stock pile area has 
commenced immediately adjacent the existing harvest ponds where the mined salts will stored 
the sequential process involves each pond being drained and then the salt being removed although evaporative area lost 
the process the recovery stored brine from the salts through the drainage process and the addition three harvest ponds 
due for construction this quarter expected fully compensate the impact reduced evaporation area 
the salt drainage and harvesting process will take approximately months 
carbon dioxide recovery 
carbon dioxide used the olaroz lithium facility the production battery grade lithium carbonate currently sourced 
from near buenos aires cordoba and mendoza and transported kilometres truck consequently significant 
component total reagent costs and the company installing recovery systems various parts the purification circuit 
recover from the production process 
results from engineering studies and trial plant over the last year have demonstrated that recovery total 
possible and orders have now been placed for provision and installation permanent equipment capital expenditure this 
project expected less than the plant supplied package specialist manufacturer europe 
installation and operation the permanent recovery equipment expected the second half following some 
delays the procurement and manufacturing the equipment 
future production and guidance 
production the june quarter expected significantly higher than the march quarter the end march harvest pond 
inventories were approximately above the same period last year and continue supplied with brine from intermediate 
and primary ponds line with revised pond operating practices plant feed brine concentrations are currently above the 
levels the same time last year inventory balance between the pond areas will affected the salt harvesting process but 
this not expected negatively impact production 
previously advised the company expects full year production will approximately less than the previous 
guidance approximately tonnes production for the month april has been tonnes

update progress 
orocobre and ttc are well advanced with plans for proposed naraha lithium hydroxide plant built japan 
the proposed location well situated near potential customers which reduces the common risks caking and degradation 
quality when lithium hydroxide transported exposed humidity 
the process will utilise primary grade lithium carbonate sourced from olaroz and locally sourced japanese lime the test work 
demonstrated that very high quality battery grade lithium hydroxide could produced from customised process 
contract negotiations continued with the two engineering firms the selection criteria for the engineering contractor includes 
turn key commissioning and personnel training with process product quality and performance guarantees 
negotiations continue with ttc regarding the commercial arrangements the joint venture structure staffing and 
management the construction phase also being determined financing arrangements have been advanced with term 
sheet being provided from japanese banks approval for million subsidy was received from the japanese government 
capital expenditure for the lithium hydroxide plant remains approximately million basis pre subsidies 
operating costs excluding lithium carbonate feedstock for the lithium hydroxide plant remain approximately 
tonne delivering very favourable investment case

market and sales 
total volume lithium carbonate sold the march quarter was tonnes lithium carbonate prices increased 
tonne fob for the quarter 
since operations commenced olaroz has developed strong customer base customers who have tested and accepted the 
high grade purified and prime products the purified product regularly tests lithium carbonate and sold battery 
and cathode end users the prime product regularly tests lithium carbonate and sold variety technical and 
industrial end users neither these products require any additional processing for their respective markets and uses 
lithium market 
the rechargeable battery market continued forge ahead generating strong lithium demand despite the holiday season while 
many large cathode customers reportedly attempted build lithium inventories the december quarter stocks were quickly 
run down the chinese government clarified the policy regarding new energy vehicles nev this resulted many 
customers returning the market earlier than lithium suppliers expected time when lithium producers volumes were fullycommitted uncommitted supply from smaller chinese brine and lepidolite spodumene conversion plants that intermittently 
sell into the spot market during the year was also limited operations were impacted the chinese new year and spring 
festival holidays 
the differential between china domestic market price and the rest the world market price continued close qoq major 
chinese producers tianqi and ganfeng prices were reportedly stable levels with committed volume available both 
experienced imbalance between spodumene concentrate supply and lithium salt production due longer than expected 
maintenance completion and commissioning expansion volume tianqi jiangsu conversion plant lce nameplate 
capacity was shut down for extended period during april for maintenance resulting significant backlog undelivered 
volume while production from ganfeng expanded capacity hydroxide expansion was delayed commissioning

meanwhile shandong ruifu product line installed convert direct shipping ore dso was scheduled finish commissioning 
during the quarter however information could sourced confirm this had occurred indicate the dso had been 
converted lithium carbonate equivalent product 
further investment required downstream conversion capacity address the existing bottleneck for spodumene conversion 
response many the existing conversion plant operators announced expansions varying scales and timeframes 
historically actual effective conversion capacity has been significantly less than claimed nameplate capacity therefore the 
actual conversion capacity realised the short medium term will lie somewhere between the existing capacity and claimed 
new nameplate capacity

greater investment upgrading advice from recent the december quarter addition the mandatory sales 
requirements and credit system clarified during the quarter china most recently announced would remove foreign ownership 
caps for companies making fully electric and plug hybrid vehicles for makers commercial vehicles and the 
wider car market these ownership restrictions were imposed limiting foreign carmakers owning more 
than percent share any local venture and forcing foreign carmakers work with chinese firms

borax argentina 
progress was achieved during the quarter developing borax argentina into sustainable operational and financial business 
unit the strategy one shifting product mix that will drive higher average pricing improved margins and reducing unit 
costs full production rates this product mix realignment has included the removal one high volume marginal loss making 
product sales refined higher value borate products decahydrate pentahydrate anhydrous were compared the 
previous corresponding period 
several new product development opportunities have been identified since this initiative began which have demonstrated 
strong market acceptance particularly the local south american market during the quarter more customer testing was 
completed resulting product approval integration these new products into the customer supply chain will pursued over 
the course the year unit costs are near record lows 
borax argentina will aim drive greater sales share these new products but recognise the need for customers manage 
themselves out their current supply arrangements before the financial benefits the initiative can realised
