our focus this note electric drivetrains simply expand that theme not 
the exclusion the other themes the basis the changes strategy announced 
this summer and more recently followed daimler and bmw 
electric drive current ice engines are highly pollutive the environment and have 
significant health impacts particularly urban areas although there have been health 
concerns for many years deteriorating smog conditions many cities and also recent 
breaches regulatory rules seem accelerating demands for change certainly 
regulations emissions are becoming sharply tighter globally but particularly 
europe and are becoming much more tightly controlled this raising the cost 
existing ice engines and making evs relatively more attractive some oems have now 
finally reacted with sharp change strategy and ambitious vehicle launch and 
sales targets this report analyse why this happening and what may mean for 
auto investors 
autonomous driving not here repeat any the excellent work done this 
topic our colleague adam jonas short car companies and tech firms are 
combining add significant autonomous capability into passenger vehicles which will 
eventually allow the car become fully self driving recent technologies include fully 
adaptive cruise control lane control and departure systems and automatic electronic 
braking systems adam has highlighted how this has many advantages including much 
lower car ownership penetration sharply improved utilisation global automotive 
assets cars totalling trillion value from the current but also the 
potential for huge improvements safety computers reduce driver error see his

can achieved through the connectivity the car and the integration the car with 
the smart phone using ride sharing and ride hailing apps connect users clearly this 
has become huge phenomenon many our lives and the lives urban millennials 
clearly with average occupancy the car less than and with utilisation low 
the potential for shared mobility enormous the other hand taxis far 
account for only about all miles driven and although this will undoubtedly rise 
shared mobility becomes reality seems there will still plenty room for our 
current owned mobility model view all this simply time scale ownership 
model per below where full ownership has already been replaced loans and 
leasing which would then see getting shorter and shorter short term convenient 
availability options start multiply and ride hailing autonomous cars could eventually 
replace our cars altogether obviously lot has happen for that become possible

the point about all this the inter dependence all three trends electric vehicles 
will hugely accelerate the electrical and electronic content the vehicle aiding and 
being helped trends towards autonomous driving which can control speeds 
transmissions even routes maximise efficiency and battery range autonomous 
cars would hard pushed refuel themselves with ice engines whereas induction 
charging already reality for phones shared mobility helps the efficiency all cars 
but would much more powerful with autonomous cars which themselves rely

soon new oems add their own electric vehicle strategies think the assumed

show two previous technology replacement cycles smartphones accounted for 
less than the market early but late reached over similarly 
have seen three technology cycles again showing fast adoption rates from 
introduction very high penetration within decade for each generation 
technology understand why investors and even auto oems might little bit 
wary the potential for evs replace ice technology however seems clear than 
when these generational technology changes start they have historically accelerated 
very sharply and caused significant changes the underlying industrial landscape 
different reasons why technology may win 
there remain many question marks over the viability and eventual likelihood 
technology taking over the automotive drivetrain battery costs remain very high 
battery range remains too small and batteries are still too heavy battery charging 
infrastructure has not been sorted out many countries are evs actually 
environmentally friendly given through life cost and environmental impact and 
consumer demand seems have been very limited for most evs launched date presumably excluding tesla despite this now have situation where some the 
largest oems the world are investing heavily this technology and setting aggressive 
targets for their take think the key answer that political and regulatory change 
mean that the internal combustion engine longer the cheapest answer the long 
run and may not viable all world demanding zero emissions below look 
various different reasons why large oems such daimler and have moved 
towards their new strategies 
cost regulatory compliance for current ice engine 
costs compliance for ice engine technology are rising sharply show this analysis 
below regulatory oversight increases sharply post recent industry revelations 
remember that diesel was key part the oem strategy for future performance the change regulatory focus nox and the related fall diesel penetration 
changing that strategy altogether with the help european government incentives 
diesel went from just over market share well over market share 
see reason why evs could not similarly incentivised just diesel 
incentives are removed with the change political emissions policy remember also that 
may our focus many these companies are thinking about and 
beyond just the first step how oems achieve future targets 
even lower with existing ice engines will regulators some regions even 
push towards zero emissions 
the real change our view that may have informed and daimler strategic 
changes that wltc and rde testing regimes coming europe over the next years 
will drive significant increase the costs complying with the standards see our 
detailed work the new testing standards faurecia what happening diesel 
oct compared the oems original assumptions for the cost ices recent 
years have seen several changes 
adding the global customer preference for larger and higher emissions 
suvs 
the gradual decline lower diesel 
the introduction the new wltc test cycle much tougher for nox europe and 
china and finally 
the new rde targets 
model these changes our illustrative exhibit below whilst the falling cost 
battery technology remains question mark dependent future technological 
chemical break throughs and timing this seems uncertain maybe the rising cost 
ice that proving the real driver oem strategy show below exhibit 
highlighting how the two cost scenarios interact have little concept the exact 
shape each curve the exact timing the cost changes but our chart clearly 
highlights what happening the original cost regulatory compliance assumptions 
the ice engine and the fact that higher ice costs cross over with falling battery 
drivetrain costs earlier whether our chart timing proves accurate its exact timing 
not would not like speculate

zev programme are fully reflected the impact assessment 
possible that current very stringent cafe standards the may renegotiated

implications for global autos stocks nov 
emissions absolute may become unachievable 
believe that adding nox the focus already raises regulatory costs very 
substantially and changes the technologies available meet such targets especially 
take real world driving emissions into account what would happen likely 
emissions standards are simply unattainable with existing ice technology 
even zero some cities states assume very sharp increase penetration for 
mild hybrids and other ice emission control technologies maybe these technologies 
are not sufficient meet absolute emission ambitions further out there risk that 
some regions emission requirements fall zero reduce healthcare risks from air 
pollution 
fleet average nox regulations apply each car standards are based 
fleet averages allowing oems continue sell some high models those the 
high end the range likely the most profitable long there are enough low 
zero cars each manufacturer mix for regulations around particulates such

clearly oems still have meet those targets although seems that rde testing 
may reduce the engine downsizing turbocharger option given the changes think this 
making the cost curve calculations around ice and the recent announcements 
higher penetration targets seems that oems are shifting towards managing 
targets via mix hybrids evs and away from reducing internal combustion 
engines 
oems must achieve average across their new car sales model year 
around the exact target varies slightly manufacturer based mix larger 
vehicles get slightly higher allowance for bmw the example below the 
target oems have achieved average annual reductions

cost batteries can come down with new investment 
battery costs remain major barrier increasing penetration most estimates 
have seen suggest that costs per kwh would have fall below including 
packaging and battery management system order make evs economically viable 
most evs currently production have battery capacities around implying 
total cost around per vehicle kwh kwh and 
kwh our colleagues covering major battery players chem kyle kim and samsung 
sdi shawn kim expect costs for the cell only fall more quickly than expected 
driven significant capacity increases china but still see cell prices alone 
packaging and battery management system kwh batteries more 
hype than opportunity jun 
however bev costs come down even minimally and the cost compliance 
existing ice engines rising sharply then oems will move bev strategy long 
they can see the two cost curves crossing over show above think that 
inflection point their thinking has now happened now happening many oems 
whilst many investors remain sceptical the viability battery electric technology 
given the lack range and battery expense today are sure other technologies have 
beaten similar scepticism the past auto market volumes expand the potential 
future battery demand expect the investment battery technologies multiplying 
and should lead technological break throughs reducing the cost per kwh look 
what has happened the cost solar panels per watt which fell from less 
than the span years even since years into the development the 
solar panel prices per watt have fallen further similar stage development 
for lithium ion batteries today costs have fallen from over per kwh below

clearly even successful electric vehicles such the nissan leaf have made little 
headway global car market shares and many vehicles have failed sell any volume 
all however also seems clear that the technology improving all the time 
charging times are falling and usability improving again think there will 
inflection point where range and usability combine with the right price the tesla model

consumer cost benefits and financing 
although this stage the price evs still much higher than the cost ice vehicles 
especially cheaper petrol technologies have explained this may not remain the 
case rising regulatory requirements may continue push ice vehicle prices higher 
the same time oems are becoming increasingly incentivised reduce the relative costs 
phevs and evs just try and meet fleet emission requirements further even 
without direct government purchase subsidies consumers with low zero emission 
vehicles many markets may benefit from other tax benefits such lower annual road 
taxes lower road tolls congestion charges even use dedicated traffic lanes

much higher current transaction prices have also assumed that least 
early evs have much lower residuals than ice cars suggesting that lease costs will 
much higher given greater depreciation will have covered during the life 
the lease thus monthly lease costs for phevs and bev could much 
higher than monthly lease costs for petrol engined alternatives however then

lower insurance costs and lower service costs than current vehicles calculate that

believe that automakers not have wait for demand for their vehicles pick 
strongly believe that leading oems use their distribution arms and financial 
services business proactively generate demand for models and when they need 
believe that globally lower interest rates have sharply contributed their ability 
oems have been able control monthly spend converting savings from 
lower interest costs into higher asps and content per car believe oems can 
achieve the same feat with evs they are incentivised with some oems selling 
california evs very heavily subsidised prices just meet california air board zero 
emission regulations allowing them continue sell much more profitable trucks and 
suvs that large market seems oems can incentivised sell low zero 
emission cars even net cost themselves 
the example above might possible for oems bundle total cost 
ownership tco for consumers capture the through life savings offset some 
the initial capital cost the bev phev alternatively oems face significant 
penalties for non compliance with emissions legislation then again would quite 
possible for oems cross subsidise evs from their existing ice business and yet still 
maximising business profitability politicians are starting understand incentives for 
consumers may not the only way raise penetration levels 
what clear however that key variable this debate the level residuals that 
assume new evs although have already allowed for significantly worse 
performance residuals than current ice vehicles performance may even 
worse depending battery performance the other hand the availability much 
lower tco evs could similarly have sharply negative impact residuals current 
ice vehicles consumer demand switches quickly then the market will face glut 
off lease ice cars which could severely depress their residuals 
thus seems clear that oems will have agile managing their total financial 
services lease exposure seems likely that given the uncertainty consumers will 
choose lease initial models leaving the oem take the residual risk this 
suggests that fast conversion rate from ice models consumers would require 
significant growth market lease penetration requiring further growth oem financial 
services balance sheets and adding their risks however given that many these 
launches won happen until after first real residual risks won appear until 
the earliest however may have impact and leasing strategies 
before then 
future regulations and incentives 
key parts our arguments favour the are not necessarily just the regulations 
laws and incentives that have today car companies have manage generations 
vehicles that will launched over decade from now and may continue selling 
various guises until this means that auto oems are looking future 
changes and political trends much current laws thus for many auto oems their 
strategies are already set stone unfortunately being affected new 
test cycles and real world driving emissions tests these have clearly increased the need 
reduce nox emissions further 
germany banning ices however initial industry negotiations regarding 
european emission standards are another huge step and seems unlikely these trends 
will ease significantly much less reverse thus even germany spiegel had article 
october reporting that the german bundesrat had passed resolution 
ban the ice starting the resolution calls the european commission 
approve only zero emission passenger vehicles for use european roads whilst the 
bundesrat representing german states has legislative power its recommendations 
clearly help shape the overall european debate the resolution suggests the 
stimulation emission free mobility the use taxes and stimulus boost zero 
emission vehicle sales 
china quotas for evs phevs soon certainly seems diesel tax 
advantages will ended europe soon contrast germany approved subsidy 
for electric car purchases only may allowing consumers subsidy for full 
vehicles and for phev with goal getting vehicles the road 
any debate around zero emissions must concern for european oems 
providing further fuel for recent strategy conversion further development 
german environment minister barbara hendricks was quoted bloomberg 
november saying she backed aggressive new targets for sales china being 
proposed draft legislation from china industry minister miao wei now china 
considering legislation requiring all automakers sell specific quota zero and low 
emission vehicles starting overall deliveries almost vehicles this 
proposed target then set rise and oems that fail 
meet the targets would face penalties would forced buy credits from 
competitors meet the targets for the german oems the initial target would mean 
having sell over and phev vehicles each for bmw and mercedes and over 
annually for such short time frame this could prove very difficult

now proposing new higher daily congestion charge for diesel cars built before

clean air zone framework this month looking clean air zones birmingham leeds

bmw electric but targets 
bmw launched its own electric vehicles and brand the series well ahead the 
competition with the and bmw recently announced over sales its allelectric and phev vehicles after launching the second generation the recently 
with increase battery range bmw was very early with series phev concept 
back and phev version the launched with the range now 
expanded seven phev models with sales over date and over electrified 
bmw sales september alone start his speech the report the 
results bmw ceo harald kruger said the bmw group has clear vision how our 
customers the premium segment will stay the move after mobility will 
autonomous electric and fully connected are electrifying our vehicles across all 
our brands and across all our segments and series hard argue bmw does not have 
strong view 
however unlike the competition bmw not yet committing itself targeted 
penetration rates for evs like new models unit sales 
and mercedes models for units sales instead bmw facing the 
regulatory hurdle with sharp increase the number models being launched 
with plug hybrid powertrains pure evs bmw continues support its new 
new roadster from and has said will launch mini and 
well the next however with its experience the bmw also 
said over the coming years will need make significant upfront investments this 
applies not only sustainable drivetrains but also digital connectivity autonomous 
driving and mobility services our financial strength continues provide the basis for 
this clearly investments will need substantial 
evs sales 
the initial presentation its strategy outlined plans for new model 
launches and plans for units sales per year compared 
unit sales this implies between and group volumes from evs not 
have visibility underlying group volume assumptions here but seems safe 
assume that the unit target implies least group volumes pure 
products already planned for production include the porsche mission for the 
audi tron for and most recently the for clearly 
assumptions around penetration are very different from the penetration levels 
required purely meet regulatory standards suggesting that has taken the view 
that competitive dynamics and customer demand are going require very large 
product offering within the next decade has developed completely new modular 
platform meb provide the basis for all its model launches believing that the 
differences inherent the drivetrain require dedicated platform not all oems 
have far taken the same approach 
daimler evs sales

ceo said emission free automobiles are the future daimler could hardly have been 
clearer its intention having previously focused its ambitions the smart brand 
with both the fortwo and forfour come with electric powertrains and class mpv 
mercedes has also announced that will have phev versions its current model 
range available for consumers however with the launch the suv 
concept mercedes has now signalled the launch all new brand based this 
similar bmw series the first model due launched with 
over kilometers miles range per charge the battery will also produced 
mercedes subsidiary accumotive saxony germany with mercedes investing 
increase production capacity produce all batteries for bevs phevs and 
even plans for stationary battery sales 
daimler has now committed having over ten electric drive vehicles

all its major models today daimler even has acronym for its future mobility strategy

other oems like and hyundai are slowly being turned also 
the nissan has historically led electric vehicles launching the leaf 
rather than seeking follow hybrid technology having been leader hybrid 
technology the and globally toyota has always concentrated the benefits 
this technology provide both fuel efficiency well range something battery 
electric vehicles have lacked toyota has also spent lot money developing its 
technology fuel cells with its mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle which also provides 
better range and faster fuelling than pure evs however with sales the toyota 
prius slowing the and with lack infrastructure support for hydrogen fuel 
cells last week nikkei report suggested toyota might produce suv like electric 
vehicle based the new generation prius platform toyota becomes more 
comfortable its use lithium ion batteries the wsj november toyota 
executive vice president takahiko ijichi was quoted saying although electric vehicles 
have many issues such range and the length recharging time and battery 
performance depending the energy situation each country and region would like 
get ourselves ready commercialise them although timeframe targets have 
been set the addition the largest global auto oem the launch path suggests 
further support for greater penetration

brands each with just one vehicle their line ups fact the such vehicles sold 
the market the tesla model itself accounted for over the

that there consumer demand for evs tesla model has taken over the 
high end sedan market the since its launch clearly well branded 
mile range can extremely well even against engrained competitors such 
mercedes class bmw series and audi even consumers able afford cars 
this category may well different consumers than the average and may earlier 
adopt new technologies this does suggest that there plenty willingness 
consumers embrace technology the right package the orders that tesla

oem business model change 
the move evs game changer for many reasons the existing business model 
oems control much the value the car 
design and production all the major structures 
well design sub structures manufactured suppliers 
they design and produce most the powertrain 
they are responsible for all the major systems integration 
design the final product branding and distribution 
with their level control the oem can add significant value the car terms 
design the interior and exterior terms overall feel and branding the product 
terms driving characteristics and terms the selling process show this 
our model below the problem the extent the change content the car 
exhibit existing auto production supply chain 
source morgan stanley research 
according some industry estimates the value the car could migrate 
electrical systems and electronics rather than mechanical systems much this 
represents pure content growth areas such adas internet connectivity and digital 
displays although automotive asps have grown sharply recent years and much 
the historical content growth has been priced consumers believe this was 
enabled only the large proportion cars being financed and the fall global 
interest rates oems have simply replaced the interest rate saving the monthly 
payment with greater capital repayment portion allowing them higher asps although 
credit costs remain very low they are longer falling 
thus going forward there natural cost saving with which pay for higher asps 
believe this means asp growth will slow may even start reverse asps 
reverse then content growth comes straight out oem margins that stage 
believe oems will start cut non revenue content more aggressively the very 
least increase annual price downs existing components net this represents huge 
transfer the pools global automotive revenues available away from mechanical 
component suppliers towards electrical and electronic ones our view 
exhibit future autonomous production supply chain 
source morgan stanley research 
for the oem show this transfer power below although the oem will continue 
control major structures the car overall design and branding and distribution they 
could lose lot their branding power with the loss powertrain differentiation with 
new auto operating system the centre the new electric autonomous vehicle the 
question becomes where the overall balance branding power will lie 
the supply chain current suppliers for much the powertrain transmission and fuel 
systems may face very significant loss content whilst other legacy suppliers seats 
wheels tyres passive safety will continue supply into the new generation vehicles even the content and price that content may called into question more 
importantly show there whole new level new electrical electronic 
systems suppliers adas systems sensors radar batteries lithium digital led screens 
internet connectivity software into the central operating system that don exist today 
where least content will grow very significantly 
how much the value the current vehicle will fall into their hands future and 
away from the current supply chain how much will the current oem able 
control without control over powertrain and greater supplier content than ever 
before how will the major oems able maintain their competitive position 
branding and pricing power won much easier for new competitors enter the 
market 
transition assumptions consider 
have tried model the impact the transition from ice engines evs our first 
attempt was published here volkswagen exciting future not oct 
this note have split our transition work between the impact and earnings 
cycle for evs versus some sensitivities around the impact different assumptions 
existing ice production profitability 
our model have assumed many different variables regarding growth ramp 
price impacts ice pricing evs initial losses ice operating leverage impacts and 
gross margins are not trying suggest any all our assumptions are correct 
however worth thinking about all the variables that will impacted the new 
strategy and the impact any our assumptions may have overall oem profitability 
and profit margins here are our key assumptions would welcome comment

assumption might generous given where are the cycle today after near 
volume recovery from troughs exclude china which might the largest 
market the world but for our oems excluded from ebit and skew our 
analysis focus consolidated sales and ebit have not assumed any change 
overall global market unit sales due the evolution the vehicle changes the 
average cost per mile 
ice price deflation assume ice price deflation bps 
rising bps post new models start take larger share the 
market and oems need maintain total volumes again believe our price 
assumptions might generous ice price deflation may key variable this model 
similar nokia experience explore 
ice cost restructuring offset the rather obvious negative impact the ice 
business assume management able produce incremental cost reductions 
some from when total ice volumes start fall more quickly 
have not assumed any balance sheet impact from restructuring costs this model even 
with such cost reductions our assumptions ice ebit falls break even 
increasing price deterioration without cost compensation reduces ice business 
loss 
ice operating leverage assume further ice production model operating 
leverage lack better method assume negative operating leverage 
approx per unit our normal assumption for marginal profit per vehicle around 
revenues per vehicle depending the oem our assumed 
leverage ebit margins limited relative our price assumptions the other hand 
managing costs unit sales fall might tough the exact level operational leverage 
risk depends the proportion assets that can used the production the shared ice platform that could assembled one existing assembly line could 
reduce this leverage have assumed cash restructuring costs this model 
model launches this very tough assumption again our work 
assumed that manages launch models against the target 
this more generalised model assume that each oem averages model lines and 
that each launches models starting sales per model 
are much higher than those for ice cars assume far fewer variants per 
nameplate this more generalised model this gets sales between and 
depending the assumptions make and obviously falls production ice 
cars similar magnitude 
cannibalisation have assumed cannibalisation intra group between 
and have assumed after with most global oems starting 
offer evs from see limited room for european oems taking significant 
market share fact any new entrants into the market for evs could impact negatively 
our assumptions with new entrants having ice sales lose way 
comparison nokia covered francois meunier saw similar situation back when after initial growth boost from smartphones experienced falling 
revenues both businesses 
price premium assume asp premium the start versus 
ice cars although this may depend the impact global subsidies any 
assume that this premium starts erode from when 
competition heats and assume falling ice prices anyway then assume that 
demand for new products increases prices hold post ice pricing 
deteriorates show our relative asp model the next section again the nokia 
experience decade ago suggests quite possible for asps both sides the 
business fall simultaneously obviously feature phone legacy prices fell much 
more than smartphone prices according our tech team the time some analysts 
saw legacy products feature phones bull point the thesis was that the feature 
phone portfolio was still strong and that consumer demand emerging markets would 
continue driven india with smartphone adoption remaining low for many 
years however aggressive pricing came more quickly than was expected growing 
smartphone penetration also 
costs assume initial costs and development rising 
one could argue that the net impact this may offset lower spend the 
ice business have assumed offset this generalised model suspect 
that may overly generous the early years oems try sustain their ice business 
have assumed fixed cost inflation for evs come down again the 
model launch schedule starts slow down but this has historically not happened and depends what the oems are controlling developing that time this very 
tough curve consider 
gross margins last have assume initial gross margins and the 
improvement gross margins volumes ramp this incredibly tough again evs 
are not like the iphone which ramped quickly where production outsourced and 
where competition was limited for high end branded product have assumed initial 
gross margins for evs approximately loss per vehicle adding fixed costs 
production starts then assume that gross margins improve from that 
initial assumption until gross margin course long term 
pricing power evs remains outstanding question that needs answered 
think there risk that evs become significantly more competitive than existing ice 
business supplier content even higher and hence barriers entry are likely lower see autos auto parts there goes the post van oct 
electric vehicle transition profit cycle model 
unit sales transition and penetration 
show below illustrative oem with annual vehicle sales global market 
growing china exclude china most china growth the jvs 
excluded from western oem profit and loss accounts associates assume

market growth 
have shown chart the end assuming normalised year downcycle 
and followed full recovery pre downturn high unit sales within years 
this model ice deliveries fall over and then recover their previous peaks 
but never above their levels this model current ice deliveries

continue with our illustrative oem assume starting asp per unit 
driving annual revenues than assume three different asp periods from 
now until assume bps annual fall asp although assume the asp 
growth seen from today finished rates not sequentially fall not 
also assume reversal the very strong trend then from and 
also from assume ice asps fall and believe this 
perfectly healthy assumption even just with credit cost normalisation let alone 
competitive devaluation this scenario ice revenues fall from 
and just over clearly this revenue decline could drive 
severe negative operational leverage the ice business 
fact think could very generous this assumption and model separate 
ebit margin scenarios with more aggressive price assumptions the ebit section below 
for the business assume varying asp premium starting currently 
then assume that this asp premium declines during low premium just 
oems try achieve their sales targets after evs become 
more established and assume ice asps start fall assume that evs hold 
their price under supplied market thus raising the relative price premium once 
more thus our asp starts and falls after that 
assume prices stabilise roughly that level ice asps continue fall

ebit and transition and impact margins 
possibly the most difficult part this model the ebit model there are number 
key inputs 
how much incremental and capex the strategies require and how much 
this spend can offset savings from the existing budgets show our 
assumptions the exhibit below assume our base case that incremental 
offset cuts existing budgets from day one think this very 
generous ice budgets likely cannot cut quickly and given that oems likely 
won cut ice budgets until they have more evidence the likely success their new 
evs flex the assumption one our sensitivity scenarios below 
what are the initial gross margin losses evs and how does the gross margin the 
develop how much subsidy any will available for consumers and how much will 
consumers willing pay for the lower running costs any assume 
negative gross margins evs until when revenues rise and then 
assume gross margin improvement all the way through flex 
this more bullish scenario 
post the questions will what level gross margins evs will able 
achieve what will pricing like relative current ice prices and profitability will 
evs not more competitive than current passenger cars given limited oem control 
this very important debate but given our timeframe when evs will likely 
still ramping believe pricing period solid growth should 
sufficiently strong only once penetration reaches close and growth stagnates 
will really see how the competitive landscape has changed 
what the price impact the existing business volumes fall with the launch 
models evs take share the market then ice assets will see 
drop utilisation the very least this would cause sharp loss operating leverage 
lost ice volumes historically oems have tried optimise utilisation through price 
reductions are witnessing the market again this year this suggests that 
transition evs and new model launches will lead increased price deflation 
ice models 
assume our base case that pricing falls from and 
from and from our scenario analysis 
flex this further worse worse pricing scenario assuming faster price 
deterioration ice cars assume price deterioration show all

german oems also lead fixed assets and capex 
similar analysis capex have done above believe that 
the car content changes oems will forced spend more but depending 
their strategies for new sub systems like batteries their strategy for platforms 
integrated into ice technology stand alone fact could see period ahead 
key launches where capex the existing business could conceivably fall not 
currently forecast such change either way bmw and daimler have the highest fixed 
assets per vehicle followed and with psa and rbno long way behind 
leader relative revenues but the french are again much lower capex sales trends 
show the same trends with the exception that daimler capex sales has been falling 
sharply revenues have grown again has outspent everyone else the past 
decade nearly and its capex budgets have expanded the most the footprint 
has grown seems the germans face greater capex risks from the move evs than 
the french oems course remains seen how well the french oems will 
able compete from their much lower levels spending
