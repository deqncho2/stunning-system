chemicals kwh early new discoveries needed lower our 
chemicals colleagues see battery costs kwh comfortably achievable 
the early increasing nickel and reducing cobalt content cathode 
materials tech step change needed for costs fall further unlikely but potential disruptors are already key focus kwh and 
assuming battery supported chip innovation also battery 
component costs would still higher than petrol but european fuel 
costs evs can support purchase price premium and still reach parity 
total cost ownership this even before factoring any incremental costs for 
ices from future emissions regulations battery evs could rapidly become the 
cheaper option 
chips silicon carbide brings efficiencies power electronics silicon carbide 
sic adoption has been slow and our tech colleagues expect silicon igbt chips 
stay mainstream through however sic materially improves efficiency 
lower power loss higher temperature resilience increasing range 
and reducing charging time costs are high today sic chips are unit 
for igbts but given the efficiency potential the team sees system cost 
parity over time market leader infineon sees slow sic penetration based its 
customers year roadmaps but tesla already uses sic and toyota new prius 
development dual track with igbts but also sic chips made house oems 
chose use sic range charging benefits reduce battery capacity from 
kwh this could save over car 
conclusion tech advances are coming just not from tier auto suppliers 
evs are already close parity with ices looking total cost ownership 
europe and with battery and electronics improvements could move closer 
component cost parity from tier auto supplier perspective though 
interesting see these innovations coming largely from companies outside 
the sector bosch will invest semiconductor manufacturing reuters 
june can other tier shift their product base further towards the new valueadd areas powertrain exposed suppliers face change from today highly 
consolidated high margin markets fragmented markets with the value add 
elements power electronics chips battery cells largely outside their control 
michelin and autoliv think the oems remain challenged but 
prefer suppliers without material powertrain exposure

chemicals kwh achievable new technology could drive 
further improvements time 
kwh current technologies potential 
lower with new technologies 
our chemicals colleagues see clear path reducing battery costs kwh 
current technologies this mostly focussed increasing the mix nickel 
and reducing the mix cobalt the cathode all using nickel manganese cobalt 
nmc but shifting the composition towards nickel raising energy density while 
also cutting cobalt requirements the most expensive raw material the cathode 
getting below kwh likely require technology breakthrough 
potentially from one the many disruptive technologies being investigated 
today such lithium sulfur lithium air and solid state lithium 
even without material improvements below kwh evs could close much 
the current cost gap with ices this before factoring any incremental 
costs future emissions regulations european regulations are not set yet post 
and targets could well managed via the mix but further 
tightening nox and particulates present petrol engines also could mean 
rising costs 
how get kwh 
fit for purpose cathode technologies should support pack cost kwh 
automotive oem cost and technology roadmaps are intrinsically linked cathode 
material producers need improve the energy density the cathode materials order 
support lower price kwh while maintaining stable price for the cathode 
material not yet clear whether the targeted energy density improvements will 
enough maintain stable cost for the cathode given contractual price downs 
agreed for each platform nmc has clear technology roadmap move from 
nmc more nickel rich nmc currently use and nmc the not toodistant future simplistically increasing the nickel content not only raises the energy 
density but also thrifts cobalt currently the most expensive ternary raw material 
and reduces the total metal required this roadmap well understood and will 
support reduction the battery dollar cost kwh somewhere close 
which believe fit for purpose supported emission regulation and government 
incentivisation 
cell scale effects are already diminishing technology improvements and reduction 
materials costs likely support industry cost roadmap cell costs have declined 
fast pace over the past five years driven increasing scale 
production cathode evolution and chemical proficiency and advancements 
other materials however believe the scale effects are already diminishing given that 
plants have reached critical production level and the fact that fixed costs contributed 
relatively small proportion total production costs most the cell costs are 
therefore largely determined material prices and composition 
increasing the energy density the battery the key lever for players within the 
supply chain navigate cost pressures and support the industry cost roadmap the 
cathode key component where energy density improvements can and are being 
made are the anode electrolyte and separator although the later two less 
degree for example tesla model battery cell has incorporated new type 
graphite anode blended with silicon which can improve the energy density the total

reductions material costs will limited mainly the cathode the cathode 
comprises the bulk the overall savings opportunity making the battery 
component cost the cell itself consists several components including the anode and 
cathode materials the battery separator and electrolyte most the metal costs can 
associated with the cathode and composition varies technology improvements the 
cathode energy density will reduce the amount metal required per kwh basis 
which important not only lowering the absolute metal requirement per kwh but 
also reducing the metal price risk the average market price each metal depends 
the supply and demand dynamics which for small markets can expose the automotive 
oems unwanted metal price exposure which some cases cannot hedged 
cobalt 
should the rate technology improvement slow price pressures across the supply 
chain will become more visible the technology roadmap largely place offset the 
cost roadmap should see any point slowdown the rate technology 
improvements increase energy density deflationary pressures will affect the supply 
chain gradual technology improvements and remaining scale effects should support 
steady migration kwh which point raw materials and precursors will make 
large portion the overall cost turn this may lead some volatility the cost 
per kwh metal prices move higher and lower depending the underlying supply 
and demand for each metal 
kwh evs could already cheaper than petrol diesel 
total cost ownership 
purchase prices are much higher today exhibit shows model attempting 
calculate the impact monthly running costs much higher current transaction 
prices assume that evs have much lower residual costs than internal combustionengine cars least early suggesting that lease costs will much higher given that 
greater depreciation will have covered during the life the lease thus monthly 
lease costs for plug hybrid vehicles phevs and battery electric vehicles bevs could 
much higher than monthly lease costs for petrol engine alternatives 
however then continue compare total running and ownership costs evs can 
start quickly reduce that price disadvantage 
lower running costs make much the difference looking total cost 
ownership assume phevs and bevs have lower fuel costs lower insurance 
costs and lower service costs than current vehicles calculate that based 
european fuel prices fuel and running costs for bevs could much lower 
than for current petrol diesel engine cars adding all calculate that 
although hybrids and extended range evs continue more expensive all 
our calculation bev costs comes just per month versus for our petrol 
and diesel cars not huge cost difference this assumes that battery sells

evs are major challenge for oem profitability cost reduction will remain very 
important the industry transitions towards battery evs see two issues for oem 
profitability first the obvious cost pressures evs from building volumes from low 
base and just component costs second think that lower ice volumes from 
cannibalisation and lower prices demand shifts the new technologies could 
mean sharply falling profitability the legacy business too see autos shared

kwh could bring battery evs close cost parity with petrol assuming 
battery kwh the total battery pack for would cost our analysis 
leaving total component costs still well above traditional internal combustion 
engine cars although above already more favourable total cost ownership 
basis europe our tech team sees potential for silicon carbide sic chips increase 
range oems choose use this solution most likely post they 
think reduce battery capacity and cost this could take costs out the 
car narrowing the petrol battery cost gap just that 
kwh our tech colleagues expect total system costs for sic the same 
today systems despite higher chip costs not flex our assumptions for the 
hybrid powertrain here that electric motor inverter converter charger wiring 
for more detail please see their report sic chips increase mileage 
sizing the opportunity june 
battery costs can reduced below kwh battery evs could even come close 
petrol cars component costs think this unlikely achieved petrol until 
costs fall kwh but this much closer happening for diesel cars europe 
even just looking the costs including development cost adhering the real 
driving emissions and new worldwide harmonised light duty test cycles wltc 
that euro standards see autos shared mobility future car earnings 
risks november for more detail european diesel regulations post our 
analysis suggests that battery evs could rapidly become the cheaper solution battery 
costs continue fall and the cost ice emissions compliance continues rise 
ice emissions compliance costs likely keep rising affecting hybrids also yet 
not clear how european emissions regulations will develop post cafe 
standards are planned out absent any changes from the current 
administration but china and india visibility also limited post clearly likely 
that emissions regulations will continue tighten for increasing penetration 
sales helpful these regulations are based fleet average adding evs which 
count zero helps oems overall numbers for nox and particulates however the element emissions that harmful health standards are absolute and each 
car must meet them governments focus more clean air expect nox and 
particulate regulations get progressively tougher adding costs both petrol and ice 
affecting hybrids also without detail where these regulations could can 
estimate how much this could and course neither can the oems but much 
the cost around developing new engines rather than just adding more content 
existing engines ice and particularly diesel volumes start fall think this 
makes for tough investment proposition for oems which can avoided altogether 
shifting development focus towards evs 
exhibit battery evs could close cost parity with petrol diesel cars even before 
any incremental costs emissions regulations continue tighten

fit for the future cathode technology will drive differentiation and capture value fit 
for the future materials will required reduce the battery cost kwh and 
where see the greatest opportunity for cathode material producers capture value 
unlike fit for purpose materials fit for the future cathode materials will provide 
greater industry differentiation and likely see higher barriers entry with more 
restrictive landscape suspect automotive oems will willing share the 
improved cost economics well less metal price volatility with cathode producers 
believe that the market for fit for the future materials could resemble something 
more similar that the autocatalyst market unlike the more commodity fit for

possible technology disruptors 
lithium sulphur lithium sulfur often cited the long term solution given its 
very high specific energy about three times that conventional 
lithium ion battery the other advantages are the relatively low cost raw 
materials specific power density and good cold temperature 
discharge characteristics well low temperature charging 
limitations include material degradation low cycle life and self discharge 
high voltage lithium ion much research going into next generation ion 
increase the operational voltage and therefore energy density while not 
compromising the stability the cathode material this includes alternate 
material structures olivine spinel and material doping increase stability 
higher voltages limitations include reduced cyclability and material degradation 
high voltages 
lithium air lithium air believed offer the energy density 
conventional ion battery the theoretical specific energy lithium air 
would par with gasoline fuelled vehicle widely 
acknowledged least years from commercialisation and only some 
the material challenges can overcome limitations include material degradation 
due air purity short cycle life and poor thermal operating range 
solid state lithium this often perceived the natural progression current liion batteries with the ability store twice the energy although there are some 
concerns over the loading capabilities solid state batteries continue use current 
cathode materials but replace the anode with solid state lithium and use 
alternate electrolyte limitations include material degradation the anode short 
cycle life poor thermal operating range 
fuel cells the increased focus evs has raised interest fuel cells again fuelcell vehicles typically run off hydrogen and while range and power are less 
limitation the infrastructure build out remains the greatest hurdle material 
limitations include fuelling infrastructure and energy efficiency liquifying

tech silicon carbide offers material efficiency improvements 
sic could improve range the same system cost 
our tech colleagues have built bottom proprietary chip model driven 
chips car and their long standing statistical pricing model silicon carbide sic adoption 
has been slow and the team expects today silicon igbt chips remain mainstream for 
the next years however sic materially improves efficiency lower power loss higher 
temperature resilience increasing range and reducing charging time 
sic chips are unit for igbts but given the efficiency potential the team 
believes that adoption could increase bringing system cost parity over time market 
leader infineon sees slow sic penetration based its customers roadmap for the next 
years but tesla already uses sic and toyota new prius development dual track 
with igbts but also sic chips made house 
trade off between increased range and reduced cost 
range miles today going today the newest evs are 
achieving fully electric ranges around miles using the epa standard 
which tougher than the european nedc certified ranges the chevy bolt epa 
certified miles range the tesla model expected have least miles the 
next generation nissan leaf due expected step range miles from 
the range miles the larger battery option both estimates are from 
cleantechnica information remains closely guarded new launches particularly 
what ranges can achieved under the epa certification regime but targets for the 
porsche mission audi tron quattro and the mercedes suv are all around 
miles almost 
range has been the priority but think miles will sufficient 
thus far new launches have mostly seen improved energy density deployed 
increased battery capacities higher kwh order achieve longer ranges range per 
kwh has not really improved but the physical size and cost per kwh has come down 
hard gauge exactly where the tipping point would consumer acceptance but 
think that miles major step from current levels over time certainly 
see potential for some much longer range evs the market but also believe that oems 
will seek offer range battery capacities not least support pricing for variants 
with larger batteries tesla already prices its models this way think that oems 
could use the efficiency improvements that sic brings increase range some cases 
and reduce cost others charging times are also key making smaller batteries 
workable for consumers but for the launches charging times are already 
expected fall sharply and sic further development that could reduce charging
