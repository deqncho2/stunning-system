from the chair 
dear fellow shareholder 
pleased report that the financial year 
has been another watershed year orocobre vision 
become leading and sustainable global supplier 
high grade high value lithium chemicals 
the end saw orocobre 
strong financial strategic and 
operational position sales jujuy 
sdj the operator the olaroz 
lithium facility olaroz increased 
total sales revenue 
million basis 
from production tonnes 
lithium carbonate 
for the full financial year orocobre 
recorded statutory net profit after 
tax from continuing operations 
million 
million which was impacted 
non cash foreign currency losses 
asset impairment write downs and 
additional deferred tax expense 
resulting from changes tax law 
argentina 
the end 
saw 
orocobre 
strong financial 
strategic and 
operational 
position 
our balance sheet strong with 
available cash million 
and net cash million 
after deducting orocobre share 
project debt our operations 
continue generate strong operating 
cashflow ensuring are funded 
achieve all our growth plans market 
fundamentals for lithium chemicals 
also remain strong 
january welcomed toyota 
tsusho corporation ttc our 
register shareholder when 
conducted strategic placement 
and rights issue which raised 
million updated from 
million due effect this capital 
raising placed orocobre sound 
financial footing and ensures that 
subject board and joint venture 
partner approvals the stage olaroz 
expansion and naraha lithium 
hydroxide plant are both fully funded 
orocobre continues expand its 
operational capabilities olaroz 
leveraging lessons learned through 
its first two years commercial 
production following the adverse 
weather conditions during which 
resulted production shortfalls 
are developing methods better 
manage and mitigate climate impacts 
our operations these will 
incorporated into stage design 
optimise future production 
olaroz finished the year high 
with production for the june quarter 
the second highest record 
tonnes lithium carbonate 
have exciting few years ahead 
deliver our growth 
projects with ttc who have proven 
excellent joint venture partner 
and who share our vision for olaroz 
and approach sustainability early 
works have already commenced 
the tonnes per annum tpa 
stage expansion olaroz with new 
ponds roads and camp infrastructure 
addition plans are well advanced 
for the tpa naraha lithium 
hydroxide plant built japan 
these two projects will not only 
significantly increase the scale our 
business but also diversify our product 
range ensure are well placed 
benefit from future lithium battery 
market growth 
the strategy pass the parallel 
development the cauchari joint 
venture project advantage lithium 
has been well rewarded updated 
resource estimate for the project 
was released during the june quarter 
detailing fold increase the 
inferred resource lithium 
carbonate equivalent the updated 
resource covers significantly larger 
brine resource area and 
extends greater depths with 
potential for additional resource 
expansion the brine has excellent 
chemistry for processing with 
ratio which very similar 
the olaroz operation preliminary 
economic assessment has been 
released and feasibility study 
expected completed early 
orocobre maintains effective 
interest the project through 
the joint venture and its shareholding 
advantage lithium 
while borax argentina borax 
improved its performance 
low product prices throughout the 
year and the poor brazilian economic 
environment continued affect the 
financial results recognition 
this have taken the decision 
write down the value plant and 
equipment borax nil enable 
continuous improvement despite 
these external pressures borax 
maintains its focus customer and 
product development and improved 
operational performance 
the safety and well being our staff 
remains our number one priority 
june the borax sijes

severe winter weather conditions 
the end the previous financial 
year production was affected low 
evaporation rates caused 
reduced solar radiation from cloudy

salt harvesting 
during the first cycle 
salt harvesting commenced from 
the harvestable ponds the final 
eight ponds the pond system 
this process occurs approximately 
every three years and involves 
the removal the majority salt 
mainly halite and sylvite which has 
precipitated through the evaporative 
process 
this process involves the sequential 
draining the ponds prior 
removal the majority the 
contained salts the salt drainage and 
harvesting process forecast take 
approximately eight months the 
end three the final eight 
harvest ponds had been cleared 
harvestable salts construction 
salt stock pile area has commenced 
the west the existing harvest ponds 
where the mined salts will stored 
although evaporative area lost 
during this process the recovery 
stored brine from the salts through 
the drainage process and the addition 
three new harvest ponds fully 
compensated for the impact 
reduced evaporation area 
expansion plans 
the stage expansion olaroz 
became fully funded with 
combination cash and proposed 
debt arrangements 
the final investment decision 
remains subject orocobre and

orocobre announced 
the increase stage expansion 
tpa total tpa from 
the previously announced tpa 
engineering studies for the enlarged 
stage were completed during the 
same quarter 
the increased stage uses 
simplified design including primary 
lithium carbonate circuit but excluding 
purification circuit the planned 
product mix for the olaroz lithium 
facility will tpa purified 
lithium carbonate from the 
existing purification circuit and 
tpa prime grade lithium carbonate 
avg which tpa will 
used feedstock for the planned 
lithium hydroxide plant naraha 
japan 
this expansion plan will result 
capital expenditure approximately 
million including 
million contingency and retains the 
lower risk implementation the 
project based around simple 
duplication bores ponds and 
primary circuit stage olaroz 
the capital cost intensity the 
tpa expansion increased 
from the previous tpa 
principally due the increased 
accuracy with the engineering study 
compared the previous scoping 
level additional redundancy the 
design increases indirect costs 
and inflationary pressures however 
this capital remains extremely 
competitive when compared 
with greenfield developments 
multinational engineering firm ghd 
continues undertake engineering 
design and procurement activities 
for the olaroz stage expansion 
all necessary permits have been 
granted for process water brine
