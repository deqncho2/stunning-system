last week hosted our inaugural chemtech event london focussing 
innovation technology sustainability and digitalisation better understand 
how this driving businesses forward the companies attendance included 
air liquide axalta croda dowdupont eastman lenzing linde 
lyondellbasell and wacker chemie 
digitalisation accelerating time market and increasing efficiency many 
companies noted how digitalisation and data analytics were speeding the rate 
innovation and the time deliver solutions customers through advanced 
modeling companies are able accelerate steps the validation process 
new products and solutions these same modeling steps reduce inefficient 
allowing for quicker termination fruitless projects data analytics are also 
being used improve plant efficiency preemptive turnarounds and optimise 
the supply chain turn reducing working capital and cost from disruption 
energy hydrogen and automotive electric vehicles are two the major 
change stories comes little surprise that perhaps the biggest change 
adapting the emergence the whether its the silicones value chain 
polymers coatings virtually all the met with see enhanced content 
and value per vehicle from the migration evs coatings axalta countered 
investor concerns that avs and evs are net negative sighting opportunities 
electrical motors both inside the vehicle but also relation the 
infrastructure wacker insights into silicones content was perhaps the most 
interesting read through for elkem though new dow cross polymerization 
strategy was the most differentiated the energy mix was also focus the 
scope for hydrogen gain traction cleaner energy source both industrial 
and automotive applications and reduce production was talked about 
both air liquide and linde 
sustainability recurring theme this theme was most visible croda 
presentation around delivering technical and sustainable solutions customers 
turn giving pricing power and organic growth opportunities was the same 
when listening air liquide comments its biomethane technology indeed 
linde dry reforming process for synthesis gas likewise lyondellbasell belief 
that can improve multiple facets the plastics recycling process eastman 
new biobased fiber solutions that take advantage sustainably managed 
forests all see the value proposition from delivering sustainable solutions 
detail this report 
winners and losers too early tell but see value croda ingrained 
sustainability wacker and new dow potential opportunities silicones and air 
liquide desire promote hydrogen alternative energy source right now 
see evolution value chains rather than revolution and are 
focusing the efficiency and production processes much 
developing new solutions markets

who did meet met with philippe merino vice president 
summary key bullet points 
hydrogen potentially large market for air liquide the sees scope for 
used more aggressively the global energy mix well other markets like 
automotive fuel cells and industrial replacing coke steel mills 
biomethane could big business green route producing methane from 
biomass and industrial waste more than invested gwh capacity 
with sites globally today 
double digit growth platform there are three focus areas terms new 
markets within deep tech which includes innovation space aerospace and 
cryogenics energy transition both the form biomethane production and clean 
mobility and cryogenic maritime logistics covering cryogenic transportation and 
uses maritime 
detailed feedback from our meeting 
neos programme driving customer centric transformation the aim profitable 
growth long term key pillar this corporate programme open innovation the 
ability and agility the group innovation and opening new markets over the past 
years has been key growth within its innovation function has employees 
supporting with spend running 
the way the innovates has changed over the past years you cannot innovate 
everything focused small essential molecules core technology development 
the focus whereas global network supporting innovation covers areas like 
customer centricity altec the digital transformation impacting customers assets and 
ecosystems and open innovation for example lab aliad 
the main focus air liquide presentation was the global markets technologies 
division high double digit growth area within air liquide albeit 
small portion ebitda today sales and ebitda there are three focus 
areas terms new markets within deep tech which includes innovation 
space aerospace and cryogenics energy transition both the form biomethane 
production and clean mobility and cryogenic maritime logistics covering cryogenic 
transportation and uses maritime 
air liquide has been involved number high tech projects technology for 
cryogenics developed for space applications now used for the liquefaction 
certain gas molecules another project example would work the iter 
international thermonuclear experimental reactor project where the uses liquid 
helium for cooling materials helium liquefaction and transportation technologies 
developed during this project can now used broader markets 
biomethane production addressing the challenge emissions biomethane 
alternative fossil fuel derived methane the process involves capturing methane gas 
out organic waste material such household waste industrial waste sewage sludge 
and agricultural waste which then processed and purified get pure biomethane 
biomethane generated electricity can then either injected into the grid used for 
different purposes the process addresses the issue both and particle emissions 
air liquide started new plants the france and the company has 
doubled its biomethane capacity gwhr per annum globally this compares 
gwhr total capacity france for the whole market has invested 
and now has sites globally for the production biomethane 
exhibit energy transition 
source company presentation 
creating the hydrogen council with toyota back early these two launched 
the hydrogen council the world economic forum davos today the council 
comprises some different members air liquide points the fact that all 
energy demand will supported hydrogen the two degree scenario 
based report the council conducted cooperation with mckinsey steel makers are 
replacing coke with hydrogen important milestones for passenger cars 
sold early adoption markets like germany california japan and south korea will 
fcevs mtpa will used for high grade heat for industrial applications and 
households will connected network blending and natural gas 
hydrogen can used both for mobility well energy storage mobility today 
trains are one the most interesting applications however this will take time the 
market still needs the investment infrastructure support this growth where 
hydrogen will useful energy the storage energy from renewable sources the 
industry focus hydrogen was only mobility until the end but now 
beginning both mobility and energy storage today the market lacks scale both 
mobility and energy storage 
the footprint hydrogen fuel cells notably lower cradle grave 
analysis the production bev toyota wants producing vehicles 
with fuel cells next year and car manufacturers are shifting their 
attention hydrogen another alternative 
cryogenic maritime logistics helium argon carbon dioxide argon needs 
transported liquid form for applications offshore oil gas platforms and wind 
turbines welding inserting support drilling diving argon product oxygen 
meaning production based where you produce your oxygen helium has 
invested storage cavern allowing inventory one year sales this allows 
supply customers secured 
biomethane entered market through technology and selling own equipment the 
process works for example germany air liquide was not used injecting into the 
grid went into cogen also making the natural gas mix greener the company 
has long term contracts sourcing biomethane and then long term contracts supply 
the grid demand from volvo and scania for heavy trucks lng modifications mean 
these vehicles can run new fuels the the supply biomass coming from 
land fills the company sees two geographies key china and malaysia sells 
equipment china malaysia the main source feedstock palm and today 
does not have presence this market for smr steam methane reforming for 
hydrogen more and more the gas will come from biomethane

who did meet met with barry snyder chief technology officer 
summary key bullet points 
axalta process has seen significant shift since the company was carved out 
dupont five years ago management highlighted that under dupont was silo 
versus the underlying needs the business customers more build they 
will come strategy axalta has shifted its priorities being very customer focused 
achieving greater customer intimacy solving customer problems and gaining scale and 
efficiency from the innovation that created 
evs are seen positive development for the company sees significant 
incremental opportunities electrical insulation materials but also within the 
infrastructure that needed charging stations power points 
autonomous vehicles avs are likely much further out than the equity market 
realizes multiple decades and provide net positive opportunity for the company 
axalta notes that new paint system technology needed that certain colors can 
seen the lidar system cars sold today are white which absorb the infrared 
lidar system another are painted black and cannot seen lidar all the 
other colors fall somewhere between present prohibitively expensive 
develop black paint that can seen lidar and the dark shades that can 
developed affordably would not attractive consumers

axalta process has seen significant shift since the company was carved out 
dupont five years ago management highlighted that under dupont was silo 
versus the underlying needs the business customers more build they 
will come strategy axalta has shifted its priorities being very customer focused 
achieving greater customer intimacy solving customer problems and gaining scale and 
efficiency from the innovation that created the question constantly being asked 
what need for the future the business and answered through the 
creation product technology road maps the company already outspends its peers 
and should not expect ratios sales present but rather 
should expect the continuation fit for purpose approach tailored business 
business more specifically over last years flat dollar basis despite axalta 
integrating series acquisitions that brought new technology yet the company has 
doubled the number new products that has released this increased efficiency has 
also shown the delivery higher quality lower cost production processes and 
reduced raw material costs 
refinish axalta believes that has the best technology and algorithms ensure 
the perfect color match through spectrometers optics and color technologies the 
company focused color delivery and increasing its productivity the company 
maintains its technological edge investing new tools systems and chemistry 
continue outpace the competition axalta continues focus the mso multi shop 
operator market where the customer gets paid the job and therefore throughput 
premium job specced for hours and they get done they keep the 
hour extra profit msos monitor every painter and every part utilization axalta 
brings the mso products and tech that improve throughput and this value add means 
that the conversation about raw material costs less relevant paint cost isn how 
msos derive their profit 
oem focus more materials productivity enhancement and environmental 
improvement plastic increasingly penetrates the vehicle coatings become more 
complex you paint plastic doesn look appear the same other materials you 
are not careful but consumers expect mixed material car look the same across all 
the different materials 
evs overall represent significant opportunity for axalta energy solutions the 
company selling electrical insulation materials for motors electrical substations etc 
motor shorts there very little that can done about highlighting the need for 
high quality insulation materials like wire enamel for coil and impregnating resins that 
cure completely the object which they are applied and provide electrical 
insulation high mechanical stability protection from climate influences and improved 
heat dissipation for copper windings and coils tesla has over individual motors 
throughout the car while this unique example present all automobiles electric 
internal combustion engines are moving this directions addition axalta also 
increasing its revenue supplying the infrastructure environment such charging 
station and power points the company the number two player energy solutions 
and believes gaining share the number one player german company called 
alantis 
despite the opportunity they represent autonomous vehicles are further out than 
investors think multiple decades given enormous technological and societal barriers 
entry axalta notes that new paint system technology needed that certain colors 
can seen the lidar system cars sold today are white which absorb the 
infrared lidar system another are painted black and cannot seen lidar all 
the other colors fall somewhere between present prohibitively expensive 
develop black paint that can seen lidar and the dark shades that can 
developed affordably would not attractive consumers 
the company sees the biggest opportunities going forward organic innovation 
each business developing next generation products platforms driving growth 
industrial coatings entering new verticals less looking invent their way into 
new markets but more looking buy capabilities that can translated around the 
world 
axalta has always focused the premium market which also the largest both 
europe and the inverted pyramids however emerging markets are the 
opposite instead addressing those two markets separately axalta has developed 
waterborne coating syrox that has been huge success europe and will soon 
launched china which traditionally solvent based market local chinese 
companies not have this technology and axalta believes that its environmental 
advantage will lead great success

businesses croda subsequently bought having already established development 
relationship with them 
biotechnology core focus for croda innovation efforts the irb acquisition was 
good example the green biotechnology space ticks all the requirements around 
sourcing ethics sustainability and safety and quality this makes croda attractive 
supplier customers like oreal irb only had sales italy when was acquired and 
now its ingredients are going into mncs all around the world white biotechnology 
croda fermentation investment facilitates manufacturing microbial multi tonne 
quantities giving immediate capability scale nautilus and enza biotech novel 
sugar based chemistry originating from astra zeneca for drug delivery systems blue 
biotechnology also focus the diversity marine life that exists below the surface 
has value for croda there are lots different habitats exploit terms biological 
diversity wood sediment algae mangroves corals etc the acquisition nautilus 
gives croda filing cabinet potential products that can commercialised its 
relationship with nautilus began with open innovation partnership and then 
acquired the business january focused marine microbial biodiversity 
agriculture another area increased investment for example biostimulants which 
are niche new areas growing strongly agriculture driving yield enhancement 
for farmers the acquisition plant impact can now scaled 
smart materials and the internet things embedded micro electronic components are 
connecting increasing number products the internet for example devices cars 
sports equipment the rapid discharge static electricity can damage micro electronics 
which will increasingly require protection from electro static discharge this led 
croda acquisition ionphase earlier this year the makes additives that going into 
the polymers used make electronic devices helping safe discharge static electricity 
styrenics pmma sales were with employees and 
customers key markets are automotive and electronics

through its vertical integration capability that the competitive set does not have 
new dow focused selling value the past the company noted that has 
times failed the customer value proposition test got too focused new exciting 
product features and overlooked both what the customer actually wanted and what 
the customer would actually pay for further there now more focus chemistries 
that can leveraged across the businesses into multiple markets rather than siloed 
individual business 
detailed feedback from our meeting 
new dow excited about the opportunity merge silicones with organic polymers 
through its vertical integration capability that the competitive set does not have 
new dow focused packaging polyethylene personal care silicones and industrial 
intermediates markets new dow sees collision technology taking place here 
driven customer demand new dow believes the only one with the integration 
makes this work and notes that years ago tried put polyurethanes and silicones 
together and couldn make work when began integrate dowcorning the 
people knew exactly how the company failed and what needed differently new 
dow believe that two times the size its nearest competitor silicones this 
greater scale allows platform analytical technology and market presence that 
would difficult for others replicate all this should lead greater customer 
intimacy both and production 
cross pollinating organics and silicones unique opportunity for new dow cross 
pollinating organics and silicones unique opportunity both terms increased 
product properties more unique specification for customers with the ability reduce 
the cost optimized surface interactions this will provide positive mix effects across 
the group will more protected and can pursued both molecularly and from 
application stand point 
the program viewed through the following three lenses roic past 
projects what was the ebitda generated how accretive was does the new 
product have higher margins than incumbent comparable products and milestones 
manage the present clear stage gates for decision with the goal killing 
non viable projects early 
the company intends risk adjust the portfolio such that has single digit 
exposure high risk areas significant exposure blue chip areas spaces the company 
knows well and just looking move the next technology level and the balance 
focused extending the franchise advantage you cannot just stop spending 
and keep sales flat competitors won stop investing and regulation could 
evolve against your existing products the company will constantly evaluating the 
portfolio make sure has the ratios portfolio risk correct the majority the 
budget built for growth but significant component maintenance 
oriented 
new dow focused selling value the past the company noted that has 
times failed the customer value proposition test got too focused new exciting 
product features and overlooked both what the customer actually wanted and what 
the customer would actually pay for further there now more focus chemistries 
that can leveraged across the businesses into multiple markets rather than siloed 
individual business the company launching products this year that combine 
chemistry platforms not all which are polymers 
new dow team delineated such that the organization focused 
innovation while small dedicated team deals with and reporting issues the 
reorganization post the merger was executed within six weeks not lot came 
over from dupont polymer business was more refocusing dow 
platform than integration likewise with the dow corning integration while there 
were cost synergies around taking out higher cost leadership dow had zero silicones 
and corning had the areas dow was working 
new dow particularly focused household and personal care hpc particularly 
where can introduce hybrid materials more durable skin foundations the 
company sees very attractive population demographics globally but particularly asia 
and south american markets 
for evs new dow sees the opportunity take polyurethanes paintable and combine 
them with silicones not paintable create paintable sealant around the sensors 
that provide feedback the car 
another example composite product for decking ground wood with 
polyethylene and silicone that will provide higher throughput the customer 
smoother product and greater scratch resistance putting polyethylene and silicone 
together provides higher green strength greater durability into the next step the 
production process 
capabilities that not all segments can afford will put the middle the 
company very expensive equipment and then utility for the segments hub 
and spoke model that designed avoid reinventing the wheel the hub meant 
keep the spokes focused further the company will not simply put the shelf 
there the opportunity license other parties 
from perspective nothing anticipated beyond potential bolt ons the 
company views itself both very patient and very happy with its existing tool kit 
notes that already got cellulosics acrylics and silicones from past

eastman has seven world class tech platforms functional films thermoplastic 
processing nonwovens textiles coatings formulations rubber additives adhesives 
formulations and animal nutrition from volume and scale perspective they are 
generally the same size competitors but the horizontal opportunity gives eastman 
greater potential develop products into niche applications which leads greater 
customer intimacy 
key tenets eastman strategy macro trend driving customer demand for 
example more people energy food and clean water things that will require the entire

film the windshield keeps vehicle occupants from going through the glass during 
collision and prevents foreign objects from entering the cabin further with all the 
new adas functions the goal take all tech info and put the windshield that 
drivers not take their eyes off the road heads displays hud originally 
this manifested itself little box screen that got blurry ghosting eastman had 
invented the sheet which has the projector screen partnered with nsg group and 
nippon seiki improve the product such that ghosting was eliminated and the viewing 
space was increased the next generation goal able project the image down the 
street this very lucrative product can component 
within vehicle upgrade package and growing faster than the overall market 
evs eastman focused energy storage and managing thermal properties inside 
the cabin the vehicle reduce weight energy and noise films that manage infrared 
and block films that reduce glass content and therefore weight but improve 
acoustic properties the company notes that evs have different set noise 
properties the road itself which changes acoustics inside car rather than the 
engine which controlled pvb film within the car 
eastman believes that its efforts pay back two ways firstly clearly revenue 
generation million revenue going million secondly strategic 
relevance eastman perceived customers different company today than the 
past now viewed leading innovator that evolves with its dynamic customer 
base solve complex problems together

the linde pilot reformer reduces energy consumption and consumes dry 
reforming produces synthesis gas which mixture hydrogen and carbon monoxide 
from carbon dioxide and methane traditionally synthesis gas was created via steam 
reforming methane and water and consumed lot energy its dry counterpart 
offers more sustainable alternative requires not only less steam produced 
about one tenth the ratio required for steam reforming but the reaction also 
consumes lot carbon dioxide industrial steam gas plant could reduce 
emissions million car kilometers 
automation and digital intelligence better manage working capital and improve 
customer offering linde working closely with its customers optimize supply chain 
and delivery example data collected from bars enabled the company predict 
purchases gas and subsequently save the transport cylinders the 
company had previously developed the same type network for hospitals with inetiq 
previously named cobalt tracking cylinder levels oxygen and relieving staff from 
stress associated with refilling automation another field investigated the company 
improve working capital management while having positive impact health safety 
and flexibility five cylinder filling stations are currently automated out 
globally reducing the labor force and thus reducing health and safety 
incidents 
linde has been driving hydrogen mobility for more than years linde operates over 
hydrogen production plants globally and worldwide hydrogen refuelling 
stations are built linde the company signed partnership with alstom last year 
supply new fuel cell trains with hydrogen

who did meet met with fridolin stary senior vice president research 
development 
summary key bullet points 
future silicones growth well underpinned future silicones growth well 
underpinned substitution organics structural growth markets evs solar 
implants health positive mix developments 
wacker leading cost position wacker has leading cost position consequence 
world scale production and silane silicone silica loop production process which 
competitors cannot replicate that minimises waste 
silicon content higher than ice the silicone content 
versus average tradition ice vehicle 
detailed feedback from our meeting 
silicones will continue grow between attractive margins many case 
organic materials polyolefin based are reaching the limit their performance with 
silicone based solutions able offer better alternative this substitution from organic 
materials where pricing and the fact that standard silicone not expected 
ever less than the driver for above market growth terms 
performance silicones cannot surpassed polymers with higher resistance both 
heat and electricity well their ability make surface hydrophobic they are also 
intrinsically inert making them good material for medical implants moreover silicone 
has lot potential further grow emerging markets silicone spending per capita 
developed economies estimated around while still emerging 
countries 
since wacker has raised capacity silicones through brownfield expansions 
while reducing opex wacker has been able achieve capacity cagr between 
siloxane and capacity cagr silica through brownfield debottlenecking 
which has seen associated decline specific opex and respectively 
wacker past investments upstream siloxane manufacturing has provided the 
company with leading large world scale plants and fully integrated supply chain with 
very attractive cost position 
exhibit effective brownfield investment has reduced opex 
source wacker chemie 
wacker has unique silane silicone silica loop production process that differentiates 
from its competitors competitors that produce either polysilicon silicones using 
standard production process will always generate some waste products however 
wacker circular process consequence producing both polysilicon and silicones 
reduces the company waste and therefore cost base and results the production 
some high quality products both german and lesser extend chinese sites are 
utilising this process while the based tennessee plants should able benefit 
from this technology well once its fumed silica production fully ramped 
exhibit wacker benefits from unique verbund production loop 
source wacker chemie 
the shift evs net positive for silicone demand currently between silicone 
material utilised ice vehicles with being used improve thermal 
management according wacker this could rise silicone material evs 
not only there positive volume development for silicones near term but also 
positive mix shift with more specialty silicone products being consumed for 
example silicone thermal interface materials tims are used throught the battery pack 
given their adhesive and insulating properties for both thermal and electrical and 
demand notably higher price given leading performance characteristics 
exhibit silicones well suited for cell thermal management 
source wacker chemie 
increasing the silicon content the anode presents future opportunity 
silicon carbon composite anode materials also represent meaningful future 
opportunity for wacker however given the approval time frames the auto industry 
this technology not likely used significant volume for the next years the 
industry tends take conservative approach new technologies adding silicon 
the anode increases its overall capacity which required for more energy dense cells 
today tesla uses anodes that contain silicon silicon composite anode materials 
represents one wacker most active areas for investment both terms 
materials and processes with patents filled recently this space 
silicones unique properties diverse range end markets these range from 
coatings films silicone needs produced much faster pace pushing technology 
for fast curing mechanism automotive cosmetics health electric transmission 
underground cables increasingly the properties silicones are required solve for 
customer needs creating new opportunities this will continue support the growth 
the higher margin silicone specialty products however this high level specialisation 
and diverse end markets makes managing the supply chain challenging
