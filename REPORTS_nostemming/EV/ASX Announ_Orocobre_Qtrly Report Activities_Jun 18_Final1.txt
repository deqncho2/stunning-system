production sales and operational update 
production and sales 
production for the june quarter was tonnes from tonnes the march quarter sales were tonnes 
lithium carbonate with record realised average price per tonne fob basis and record total sales revenue 
million operating costs cost goods sold basis were tonne down qoq due increased 
production and sales volumes and the impact the peso devaluation resulting lower local costs for the quarter 
gross cash margins for the quarter were record per tonne qoq with higher prices and lower costs 
this demonstrates the robust cash generation ability and profitability the olaroz operations 
the sales figures presented this report differ those reported asx release july owing the previously noted delay 
shipping with unforeseen port congestion this simply represents timing issue when revenue reported

operational update 
production the june quarter was significantly higher than the march quarter with both the lithium carbonate plant and the 
pond system operating well this result demonstrates improved pond management and harvesting practices despite lower than 
average evaporation rates through the half 
during the june quarter the first cycle salt harvesting continued from the harvestable ponds the final eight ponds the 
system the harvesting process occurs approximately every three years and involves the removal the majority salt mainly 
halite and sylvite which has precipitated through the evaporation process 
construction the salt stockpile area immediately adjacent the existing harvest ponds has been completed three eight 
harvest ponds have now been cleared harvestable salts 
carbon dioxide recovery 
carbon dioxide used the olaroz lithium facility the production battery grade lithium carbonate currently sourced 
from near buenos aires cordoba and mendoza transported kilometres truck making significant component 
total reagent costs 
recent engineering studies have shown total used the production process can recovered the 
company currently installing recovery systems various parts the purification circuit help significantly lower the 
total reagent costs 
installation and operation the permanent recovery equipment expected the second half calendar year with 
capital expenditure this project expected less than 
future production and guidance 
during the current quarter there will temporary closure the plant for maintenance approximately one two weeks 
during which time work will undertaken some minor modifications the bepex dry and bagging circuit and electrical 
upgrades addition normal preventative maintenance programmes this the first major maintenance shutdown since the 
plant opened

update progress 
orocobre and ttc continue advance plans for the proposed lithium hydroxide plant built naraha japan 
the proposed location well situated near potential customers which reduces the common risks caking and degradation 
quality when lithium hydroxide transported and exposed humidity 
the process will utilise primary grade lithium carbonate sourced from olaroz and locally sourced japanese lime the test work 
demonstrated that very high quality battery grade lithium hydroxide could produced from customised process 
negotiations continue for the epc contract and are expected completed the september quarter 
capital expenditure for the lithium hydroxide plant remains approximately million basis pre subsidies 
subsidies million have been secured from the japanese government 
operating costs excluding lithium carbonate feedstock for the lithium hydroxide plant remain approximately 
tonne delivering very favourable investment case

market and sales 
total volume lithium carbonate sold the june quarter was tonnes lithium carbonate prices increased 
tonne fob for the quarter 
since operations commenced olaroz has developed strong customer base customers who have tested and accepted the 
high grade purified and prime products the purified product regularly tests lithium carbonate and sold battery 
and cathode end users the prime product regularly tests lithium carbonate and sold variety technical and 
industrial end users neither these products require any additional processing for their respective markets 
lithium market 
during the june quarter china lithium carbonate contract prices continued edge higher closing the gap with stagnant and 
declining china spot prices the spot prices china experienced decline during the quarter result subsidy policy changes 
having effect demand due the need for cathode and battery manufacturers adjust the new requirements and the 
need for raw material producers china move excess inventory key south american suppliers have guided toward strong 
pricing citing robust demand particularly from cathode customers amidst shortfall battery grade lithium carbonate 
and hydroxide the market had expected improved supply conditions with expansions expected come line from 
australian hard rock projects and chinese conversion plants but despite growing imports australian concentrate and direct 
shipping ore dso through chinese ports the overall supply demand balance continues tight conversion plants 
reported significant technical difficulties commissioning new capacity and converting new supply 
the end approximately lce concentrate and almost lce dso was stockpiled china due restrictions 
chinese conversion plants with most operating below capacity given growing imports new australian spodumene 
concentrate supply this bottleneck became more apparent during the march quarter approximately the concentrate 
and dso volume was below grade concentrate import data sourced from chinese customs and there were reports 
growing stockpiles throughout the supply chain ports warehouses and plants 
given only chinese imports non greenbushes material was above during several new hard rock 
producers have announced ongoing efforts improve grade during via additional plant and equipment additionally 
the leading dso supplier has announced plans progressively decrease supply for the remainder the year this decision 
comes amidst months market speculation regarding the technical and economic viability dso 
given very little sales battery grade material have been made the spot market the price indicative speculative 
trading rather than demand from the growing battery segment contrast demand for battery grade material from suppliers 
the contract market has grown reflecting robust demand conditions both sqm and albemarle attest strong demand growth 
rates and cagr respectively based their customer long term order books 
this sentiment echoed downstream the battery supply chain with continued investment additional capacity buoyed 
car manufacturer targets battery manufacturing capacity expected more than quadruple growing from 
although continued expansion beyond this likely while numerous smaller players have announced 
expansions and new entrants are expected drawn into the industry its growth prospects over the capacity 
forecast accounted for panasonic tesla catl and chem benchmark minerals 
the downstream battery supply chain expands largely line with company guidance has become increasingly apparent 
that the current deficit lithium carbonate and hydroxide likely persist due slower ramp profiles than expected 
significant technical improvements are required lift output and unlock persisting bottlenecks this basis the 
company view that tight market conditions will persist the short term with some lumpiness variability expected 
supply and demand the market grows
