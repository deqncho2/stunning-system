emission cost inflation and incentivisation are driving the revolution the 
revolution being driven not the cost ownership many had expected 
although the gap narrowing but the sharp rise cost regulatory 
compliance existing internal combustion engines ice this rising cost 
compliance pushing oems change their strategy towards electric vehicles 
evs with the law diminishing returns ever more apparent relation 
emission regulatory compliance think these changes are happening now and 
that penetration rates could rise which poses the question 
what value the chemical industry can extract from powertrain versus the 
traditional combustion engine simplistic view the chemical sectors would 
that autocatalyst companies have all lose while cathode material producers 
have all gain however believe more nuanced than this 
fit for purpose versus fit for the future believe that current ion battery 
technology largely workable and will the near term fit for purpose 
support adoption world supported emission regulations and 
government incentives the battery pack cost kwh migrates towards 
kwh however you believe that cost parity with ice vehicle 
somewhere between and kwh standalone basis noted 
suppliers such johnson matthey and conti then material step change the 
evolution the battery materials will required innovation can deliver this 
step change then arguably evs will prove fit for the future and could 
envisage scenario for cathode technology leaders differentiate themselves 
creating market more reflective the autocatalyst market 
underappreciated battery integration future technology leaders appear the 
best way play the opportunity from here given our concerns around nearterm cathode material commoditisation and industry cost pressures believe 
investors should ascribe greater value those companies investing the 
development future materials where valuations don yet reflect the potential 
upside johnson matthey overweight rather than those investing fit for 
purpose capacity today where valuations not discount the near term risks 
commoditisation umicore underweight for investors with shorter time 
horizons prefer integrated battery manufacturers that should benefit most 
from scale effects and chinese acceleration overweight chem and 
chinese pure battery play guoxuan high tech

why read this report 
our deep dive into the cathode material market and proprietary integrated model 
have unearthed number interesting conclusions some which challenge 
consensual wisdom and pose number interesting questions not readily 
debated below are the three explore more detail this report 
chemistry fit for purpose versus fit for the future the current cathode 
material technology roadmap well understood and while will help reduce the 
cost towards kwh material step change required the technology 
reduce costs further 
capacity aggressive expansion will test price discipline with the demand 
outlook taken given not enough attention being paid the supply side 
where have identified material expansion plans across most producers most 
notably china 
cost the cathode important lever reduce the cost kwh the cathode 
material will play important role achieving the cost roadmap for the supply 
chain given its current large share the overall cost and the ability improve 
energy density less clear whether producers will able maintain 
stable price kwh from energy density improvements alone

emission cost inflation driving fit for purpose revolution the revolution 
being driven not the cost owners many had expected but instead the sharp 
rise cost regulatory compliance existing internal combustion engines ice this 
rising cost compliance pushing oems change their strategy towards electric 
vehicles evs with the law diminishing returns ever more apparent relation 
emission regulatory compliance while battery costs may not coming down quickly 
oems would like the point which ice and drivetrain manufacturing costs match 
getting closer oem longer term view longer term regulations and 
nox emissions tighten further seems likely evs may not even the cheaper 
alternative they may become the only alternative political demand for zero emissions 
clearly increasing and the political environment for the previous industry 
solution diesel engines has changed considerably oems will have find new 
alternative 
exhibit major changes battery cost calculations but the 
costs getting conventional engines comply with and

chemical elements dictating the properties and performance battery cell 
along with the anode and electrolyte the cathode facilitates the charge discharge 
process battery therefore depending the materials used will influence 
properties such energy density kwh power density cost kwh

how does our view the cathode material market differ from consensus while 
not dispute the volume growth expected evs and therefore for battery materials 
question whether the supply chain risks are being appropriately discounted the 
market identify three key risks 
increasing competition with all producers planning increase capacity materially 
technological advancements the chemistry and 
industry cost pressures that cathode material producers will need navigate 
order capture the full value from this powertrain migration 
suspect that technology step change will lead evolution the possible 
value extracted from the cathode market with fit for purpose cathode materials risk 
commoditising while fit for the future materials secure greater value for the 
improvements and cost reduction they bring 
how can investors position themselves what nascent fast moving market for 
investors with longer time horizon prefer future cathode technology leaders 
where currently value being ascribed the equity here our top pick johnson 
matthey overweight for those with shorter time horizon favour integrated 
battery manufacturers able benefit most from scale effects and china bev 
exposure here like guoxuan high tech and chem both rated overweight 
are more cautious umicore underweight where valuation reflects more the bull 
case and our view fails discount the risks associated with fit for purpose capacity

similarities and differences cathodes autocatalysts supply 
and demand 
the cathode material market not oligopoly such have autocatalysts 
and that basis would expect greater levels competition here while 
technology will doubtless play part early signs are that supply availability will 
play greater role the profitability the cathode market than does 
autocatalysis where technology and know how are the barriers that have led 
long standing oligopoly for nearly years 
chemistry fit for purpose versus fit for the future 
while research continues across all ion cathode materials the focus nickel rich 
ternary materials has increased notably given clear technology roadmap and the 
higher energy density the materials best address consumer range and price concerns 
while incremental improvements the cathode material will made coming years 
believe make evs truly competitive with their internal combustion engine 
equivalent still requires step change the technology 
possible technology disruptors 
lithium sulphur lithium sulfur often cited the long term solution given its 
very high specific energy about three times that conventional 
lithium ion battery the other advantages are the relatively low cost raw 
materials specific power density and good cold temperature 
discharge characteristics well low temperature charging 
limitations include material degradation low cycle life and self discharge 
high voltage lithium ion much research going into next generation ion 
increase the operational voltage and therefore energy density while not 
compromising the stability the cathode material this includes alternate 
material structures olivine spinel and material doping increase stability 
higher voltages limitations include reduced cyclability and material degradation 
high voltages 
lithium air lithium air believed offer the energy density 
conventional ion battery the theoretical specific energy lithium air 
would par with gasoline fuelled vehicle widely 
acknowledged least years from commercialisation and only some 
the material challenges can overcome limitations include material degradation 
due air purity short cycle life and poor thermal operating range 
solid state lithium this often perceived the natural progression current liion batteries with the ability store twice the energy although there are some 
concerns over the loading capabilities solid state batteries continue use current 
cathode materials but replace the anode with solid state lithium and use 
alternate electrolyte limitations include material degradation the anode short 
cycle life poor thermal operating range 
fuel cells the increased focus evs has raised interest fuel cells again fuelcell vehicles typically run off hydrogen and while range and power are less 
limitation the infrastructure build out remains the greatest hurdle material 
limitations include fuelling infrastructure and energy efficiency liquifying 
hydrogen transportation 
and many others 
fit for purpose cathode technologies should support pack cost kwh 
automotive oem cost and technology roadmaps are intrinsically linked cathode 
material producers need improve the energy density the cathode materials order 
support lower price kwh while maintaining stable price for the cathode 
material not yet clear whether the targeted energy density improvements will 
enough maintain stable cost for the cathode given contractual price downs 
agreed for each platform nmc has clear technology roadmap move from 
nmc more nickel rich nmc currently use and nmc the not toodistant future simplistically increasing the nickel content not only raises the energy 
density but also thrifts cobalt currently the most expensive ternary raw material 
and reduces the total metal required this roadmap well understood and will 
support reduction the battery dollar cost kwh somewhere close

kwh estimate that battery evs component costs will remain car higher than petrol even these levels total cost ownership for 
battery evs could lower than petrol diesel due fuel cost savings 
european fuel costs helpful for our forecasts for rising penetration post

kwh evs could close cost parity with petrol cars and cheaper than 
diesels that even comply with the standards europe 
kwh evs could already cheaper than petrol diesel 
total cost ownership 
purchase prices are much higher today exhibit shows model attempting 
calculate the impact monthly running costs much higher current transaction 
prices assume that evs have much lower residual costs than internal combustionengine cars least early suggesting that lease costs will much higher given that 
greater depreciation will have covered during the life the lease thus monthly 
lease costs for plug hybrid vehicles phevs and battery electric vehicles bevs could 
much higher than monthly lease costs for petrol engine alternatives 
however then continue compare total running and ownership costs evs can 
start quickly reduce that price disadvantage 
lower running costs make much the difference looking total cost 
ownership assume phevs and bevs have lower fuel costs lower insurance 
costs and lower service costs than current vehicles calculate that based 
european fuel prices fuel and running costs for bevs could much lower 
than for current petrol diesel engine cars adding all calculate that

reports from the washington post september and amnesty international 
have highlighted human rights concerns within cobalt mining the drc artisanal 
mining prevalent cobalt exported from the drc source this what die 
for amnesty international and african resources watch january and while 
this provides much needed jobs also raises the risk poor health and safety 
practices exposure cobalt dust while not using protective equipment can lead 
respiratory illness while poor construction underground mines raises the risk 
tunnel collapses several sources document the existence child labour within cobalt 
mining the drc including the department labor and unicef 
the state department defines conflict minerals those whose exploration and 
production are potentially connected human rights violations the drc adjoining 
countries present the term only applies tantalum tin tungsten and gold 
otherwise known however there the potential for expansion the list 
include cobalt should this happen the companies that use cobalt their products 
would need file conflict mineral disclosure reports the sec under the dodd frank 
wall street reform act 
europe the recently finalised regulations that will require compliance and 
some ways are more rigorous than those the for example the geographical 
application goes beyond just the drc and adjoining countries encompass any 
conflict affected and high risk areas globally however again cobalt currently 
excluded from the list affected minerals tantalum tin tungsten and gold 
for now the responsibility end users cobalt improve transparency their

umicore underweight 
umicore rechargeable battery business sits within its energy surface technologies 
division which also includes its cobalt and nickel refining business that refines precursor 
material umicore has long history consumer electronics cathode materials and 
the market leader lco cathode materials from technology and capacity standpoint 
umicore has been invested most other cathode technologies some point time 
and has accelerated its investment nmc primarily for automotive applications 
umicore exited from lfp cathode materials selling its stake belife its partner 
prayon within umicore battery business automotive battery sales made around 
half that the subdivision back for the first time 
within energy surface technologies umicore also has cobalt and nickel refining 
business that produces some the precursors used make cathode materials cobalt 
refining refers the processing cobalt ores concentrates intermediates and 
secondary materials into range cobalt products including metals powders and 
chemicals the operations belgium and china mainly refine intermediate products and 
secondary materials into cobalt salts oxides powders and battery cathode materials 
umicore has been active building position fit for purpose materials umicore 
nmc cathode material business recently acquired number nickel rich nmc patents 
from most likely making the majority the intangible additions reported 
that totaled these family licences provide the blueprint for nmc 
and and will run depending license umicore has also 
announced relatively short space time two expansion plans for nmc cathode 
material that will increase its current capacity fold the first expansion set ramp 
and will treble capacity from today cost the 
second capacity expansion will then double the total capacity adding further 
cost and will start available 
are the risks fit for purpose capacity being appropriately discounted our cathode 
material analysis suggests that there are some issues relation umicore that the 
market has not yet factored these include material chinese nmc cathode material 
capacity expansions low capital barriers entry low market visibility given short 
capacity build time possible near term technology ceiling for nmc materials 
unclear contract structure with some platforms approving multiple materials and 
aggressive industry cost roadmap with the debate often centered around terminal 
value question the consensual view that nmc will the lasting technology while 
nmc technology fit for purpose and will help reduce costs kwh belive 
that the fit for the future technology that will really add value and generate
