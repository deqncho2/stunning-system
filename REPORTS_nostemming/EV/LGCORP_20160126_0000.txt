benefit from premium product mix driven twin wash washing machines and door door

uplus provides wired and wireless communication services through its subsidiaries also 
provides internet service software and hardware development and others uplus fundamentals 
are fairly flat with arpu inching slightly higher due higher seasonality while marketing 
expenses continue more less benign despite ongoing subscribers selecting tariff

expect earnings momentum remain robust coming quarters reflecting strong dutyfree home visit sales and improving margin beverage hpc coupled with easy comparison base 
however the domestic trend could slightly weaker than had thought especially for household 
personal care 
cns earnings have declined for the past two years given the regulators projects outsourcing only

mainly higher margin construction management business given increasing group capex plan for 
the next five years 
siliconworks develops manufactures and distributes semiconductor products the company 
manufactures core display semiconductor products locally resolve importing barriers after corp 
increased its ownership expect see strong sales growth yoy and net

business contribution from group
