its focus new parts with emphasis the software and user 
interface where technology and connectivity become important 
hyundai motor slow far but expect 
acceleration 
already significant producer hardware and parts and believes 
can take larger electronics role autonomous vehicles for auto 
oems many car companies have opted focus their efforts 
house but believe samsung could become key supplier this 
although hyundai motor group has been less vocal and active its 
area see the near term benefits for the company four fold

prise the group total hev unit shipments during made 
help provide with access the high end auto business and 
the global producer albeit low base the oem side both 
believe this should give significant headstart monetizing the

and consumers and combining the car this should complete its iot 
parts the group and aims mass produce level autonomous 
framework

samsung place the larger self driving car race 
the open platform approach the challenge 
believe samsung goal build top bottom technological platform that automakers can incorporate into their 
cars run everything from infotainment self driving 
appears have goal building more open source suite 
self driving software solutions creating new architecture for open autonomous and adas technologies and 
involving multiple key automotive players and suppliers 
our view samsung strategy not about developing the 
algorithms that help the self driving car understand the 
world around and make the right decisions navigates 
city streets instead the company focus appears 
creating software intermediary that other companies can 
use bring all the pieces together similar how android 
allows app developers launch services the smartphone market component manufacturing part the 
solution samsung currently supplies processors semiconductors and other components for oems infotainment 
systems and driver assistance features but the company 
does not appear interested building cars 
strategy important vehicle component supplier 
automobile ambitions extend developing wide variety highly 
competitive vehicle products which include infotainment system 
such avn and advanced driver assistant system called intelligent safe well focusing vehicle engineering vehicle 
thermal systems and electronic vehicle battery packs the recent 
acquisition premium automotive light maker zkw also appears 
fit with this plan 
lessons from samsung motors 
why did samsung auto business fail the samsung ventured into auto manufacturing setting samsung motors 
but was not successful back samsung motors 
launched its first mid segment sedan with technical assistance from 
nissan motors but auto industry meltdown and its misguided 
model strategy drove the company seek bankruptcy protection 
first the korean passenger vehicle market volume fell 
units from units driven weak demand 
during the financial crisis second samsung target market midrange sedans suffered even more than the overall market plunging 
way integrating through acquisitions the acquisition 
decline overall auto sales samsung 
harman last year gives samsung immediate foothold connected 
market share continued fall from and 
technologies particularly automotive electronics september 
while the overall industry recovered from units 
samsung announced new strategic business unit and 
units over the same period samsung motor revenue 
automotive innovation fund invest automotive 
was heavily exposed domestic volume continued volume declines 
startups and autonomous driving technology samsung may not 
led high inventory additionally the combination high fixed 
want own the whole car but looks moving towards eco 
costs and low utilization resulted heavy net losses 
system that looks lot more like the internet and more open for 
and the auto manufacturing business even 
example collaborating with renovo auto startup that has 
tually was bought out receivership renault 
developed operating system that integrates and manages all the 
software needed for commercial fleet shared autonomous vehicles

can korea tech and auto industries 
work together 
admittedly this seems unlikely since its inception the 
chaebol structure has fostered system growth from 
within rather than via cooperation even nowadays competition remains fierce especially between samsung and 
many areas however with potential opportunities 
the global auto transition rapidly changing the competitive landscape and inviting even greater competition the 
form mega tech giants the korean companies could 
ever find ways cooperate even small degree see 
complementary fit and believe that synergies would 
present enormous opportunities for these companies 
well for the korean economy
