what are process catalysts catalysts are the heart any chemical refinery 
conversion process there are few chemical refinery operations that don use 
process catalysts they are agents that not form part the finished product

reactions accelerate the rate reaction improve yield given time 
reduce the energy requirement for given yield reducing cost and waste

today highlight the risks investing fit for purpose cathode material what

for the dollar cost kwh drop meaningfully below kwh this believe will 
see the energy density increase significantly which turn will reduce the material cost 
sharply producers that are able deliver this step change are likely capture 
greater share the incremental cost reduction value the material would bring while

than lack technology know how

capable producing comparable materials that the current market leaders 
nmc cathode technology believe johnson matthey has been able achieve this 
leveraging competencies across its other business units process technologies and

consequence has deep understanding nickel based materials this acceleration

battery business derives little equity value falls within the group lossmaking new business division may even negative however the belief that 
johnson matthey has and will continue develop technology expertise cathode 
materials well the capability invest commercial capacity this business 
terminal value will not zero the market proves profitable this basis see 
johnson matthey attractive way play the theme while not exposing 
investors the risk fit for purpose capacity 
relative valuation presents opportunity 
the rating justified johnson matthey has rated from its long run average 
versus the chemicals sector year forward basis over the last months this 
underperformance has coincided closely with diesel gate when admitted that had 
manipulated diesel emission testing the back september since then 
johnson matthey has been seen the consensual loser from fall diesel 
penetration europe with ebit coming from this market niche this was 
compounded weakening market conditions for johnson matthey and pmp 
divisions capex was dialled back and pgm prices moved lower however with the 
organic growth trajectory now inflecting and diesel headwinds better understood this 
rating presents attractive entry point our view 
the rating even starker relation umicore where the shares have rated 
from their long run average relative the key debate has centred the 
terminal value proposition each business with investors willing look past umicore 
catalyst exposure group ebit for its exposure battery materials 
whereas with johnson matthey investors only seem wiling focus catalysis using 
sotp analysis believe that the market ascribing umicore 
automotive battery business while johnson matthey being ascribed virtually zero 
feel this relative rating unjustified given the comparability the both 
battery technology platforms and our concerns around the risks faced umicore fit 
for purpose capacity expansions from competition technology ceiling and 
aggressive industry cost roadmap while umicore technology leader believe 
johnson matthey not far behind and well positioned develop fit for the future
