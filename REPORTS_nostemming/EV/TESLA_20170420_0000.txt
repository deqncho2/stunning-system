why does tesla want get 
into trucking 
this september tesla plans unveil prototype 
autonomous electric class semi truck despite full plate 
why does tesla want get into trucking services revenue 
model may the answer 
tesla semi truck coming last july part his master plan part deux ceo 
musk announced that tesla would unveil prototype electric class semi 
truck that believe could have autonomous capabilities tesla said the unveil 
remains track our ces summit january well with musk 
tweets february and april when confirmed september reveal 
with the imminent launch the model launch the gigafactory 
development the model and integration solarcity why does tesla care 
about trucking explore few hypothetical scenarios for tesla trucking 
opportunity none which are reflected our current risk reward framework 
valuation for tesla 
tesla wants become truck oem tesla looking branch out into other 
verticals the transportation space part ceo musk master plan and 
commercial trucks appear good segment have previously written 
here electric autonomous class trucks make lot sense maybe even 
more sense than passenger cars the total addressable market tam also 
quite large tesla were garner the new truck market the 
estimate would worth annual revenue many 
base model 
may about services more than becoming truck oem trucking could 
allow tesla enter the services market bringing sustained revenues and data 
believe tesla could conceivably sell truck without battery thereby 
significantly lowering the upfront cost and offer battery swapping 
alternative putting large battery the truck estimate that tesla 
charges mile lease the battery this could big win for both trucking 
carriers and tesla carriers would benefit cutting their current fuel spend 
half from mile today addition significantly lower purchase costs 
and not taking residual risk for the battery estimate tesla could see 
annual revenues achieves run rate level share the truck parc 
also believe tesla can vertically integrate into the brokerage business for 
more services revenue estimate tesla could eventually capture just under 
the truck brokerage market 
the incremental investment may not significant entering the trucking 
industry may not particularly challenging estimate that much but not all 
the battery and autonomous driving technology needed for the truck could

shared with the passenger car division the low production run rate only 
units share should allow this fit into existing facilities without too 
much incremental investment assume that tesla would build brand new 
network battery swapping stations with overlap with existing 
supercharging stations conservative assumption but note that such 
network would roughly cost only the cost tesla 
supercharger today estimate total upfront capital cost enter 
the truck segment including the swapping stations 
what could this mean for tesla believe the tesla truck opportunity real 
and natural market adjacency the personal transport model but don 
see being worth more than market cap theoretically assume that 
tesla can deliver units class electric trucks annually with battery leasing 
revenue from trucks operation driving billion miles trucks 
miles per truck per year this would result revenue per mile 
assuming gross margin the battery business alone and blended gross 
margin including gross margin oem truck sales and 
gross margin for logistics further assumed sales and 
sales and tax rate achieve nopat revenues 
for tesla trucks value this dcf model assuming wacc 
and exit multiple nopat have assumed front costs 
top tesla current capex launch the truck business which 
dedicated tooling and manufacturing capacity with another for the 
battery swapping infrastructure which consists locations average 
robots per location servicing average trucks per hour 
hour day schedule have assumed cost per swapping station 
roughly double the cost the average tesla supercharger station these 
assumptions produce npv per share roughly tesla 
current market value 
what does this mean for the trucking industry believe autonomous 
electric truck can game changer for trucking carriers tls ltls and 
intermodal drayage significantly lowering operating costs improving 
productivity and even driving industry consolidation see here estimate 
autonomous electric truck could cheaper operate than regular 
truck today due lower driver fuel maintenance and insurance costs our 
conversations with trucking carriers believe they would quite open 
using such trucks made new non incumbent oems long the 
performance service and operating costs are superior fact would not 
surprised tesla revealed large carrier and shipper partners during its truck

tsla plans unveil prototype electric class semi truck september one 
the biggest surprises ceo musk master plan part deux unveiled july was the 
plan unveil semi truck that said would deliver substantial reduction 
the cost cargo transportation while being safer and really fun operate our ces 
summit jan tsla confirmed that they were track with the unveil 
timeline which was further confirmed ceo musk tweets feb and april 
when announced september reveal given tsla typical month window 
between prototype reveal and production intent this would put tsla track for 
potential late early production launch their semi truck 
why would tsla want become truck oem see two main factors 
autonomous electric trucks simply make sense and the truck oem tam not 
small 
autonomous electric trucks simply make sense the trucking business operates 
two key metrics unit economics and time service previously wrote here 
believe the benefits electric trucks can far outweigh the hurdles electric trucks can 
also easier sell than electric passenger cars our view thanks the operating 
cost savings roic focus fleet operators packaging benefits high percentage 
highway miles the platooning opportunity and quick penetration the fleet serving 
offsets initial concerns about range and reliability expect tsla class truck 
equipped with industry leading autonomous capability when hits the market 
the truck oem tam not small the total class new truck market worth about 
trucks average each even share the 
revenue would the equivalent selling model every year 
believe share assumption for tsla over time not particularly aggressive given 
the truck market relatively concentrated with only truck oems the truck 
oems appear lagging the tech stakes and tsla demonstrated ability take 
share from entrenched incumbents the segments which competes the 
passenger car side with share tsla would still comfortably the smallest truck 
oem the assume tsla truck would sell for about without the 
battery included and tsla picked the class truck market the 
that would generate revenue per year trucks each 
this the equivalent selling base model

leasing batteries could tesla entry into the services business 
long haul class truck needs have range miles day about the 
distance that driver can drive day remain compliant with hours service rules 
autonomous class truck may need double that range given its higher utilization 
not having driver would not restrict hours service regulations for 
lbs class truck have range over miles the truck battery would need 
least kwh capacity our estimate mile range per kwh based 
tsla miles range per kwh for the model and roughly miles range per 
kwh for existing heavy duty electric trucks the market assume that tsla battery 
will offer superior performance range existing trucks the market due their 
superior technology experience particularly with battery management even with 
tsla leading cost structure and battery packaging experience this could 
prohibitively expensive and hard package our opinion estimate that the 
powertrain fuel class truck today weighs approx lbs which 
would allow tsla put kwh battery its truck keep the overall truck 
weight unchanged assuming kwh battery model weighs about lbs 
this would leave tsla with two choices our view 
develop shorter range trucks tsla limited the per charge range its trucks 
something closer miles instead targeting this could help 
significantly alleviate the price packaging problem since the truck can get away with 
only kwh battery note that even the kwh battery tesla model 
has been independently rated over and torque which 
compares well the specs the average class diesel engine today class truck 
with miles range can effectively used for relatively short haul 
applications including ltl intermodal drayage closed loop applications like 
yards ports and select ecommerce last mile applications this particularly applicable 
tsla initially launches class rather than class truck also note that 
tsla supercharging network with potential flash charging option could allow truck 
practicably cover longer distances even with smaller battery 
use battery swapping get around the battery price packaging problem 
believe tsla could sell its autonomous electric semis without battery which would 
then separately leased the customer with mile range these batteries 
could then swapped out battery swapping station tsla passenger car battery 
swapping demo took seconds but conservatively estimate that truck battery 
swap would take least minutes built tesla supercharging stations and truck 
stops around the country 
tsla has had mixed relationship with battery swapping thus far while ceo musk was 
enthusiastic about the solution during his battery swap demo june believe 
the company internally feels that swapping imperfect solution and would instead 
prefer achieve the maximum possible range from its batteries together with dense 
fast charging network nevertheless believe that battery swapping can much 
better solution for the commercial truck market than for passenger cars believe 
trucking carriers would far more amenable the concept battery swapping than 
passenger vehicles have been because makes economic sense lowering the upfront 
cost the truck and without the residual risk buying battery which going 
used extensively 
this makes economic sense for tsla our view estimate that trucking carrier 
spends about per mile fuel gal diesel and mpg and does about 
miles year per truck tsla charged mile lease the battery out 
the carrier can reduce its total fuel bill fuel total costs and 
tsla could generate revenue per truck per year run rate 
once tsla achieves share the truck parc consider the fact that the 
powertrain class truck today about the cost new tractor 
the savings buying truck without powertrain would worth almost 
mile over the life the truck years avg life cycle 
miles for public carrier with this mind tsla could charge much 
mile and the truck carrier would still save fuel costs but with equal 
purchase cost today with the mile kwh range assumed earlier give truck 
mile range would need kwh battery which assume would cost 
tsla approx each kwh 
key assumption making this analysis work how long the battery would last 
before needing pulled out service and recycled replaced tsla today has 
unlimited mile battery warranty its passenger cars but this only calls for replacement 
the battery performing below its performance curve within the first years 
not have data how long tsla batteries last average before replacement 
the batteries last miles tsla would roughly break even between the 
cost the battery per year and the revenue generated per truck per year 
the battery lasts significantly longer the life cycle economics would significantly 
better also not know the production cost recycling battery building 
new one estimate that the batteries will last least years miles 
building the swapping infrastructure tsla could well expand its current network 
supercharging stations across north america include truck battery swapping 
stations but have assumed that they would likely build new network locations 
from scratch for few reasons better align the battery swapping footprint with 
the truck route network along highway corridors assume that buyers 
cars may not want recharge alongside class trucks though this experience will 
significantly better than pulling your diesel bmw into the diesel section the back 
gas station and conservative with our math
