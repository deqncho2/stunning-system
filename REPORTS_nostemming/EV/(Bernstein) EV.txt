before the siege paris began the autumn castor and pollux two elephants 
housed the jardin des plantes were proboscidean celebrities the siege extended into 
winter the pair role the daily lives parisians changed the prussian army surrounding 
paris that fall prevented anything and anyone from entering leaving the city shortages 
became commonplace especially meat beef prices skyrocketed rationing was 
imposed and finally there was simply none had the kitchens paris were forced 
improvise december pollux made the ultimate sacrifice for fellow parisians 
the next day was castor turn death the two have come exemplify the pity war 
humanity indomitable will survive and the risks bottlenecks and substitution 
set out this blackbook within any dramatically altered system whether city under 
siege industry facing disruptive innovation the most important question almost 
always the same where the supply chain bottleneck what component material 
commodity input are existing suppliers least able scale keep with demand and 
what substitutes exist the fate castor and pollux demonstrates identifying the 
bottlenecks and the alternatives crucial when attempting navigate revolution 
since our first blackbook the electric revolution published march rapid 
advances battery technology have improved economics demand continues rise 
and incumbents are jumping board this global cross sector blackbook therefore 
focuses primarily bottlenecks see greatest opportunities tier battery makers 
including samsung sdi and byd both outperform tier battery component particularly 
cathode makers including umicore market perform johnson matthey outperform 
plus leading asian suppliers and raw material suppliers exposed nickel cobalt and 
copper including glencore first quantum antofagasta and ivanhoe all outperform 
believe that vertically integrated oems tesla market perform and byd outperform 
are better positioned given bottlenecks the supply chain among incumbent oems 
daimler and saic are our top picks globally the utilities with exposure the mobility 
infrastructure theme are enel both rated outperform innogy sse and national

innovations chemistry and design combined with scale are leading higher energy 
densities and lower cost higher capacity cathodes with lower reliance cobalt and new 
innovations the anode all drive significant improvements thus believe that battery 
pack costs will reach the kwh peak much earlier than most expect 
demand accelerating tipping point sales growth has continued rate 
higher than our earlier slow adoption case yet slightly behind our more aggressive rapidadoption projection the near term expect demand continue grow roughly line 
with this slow adoption projection until evs reach upfront cost parity with internal 
combustion engines ices this should drive rapid acceleration demand 
incumbents finally climbing board expected any disruptive innovation the first 
response incumbent car oems was resist change however faced with the potential 
ban ices and the threat new entrants tesla byd and others incumbent oems 
appear finally climbing board the past months 
batteries and raw materials could become potential bottlenecks although don see any 
long term permanent bottleneck see risk tightness and short term bottlenecks 
few areas raw materials nickel and cobalt could present meaningful bottlenecks 
using current chemistry however new battery formulations will introduced after 
that will use significantly less nickel and cobalt battery components manufacturing 
processes are quite scalable and thus don expect significant risk terms 
capacity bottlenecks see risk shortages high quality battery cells due 
increasingly complex quality control and manufacturing processes finally don see

substitution risks 
battery technology continues evolve providing substitution risks along the supply 
chain battery innovation accelerating which leads higher energy density and lower 
costs our analysis shows substitution risks for all major raw material inputs except lithium 
and copper also see risk disruption anodes separators and electrolytes battery 
cells and cathodes however have far less substitution risks 
new chemistries are being introduced wean off expensive metals particularly cobalt 
numerous incremental cathode innovations are being introduced that use less cobalt 
and less nickel addition see silicon and eventually lithium metal substitute for

battery innovations will likely utilize current battery manufacturing facilities most future 
battery technologies evaluated are being adjusted utilize current battery 
manufacturing processes and equipment due the huge sunk cost and scale advantages 
that today lithium ion factories possess any new technology that doesn utilize current 
tools believe doomed fail over will likely have been invested 
these battery and battery component factories 
hybrids and fuel cells may play role but likely niche although hybrids are competitive 
with pure evs upfront costs today excluding subsidies due falling battery costs 
and inefficient duplication powertrains show that hybrids will uncompetitive 
with pure evs beyond fuel cells are least more expensive than pure 
powertrains based upfront costs but see potential for fuel cells play niche role 
long haul point point heavy goods transportation due higher energy density 
beyond the upfront cost disadvantage hydrogen refueling stations are more 
expensive than electric chargers and thus dispersed network cost prohibitive

the supply chain 
turning the subject the raw material requirements for the revolution with 
refreshed adoption and battery chemistry mix scenarios examine the potential 
upstream implications the mining industry the issue potential raw material 
bottlenecks one that clearly significant concern both investors and industry 
participants 
not just about potential demand impact geological and financial constraints are vitally 
important compared with current demand levels the biggest potential demand uplift from 
electric vehicles appears the lithium market but people seem miss the fact that big 
potential demand uplift not necessarily sufficient itself justify sustained higher 
prices when comes the availability tonnes the ground copper nickel and 
cobalt that have the shortest reserve lives out the key electric vehicle battery metals and 
based bernstein new government target scenario and slow adoption battery 
chemistry mix case the cumulative metal required out for evs significantly 
greater than the current reserve base for these three metals see exhibit this not the 
case for lithium the financial side meanwhile nickel and copper that will require 
far the most capital investment order supply the required material for growth 
clearly there much interest developing cobalt and nickel lite battery technologies 
would however caution against simply magicking away any possible challenge 
adoption invoking the specter technology explain what would otherwise 
legitimate limits what actually possible nevertheless running the numbers more 
aggressive what battery chemistry scenario can see that there will need for 
significant amounts nickel cobalt and copper see exhibit importantly copper least 
affected any move toward this battery mix scenario and the raw material requirements 
here still appear extremely challenging 
our conclusion from this analysis that see nickel and cobalt having the biggest 
potential upside current market prices and respectively the government 
target scenario but the impact for nickel and cobalt would lower the battery industry 
can move more aggressive chemistry mix however the upside for copper remains 
very significant indeed upside our government target scenario and the 
slow adoption scenario and far can see the range potential price outcomes 
much narrower such see copper offering consistent upside almost regardless

how does this impact tesla 
and byd 
will the commodity and battery production bottlenecks impact the emergent oems 
such tesla and byd think the impact will small while bottlenecks could 
incrementally negative adoption creating investment opportunities throughout the 
value chain the investment theses for tesla and byd will likely remain unchanged the 
downside these companies may even outweighed the fact that bottlenecks could 
strengthen the two companies competitive advantages relative basis 
for instance believe bottleneck battery commodities would only modest but 
surmountable headwind the and perhaps relative positive for tesla note that 
the actual cost impact per vehicle would not particularly high our analysis implies 
worst case cost increase kwh for tesla batteries and kwh for nmc 
batteries per car while such development would inherently 
negative for the industry ceteris paribus the fundamental story does not change prices 
will likely keep going down bit slower governments will still increasingly push 
adoption companies such tesla will likely further catalyze consumer interest and 
incumbent responses and battery and charging technology will inevitably continue 
improve even total cost parity pushed off year two meanwhile tesla might 
even benefit from commodity bottleneck other manufacturers the company 
unparalleled brand aura would likely lend industry leading pricing power when 
surveyed tesla owners with model reservations july only respondents 
indicated they would much less likely purchase the car additional options added 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
the price doubt charging extra cover 
commodity costs would move the needle much 
similarly view bottlenecks battery production another small but surmountable 
hurdle for the electric vehicle industry and potentially relative positive for tesla and byd 
each which controls its own battery production moreover suspect that the timeline 
for the bottleneck mid outside most investors time horizons note that our 
projected shortage still perhaps eight years away and this assumes that 
demand specifically inflects around opposed several years later which 
point there might shortage also assumes that the battery supplier industry begins 
consolidating absent consolidation might not face shortage until 
our conclusions particularly resonate for tesla market bottlenecks aren going make 
break the company instead see the company itself its own greatest bottleneck 
can tesla really execute its ambitions the company long term future 
precipitated successful near term rollout its model but remain skeptical about 
the company ability make the car profitably deliver good initial build quality and 
ramp production quickly tesla cannot chart plausible path profitability and 
sustainable cash flows with the model then investors may balk providing further 
liquidity going forward and tesla capital needs remain enormous achieve its own

political headlines most notably the and withdrawal economic support most 
notably china the withdrawal from the paris climate accord announced august 
and the imposition the import tariffs solar panels under section

the decline cost the technology together with widespread adoption and rapid growth 
means that the cessation subsidies from any one individual market would little 
derail the electric revolution forecast that the year when evs and ices will come 
with similar sticker price regardless subsidies and without considering the effect 
fuel prices the total cost ownership cuts renewable energy subsidies spain 
and germany had material consequences demand pricing and 
profitability today political backlash against renewables and evs has become more 
profound some corners the world but counterintuitively these political stances are 
less meaningful industry economics the rationing federal tax credits for evs the 
and the abolition tax waivers evs hong kong put the margin incremental 
pressure other markets however the moment when killer blow can extinguish the 
entire industry regulators come their senses has largely passed 
the exception that observation may china china leadership both producer and 
consumer renewable energy and energy storage continues expand cost declines 
continue subsidies china are falling and the criteria qualify for subsidies tightening

abandonment the technology the part the regulator host market however our

battery technology advancements and the race 
ice cost parity 
rapid advances battery technology are improving economics faster than expected 
innovations chemistry and design combined with scale are leading higher energy 
densities and lower costs these innovations have accelerated over the past few years 
the global battery supply chain readies for electrification transport and energy storage 
systems enable renewables although the pace technological advancement has not 
been perhaps fast moore law for semiconductors innovation accelerating 
bottlenecks substitutes and holdouts 
bernstein 
spurred mounting environmental concerns around fossil fuels and the growing need for 
cheaper and better batteries 
result these innovations and unprecedented scale believe battery pack costs 
will reach the kwh peak far earlier than most expect our latest analysis 
shows that battery pack costs are falling far faster than most recent projections hitting the 
inevitable economic crossover with ice cars far sooner than most expect thus expect 
the electric vehicle revolution accelerate post this critical inflection point 
battery costs are falling over per year and will likely continue this rate until the 
kwh pack level reached thereafter expect single digit cost declines until 
new breakthrough chemistry commercialized the mainstream such solid state 
lithium metal batteries lithium sulfur lithium air 
what driving this accelerated decline battery costs improved chemistry higher 
voltages cell design and scale all play their part reduce battery costs particular the 
development higher capacity cathodes with higher nickel content new innovations the 
anode that enable carbon composite anode and improved electrolytes that allow 
higher voltages all drive significant improvements energy density this higher energy 
density directly translates lower cost per kwh today nmc giving way nmc 
and nmc and expect nmc enabled later this year further 
improvement energy density and cost reductions will likely enabled with the 
introduction nmc and elno addition great deal research making 
silicon carbon anodes possible sooner than predicted 
exhibit the battery law energy density continues improve regular and linear rate 
per year this rate should reach

demand accelerating tipping point around 
sales growth has continued rate higher than our earlier slow adoption case and 
slightly behind our more aggressive rapid adoption projection the near term expect 
demand continue grow roughly line with this slow adoption projection until evs 
reach cost parity with ices excluding subsidy and operating cost savings when evs 
become not just faster cleaner better but also cheaper than ice cars likely 
expect rapid acceleration adoption from following the trend other 
mainstream technologies have followed the past 
since published our adoption projections the end sales have 
accelerated china after rocky start due subsidy cuts and missing 
catalogues saw sales grow faster than expected accounting for half global 
sales including imports yoy the government has reiterated its 
determination toward strategy confirming the cafc quota policy for 
and stating that working the timetable ban gasoline cars this biggest market 
globally the competition not only limited domestic players but also from foreigners 
via their jvs with chinese partners expected fiercer following years

leaf debut september japan 
compared our global projection the actual sales and were 
between our slow and rapid adoption scenarios however was worse than 
originally expected growth basis the growth rate was stronger than even our 
rapid adoption scenario globally see exhibit 
despite low penetration the near term believe adoption will reach its tipping 
point when evs will likely become cheaper than ices this will lead more car 
oems creating their own strategy providing more alternatives the market which 
turn should cultivate consumers car buying behavior 
explained earlier battery pack costs will likely reach the kwh panacea 
much earlier than most expect our latest analysis shows that battery pack costs are 
falling much faster than most recent projections hitting the inevitable economic crossover 
with ice cars far sooner than earlier projections suggested thus expect the 
revolution accelerate post this critical inflection point 
for the long term mass adoption evs the economics should make sense evs must 
able compete with ices even without subsidies appeal consumers and cost 
competitive the main driver incremental costs for evs the battery pack which for 
range capacity costs around today compared with gasoline 
engine that costs around add that another for the electric motor 
and inverter and the gap even wider but battery costs are falling fast and even more 
rapidly than our earlier estimates due this the long term economics look increasingly 
good for evs and better than ices thus powering mass adoption addition massive

our three new adoption demand scenarios 
after the success and acceleration sales make some changes our 
original late adoption projections now longer see the most bearish case 
termed epic fail reasonable case keep our slow adoption and rapid adoption 
cases plus add third new and more reasonable case based government and oem 
targets this targets line sits the middle between our original rapid and slow adoption 
scenarios detailed below 
rapid adoption scenario this untouched from our original late projections 
this scenario assumed cost parity with ices will reached the early 
and rapid adoption would follow like many previous new technologies 
assumed adoption would follow the typical curve tvs pcs handsets and 
smartphones reaching shipments developed markets and the 
majority this scenario china leads the market but other emerging markets 
lag our developed market estimates due lack infrastructure and lower level 
willingness invest the short term this assume rapid adoption similar 
what have seen playing out smartphones and other technologies also 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
assumed cost parity with ices will reached before and all car makers will 
respond phasing out ices favor the faster better cleaner and cheaper 
battery powered cars this case also assumes major bottlenecks adoption from 
batteries battery materials other component supplies 
government target scenario this the new middle case which still models 
curve penetration for each region for this case assumed that all western 
european countries follow the example france the and ban gasoline vehicles 
assuming hev allowed though china has just initiated the research 
the timetable ban ice cars assume plug evs will take all the new car 
sales the country following the trajectory reaching and 
guided contrast think plug evs still have long way the 
india market despite the fact that the country considering the implementation 
evs see details below 
slow adoption scenario this scenario also untouched from our original 
projections and now effectively our bear case this scenario assumed cost 
parity with ices will reached bit later due poor enforcement fuel 
efficiency and emissions standards globally this scenario also follows the curve 
trajectory but with later inflection and much slower adoption due bottlenecks 
arising either batteries battery materials other component supplies this case 
also assumes much slower pickup emerging markets due the lack

detailing our new 
government target case 
china september the chinese government published the final version 
cafc credit policy the credit quota assessment has been pushed back year 
with for and for the first year implementation oems 
accumulated negative credits will allowed offset addition 
the guidance for penetration until china miit also published document april 
indicating that the government expects reach total million vehicle sales 
and million further indicates that annual sales are expected reach 
million penetration and that evs will account for total car 
sales which translates million sales unlike the cafc credit policy this policy 
more like statement expectation than hard target but helps understand the 
trajectory that the government wants develop for this market 
from industry wide perspective think the credit quota could achieved 
and but without significant extra credits offset negative cafc credits any 
under our slow adoption scenario assuming the average credit bev china 
the penetration bev gives the industry credit which further rises 
when credits from phev added there still upside potential 
average bev credit improves until and bev portion plug ins increases further 
above total plug sales witnessed given bevs are more 
favored oem for their higher credit per car however compared the government 
annual sales guidance our combined electric and projections for slow 
adoption case are still and less respectively see exhibit 
exhibit bernstein projection government guidance our slow adoption scenario suggests that china 
will reach the quota for with few credits offset negative cafc credits any however 
are and down compared with the million and million annual sales guidance from miit for

global from studying previous technology adoption curves consistently see 
curve and although the rate adoption does vary somewhat has typically taken five 
years for the adoption rate increase from see exhibit 
addition china and the three european countries france the and norway 
believe there will more countries encouraging mandating evs thus further 
analyzed the potential penetration modeling curve penetration for each region 
here assume all western europe will follow the example france the ban 
gasoline vehicles assuming hev allowed though china has just initiated the

the new car sales the country following the trajectory reaching and 
guided contrast think plug evs still have long way the 
india market despite the country considering the phasing evs encourage 
the adoption bevs india has just rolled out the new tax policy gst which lowers the 
total tax for bevs and boosted the total tax for hybrids 
even hold conservative view for this market given that india has not installed 
the charging infrastructure yet and major oems india are lagging rolling out bevs 
think the country far away from switching fully electric vehicles see exhibit

evaluating potential bottlenecks and substitutes 
batteries and raw materials could become potential bottlenecks although don see any 
long term permanent bottleneck see risk tightness and short term bottlenecks 
few areas raw materials nickel and cobalt could present meaningful bottlenecks 
using current chemistry however new battery formulations will introduced after 
that will use significantly less nickel and cobalt and could entirely replaced the long 
run necessary furthermore after battery recycling should start provide 
portion needs battery components manufacturing processes are quite scalable and 
thus don expect any significant risk terms capacity bottleneck see risk 
shortages high quality battery cells due increasingly complex quality control and 
manufacturing processes 
other areas such power semiconductors and electric motors don see any major 
bottleneck concern power semiconductors although complex component that 
undergoing improvement scale can ramp significantly when needed today power 
semiconductor industry very small fraction total semiconductor wafer volume 
produced today and hence see major risk here electric motors see numerous 
makers including auto oems insourcing and thus see major risk also don see 
charging infrastructure barrier adoption the commercial case for investing 
improves with higher adoption 
terms substitution risks the only raw materials see with little risk being entirely 
replaced are lithium and copper all other materials see are having substitution risks 
the long run components anodes separators and electrolytes all face significant risk 
disruption the inevitable move solid state chemistry the for battery cells 
the only viable substitute can see would the hydrogen fuel cell which will evaluate

technology roadmap and 
substitution risks 
overview 
battery technology continues evolve providing substitution risks along the supply 
chain battery innovation accelerating which leads higher energy density and lower 
cost our analysis shows substitution risks for all major raw material inputs except lithium 
and copper also see risk disruption anodes separators and electrolytes battery 
cells and cathodes however have far less substitution risks 
new chemistries are being introduced wean off expensive metals particularly cobalt 
numerous incremental cathode innovations are being introduced that use less cobalt 
and less nickel addition see silicon and eventually lithium metal substitute for 
graphite the anode 
longer term solid state batteries will likely disrupt the battery component supply chain 
expect solid state electrolytes play role the mid first solid state lithiumion and finally solid state lithium metal battery this has major ramifications for battery 
components separators are not required electrolytes will fundamentally different 
polymers ceramics and anodes will eventually become pure lithium cathodes also have 
some potential disrupted sulfur air but that lower risk and likely later 
battery innovations will likely utilize current battery manufacturing facilities most future 
battery technologies evaluated are being adjusted utilize current battery 
manufacturing processes and equipment due the huge sunk cost and scale advantages 
that today lithium ion factories possess any new technology that doesn utilize current 
tools believe doomed fail over will likely have been invested 
these battery and battery component factories 
hybrids and fuel cells may play role but likely niche although hybrids are competitive 
with pure evs upfront costs today excluding subsidies due falling battery costs 
and inefficient duplication powertrains show that hybrids will uncompetitive 
with pure evs beyond fuel cells are least more expensive than pure 
powertrains based upfront costs but see potential for fuel cells play niche role 
long haul point point heavy goods transportation due higher energy density 
beyond the upfront cost disadvantage hydrogen refueling stations are more 
expensive than electric chargers and thus disperses network cost prohibitive

longer term solid state batteries will likely disrupt the battery component supply chain 
expect solid state electrolytes play role the mid first solid state 
lithium ion and finally solid state lithium metal battery this has major ramifications for 
battery components separators are not required electrolytes will fundamentally 
different polymers ceramics and anodes will eventually become pure lithium cathodes 
also have some potential disrupted sulfur air but that lower risk and likely 
later 
the current form the lib the electrolyte has seen relatively little innovation the most 
commonly used material lithium salt solution with more additives added 
battery manufacturers however gen solid state ion batteries could replace the 
flammable liquid electrolytes used most traditional libs with solid electrolyte and thus 
make the battery safer various applications while don know what kind cathode 
will prominent this generation libs see that many the cathode materials used 
today nmc and lfp can used 
other than the innovation the electrolyte gen gen takes step further replace 
the current anode material carbon silicon with metal currently there limit libs

are inert the anode which only provides host structure for the ion does not contribute

the electrode powder converted into liquid and then dried the foil but after those 
electrodes are all built and piled top each other through winding stacking

battery manufacturing not easy scale the battery cell manufacturing scale 
fundamentally limited the batch size the cell which cannot scaled due safety 
issues with larger cells not mention the challenge fitting huge cell car much 
the battery manufacturing process the cell level scaling this requires faster 
automation rather than larger batch sizes 
battery component manufacturing more scalable key battery components include 
cathodes anodes separators electrolytes and copper foil these segments are generally 
more scalable than battery manufacturing due the scalability the batch while battery 
cell manufacturing limited the ability scale all battery components can made 
batches that can made significantly larger with larger processing equipment such 
kilns for cathodes furthermore these components are tiny subsegments much larger 
chemicals industry with huge chemical companies ready expand 
batteries become major bottleneck while demand will likely reach tipping 
point due price parity with ices many markets battery cell supply growth 
more linear and constrained our analysis shows that tier battery suppliers 
alone will not enough even total supply our consolidation supply case will 
not enough the most aggressive consolidation supply case total battery supply 
will shortage demand from modeled government target 
dram case studies show how key components can benefit era rapid growth 
the demand grew rapidly and dram supply had difficulty keeping during 
this period dram prices fell far slower than costs and far slower than prices before and 
after that period thus dram profit jumped and share prices leading dram makers 
samsung and micron rallied and respectively

rising battery complexity will likely lead 
consolidation 
battery technology evolving rapidly leading greater intensity and barriers 
believe that consolidation and greater returns should follow find that battery 
intensity and barriers are similar what see semiconductors and substantially 
higher than those panels and solar modules like any industry its early high growth 
stages the lithium ion battery industry has seen plethora new entrants all positioning 
for piece what should eventually industry bigger than the entire 
global semiconductor industry with safety concerns mounting and complexity rising 
see future for small battery players with poor technology and weak quality control the 
government policy china also encouraging consolidation mandating new minimum 
capacity requirements although this fast growth period likely continue for some time 
see consolidation inevitable thus leading better behavior the industry and 
decent returns the long run 
battery complexity and safety concerns increase energy density increases 
the first two chapters this blackbook stated that battery technology continues 
advance pace faster than expected much these technology innovations utilize 
chemistry with higher energy density which could lead batteries exploding and hence 
making them less safe thus safety and quality control become increasingly more

inevitable 
although battery cells are rather unconcentrated today after many low quality suppliers 
entered the market believe that with rising technology and quality demands 
battery makers that consolidation inevitable see exhibit 
concentrated sectors enjoy higher margins and returns every time updated our review 
the economics for five technology sectors foundry dram flat panel display solar 
modules and polysilicon and look for parallels for battery manufacturers the trap 
clear avoid sectors that are aspirational for emerging economies with centrally 
directed industrial policy intent migrating the value chain this requires 
rising barriers entry particularly intensity and complexity drive 
consolidation which turn creates higher returns may sound simplistic but what really 
matters the market structure industries with high market fragmentation simply not 
generate high margins value created competed away the good news that high 
rising intensity tends force consolidation dram and foundry have made this shift 
believe batteries will follow suit see exhibit

increasing requirements from china policy makers are also forcing consolidation china 
looking the chinese market specifically the end estimate that only four 
chinese players have reached the minimum capacity that was mentioned the

lifted the battery energy density hurdles for bevs pack level for subsidy and 
for subsidy see exhibit from the several catalogs published 
recent months from november february lists evs that are not 
necessarily available yet but are qualified for subsidy see that many oems have 
prepared one two models that reach the subsidy bar however the 
timing launch depends the overall economics selling the for which battery 
quality and cost take large weight having said that not easy for every battery maker 
help oems meet the increasingly stringent rule even the battery energy density meets 
the requirement the mass production not necessarily going happen oems need 
make sure that adopting more advanced batteries makes sense terms cost and 
safety and without sacrificing too much battery maker profitability see exhibit 
the for subsidy means jump level 
assuming the bar will continue raised this rate per year until for top models 
get subsidy oems will need have pack energy density reaching 
despite that additional subsidy for insignificant given that 
battery companies are normally ready for new tech one year earlier than the model 
launch implies that the top battery makers can achieve the pack level that 
was targeted the government see exhibit

battery manufacturing not easy scale 
most future battery technologies evaluated our roadmap are being adjusted utilize 
current battery manufacturing processes and equipment due the huge sunk cost and 
scale advantages that today lithium ion factories possess any new technology that 
doesn utilize current tools doomed fail our view over will 
have been invested these battery and battery component factories thus battery 
incumbents appear well positioned adopt these new technologies 
the battery cell manufacturing scale fundamentally limited the batch size the cell 
which cannot scaled due safety issues with larger cells not mention the problem

the main problem with today production process that takes long time weeks 
actually make battery due all the much needed wetting and drying procedures 
not only the electrode powder converted into liquid and then dried the foil but 
after those electrodes are all built and piled top each other through winding 
stacking process liquid electrolyte pumped the battery cell along with the 
stacked wound electrodes and then sent through another long drying process

the longer term battery supply growth has fundamental limitations and more linear 
battery capacity though requires significant capex not particularly expensive the 
capex required per gwh will likely decline from average for recent projects 
and below the coming years however the sheer size and volume 
manufacturing equipment the more fundamental limitation our view date 
battery company including the tesla panasonic gigafactory has added more than 
year even using the aggressive targets for the average capacity added 
top companies amounts per year 
our supply projections estimate per year capacity addition for tier players 
this includes continuous improvements energy density and productivity per year 
which applies not only new capacity but also legacy capacity believe this highly 
aggressive expansion rate that will require huge factory expansion for tier assume 
slower rate expansion due more technological bottlenecks for the number 
players assume some consolidation our consolidation supply case tier players 
are forced exit our consolidation case assume roughly the same number 
players continue believe this unlikely due the technological barriers the move 
higher energy density 
below explain detail our two supply projections

old plant improvement from total players current resources and 
customers move top players assume each the top suppliers based

sdi will build line with their announced yearly expansion between 
contrast for the rest the players assume only expansion for each 
via new factory build addition the capacity added the new factory think 
there are annual improvements per production line thanks the enhancement the 
energy density and manufacturing efficiency which result additional capacity new 
factories post well the production lines that are operation before 
thus believe there will total additional battery supply 
the market per year between and under this scenario the capacity target 
set battery makers for will reached and the 
global supply will reach compared our battery demand model 
the trajectory the capacity utilization rate now becomes more curved and hits 
bottom under the slow adoption scenario and under the rapidadoption scenario see exhibit exhibit 
consolidation scenario here expect see capacity expansion from total 
players current and under the post consolidation scenario the top

china market despite the huge capacity build looking scary believe that the market 
will consolidate the future and demand will flow companies that not only have scale 
but also have higher quality leading chemistry and cost competitiveness developed from 
years experience particularly industry leaders catl and byd combining battery

starting from lots chinese players have announced the expansion plan for wet 
separators while the quality and production yield still needs improved terms the 
manufacturing process the biggest difference between dry and wet separators that the 
polymer wet separators needs solvent create pores whereas the pores dry 
separators are opened physically stretching the stretching the wet type always 
biaxial could stretched synchronously asynchronously depending the designed 
function whereas the dry type could extracted uniaxially biaxially depending the 
product type

the biggest advantages for wet separators are that they could very thin micron 
micron for the dry type and still maintain their tensile strength addition the pore 
distribution more consistent which helps even the current density distribution 
contrast the advantages for dry separators are that they have higher shutdown 
temperature and lower manufacturing cost well being environmental 
friendly solvents needed general wet separators are preferred for batteries

copper foil one the key components for lithium ion batteries and used the current 
collector for anodes comprising the bill materials the cell level quality 
copper foil critical energy density given that thinner copper foils allow more space for 
active material and the foil ability withstand high temperature and pressure arising from 
high nickel content going forward given that copper foils are typically shipped rolls quality control maintain consistency throughout the entire roll presents

demand growth were look more like the rapid growth scenario would expect 
significantly higher capex requirement with requiring capex per annum 
meet additional demand and this increasing the challenges here lie the rate 
growth capex required three year lag between capital spending decisions and 
production the risk involved ramping production based rapidly increasing expected 
demand and the size investment required from onward company with the same 
current asset base umicore would need built annually this situation the medium

raw material bottlenecks the 
supply chain 
overview 
raw material requirements for the revolution this chapter turn the subject 
the raw material requirements for the electric vehicle revolution with refreshed electric 
vehicle adoption scenarios and battery chemistry mix scenarios from our global energy 
storage and electric vehicles team examine the potential upstream implications 
those scenarios 
not just about potential demand impact geological and financial constraints are vitally 
important compared with current demand levels the biggest potential demand uplift from 
electric vehicles appears the lithium market but what people miss that big potential 
demand uplift not necessarily sufficient itself justify sustained higher prices when 
comes the availability tonnes the ground copper nickel and cobalt that have 
the shortest reserve lives out the key electric vehicle battery metals and based 
bernstein new government target scenario the cumulative metal required out 
for electric vehicles significantly greater than the current reserve base for these three 
metals this not the case for lithium the financial side meanwhile nickel and 
copper that will require far the most capital investment order supply the required 
material for electric vehicle growth 
nickel and cobalt offer largest potential price upside though the upside available copper 
less dependent the adoption scenario our conclusion from this latest analysis 
that see nickel and cobalt having the biggest potential upside current market 
prices and respectively the government target scenario but the impact 
and would lower the battery industry can move more aggressive 
chemistry mix outline later this chapter however the upside for copper remains 
significant indeed upside our government target scenario and the 
slow adoption scenario and far can see the range potential price outcomes 
much narrower such see copper offering consistent upside almost regardless 
the electric vehicle pathway that materializes this course speaks ivanhoe first 
quantum and antofagasta the best ways gain exposure copper outside glencore 
which itself provides unique combination exposure copper nickel and cobalt 
regardless the scenario meanwhile still see current lithium prices very high 
other words these price levels are excess those that would see being required 
deliver the supply needed under any scenario 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
malthusian resource constraints growth 
the issue potential raw material bottlenecks one that clearly significant concern 
both investors and industry participants one the questions get asked time and again 
whether there enough cobalt copper lithium whatever enable the mass 
adoption electric vehicles whether there some kind malthusian constraint our 
ability deliver this however these kinds concerns are not new raw material supply 
forms the basis all economic activity and there have been perennial concerns about the 
potential limits supply perhaps the most famous modern expression this theme 
occurred the period immediately post the oil shocks the with the founding 
the club rome and the widespread diffusion the ideas inspired the limits 
growth however with the original club rome analysis clear from the way the 
question cast that there widespread confusion about the difference between reserves 
resources and underlying material endowment the most basic level the total metal 
available for human use the earth crust essentially inexhaustible and many multiples 
any currently conceivable human need know how mine prodigious depths 
below the earth surface for precious metals and can extend that process almost any 
metal moreover the vast resources the ocean floor contain huge amounts metal that 
are yet untapped given the current state technology there physical impediment 
any growth trajectory and this extends across electric vehicles renewable energy any 
other economic good that may wish pursue the reserve base for any commodity 
contrast and the ultimate analysis simply the very limited portion the total 
mineralogical endowment offer that society has chosen develop the fact that this 
choice indirect one transmitted via risk discounted forward commodity price 
expectations does not take away from the fact that social rather than physical limit 
growth 
way example what mean this one estimate the total copper existing 
average crustal abundance billion tonnes which would sufficient for 
million years consumption current rates but well before get anywhere near 
million years production would have built every conceivable copper containing good 
and the commodity accumulative phase economic development would distant 
memory however not the absolute endowment that important with respect the 
commodity price environment but rather the distribution that endowment easily 
accessible concentrations reserve not fixed geological formation instead where 
geology and economics intersect far cost effective method has ever been 
discovered for copper extraction from silicates which correspond the majority the 
world copper endowment but copper were order magnitude more expensive this 
would different story 
course there are those that positively revel the pessimistic world view the club 
rome and promote kind militant and quasi soteriological environmentalism 
they conclude that malthusian world resource constraints incompatible with 
population growth and egalitarian distribution wealth other words those lucky 
enough enjoy wealth which after all simply the consequence previous commodity 
accumulation today will continue but everyone else will simply have suffer 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
silence fundamentally disagree with such conclusion there are physical limits 
growth there more than enough capital the world deliver whatever future like 
the entire future population the planet can enjoy whatever standard living they 
choose the only limit growth limit our own making arising out the choices that 
make regarding the activities choose prioritize and reward the misvaluation 
both the world natural resources and those agents that are capable the only real 
wealth creation opposed transformation the economy that are the barriers 
growth not the world natural resources choose value commodities correctly and 
choose reward those agents that are engaged their development then the 
availability the raw materials need support whatever future wish conceive 
essentially unlimited however continuing value certain fundamentally redistributive 
activities far more highly than those sectors the economy mining that are essentially 
productive creates self imposed barriers economic growth what this work highlights 
not that there are limits growth but that real economic choices must made 
might interesting recall the words tawney discussing the consumptive 
choices the world the 
this leads the mis direction production part the goods which are annually 
produced and which are called wealth strictly speaking waste because consists 
articles which either should not have been produced until other articles had already been 
produced sufficient abundance should not have been produced all and some part 
the population employed making goods which man can make with happiness 
indeed without loss self respect because knows that they had much better not 
made and that his life wasted making them long minority has large income 
that part spent all must spent trivialities long will part the human energy 
and mechanical equipment the nation diverted from serious work which enriches 
making trivialities which impoverishes 
against this backdrop that reflect the relative valuations facebook 
and rio tinto are always tempted recast another one 
tawney more famous comments and assert that for long facebook worth 
anything the miners are worth more the reality that there isn now any fundamental 
physical constraint growth and wealth creation that cannot overcome the correct 
financial choices made society which assets society chooses value and which 
does not and where accordingly will direct the flows capital the supply raw 
materials for electric vehicles will imply higher prices for certain commodities but the 
pursuit this technology genuine good then that will small price pay simply 
question recognizing which the items choose value today are genuine goods 
and which are not robert skidelsky has commented the difference between genuine 
economic needs and those items that merely want below 
last but not least modern economics has dispensed with the central concept use value 
for aristotle saw the use value object its particular contribution the good 
life wine for instance enhances food and friendship both central human goods 
therefore has use value whereas crack cocaine which enhances neither food nor 
friendship nor any other good thing does not that prefer crack wine does not alter this 
fact simply shows have corrupt taste 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
malthus and the sharing economy 
also worth highlighting the latest and potentially most insidious version the same 
old malthusian world view that has emerged under the seemingly innocuous banner the 
sharing economy under this regime the total stock any particular good this case 
the stock passenger cars can decline dramatically and instead owning car people 
will apparently happy have the services that car ownership supposed provide 
delivered them via increased utilization lower stock goods the fact that such 
increase utilization can delivered via the use social media and phone apps only 
increases the supposed allure what being proposed the reality such world view 
however nothing more than the same old malthusianism recast with supposedly 
egalitarian gloss designed appeal millennial generation that apparently unable 
differentiate between the reality and the appearance wealth there nothing 
egalitarian about aggregate reduction wealth the reduction the stock physical 
goods that the sharing economy supposed precipitate nothing more than cover 
for reduction wealth the argument can applied any good service with equal 
impunity rather than owning car people will content own part car rather than 
owning house people will content play the perennial student and share only own 
part house which equivalent simply owning smaller house rather than actually 
owning direct share the stock goods economy people will apparently happy 
dispossessed and have the services they need meted out them from the largesse 
those that own these goods short the sharing economy beloved tony seba 
and his ilk less about trying create wealth which hard than about redistributing 
the claims ever diminishing pool assets course also all but inevitable that 
any contraction the stock material wealth were occur would not take place via 
the surrendering incumbent claims that wealth consequently such reduction the 
stock any physical good car otherwise would inevitably translate itself into 
marked increase inequality economic activity then ceases about productivity and 
instead becomes means social control 
however such outcome entirely avoidable there absolutely physical reason why 
both absolute wealth the stock goods this case cars cannot continue grow 
the same time that the form those goods changes 
clearly not issue whether can afford the raw materials that need 
deliver electric vehicles the channeling capital into activities that the words 
tawney should not have been produced until other articles had already been produced 
sufficient abundance should not have been produced all proves the lack any 
financial constraint the existence the caterpillar meanwhile proves the lack any 
physical constraint all that lacking the correct connection between these two 
elements the productive system 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
electric vehicle scenarios 
the three bernstein scenarios are summarized again exhibit these show the 
absolute production figures and percentage penetration rates adoption scenario 
clearly the actual curve that will followed this technology controversial say 
the least hence seems make much more sense talk about the total stock evs 
that will present the economy rather than detail the infinite permutations which the 
actual construction that stock vehicles takes place this also convenient from the 
perspective the analysis raw materials the total quantity metal embedded the 
stock vehicles then directly comparable the total available reserve base metal 
from which ultimately that metal must derived also avoids having make any 
assumption about recycling rates and enables make analysis raw material 
constraints absent any view secondary supply after all before material can 
recycled should mined first course will also provide analysis the flow 
rather than stock implications each these penetration scenarios later the 
chapter when looking the annual supply demand balances for each commodity turn 
however the raw material analysis rendered far simpler move this stock based 
approach 
the total stock figures are shown exhibit way comparison show exhibit 
how the bernstein view stacks against the views some the others the 
market the differences between the positions must come down either slower ramp 
penetration rates potentially similar ramp ups but where the inflection point the 
curve occurs later than the bernstein analysis but whatever the explanation may 
clear that bernstein scenarios are decidedly more aggressive than the consensus 
expectation the same time also model change both the energy requirement per 
electric vehicle range power and performance improvements well the mix 
between pure battery evs and plug hybrids see exhibit and exhibit finally 
also model move the more aggressive cobalt lite technologies over time while keeping 
within the basic range battery chemistry types that see being achievable present 
see exhibit particular move rapidly toward nmc eight parts nickel one 
part manganese and one part cobalt the dominant technology electric vehicles 
course there are many voices that advocate much faster technological transition even 
lighter cobalt loadings and higher energy densities against that however are those that 
highlight that with nmc are reaching the theoretical limit how much cobalt you 
can remove without undermining the battery architecture completely nmc has the 
lowest proportion cobalt but also has downsides with hit safety and lifecycle the 
upsides include higher energy density and lower raw material input costs for the cathode 
due the replacement cobalt with nickel however the cost the delivered battery 
pack higher because the need for more sophisticated battery management system 
run the pack more advanced cooling systems more conservative depth discharge 
requirements etc essentially there cost performance trade off there decided 
tendency when discussing battery chemistry see the words technology and magic 
the only complicating feature however that the stock analysis requires that the average life any asset known here 
have assumed that each lasted exactly years could course refine this but would make very little difference 
the conclusions presented here 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
interchangeable least far the semantic content any proposition concerned 
need very careful that not simply magic away any possible challenge 
electric vehicle adoption invoking the specter technology explain away what would 
otherwise legitimate limits what actually possible 
this regard interesting hear umicore chief executive marc grynberg discuss some 
these issues when told briefing that while the technology was evolving toward 
higher nickel loadings was not possible design cobalt out batteries 
you increase the nickel proportion you reduce the stability the battery and has 
impact cycle life the ability charge fast cobalt the element that makes for the 
lack stability nickel there isn better element than nickel increase energy density 
and there isn better element than cobalt make the stuff stable while you hear about 
designing out cobalt this not going happen the next three decades simply doesn 
work 
nevertheless show scenarios later this chapter where the cobalt has been 
designed out batteries and large part the nickel well significantly before the 
three decade timeframe described grynberg

bernstein 
commercial production see exhibit the biggest change that have made 
result this new comparison reduce the overall copper intensity within the battery 
compared with our previous analysis however the copper the battery itself only one 
part the overall copper requirements for electric vehicles the impact this change 
relatively modest particularly when compared with some the other raw material changes 
that are associated with movements between the various battery chemistries 
understand the full impact the change evs might have the commodity markets 
must look beyond the battery itself electric vehicle replaces internal combustion 
engine with large copper wound motor has been mentioned many times variety 
commentators this motor really very simple piece equipment and dramatically 
reduces the number moving parts any car moreover the power the motor more 
less simple function its size which again more less function the amount 
copper contains for faster more powerful electric vehicles relatively trivial matter 
simply increase the size the motor see exhibit consequently see this 
very definite source upside for copper demand widespread adoption comes pass 
battery technology improves there reason why the desire for increased 
performance from the vehicle itself should not lead ever larger motors and ever greater 
demand for copper but addition the non battery copper contained electric 
vehicle there need for incremental copper charge this fleet electric vehicles and 
generate the additional electricity that will required discussed both these

financial constraints 
raw materials 
exhibit and exhibit show the illustrative economics associated with 
brownfield project designed accelerate the supply raw material there finite 
reserve life and fixed capital intensity for the expansion the choice whether expend 
capital double production and thereby halve the life the asset keep production 
flat what show exhibit the value the expansion decision under the 
assumption constant commodity price what clear that the value the expansion 
falls the reserve life declines depending the cost capital and the operational 
gearing the project the point which the decision expand longer makes sense lies 
somewhere the year range that point the time value accelerating 
production longer offsets the capital cost attempting and the project 
appears value destructive this means that when the reserve life any commodity falls 
below years becomes much harder expand production that commodity 
essence this implies that developing brownfield extensions deposits that have 
already identified becomes much much harder show the current reserve life for each 
relevant commodity exhibit another way make the same point ask what the 
incentive price would for such project rather than just asserting that the development 
value destructive once the life mine falls below certain critical threshold the point 
that this were the case then the market would move higher commodity price regime 
ensure that the required increase supply forthcoming course this price increase 
would also precipitate expansion the reserve base and increase exploration 
expenditure 
what this all points however that there temporal structure the price elasticity 
supply practice the development brownfield projects which are quicker execute 
and have lower capital intensity buys the industry time explore for find and develop new 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
greenfield projects but the mechanism which does through rising price 
environment the reserve life falls industry will move away from regime where 
the cash costs existing mines that determines appropriate price level and toward one 
where the fully loaded economic costs new greenfield expansion that does 
part this dynamic that gives rise the difference structural behavior already seen 
between the aluminum price and the copper price 
second way look this issue actually analyze the long run price elasticity each 
commodity see exhibit and exhibit course the trouble with this that the 
results are always dependent time and the desire use the same amount time for 
the analysis each commodity our analysis where use the same year window 
between and may run across the fact that each commodity has different 
capital cycle fixed window may capture the full cycle for one commodity but 
incomplete cycle for another thus the cyclical component the behavior may mask the 
structural price elasticity that are trying measure that may what see 
this analysis except for cobalt the same rank ordering would have been suggested 
the analysis the reserve life 
there also the issue the absolute magnitude capital that will required each 
these commodities while lithium has probably the strongest demand growth potential 
any material the fact remains that currently tiny market therefore remains 
highly vulnerable the price disruptive effects new capital inflows very small 
percentage swing the capital currently employed the mining industry from say iron 
ore lithium would result huge increase potential supply the growth rate for 
lithium high because the denominator the growth equation low and not because the 
numerator particularly impressive absolute terms can see this clearly exhibit 
and exhibit where show the absolute increase capital current capital 
intensities commodity exclude cobalt from this analysis because cobalt supply 
product metal depends the flow capital into either the copper nickel markets 
can seen the absolute requirement for capital increases into copper and nickel 
rather than any metal 
course the next question whether the capital flows are being directed the right way 
the market currently the way can measure this look the current irr new 
investment discounted the current spot price environment clearly capital will flow 
the commodity with the highest incremental return capital ought expect 
efficient capital markets direct capital flows where there the greatest absolute need 
for capital show this for copper nickel and lithium again bearing mind the byproduct nature cobalt mines exhibit exhibit what clear that the 
market discounting essentially impossible world view the market believes that there 
will the need for more lithium for evs appears reflect rapid adoption scenario 
for that metal but does not seem believe the same for either copper nickel 
perhaps put this more charitably issue with phasing demand the world needs 
more lithium now but the price incentive for copper and nickel will appear due course 
and what see the relative incremental irrs new investment another 
manifestation the different capital cycles across commodities discussed earlier 
would flag though the continued emergence projects the lithium industry that 
seemingly offer significant scale low initial capital cost and extremely high irrs even 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein

phenomenon comes from pilbara minerals and the recent release its pre feasibility study

that will need pulled out the ground and embedded the fleet vehicles the fact 
that this stock metal subsequently recycled secondary matter the fact that 
before can recycled must mined recycling can never create wealth all can 
slow the erosion that wealth while clear that the absolute demand increase for 
lithium relative our current consumption the metal shows the greatest percentage 
uplift see exhibit what really matters the stock metal embedded electric 
vehicles relative the total available reserves again worth emphasizing that just 
because the demand for metal over some horizon exceeds the total identified reserve 
does not mean that will run out that commodity what means that the reservoir 
low capital intensity easy projects particularly brownfield expansions likely far 
more limited where the reserve base stretched this will then drive lower trend 
medium term supply growth rate and will drive prices level sufficient increase the 
reserve base the more stretched the reserve base the higher the trend price level will 
need the medium term 
show the current state the reserve base for each the commodities turn and 
compare this with the total cumulative non demand and the total demand out over 
the next years based the government target scenario see exhibit exhibit

the full implications that run rate are not yet apparent that point also the point

still very small have normalization both penetration and fleet and this 
what matters from the perspective potential geological constraint see exhibit 
and exhibit clear from this analysis cobalt nickel and copper that the 
most significant structural challenges exist will require expansion the known 
reserves these metals meet demand for evs and this will only happen the price

cyclical considerations 
the preceding analysis the commodity bottlenecks was necessarily long term was 
concerned with the adequacy the current reserve base and the structure long term 
supply however the commodity price environment always one which there the 
interplay between two elements the cyclical and the structural the structural 
component itself function the interplay between geological deterioration and mining 
productivity for discussion see metals mining why isn the price copper 
overview the impact moore law mining 
global metals mining the end golden century growth the cyclical component 
driven the current supply demand balance and perceptions scarcity otherwise 
the market course not possible make any call the cyclical component 
commodity price environment absent view the structural direction prices any 
case 
the sections below look some the cyclical issues for each commodity well 
some the more idiosyncratic themes for each commodity industry 
copper 
have discussed several notes earlier the subject copper key component for 
the electric vehicle story and needed the largest amount per kwh for nmc cathode 
chemistries what more alluded earlier this chapter copper likely benefit 
from not only the electric vehicles themselves but also from the infrastructure required 
support them metals mining electric vehicles and the grid how much copper will 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
infrastructure need much greater extent than the other materials that are required 
the cathode chemistry alone such believe that copper the most important 
commodity for the electric vehicle investment theme and show our estimates the 
impact our various scenarios the copper market exhibit exhibit 
aside from this and discuss european metals mining reasons copper 
bull the supply side alone are particularly bullish copper from the supply side 
which see significantly challenged 
relative how much use copper geologically the scarcest industrial 
commodity naturally have mined the easy copper first because the most 
valuable the higher grade open pit copper the mining which was facilitated 
the productivity gains result initially the electrification mining from the early 
and then the scale revolution the has largely already been mined 
now grades are declining and copper mines are getting deeper and older think 
chiquicamata still one the world largest copper mines and over years old 
this clear upward pressure mining operating costs 
addition productivity gains have been stagnant trend sense since the end 
the sxew revolution the and there appears nothing that can change 
this 
meanwhile mining wage rates have increased dramatically consequence the 
cessation productivity gains and persistent labor unrest strikes across the industry 
continue lend upward pressure production costs 
are also finding less and less copper through exploration while finding that copper 
becoming more and more expensive 
when copper found ever more stringent environmental requirements are 
lengthening the time needed approve finance and execute mine construction 
indeed the set currently investable projects significantly more challenged than the one 
that existed pre supercycle pre china essence the low hanging fruit has been 
picked started with set possible projects developed the best ones and have failed 
adequately replenish that set via exploration are pains point out also that much 
this low hanging fruit was sanctioned when copper prices were much higher than their 
current levels notwithstanding the price recovery that have seen over the past couple 
years such with drastically lower copper prices and only higher cost development 
options left there only one way that rates return incremental investment have 
moved over the last several years down what are left turn terms future 
copper supply represents three way trade off between geology capital and political 
risk all these options however entail increased future costs and whether those 
increased costs manifest themselves the form higher capital intensity increased 
upfront cost higher production costs increased operating costs over the life 
mine indeed both the conclusion the same much higher future copper price 
required order generate the sort margins needed facilitate the investment 
decisions that need approved order meet future copper demand and clear 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
these investment decisions are not approved the natural depletion rate the industry 
will likely see copper production fall not stand still indeed wrote exactly this point 
metals mining copper gold not production wall production cliff charts 
and given the dearth project approvals recent years expect the notional deficit 
really bite from onward 
what more our positive outlook the copper price not predicated any way solely 
the emergence incremental copper demand source the form global electric 
vehicle adoption contrary much market commentary that one might read see the 
copper demand fundamentals very robust indeed given the continuing twin 
processes industrialization and urbanization that remain drivers the global economy 
specifically china see the chinese capital stock still significantly less developed 
than that the western world and hence see continuing scope for demand growth 
there see our note global metals mining why china still needs lot more copper 
two charts not just about china however global level numerous major and 
independent studies have highlighted the global need for significant increases 
infrastructure investment including the western world and this consistent with our 
view that there not only ample scope for continued metal and specifically course 
copper demand growth china and the developing world but also need for recovery 
final metal the west based various estimates how much metal entailed 
infrastructure investment currently have estimated the metal consumption uplift 
implied various infrastructure investment scenarios which are proposed major 
studies global infrastructure see that copper that stands benefit most with 
average increase demand implied being required for incremental 
investment global infrastructure the other end the spectrum nickel with stillsizeable implied demand uplift zinc steel iron ore and aluminum sit within this range 
can quibble about infrastructure definitions the precision estimates for current metal 
consumption infrastructure the types infrastructure required and which parts the 
world etc but the point emphasize here that the world requires marked acceleration 
infrastructure investment this turn implies significant increase the demand for 
raw materials well the same time the economic multiplier effect investment 
infrastructure will catalyze demand growth outside direct expenditure infrastructure 
and leads more metal demand the notion that are peak metal demand 
incompatible with population growth urbanization and the need accelerate infrastructure 
investment and every major study have seen indicates that more not less required 
see our note metals mining defence the old economy the need for infrastructure 
investment power economic growth for more detail 
much like the iron ore market the realization that had not fact seen the end 
chinese demand growth for these commodities underpinned the continued 
improvement the underlying chinese economy formed the backdrop for higher copper 
prices total copper consumption china looks have increased yoy 
chinese economic growth was stronger than expected and copper prices rose 
across the year from the beginning just below 
while the average price for the time writing was higher than that seen 
increased optimism around the electric vehicle story 
also believe helped boost sentiment toward the metal with knock effect for 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
prices would admit that the expectation that the dollar will strengthen the back 
interest rate rises the could provide potential price headwind the coming years 
but general believe that commodity market fundamentals provide sufficient reason 
continue with our bullish copper outlook 
after the first fall mined copper output for many years likely that output will 
return positive growth and the final wave projects that were 
approved toward the end the last upcycle hit the market these include toquepala 
escondida the kamoto kov restart mopani and cobre panama toward the end that 
period despite this wood mackenzie now even expects market deficits for the next two 
years and given the dearth project approvals recent years expect the notional 
deficit really bite from onward for particular substantial number 
labor contracts are due for renewal peru and chile and the potential for strike related 
production disruptions could even higher than any normal year 
the demand side the global economy surprised the upside for and looks set 
have ended the year good shape november morgan ihs markit global 
manufacturing pmi hit for example its highest level for two and half years the 
absence another policy misstep from the chinese government such 
expect chinese demand growth remain steady for the next couple years there could 
also moderate bump for chinese refined consumption result the chinese policy 
changes relating scrap imports part these come the form the environmental 
protection theme feeding through from the steel and coal industries into the chinese 
copper smelting industries efforts control pollution are emerging through plans set 
the maximum acceptable threshold hazardous elements for copper scrap imports 
rather than currently and compared the originally proposed the changes 
ahead currently described this could cause disruption the flow copper scrap 
into china scrap generated mature economies would need elsewhere least 
initially while chinese consumers may need look for alternative options that would 
include importing more concentrates and refined copper meanwhile reported further

nickel 
when comes nickel the supply side picture complicated extent the fact that 
the main feed for electric vehicle battery cathode precursor materials not pure nickel 
metal but nickel sulphate essence made dissolving class nickel greater than 
purity nickel metal sulphuric acid and much fact the majority the global 
nickel production base unsuitable for this purpose 
class nickel obtained via essentially just two routes first can obtained via the 
traditional exploitation sulfide ore bodies much the same way copper and this has 
been the mainstay historical nickel production until very recently the issue with this 
route that sulfide ore bodies globally are significantly exhausted exploration success has 
not been able replenish the stock investable new sulfide deposits and was this 
exhaustion that led the price point for nickel the early years the 
super cycle way illustration currently total nickel production and 
class nickel production comes from high grade sulfide deposits further 
class comes from low grade sulfide deposits and comes via the hpal route from 
limonitic laterites and yet high grade nickel sulfide deposits comprise just the future 
undeveloped resource base see exhibit the second way produce class nickel 
intermediate nickel products that would acceptable feedstock into the 
production batteries via the high pressure acid leaching hpal limonitic laterite 
oxide ore bodies 
lateritic nickel deposits have come the fore the last decade given the depletion the 
nickel sulfide deposits mentioned previously the laterites themselves are again divided 
roughly into two groups the limonites and the saprolites the difference coming down 
the fact that magnesia and silica levels are much higher the saprolites the limonites can 
exploited via the hpal route get class nickel intermediate nickel product 
the other hand the saprolites tend converted into ferro nickel nickel pig iron

which itself just low grade ferro nickel these ferro nickels and nickel pig irons 
that are unsuitable for use batteries the first instance because the high cost

significant technical issue for the battery maker first wrote about the issue our note

have issue that the base geology that generates the nickel units that feed the 
stainless steel market currently not configured supply the battery market however 
top this also have issue with the physical form the class nickel and indeed 
the fact that not all class nickel equal from contamination impurity perspective 
class nickels have four basic forms powders briquettes compressed powder 
pellets and cathode these only the first two varieties are readily amenable for 
conversion nickel sulphate both pellets and cathode can converted but the low 
surface area volume ratio means they both require treatment melting and 
atomization before they can become potential source nickel units and course this 
implies cost 
this weren enough issue there third complication there are currently 
consumers nickel that are far less sensitive the nickel price than battery makers and 
that require class nickel other words these agents will always pay more than battery 
makers for access the highest quality nickel units you are making high strength steel 
corrosion resistant alloy for the aerospace industry you need consistency and quality 
raw materials and yet the cost those raw materials the final product vanishingly 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
small far smaller than the raw material cost say battery hence these demand 
applications will always consume class nickel ahead the market course the 
conclusion that the generic stainless steel market must the end migrate completely 
the use feni and npi the base load feed stock liberate class nickel for use 
high value steels and the battery market but even here there wrinkle even move 
the base load stainless production ferro nickel there will still demand for some 
class nickel ensure that the overall nickel loadings are high enough effect some 
class nickel will always needed sweeten the ferro nickel allowing for these two 
factors becomes clear that only the nickel supply either acceptable 
available for the battery market even increase nickel supply from the feni npi 
sector allows for switch material currently being used the stainless steel industry 
the maximum that this would liberate few hundred thousand tonnes against 
potential demand few million tonnes see exhibit 
are clearly going need grow the output class nickel but this easy task 
the sulfide deposits are wasting assets with limited upside potential and any event the 
value maximizing course action for those possession these highly valuable assets 
thrift their output and take the price appreciation that inevitable the world tries 
bring more economically marginal units supply that leaves the hpal limonitic 
laterites yet there one area mining beyond all others that characterizes capital 
destruction these projects the capital costs for these mines can run much 
incremental capacity earn pretax roce the bare minimum 
suggest the nickel price would have the order 
compared today yet this what will required 
the nickel market remained buffeted political events and policy action two 
the most important countries for global nickel production indonesia and the philippines 
early the year prices came under pressure after indonesia rescinded its ban nickel 
ore exports after three years and this was closely followed the filipino department 
environment and natural resources denr recommending mines for suspension 
closure environmental grounds the first new ore export licenses for indonesian 
companies were released april and was around this time that some chinese npi 
facilities closed result pressure around excessive pollution and relatively weak 
stainless steel markets indeed this was repeated august september like 
copper the nickel market did receive boost over the second half the year interest 
and enthusiasm around electric vehicle developments took hold what more for nickel 
byd one the largest producers china clarified that all its new phevs would use 
nmc batteries opposed lfp lithium iron phosphate variants which hitherto had 
been the company preferred battery type this change direction was likely driven 
two factors government directive requiring batteries achieve energy density 
and subsidy scheme that rewards evs that can travel further without 
recharge both favor ncm batteries ahead lfp such all passenger cars produced 
byd from will use such batteries helping further push the global battery market 
toward the nickel rich nmc technologies

positively for the market also now seems there has been relatively significant 
movement terms the global nickel inventory overhang which has been hampering 
prices for several years now particularly china believe that the nickel market now 
stands interesting point its development have long suspected that there may 
need split the global nickel market between traditional demand for nickel metal 
for the stainless steel market and the emerging demand for nickel chemicals for the 
nascent battery market anything that potential bifurcation may have been brought 
closer reality the surge activity around electric vehicles this year discontent among 
specialist suppliers and consumers nickel based chemicals centers around their feeling 
that the current lme contract does not reflect the recent surge demand for and interest 
their products particularly from the battery and plating segments interestingly the lme

cobalt 
our recent work cobalt see european metals mining what price will take grow 
cobalt supply why have found cobalt supply tricky and our blackbook 
considering the cobalt conundrum highlighted just how difficult believe will 
generate the cobalt units required for any kind significant move toward electric 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
vehicles indeed from our perspective cobalt availability looks set significant barrier 
the greenification the global economy general under current technological 
circumstances and capabilities 
such either need find and develop lot more cobalt and this will only 
precipitated continued significant rise cobalt prices and likely copper and nickel 
prices well need develop new cobalt lite technologies particularly the 
battery segment absent either these two options can only see scenario where 
cobalt prices continue rise the point genuine and significant demand destruction 
view future prices however should certainly informed the historical context 
price supply and demand annual apparent cobalt demand increased from 
cagr and came from even lower base before that period 
this was essence function the rise consumer cobalt significant incremental 
demand source addition the industrial use superalloys hard materials etc 
this significant demand pull however had little impact prices structural sense 
notwithstanding the extreme price spike which saw 
repeated across the entire commodity space why was this believe there are specific 
reasons notably 
some that incremental demand was satisfied through drawdown the strategic 
stockpiles cobalt that had been accumulated the defense logistics agency 
dla the dla began sell these cobalt stocks and the authorization 
expired and 
significant portion the rest the incremental demand was satisfied return 
production the copper mines the drc copper production the drc vital 
source cobalt product have seen declined sharply the lead 
the first congo war which started and only began recover when 
the first free presidential and parliamentary elections years were held the drc 
with joseph kabila eventually declared the winner the rapid recovery copper 
production thereafter was more less contemporaneous with the rise consumer 
electronics powered with lithium ion batteries and helped significantly satisfying 
this growing demand 
such have good reason believe that the conditions under which the last significant 
incremental demand pull took place are fundamentally different from those under which 
the electric revolution demand pull set take place have highlighted our work 
these supply growth freebies are simply not available present and this the face 
what could potentially much much greater growth demand than witnessed with 
the rise the first consumer cobalt 
cobalt unique its supply side issues over half cobalt production comes from the 
politically challenging drc while cobalt status product metal from copper and 
nickel mining makes the economics developing new cobalt containing projects they 
pertain specifically cobalt much trickier than primary metals typically either much 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
higher cobalt price required make mine economic the basis cobalt alone the 
cobalt price irrelevant altogether the mining decision 
our view therefore are likely see sustained period cobalt prices excess 
the last peak order facilitate the necessary exploration for 
and development incremental cobalt projects that will required satisfy this latest 
and indeed most significant demand pull the history the cobalt industry course 
recent policy events the drc regarding the new mining charter simply add further 
complexity and uncertainty regarding the incremental development cobalt resources 
the country something which could well lead further upward pressure prices

commodity price implications 
this section our analysis convert all this into determinate commodity price 
forecast that enables understand how different scenarios whether terms 
chemistry evolution penetration rates etc are likely impact different commodity 
prices clearly some commodities such lithium and cobalt are now already feeling the

between the commodity price environment and the fundamentals the narrative

framework for 
analyzing price impact 
over the past few years have explored fundamentally new approach commodity 
price forecasting one not based disconnected forecasts supply and demand 
the marginal costs production project pipeline incentive prices isolation but 
what see equilibrium fair commodity prices toward which commodity prices 
must converge irrespective the short term behavioral biases industry management 
broadly speaking our approach has been based growing belief that commodity 
industry equilibrium the extent that the prevailing price for that commodity such 
that the industry aggregate generates sufficient residual cash flow after paying its 
taxes and compensating its providers capital invest sufficient future supply 
order meet future demand requirements the simple schematic how see this 
working shown exhibit and outlined our approach this analysis these 
notes among others new approach commodity price forecasting why have 
remained commodity mining bulls and metals mining there such thing the fair

can see mining company paid price for each unit its produced commodity 
and uses that cash the following 
pay for the costs producing that unit 
pay governments for the privilege producing that unit and 
pay providers capital compensate them for the risk that they bear doing 
anything left available reinvested future growth the prevailing capital intensity 
investment for that commodity industry the time what mean capital intensity 
here course the cost incremental investment per tonne production such 
investment yields though yields ever with time lag 
based this were able invert the equations neo classical growth theory 
provide expression for the commodity price that must prevail support growth 
supply equal that demand and this turn provide genuine equilibrium commodity 
price condition see exhibit moreover this relationship preserves the insight which 
have pointed out many occasions that raw materials are durable goods the stock 
which proportional the level overall output with the constant proportionality 
being equivalent velocity term per the quantity theory money consequently 
acceleration deceleration growth that generates changes the commodity price 
environment and this turn explains the acute sensitivity commodities and hence the 
miners the prevailing macroeconomic climate 
however for our current purposes the critical point that have analytically rigorous 
way describing the structural commodity price environment that must prevail deliver 
the acceleration supply needed meet the emergence electric vehicles clear that 
this expression forward looking sense relates growth expectations price 
expectations useful backtesting our analysis look the demand growth rate 
that the market appeared discount the commodity price deck our formalism 
correct and compare that with the prevailing broader growth climate that point 
time the assumption here that the strongest component any forward growth rate 
expectation the current growth environment and that this there ought 
statistically valid connection between the growth rate discounted commodity prices and 
the prevailing macroeconomic climate exhibit perform just such backtesting 
which corroborates almost perfectly the insight the pricing methodology consequently 
feel more than comfortable with using this approach help inform the current 
discussion

cobalt lithium looks

way example show the results this methodology applied the copper price for 
the three different growth scenarios have considered this chapter and base 
case copper price assuming zero growth evs exhibit then repeat this 
analysis for all the major commodities and show the results exhibit exhibit 
comparing the spot price environment that which must prevail generate the supply 
raw materials required for each scenario the summary all this shown exhibit 
and exhibit the conclusions this analysis are clear 
raw material bottlenecks the supply chain 
bernstein 
lithium has only downside price risk regardless the scenario still see current 
lithium prices very high 
copper has the best risk reward trade off the copper price upside limited but 
the downside the range possible price outcomes for copper the narrowest and 
the same time seems one the materials that hard simply engineer out 
the narrative 
nickel has the biggest upside from here clearly the issue class class and 
the inventory overhang make this more complicated narrative than for some 
commodities but the magnitude the upside here very significant indeed 
moreover this should force rethink the view that simply dropping cobalt favor 
nickel rich chemistries batteries such obviously good strategy only 
appears because the currently anomalous nickel cobalt price ratio increasing 
nickel loading can have dramatic effect the nickel price clear that most 
battery makers have never lived through nickel price cycle 
cobalt still has upside potential but the range outcomes very wide rather 
obviously this consequence the product nature cobalt when demand for 
cobalt low and the supply being generated project that economically viable 
the primary metal then the implication that can have negative cobalt price 
the extent that cobalt itself required deliver growth investment then 
significantly higher cobalt price than even the current spot price required our 
analysis have assumed that the marginal units cobalt supply come from 
australian nickel laterites course reality the cobalt price will not negative 
but will set floor the price required the base load supply from the congo 
which estimate the order 
course should flag that these prices represent the average price level that required 
grow the commodity output the rate required each scenario there always 
cyclical element any commodity price and just because there fair value does not 
mean that there cannot deviations away from this level for potentially protracted periods 
time see such situation the moment with the cyclically low nickel price and high

good gets 
course the prices shown the previous exhibits suggest significant upside for nickel 
and continuation high cobalt price environment the offset that lithium prices ought 
abate however the result shows the outcome the scenarios that have chosen 
model the question whether there better possible outcome can create 
optimum scenario that meets the required growth objectives while minimizing the raw 
material cost doing that what attempt illustrate this section this 
consider the ability flex the loading cobalt and nickel within the basic nmc chemistry 
the nickel and cobalt position that the most challenging from raw material 
perspective take generic nmc style chemistry and energy density and allow 
variation the nickel cobalt ratio but fix the sum these two metals kwh 
begin with show that with current technology nmc really impossible 
deliver the high penetration rates use this analysis staying nmc would 
require cobalt price turn this would simply make evs far too expensive 
ever mass consumer good see exhibit the point that are already sitting 
with cobalt price and are nowhere near the penetration rates for evs that 
use this analysis demand accelerates and cobalt loadings not fall the cobalt 
price will very quickly move the regime demand destruction make evs 
impossibility 
however this analysis enables calculate the minimum cost battery chemistry 
changing the cobalt nickel ratio the nickel ratio rises does the nickel price but the 
drop the cobalt price more than offsets this however the cobalt ratio drops too low 
the nickel price increases unacceptable levels and course there sense that 
nickel already unacceptable show this optimized scenario exhibit 
and show that nmc required deliver the overall lowest battery raw material 
cost but note that this analysis ignores the fact that dropping the cobalt ratio has 
significant effect battery stability and even theoretically possible and have heard 
doubts expressed about this would require the cost more sophisticated battery 
management system deal with the drop stability adding this bms cost would favor 
higher cobalt loadings and would inevitably push the total raw material cost 
notwithstanding this can move this idealized nmc without any additional 
bms cost should enable the overall raw material costs stay level only modestly 
higher than that for nmc today spot prices course the overall level raw 
material cost increases seen battery makers the medium term will depend how 
quickly can move this new technology the interim both nickel and cobalt prices 
will likely continue put significant pressure raw material costs partially offset 
falling lithium price course there are other battery technologies outside the nmc 
variety the impact these raw material demand reduction and hence the price 
level could well significant 
the discussion nmc convenient entry point the final section this chapter

what if 
this section also run scenario where technology rapidly evolves obviate the need 
for raw materials batteries under this scenario have the following chemistry mix and 
material intensity assumptions see exhibit and exhibit hypothesi raw 
materials are not required for electric vehicles then the implication not needing them 
that demand for them will lower unsurprisingly this what see exhibit 
exhibit likewise the total amount capital required the mining industry would 
lower see exhibit and exhibit 
naturally this lower metal intensity feeds through into the commodity price deck required 
deliver the supply need show our estimated price outcome for this more 
aggressive chemistry evolution exhibit exhibit given that the entire thrust 
the new chemistry eliminate those metals that might otherwise present challenge 
the realization the rapid adoption evs cobalt and nickel unsurprising see 
those metals experience the greatest hit terms long term pricing from this change 
show the percentage change the base case battery chemistry mix scenario exhibit 
the metal that seems least affected the change chemistry mix copper 
which gives yet another reason why this metal one our preferred ways play the 
theme the potential upside lower for copper than for some metals but the same time 
believe that the price volatility lower and the risks being eliminated via innovations 
battery chemistry are much smaller show the precise upside downside potential 
current spot prices under this battery chemistry mix scenario exhibit meanwhile 
show the full price estimate breakdown commodity and penetration scenario for this 
battery chemistry mix exhibit exhibit 
would however stress the same point that made the start this chapter with 
respect technological innovation there decided tendency when discussing battery 
chemistry see the words technology and magic interchangeable least far 
the semantic content any proposition concerned need very careful that 
not simply magicking away any possible challenge electric vehicle adoption 
invoking the specter technology explain what would otherwise legitimate limits 
what actually possible therefore once more flag the comments made umicore 
chief executive marc grynberg 
you increase the nickel proportion you reduce the stability the battery and has 
impact cycle life the ability charge fast cobalt the element that makes for the 
lack stability nickel there isn better element than nickel increase energy density

our latest analysis presented this chapter see cobalt and nickel having the 
biggest potential upside current market prices however the upside for copper remains 
very significant indeed upside our government target scenario and the

well developed fast charging network but with limited incentives for evs shows 
that the presence charging network alone does not encourage deployment 
norway the other hand has strong fiscal and other incentives which have led strong 
uptake 
the stand alone commercial case for investments charging infrastructure the early 
stages deployment weak due low utilization see exhibit however 
penetration and speed charging improves utilization rates will increase improving 
commercial attractiveness further also possible price differentially for fast 
charging recover the higher capital cost fast charging stations only the initial 
stages that some form government subsidies oem support required 
quantum investments charging infrastructure based the deployment evs across 
europe reaching new car sales the government target scenario 
estimate that investments will need made the public charging 
infrastructure and additional the connecting grid infrastructure the 
implied annual investment only the current annual capex transmission and 
distribution and the annual transportation capex europe 
grid bottlenecks peak demand issues can minimized smart charging adopted 
penetration european local distribution grids will need investments 
equivalent increase from current capex levels may not 
necessary start spending much this before the early mid given lower 
penetration levels until then see curve based adoption while electricity 
demand the end state can higher than today due penetration

another survey ovo found that the top adoption deterrents cited customers included the lack

will there enough charging infrastructure and what evs mean for utilities 
bernstein 
this further explained the following case studies from estonia and norway 
estonia estonia built nationwide fast charging network consisting 
chademo standard fast chargers which were deployed early the charging 
stations were installed all urbanized areas with more than inhabitants and 
the main roads maintaining minimum distance between charging 
points the fast charging network was part deal between the estonian 
government and mitsubishi mitsubishi acquired the rights buy unused emission 
quotas million tons and exchange provided the country with mievs 
after the initial vehicles were deployed sales slowed down and with only 
evs today there massive underutilization the installed charging network 
with ratio just cars per fast charging station the reason sales have not 
picked after despite the charging infrastructure that there are fiscal 
other incentives help drive sales 
norway the experience from norway the most advanced european market for evs 
where evs account for new car sales considerably higher than the share 
and stock which total passenger cars considerably higher than 
the share just shows that high number fast slow chargers per car 
not strong factor explaining the differences uptake the higher adoption 
evs certain regions even within norway better explained the presence 
local incentives like exemption from toll roads and access bus lanes neighboring 
denmark which has well developed charging network incentives are lower 
uptake lower this implies that the starting phases adoption other 
incentives are far more important than the charging infrastructure nevertheless 
adoption becomes widespread important address the lack public

the impact penetration peak demand opposed average total demand 
would depend entirely how smooth home charging behavior through the day athome charging spread throughout the day would see similar level increase 
peak load however the charging concentrated along current peak times would 
see disproportionate increase the peak load the charging was restricted off peak 
times would see very little increase peak demand terms charging work 
public charging stations would expect fairly uniform and therefore less 
relevant peak demand implications 
first just like with overall power demand peak demand has fallen from peak 
drop the last years there definitely some 
slack the transmission and distribution system tolerate increase the peak 
demand 
second peak demand impact largely driven charging behavior users and smart 
charging offers solution recent trial calculated that uncontrolled charging

have real life data from california where there prevalence evs california 
accounts for sales the and the presence time use pricing which

from california utilities shows that customers time use pricing consistently 
consume far lower percentage their electricity during peak hours compared 
standard residential customers customers with separate meters for their evs only 
consume energy during peak periods regular customers consume

charging 
charging increases household electricity demand average and 
peak times without smart charging and can place stress the capacity cables 
and transformers and other critical parameters such maintaining the frequency and 
proper voltage these limitations can cause critical failures but can resolved 
investing sufficient capacity the grid 
the impact the local grid complex predict and depends number variables 
such the level penetration evs time charging speed charging location the 
the grid impacts voltage existing capacity redundancy the grid cables and 
transformer capacity and network topology length and number customers each

reinforcement assuming users charge per their convenience real world trial the 
showed that the event uncontrolled charging when customers have 
evs low voltage circuits will need reinforcing iberdrola its recent capital 
markets day break out session suggested that total penetration 
reinforcement was required putting all this together reinforcement likely only when 
penetration greater than markets with developed grid infrastructure like 
western europe and the 
the actual experience california consistent with the assertion that grid stability issues 
are not relevant early stages deployment over the past five years california less

cost per customer would per annum fund this reinforcement with smart 
charging the capex spend drops increase the current level 
capex spend per annum and per customer according iberdrola doesn see any

our curve european modeling discussed the previous section 
scaling iberdrola capex estimates accommodate scenario

costly grid upgrades and investments peaking capacity order incentivize smart 
charging minimum smart meter rollout being pursued most european countries

utilities can participate number ways through the revolution 
charging infrastructure most large european utilities have ventured into the 
infrastructure space see exhibit the main value pools the charging 
infrastructure are services back end connection billing fleet management 
etc and electricity sales see exhibit 
number utilities are developing charging infrastructure commercially and are 
competing with independent charging network operators and oil gas players who 
now plan install charging petrol forecourts etc explained earlier unless 
subsidized initially this currently not profitable proposition merely through the 
sale electricity alone therefore the near term upside from developing charging 
infrastructure limited higher levels utilization the economics charging 
infrastructure will improve the best entry strategy focus markets with 
subsidies for infrastructure build out participate capital light manner where 
the asset owned another party for example the owner parking lot 
motorway service station innogy for instance notes see exhibit that the 
business case not attractive for dedicated charging stations and public parking 
charging starts make more sense for building charging infrastructure for semipublic customers such retailers malls installing wall boxes for residential 
customers see exhibit for european utilities such iberdrola and national 
grid which have presence electricity distribution the the charging 
infrastructure rollout the presents growth opportunity the extent that such 
investments can added the regulated asset base 
grid investments mostly utilities with electricity distribution networks enel 
innogy and sse our coverage will likely benefit from the incremental investments 
needed strengthen the grids well investments connect the fast charging 
stations however unless there rapid adoption evs immediately unlikely that 
grid reinforcements support home charging are required before the early

the oems claim they are now 
embracing evs but how serious 
are they 
overview 
time get message about evs the traditional oems have long been resistant evs 
but stung media and investor criticism tougher regulatory regimes collapse diesel 
demand and the case premium brands suffering damage from tesla many have now 
announced that they are fast tracking evs some have set volume targets such 
sales electric vehicles but are these real plans just high stakes 
campaigns 
behind the scenes the oems are very nervous about real demand all the premium brands 
will likely launch pure evs some mass market oems notably will also join 
the fray but there huge nervousness about the real prospects these cars the oems 
market research into demand far from encouraging consumer interest has been 
rising but consumer willingness pay premium and overcome charging issues still 
looks limited the brave and visionary foolhardy are following build and they will 
come strategy 
are going see oversupply many executives speak with are nervous 
about oversupply premium evs their research simply cannot identify the 
people who supposedly have paid deposit for tesla model there are two ways 
interpret this bulls will argue that tesla has found consumers that traditional oems can 
reach bears will argue that those promised car will not all 
materialize real buyers 
are they bluffing see evidence that traditional oems are much more cautious real 
demand than the headlines might suggest first capex for evs remains modest the 
oems are planning buy battery cells limit risk second investments charging 
infrastructure far remain minimal despite talk industry consortium third suppliers 
report most purchase orders are for hybrid plug tech rather than pure products 
the true chinese industry china officially half the global market but micro evs 
accounted for the growth driven government purchases meet 
official targets the oems face quotas starting but unclear whether there 
sufficient demand from real consumers expect real world issues cost range 
charging etc hold back consumer demand nearer term the meantime government 
purchases and heavy incentives from cities the state and oems may necessary 
drive growth 
the oems claim they are now embracing evs but how serious are they 
bernstein 
who best positioned see little differentiation battery tech cost between oems 
are right about uncertain uptake the best positioned are those with the greatest 
flexibility among the europeans daimler outperform and bmw appear taking 
lower risk approach than among the chinese saic looks best positioned while 
expect brilliance benefit from bmw technology most mass market oems are moving 
deliberately slowly the slower the ramp the better the margins for traditional oems 
traditional oems are still part the resistance 
evs 
traditional automakers have long been seen part the resistance evs along with 
big oil the koch brothers and other enemies progress many critics notably from 
the tech world have argued that traditional oems don get are dinosaurs will 
disrupted and wiped out new competition guess what this not view that the 
bernstein global autos team agrees with 
the oems resistance has some strong logic 
oems have not been resisting evs just because they are run old men who like the smell 
gasoline they have been resisting evs due fundamental concerns about their cost 
poor profitability and limited consumer appeal however their attitudes appear 
changing now they are seeing battery costs fall they are seeing tesla serve 
appealing product that winning plaudits they are facing endless media and 
investor criticism and perhaps more importantly they are seeing increasingly tough 
regulatory talk particularly diesel demand plummets europe the latest developments 
germany with the courts deciding that cities will likely need act ban diesels 
clearly intensify the problem 
consequently traditional oems appear have experienced almost religious conversion 
the last months after years cynicism and reluctance about electric vehicles many 
now claim embracing them most ceos have stood and said they believe 
electric future most automakers have made bold promises about new product plans but 
how serious are they about this move evs they mean what they say are they just 
playing lip service the media planning the minimum needed comply with future 
regulations and hoping evs remain niche product 
the reality varies across oems but behind the scenes many oems remain nervous about 
real demand concerned about costs and profitability unconvinced evs can work 
lower priced vehicle segments and expect combustion engines remain dominant for 
many years also remain unconvinced that demand will soar soon the impediments 
cost and usability remain formidable the future may well electric but expect 
progress slow would also highlight that the traditional oems expect hybrids and 
plug hybrids make much greater contributions fuel economy targets than 
pure evs 
electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
this chapter review the real outlook for demand the supply plans traditional 
oems the regulatory environment and the still formidable obstacles greater 
adoption and discuss whether traditional oems are serious about evs 
sales remain very modest this demand supply issue 
the hype around electric vehicles has reached fever pitch least the investment 
community one leaves rich city like london tesla and drives less wealthy area 
clear that few have any familiarity with electric vehicles rare see another electric 
car and people look shocked when you tell them the car you driving cost over 
but many the investment community argue that are near tipping point that 
costs are about plummet and demand going skyrocket 
seems cause upset point out that sales make just global volumes 
and that outside california london and norway sales are very limited evs 
were sold greece and were sold poland bulls argue that this backward looking 
that are early stage adoption and there supply issue there simply aren 
many evs available yet true that the offer about expand present consumers 
have only limited choice the main options being the renault zoe and other renault 
models nissan leaf chevrolet bolt bmw golf and and tesla models 
and addition various china only models but very few consumers are choosing these 
vehicles for all but tesla sales these products have fallen short the oems hopes 
seems that the cost and utility these vehicles are not convincing countries without 
heavy incentives such norway that situation and reality genuinely about 
change dramatically 
demand really that strong look tesla sales 
the optimists argue that demand accelerating and tipping point but this 
backed the evidence not really tesla has served extraordinarily complete 
product the model has been sale since and the model since tesla 
currently has rivals has market share the long range segment yet 
its volumes seem stagnant the last four quarters tesla sales have gone sideways 
stuck units per quarter see exhibit and exhibit fact with 
significant rise inventory which the company previously said wouldn hold tesla had 
cut production clear some accompanied price cuts perhaps 
consumers are waiting for the model german competitors products maybe the 
number people willing and able buy expensive long range proving finite 
learn more the next year the model and german competitor products come 
stream but for now not convinced that demand proving accelerating 
every other sale far has missed its sales target 
even lower price point segments demand not exactly soaring all renault nissan 
and bmw have upgraded the batteries their evs offer more range and continue

the residual value problem 
when get into the rather complicated subject total cost ownership quickly 
run into issues with residual values most cars are bought lease finance deals and 
these need assume residual value function the problem for evs they have the 
residual value easter egg may week old sandwich this may temporary 
used car buyers are less likely buy second third car have more issue with 
range less likely take risk new technology and worry more about battery life and 
obsolesce than new car buyer all these issues may overcome but currently residual 
values are much lower see exhibit killing the cost ownership you may ask what 
about tesla residuals these appear stronger far but tesla attempts control them 
managing their supply argue that tesla sitting fast growing inventory 
used cars that aren selling the used market the prices asked and has load more 
coming off lease soon with guaranteed residual prices that may prove challenging

research simply isn that encouraging these companies have very sophisticated market 
research organizations and they been tasked with figuring out how many evs they will 
able sell geography segment and customer demographic none

quote one senior engineering executive german carmaker spoke with last year 
can understand the claims tesla making about customer deposits for model these 
are not conventional premium car buyers our market research can find anything even close 
that number people interested electric car

they pay more for and they say err don know you ask them they 
understand has range and can used for their summer holiday skiing 
break that point you lose them they say think stick with conventional car thank 
you very much really not clear how many customers will actually step and buy these 
cars and worried all going end oversupplying the market 
quote daimler ceo dieter zetsche when asked him public what mercedes market 
research indicates about demand said 
too early say the feedback are getting from the market quite encouraging but 
just talking about dealer views this stage don yet know how the customers will 
react

positioned 
oems have not been resisting evs just because they are run old men who like the smell

resisting evs due fundamental concerns about their cost poor profitability and limited 
consumer appeal however their attitudes appear now changing they are seeing 
battery costs fall they are seeing tesla serve appealing product that winning 
plaudits they are facing endless media and investor criticism and perhaps more 
importantly they are seeing increasingly tough regulatory talk 
consequence traditional oems appear have experienced big shift view the 
last months after years cynicism and reluctance about electric vehicles many now 
claim embracing them most ceos have stood and said they believe electric 
vehicle future most automakers have made bold promises about new product plans 
everyone has made china the center their strategies but how serious are they about 
this move evs they mean what they say are they just playing lip service the

government buying the driver demand the decline government subsidies the 
coming years will ensure that the cost evs the consumer will remain largely 
unchanged even battery costs fall the government will continue tighten the screws 
further access restrictions major cities only allowing cars with odd evennumbered plates the roads certain days with evs being exempt and perhaps this 
will result some incremental adoption but history suggests that only new licenseplate restrictions major cities which the government loathes given the impact 
auto industry output are effective driving significant jumps adoption while access 
restrictions generally only result consumers buying more gasoline cars ultimately 
china has increase its sales from units million units 
implying cagr over the real question should whether the government and 
corporates and fleet operators like didi chuxing can increase from buying evs 
per annum buying significantly over million evs per annum 
the question what point the chinese government ability satisfy its own targets 
buying evs directly almost impossible answer something like million people 
employed the chinese public sector among the world largest but notably the 
ministry finance has increasingly pushed for lower spending subsidies they 
become increasingly unaffordable 
the oems claim they are now embracing evs but how serious are they

investment implications 
european autos there huge amount technological change swirling around the auto 
industry some going cost money and margin electric powertrains and some 
may eventually have profound implications for car ownership and industry structure 
autonomy but traditional oems are fully capable building evs and will respond 
market demand regulatory conditions require but the speed and extent the ramp 
sales are exaggerated many costs are still not competitive and utility and usability 
will likely continue lag combustion engine cars regulatory guidelines are broadly 
technology agnostic and point toward hybrids and plug hybrids much bigger part 
the fleet than for least the next decade 
intense fears about the costs new technology help explain why these stocks are such 
low multiples but can the industry manage its way through these challenges and surprise 
investors continuing grind out the results believe probably can believe 
near term prospects for most oems and suppliers within our coverage look reasonably 
solid also believe that the industry has improved its capital discipline lowered its

what bottlenecks mean for 
tesla and byd 
overview 
far this blackbook have identified two potential bottlenecks mass adoption 
the coming decade supply demand imbalance for key battery commodities such 
nickel cobalt and copper resulting substantially higher prices and supply demand 
imbalance battery production manifesting itself battery shortage the mid 
but how will these bottlenecks impact electric vehicle oems such tesla and byd 
well the nascent market whole 
suspect the impact will small while bottlenecks could incrementally negative 
adoption creating investment opportunities throughout the value chain the 
investment theses for tesla and byd will likely remain unchanged the downside these 
companies may even outweighed the fact that bottlenecks could strengthen the two 
companies competitive advantages relative basis 
for instance believe bottleneck battery commodities would only modest but 
surmountable headwind the electric vehicle industry and perhaps relative positive 
for tesla which has better pricing power than competitors note that the actual cost 
impact per vehicle would not particularly high our analysis implies worst case cost 
increase kwh for tesla batteries and kwh for nmc batteries 
per car 
similarly view bottlenecks battery production another small but surmountable 
hurdle for the electric vehicle industry and potentially relative positive for tesla and byd 
each which controls its own battery production moreover suspect that the timeline 
for the bottleneck mid outside most investors time horizons 
our conclusions particularly resonate for tesla market bottlenecks aren going make 
break the company instead see the company itself its own greatest bottleneck 
can tesla really execute its ambitions the company long term future 
precipitated successful near term rollout its model but remain skeptical about 
the company ability make the car profitably deliver good initial build quality and 
ramp production quickly tesla cannot chart plausible path profitability and 
sustainable cash flows with the model then investors may balk providing further 
liquidity going forward and tesla capital needs remain enormous achieve its own 
long term revenue projections tesla would have spend nearly capex 
build battery capacity and tooling for over million vehicles 
what bottlenecks mean for tesla and byd 
bernstein 
market bottlenecks are likely not issue 
commodity bottleneck 
bottleneck battery commodities would likely modest but surmountable headwind 
the electric vehicle industry and perhaps relative positive for tesla which has 
unparalleled brand and better pricing power than competitors note that the actual cost 
impact per vehicle from surge commodity prices not particularly high our analysis 
implies worst case cost increase kwh for tesla batteries and kwh for 
nmc batteries suggesting cost increase per car 
estimate that battery pack costs have recently fallen kwh for tesla and 
kwh for byd within this kwh figure calculate that metals such 
nickel cobalt copper and lithium account for kwh the cost for tesla nca 
nickel cobalt aluminum batteries and kwh the cost for byd nmc 
batteries see exhibit these raw material costs are already kwh higher 
than year ago largely due spiking lithium and cobalt prices however this does not 
appear have meaningfully slowed the pace cost declines during which both 
tesla and byd saw estimated kwh improvement battery pack costs 
reminder project leaders the battery industry reaching kwh battery 
pack costs potentially sooner which point evs should achieve total cost 
parity with government subsidies fuel savings factored with traditional internal 
combustion vehicles see exhibit acting further accelerant for demand 
raw materials account only for the total cost battery pack today even 
substantial increase commodity prices would likely not particularly burdensome 
factoring our european mining and metals team long term assumptions 
price increase copper increase cobalt increase nickel and 
decrease lithium the additional cost for tesla nca battery would still only 
kwh and even smaller kwh impact nmc batteries assuming 
manufacturers switch from nmc then see exhibit nickel accounts 
for most the difference with the rise copper and cobalt being largely offset the fall 
lithium such the total cost impact would likely more than per 
even accounting for additional metals copper within the electric motor inverter 
etc 
technically byd still uses lfp lithium iron phosphate batteries which cost kwh however the company plans 
switch nmc nickel manganese cobalt comply with the new energy density requirements set the chinese 
government presumably this will entail nmc which costs marginally more kwh see china subsidies 
why china adjusting subsidies again and what does mean for byd increasing outperform 
the switch from nmc the lower cobalt nmc per bernstein official battery chemistry mix roadmap note 
that tesla could also conceivably switch nmc some point management has previously indicated that the company 
original adoption panasonic nca batteries was effectively marriage convenience moreover the gigafactory already

what happens electric vehicles end costing more than initially 
projected such development would certainly negative for the industry ceteris 
paribus particularly within lower end markets total however don expect aggregate 
demand severely affected for one battery costs will likely keep going down bit 
slower manufacturing scale efficiencies end being partly offset commodity 
headwinds and more importantly the fact the matter that electric vehicles now have 
global momentum looking forward governments will likely continue push adoption 
companies such tesla will likely further catalyze consumer interest and incumbent 
responses and battery and charging technology will inevitably continue improve even 
total cost parity pushed off year two lastly should note that our long term 
commodity price assumptions effectively represent worst case scenario where battery 
technology never develops beyond nmc fact manufacturers may end modifying 
battery chemistries specifically minimize the priciest commodities going forward 
scenario analyzed another recent note 
for tesla specifically believe commodity bottleneck might even somewhat 
paradoxically deepen the company competitive advantages least versus other 
manufacturers given the company unparalleled brand aura generally believe the

eight years away see exhibit and this assumes that demand 
specifically inflects around accordance with our government target 
projection opposed several years later which point there might shortage 
also assumes that the battery supplier industry begins consolidating absent

this our most significant concern delivering healthy gross margins critical for hypergrowth companies gross margins set the baseline for profitability once operating

model cost estimates appear optimistic tesla historically only had gross 
margins and made money its existing model and model 
offerings while competitors similar price points likely have gross margins 
and operating margins the upshot that difficult see tesla enjoying

service centers overwhelmed our tesla owners survey july showed that

company can deliver its model gross margins and demonstrate that has clear 
path long term profitability interpret tesla valuation vote 
confidence from the market long tesla growth story growth the near

investors will continue supply liquidity and overlook tesla cash burn just they

whether the company can ultimately deliver 
the meantime tesla capex requirements are only getting larger the scale tesla 
long term ambitions underscores the need for both sustainable cash flows and access 
capital markets achieve our revenue projection for roughly 
necessary justify tesla current per share valuation estimate that the 
company would have build acquire incremental battery capacity 
annually roughly gigafactory requiring capex and spend perhaps 
tooling every year see exhibit looked another way for tesla 
achieve its own revenue target detailed within elon musk new 
compensation targets the company would need make battery capacity 
additions within the coming decade that could nearly cumulative capex

capex for gigafactory which expected have battery cell capacity albeit battery pack 
capacity upon competition however expect these costs gradually decline gwh and 
gwh note that several asian battery suppliers have already approached cost 
gwh likely due less ambitious factory designs solar panels their factory roof etc additionally 
estimate that tesla will require tooling capex for every vehicles incremental production capacity going

shape the adoption curve look like our technology team believes that global adoption 
will rapid sales penetration for bevs phevs combined believe that 
adoption evs will take longer given higher costs smartphone and longer 
lifespan over years for vehicle years for smartphone displacement the 
steam engine with the diesel locomotive the horse with the car are more meaningful 
comparisons that took years the from the point reaching parc the 
world has just reached that point 
counterintuitively the shape the adoption curve has limited impact when peak oil 
demand will occur and the rate which oil demand will peak the reason for the limited

changes car sales take time make meaningful impact the fleet gdp growth and 
the pace fuel efficiency improvements matter much more setting the timing peak oil 
demand and the quantum peak oil demand 
penetration grows line with the bernstein technology team forecasts oil demand 
will peak just under around this little change from our previous 
estimates over the past year our technology team has turned increasingly positive 
adoption rates given observed growth rates the market and policy announcements 
banning ice vehicles the rapid adoption penetration rates are correct gasoline demand 
will peak the mid and global oil demand will peak around 
the shape the adoption curve does however have material impact the rate oil 
demand decline post peak oil demand this makes sales penetration the most important 
lead indicator for future demand the slow adoption case demand stays relatively flat 
post peak oil demand while the rapid adoption case demand drops 
between and these outcomes are different for the oil industry but will become 
clear the early based sales penetration for now too early tell which 
outcome more likely 
despite the rapid adoption view evs from the bernstein technology team there remain 
tangible risks the revolution infrastructure bottlenecks charging and material 
cost inflation are clear risks adoption the elimination subsidies which have been 
supportive sales also major risk one the other hand more pro policies driven 
climate change and pollution risks could support sales 
adoption rates and oil demand game over game

continue believe one more supercycle oil before reach peak oil demand 
gasoline only oil demand growth air travel and petrochemicals will likely 
continue support long term oil demand even oil demand does peak and 
declines close zero the end the century still have cumulative oil demand 
trillion bbls which more than current proven reserves trillion bbls short the 
oil industry still needed 
how fast will parc penetration grow 
the rise electric vehicles regarded one the biggest existential threats global oil 
demand although most would agree that evs will eventually dominate the global vehicle 
fleet the growth penetration remains key controversy our technology team 
believes that adoption will continue rapid sales penetration for bevs phevs 
combined based adoption curves for mobile phones and televisions 
the other hand believe that adoption will take longer given that the average lifespan 
car that smart phone and the average cost more acknowledge that 
the point which elective vehicles become more competitive will seminal moment 
but this hard predict 
counterintuitively the adoption curve has minimal impact when peak oil demand 
will occur and the rate which oil demand will peak the timing peak oil demand and 
peak rate oil demand not overly sensitive the adoption curve based our estimates 
see exhibit find that oil demand will peak the rapidadoption case and under the epic fail case other words even 
under the assumption that sales penetration will close this will 
only push forward peak oil demand years and reduce the rate peak oil demand 
less than the reason the size the global vehicle parc relative car 
sales which means that changes annual sales composition take time make 
meaningful impact the fleet find that gdp growth and pace fuel efficiency 
improvements matter much more the timing peak oil demand and rate 
the adoption curve has significant impact the rate oil demand decline post peak oil

investment implications 
investors are often siloed into two camps electric vehicle converts skeptics for 
believers the future very clear electric vehicles are the cusp disrupting the global 
auto industry which based ice technology this will lead collapse oil demand 
and stranded carbon assets such the oil industry could massive short the other 
hand skeptics believe that there could many challenges widespread adoption 
oil demand growing more strongly than ever and capital not reinvested replacing 
reserves the world could find itself short oil the early part the next decade this could 
create another supercycle for oil prices making oil one the most attractive investments 
given current depressed valuations 
our view that the pace adoption will have minimal impact when oil demand peaks 
and what rate oil demand peaks what happens beyond peak oil will very much depend 
adoption rates sales penetration the early mid will the most 
important lead indicator oil demand the our view too early tell which 
scenario more likely with uncertainty over longer term demand surprise that 
reinvestment production growth has faltered underinvestment the oil industry outside 
north america evident when tight oil can longer meet global demand growth there 
remains the potential for least one more supercycle oil the long run oil demand will 
peak but the long run are all dead selling oil stocks today could mean missing out 
least one more supercycle before the demand peak the the key message

electric revolution the resistance 
bernstein 
are sure resistance futile 
incumbent behavior and regulatory resistance 
the rest this blackbook largely focused bottlenecks supply shortages that will 
gate adoption electric vehicles this chapter focuses regulatory pressures the 
electric revolution regulatory resistance over the last year has the broadest sense 
fallen into two categories political headlines most notably the and withdrawal 
economic support and subsidies most notably but not exclusively china the 
withdrawal from the paris climate accord announced august and the imposition 
the import tariffs solar panels under section the trade act 
january have made for great headlines and have triggered speculation unravelling 
global consensus around regulating carbon together with the prospect especially 
recent weeks broader trade wars similarly cuts subsidies china can interpreted 
wavering even capitulation against support for renewables general and energy 
storage and electric vehicles particular 
our view the decline the cost the technology together with widespread adoption 
and rapid growth means that the cessation subsidies any one individual market 
would little derail the electric revolution forecast that the moment when 
electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles will come with similar sticker 
price even before any subsidy factored and without considering the effect fuel 
prices total cost ownership this contrasts with cuts renewable energy subsidies 
spain and germany which did have material consequences 
demand pricing and profitability short the market for electric vehicles today too 
broad the cost deltas between evs and ices too narrow the markets which subsidies 
exist are too numerous and the period during which subsidies are still required too short 
for any one regulator make difference said differently the train has left the station 
similarly political backlash against renewables and electric vehicles has become more 
profound some corners the world the last year but counterintuitively these political 
stances are close meaningless industry economics the enterprise caps federal 
tax credits for electric vehicles the and the abolition tax waivers electric 
vehicles hong kong put the margin incremental pressure other markets however 
the moment when killer blow can extinguish the entire industry regulators come 
their senses has largely passed 
the exception that observation may china china leadership both producer 
and consumer renewable energy and energy storage continues expand cost 
declines continue subsidies china are falling and the criteria qualify for subsidies 
tightening there tendency view these changes subsidy structure capitulation 
abandonment the technology the part the host regulator however our 
view subsidy cuts are the necessary markers success this stance aggressively 
are sure resistance futile 
bernstein 
managing subsidies down means there constant drumbeat doom and ready 
narrative regulators giving come the exact opposite conclusion the 
demonstrated history over the last decade that china will support subsidy program for 
identified strategic priority like renewables electric vehicles for exactly long 
necessary meet those strategic goals but not longer 
cheap makes for lot other shortcomings 
recently four years ago even after the launch the tesla model the 
extraordinary cost declines solar and wind technology were compounding and doubledigit growth installed capacity additions each year were continuing see exhibit and 
exhibit exhibit the critique renewable energy and energy storage still 
came back one simple argument that argument went something like this the installed 
base and the cumulative investment fossil fuels and the internal combustion engine 
globally great and the task building the hard and soft infrastructure required 
expand adoption renewables and electric vehicles overwhelming that eventually 
these new technologies will collapse under their own weight the thinking was that 
regulators and politicians would come their senses and stop inflicting this immature 
expensive technology the rest

the simple reason that one asking these questions any more the cost declines 
lithium ion batteries see exhibit renewable energy relationship with conventional 
power grid entirely parenthetical without energy storage any long term forecast 
involving widespread adoption renewable energy requires low cost energy storage 
solution and similarly any long term forecast involving widespread adoption electric 
vehicles requires low cost lightweight batteries the difference today compared 
three four five years ago that low cost batteries are now reality 
the decline cost and the expectation that the cuts will continue combined with similar 
cost trajectory for wind and solar means that almost all the objections raised about 
electric vehicles and renewable energy going mainstream four years ago have 
disappeared california utilities are longer staring quizzically intra day demand that

policy makers will respond either through regulation price competition releasing

view the regulatory and political resistance the electric revolution has become more 
virulent but less likely succeed owing large part the cost declines energy 
storage 
the political backlash against renewables and electric vehicles has become more 
profound the two most obvious examples this backlash over the last year has been the 
withdrawal from the paris climate accord and the imposition the import tariffs 
solar panels under section the trade act withdrawal from the paris 
climate accord which the terms participation were entirely voluntary symbolic 
gesture the burden proof required impose tariff because economic injury from 
imported good extraordinarily low however the holds relatively small share

cost declines have continued support for various programs most notably solar and

been cut hong kong removed its tax exemption for electric vehicles quotas the federal 
tax credit electric vehicles the are likely exhausted the next few years 
electric vehicle subsidies china are falling and the criteria qualify for subsidies 
tightening 
there tendency view these changes subsidy structure capitulation change 
attitude toward the technology the part the regulator host market however 
perversely they are signs success detail recent changes below 
recent cuts china solar subsidy 
china has been cutting the feed tariff fit solar generated electricity for years see 
exhibit december china announced lower fit each region 
with cut average therefore the fit scheme kwh 
kwh for region kwh kwh for

trending down though slightly slower pace this year starting from all new 
projects will subject the fit prevailing the time that operations commence namely 
company can lock the previous year fit early registration 
investment tax credit and production tax credit status 
the production tax credit ptc the subsidies electricity generated from wind the 
scheme has been extended several times the most recent renewal was made december 
under ptc eligible wind facilities can enjoy tax credit during the first years

hong kong subsidy program 
the hong kong government previously waived the first registration tax frt full for all 
electric vehicles sold which boosted sales hong kong significantly there were only 
evs registered hong kong the number increased early 
the first quarter teslas were registered hong kong see exhibit

after briefly becoming the second largest market for tesla the world the hong 
kong government reduced the subsidy program starting from april the frt for 
evs now waived which increased the purchasing cost 
average the effect was immediate the sales tesla dropped for

the four most significant risks facing the major mining houses are lack capital discipline 
operating cost inflation sustained downturn the chinese economy and resource 
nationalism 
capital discipline capital discipline perhaps the most important mechanism which the 
mining industry can create value have seen lapses capital discipline before and 
return such periods would lend downward pressure prices 
operating cost inflation following years double digit dollar denominated cost 
inflation the industry unit costs have come down recent years commodity prices 
have fallen expect see return cost inflation but should this stronger than 
expect then has the capacity erode value 
chinese economic risks china important commodities both the major source 
demand growth and the location the marginal units supply the market has become 
extremely sensitive sentiment regarding the chinese economy with the level leverage 
particular concern 
resource nationalism finally note with concern the trend toward global fragmentation 
and the ever greater desire extract value from the mining sector believe that this 
ultimately self defeating strategy host governments but one with impressively
