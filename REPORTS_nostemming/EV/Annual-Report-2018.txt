long term view 
automotive powertrain technology 
has seen many developments 
the years that johnson matthey

largely societal requirements 
for cleaner vehicles the coming 
decades will see even bigger

technologies enable them 
our insights into these new 
demands are broad and deep 
understand the big trends 
regulations driver expectations 
the strategies vehicle 
manufacturers and the 
capabilities the new technologies 
available the manufacturers 
these trends determine the 
demand for our technologies 
understanding our customers and their value chains 
johnson matthey brings deep insight into how these market trends translate into 
performance requirements for all our automotive powertrain enabling products and 
the technical support our customers need work from market needs through system 
performance requirements and into the design materials the atomic scale can 
then scale our science from the lab through vehicle testing production processes 
for millions engines year which itself requires intimate understanding our 
customers preferences and their ways working 
key strength our relationship with vehicle manufacturers built years 
collaboration all stages technology development from design through 
application scale testing and into mass production understand how they work 
their time cycles and their technology needs 
our relationships the supply chain are equally important securing and 
managing reliable ethical supplies metals and other raw materials will just 
important for batteries for our emission control catalyst and fuel cell businesses 
the automotive supply chain highly integrated but evolving with more emphasis 
lifetime stewardship and circular supply chains has the experience and 
structures for this way working from our precious metal businesses including 
recycling emission control catalysts 
the supply chain evolves stay aware who making the critical decisions 
and what basis decisions required performance standards technology selection 
supplier selection and system optimisation are made between different functions within 
companies and between companies and different stages the supply chain maintain 
broad set contacts order participate fully this decision making process 
all options approach technology 
plan for success future powertrain markets the experience that applies 
technology road mapping very broad supply all the transport applications 
currently using internal combustion engines everything from scooters the largest 
container ships thus know the performance demands and design cycles for the 
full range land and water based transport combine this with our practical 
experience all the options for clean energy storage and powertrains across 
combustion engines batteries and fuel cells believe that over time everything will 
become electrified but different ways different speeds and different degrees 
internal combustion engines will remain important all transport sectors for decades 
increasingly hybrid systems and fuel cells will come too particularly for heavy 
and long haul vehicles the world will need all options and all options represent 
opportunities for 
this all options view shapes our strategic planning process determines the 
portfolio technologies and businesses that develop determines the way that 
use our understanding the various alternative technologies develop and 
market the technologies determines the flexibility maintain resource planning 
place bets the most promising technologies and retain the options need 
maintain our strong position the market regardless the shape future demand 
although our catalyst technology 
has enabled fold reduction 
emissions from vehicles since the 
many cities around the world 
still suffer from poor air quality 
caused part vehicle exhaust 
gases therefore new vehicle 
emissions regulations will continue 
tighten and will significant 
driver demand for our products 
the most important trend for the 
future not the further reduction 
the headline emissions limits 
although this will continue but 
the shift testing and compliance 
regimes that better reflect emissions 
real world use these new tests 
require higher system performance 
across wider range conditions

ifrs ifrs provides principles based approach for revenue recognition and requires that revenue recognised the distinct performance

whilst some timing differences have been identified result allocating revenue distinct performance obligations where the criteria 
set out ifrs for recognising revenue over time are not met the group and parent company have completed their reviews major existing
