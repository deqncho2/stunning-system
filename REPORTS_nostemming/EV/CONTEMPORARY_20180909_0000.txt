battery upgrades initiate coverage catl

lithium ion batteries lib can act disruptor the auto power and lead acid 
battery lab industries after however view reduction the electric 
vehicle subsidy china and battery price pressures overhangs lib 
maker catl shares are more bullish than consensus battery 
volumes but are more bearish battery prices and margins this report 
map out global penetration and consider potential lib opportunities

indicates catl would need cut its battery prices least when the 
subsidy phased out the end keep economical requiring

the peak august for the index over the same period and 
average for its peers the past months our estimates the stock 
trading the highest among our china battery coverage 
universe think the market giving catl premium over peers given its 
leading industry position which think justified 
bear case price war may occur after when china becomes open

price cuts result reduction the government subsidy addition the

when the government removes its subsidy forming open market and 
leading rising price competition initiate catl equal weight 
beneficiary china opportunity but overhangs persist the medium term 
contemporary amperex technology ltd catl china leading lib producer 
including lithium iron phosphate lfp and ncm occupying volume market share 
the largest year date its leading position mainly reflected the quality its 
products strong bargaining power along the value chain solid efforts 
battery upgrades and integrated business model incorporating metals recycling 
however think the stock will negatively impacted the subsidy reduction 
and margin pressure the medium term although the subsidy cut for 
well known the market the magnitude the cut uncertain battery price 
pressure will likely remain overhang before battery companies and auto oems can 
finalize any agreements post the subsidy cut and further downside risk margins 
result the subsidy cut and rising competition and despite potential decline 
costs driven upgrades battery cell energy density the amount energy can 
store 
margins are artificially high china battery industry has been closed market the 
past three years when the boom started with the korean japanese players not 
eligible for the subsidy this has led significant profitability for the top chinese 
battery companies and their batteries remained short supply china given growing 
demand while the korean japanese battery producers have struggled break even 
think the benign price environment for chinese battery companies will come end 
after the chinese government removes the subsidy long term expect 
chinese battery companies high margins normalize while korean japanese players 
will see their margins improve diminishing the gap between the two 
finding profitability subsidy era the chinese government subsidy policy 
has helped the domestic players become profitable however the government plans 
phase out the subsidy the end and without this favorable policy 
calculate catl would need cut battery prices least keep economical 
versus internal combustion engine ice vehicles think technology evolution the 
battery for will help catl remain profitable nonetheless expect unit 
gross margins slump from see upside

lab disruption lab have been widely adopted many applications including autos 
undisturbed power supply ups telecom electric bikes and even the military lab 
have existed for centuries but are likely displaced the lib five years our 
view given the continuous fall lib costs catl will likely lower lib costs parity 
level with lab which would accelerate the displacement china lab sales 
volumes are currently about per annum lib eventually replace 
lab expect lib sales volumes and reach 
but lib earnings contribution are unlikely material before given our 
expectations intense price competition between lib and lab amid the 
replacement 
ess disruption see many growth opportunities china energy storage system 
ess market ess can used these areas where there currently power tariff gap 
least kwh between peak load and base load however most other places 
china have too slim tariff gap allow ess arbitrage storing electricity base 
load and dispatch peak load power reform which has been delayed almost for two 
decades would needed for vast ess applications china such our estimates 
not factor this ess opportunity 
valuation adopt dcf methodology value the company reflect its potential 
opportunity from auto disruption and lab replacement our price target 
derived from year dcf model with wacc similar that tesla 
covered morgan stanley auto analyst adam jonas think the two companies 
are similar theme plays over the next two decades and will beneficiaries the 
long term secular penetration assume catl dcf exits versus tesla 
reflect the saturated penetration with exit ebitda terminal value

given that over battery cell cost raw material cost believe the margin

years think battery costs will further decrease the energy density continues 
improve look for energy density for catl considering the 
preliminary type battery should still use graphite anode further evolution 
silicon based anode could lead higher energy density 
range should not problem the rising per also accompanies incremental 
per litre which means would able accommodate more batteries that 
said for the same platform more battery capacity can loaded support longer

lab disruption 
how big the lab market the lab the oldest type rechargeable battery 
widely used many applications with global market sales volume 
china accounts for half this market demand for lab has steadily grown the past 
decade driven rising auto sales and penetration mobile devices 
lab advantages over the newer types batteries include its low cost high power toweight ratio high safety level and good low high temperature performance however 
lab also has its disadvantages including short rechargeable cycle leading its short 
life span poor energy weight ratio and poor energy volume ratio the lib makes 
good replacement option for the lab our view given its high energy volume ratio 
and relatively fast time charge also lib can recharged and discharged over cycles while lab can only over hundreds cycles lib years use life 
versus years for lab make more economical than lab all else equal addition 
lib energy volume ratio more than triple that lab and thus requires less space 
exhibit lead acid batteries versus lithium ion batteries 
source battery university morgan stanley research 
replacement roadmap based our lib cost curve expect the lib largely start 
displacing the lab the next five years and replace annual lab sales volume 
think its replacement will accelerate when lib costs reach 
level that similar lab costs lib longer life cycle and higher energy density would 
make this replacement more economical for users our view

catl benefit from lib disruption expect catl see material increase sales 
volume when lib replace lab starting and then accelerate from 
look for the company take share domestic lab 
replacement market versus share the battery market the former 
requires lower tier battery quality compared the market where think 
competition will more intense but until lib completely displaces lab think catl 
would need sacrifice margins encourage the disruption think the company will 
likely consider raising margins monetize once the lib completely replaces lab 
expect catl achieve slim margins during the lab replacement cycle versus batteries the long term the slim margins 
reflect higher entry barrier for the battery industry which requires high battery 
energy density safety and consistency 
how should value this segment see this segment low margin business 
the price competition between lib and lab players will intense amid lib 
replacement for lab yet its market potential vast with market sales 
volume battery costs continue fall trigger the accelerating replacement 
the company should monetize afterward thus use dcf value the 
company reflect this potential lab substitution market 
the cost gap between the two still wide despite its many advantages over lab 
lib relatively high manufacturing costs limit its widespread use lead the primary 
material used manufacturing lab abundant and thus inexpensive contrast 
materials used making lib include lithium nickel cobalt separator and electrolyte 
which are all more expensive than lead the equipment and process used making lib 
are also more expensive and complex lib also entail high packaging costs embedded
