executive summary 
electric vehicles are coming utility sector that has been used shifting landscape 
over the past decade renewables nuclear phase outs government interventions 
should able take this latest change its stride growth expected 
strong getting cars europe and continuing 
helped government subsidies and regulation much the same way that renewables 
growth has been encouraged 
this raises opportunities for utilities more evs mean more electricity demand 
potentially equivalent another germany and doubling peak demand 
without mitigation means more infrastructure required potentially helping 
regulated assets means the roll out charging points which utilities can help 
facilitate means potential growth maintenance and services businesses around this 
the opportunity develop hardware and software solutions that can additional 
sources revenue 
demand upside will take while play out with average annual consumption 
will take lot evs materially impact the grid put this into 
context our autos team estimates there will evs western europe 
this implies additional electricity demand compared with germany 
annual electricity demand this not huge number even our forecasts 
are very wide the mark and the actual number evs higher still 
unlikely significant demand boost near term note that germany italy spain 
france and the have seen fall demand since 
however peak demand needs considered will not take many evs single 
street potentially disrupt peak demand even charging slow charge single 
could double the household peak this can have ramifications for local networks 
look this more detail the electric avenue study the section the 
opportunities for utilities 
but there are new entrants playing win well the utility companies are not alone 
seeking exploit the opportunity plenty others want get involved capital 
goods companies abb siemens are looking into charging points they already have 
good working relationships with utilities which could extend into this new area many 
other companies also specialise certain parts this new value chain some are likely 
long term winners and utilities may need find way work with these players 
develop competing operations companies such chargemaster the offer endto end charging point services from the hardware through software and contract 
servicing and maintenance chargepoint equivalent garo concentrates 
infrastructure kit while plugsurfing and hubject develop software for payment 
platforms and there are plenty more examples these types companies 
the german utilities are the most vocal but are not alone exploring this area both 
innogy and eon have been open about the work they are doing the space innogy set 
distinct division this year concentrating mobility whilst has been active for 
many years already currently has charging points likewise eon not new 
the game and using denmark its incubator the nordic countries have much

what about post 
this note focus predominantly the impact the utility sector over the next 
years this looks the potential upside from some additional electricity demand 
well thinking through local distribution challenges and opportunities from installing 
and growing charging infrastructure network and how utilities can benefit either from 
the installation management this network 
the note touches what the future the electric grid coupled with evs could look 
like time the sharing cars could mean many more miles driven and therefore the 
potential for more electricity consumption through networks and batteries 
evolve and become smarter the interplay between the mobile battery and the 
grid means that challenges such managing peak demand could look very different 
why simplistically our numbers could lead doubling peak demand time but 
reality demand side response smart grids time use tariffs vehicle grid 
connections will likely mean the outcome less dramatic but time will tell will 
address these and related themes future notes 
parallels between evs and renewables 
carrot and stick 
utilities are quite used changing environments with the roll out renewables over 
the past decade the sector has seen quite material change propelled government 
emissions targets and with help from government subsidies and falling cost curves 
renewables uptake has been swift the same drivers will likely push roll out

through dramatic change smart grids are the way energy becoming ever more 
decentralised and evs could help here time becoming stores electricity 
traditional forms thermal generation are being replaced speed the arrival big 
data bringing opportunities for utilities but also the threat new entrants can 
utility companies continue their evolution 
but evs undoubtedly bring opportunities for utility companies the first higher levels 
demand potential positive for generators well suppliers they will also bring 
the need reinforce network infrastructure potentially benefit for network 
operators they will bring the need for new charging point infrastructure and the 
maintenance this kit which could handled utility companies there are also 
software requirements that need addressed how charging points work and 
how they interface with grids this leads opportunities for utilities manage and 
service infrastructure contracts end end from installing charging point 
infrastructure with their own software managing tariffs and billing utilities are

therefore near term see little impact the need for new power generation 
because evs the iea expects additional electrical capacity with 
from renewables globally versus retirement bloomberg new

should adequate meet new demand needs this course not necessarily the 
case every single country but with modest extra demand pull from evs the next 
decade this unlikely require huge sources new generation capacity 
bloomberg new energy finance expects europe add twice much new capacity 
retires retired whilst demand stays flat 
but there could some country specific issues the two large european countries that 
this could present challenges for the next decade are germany and the the 
former will see nuclear power capacity off the grid well seeing 
its lignite capacity starting reduced the reserve margin additional capacity 
over peak demand already tight for the former bnef sees this capacity reduction 
being offset new solar and wind capacity but with the introduction new 
capacity market this time should able manage capacity requirements time for 
any such surge new registrations 
but where evs come the grid will matter load management will become important 
relatively quickly street with houses suddenly all sees new for example this 
could double the local demand the network and could have implications for grid 
operators look this more detail the section managing the networks more

whilst the incremental new load requirements from evs the next decade appear 
relatively manageable this ignores the areas where the load will not only 
distribution network operators dnos potentially have manage slow charging point 
growth people houses they will likely have contemplate fast charger growth 
well super fast chargers all sitting next one another motorway service station 
autobahn stop could cause some problems 
managing peak demand one the main problems facing grid operators will the 
potential additional demand peak times reserve margins are built into the system 
that there enough generation meet the daily peak demand and distribution 
networks are set able handle these peaks adding new layer demand 
from evs peak times could lead greater system cost through the need for more 
generation capacity and investment new transmission and strengthening transmission 
and distribution networks 
exhibit peak demand could rise current peak with new

complicated shared mobility

our penetration expectations this could see peak demand increasing 
and maybe exhibit assumes bigger impact peak demand 
assumes capacity demand with this potentially rising more

nera and mot this could see peak demand increasing 
however both these scenarios are based all evs being electric not hybrid 
also doesn reflect the likely impact from smart grids time use tariffs and vehicle 
grid capabilities the actual impact peak demand should lower there will 
more ways manage the grid cope with peaks and troughs but visibility the 
actual impact low today managing demand peaks will important manage system 
integrity but also avoid needless additional system costs and therefore additional 
customer bill payments 
exhibits show national grid simulation the impact greater fleet 
peak demand through sees demand increasing but perhaps adding only 
peak demand versus the exhibits above showing increase 
peak demand that sensitivity assumes some hybrids the mix coupled with smart 
networks and time use tariffs which will shift demand away from peaks 
electric avenue dnos are not sitting still and nor are regulators part the 
regulator electric avenue funding technology association with sse 
undertook project from january june looking the impact higher 
demand from evs networks and how this can managed reduce the longer term 
cost grid reinforcement see grey box below 
electric avenue 
this piece work was sponsored ofgem regulator and carried out 
technology collaboration with sse and other partners consider the impact 
dnos distribution network operators the growth from evs 
the work took place over months jan june and involved clusters 
people using evs and kitted out with the new esprit technology that 
monitors and controls electricity used when the car being charged 
some outputs the work 
low voltage feeders circuits will require intervention when customers have evs based charging numbers will vary charge 
rates have increased since this work 
the after diversity maximum demand admd coincident peak load network 
likely experience over its lifetime traditionally used for properties this 
doubles with the inclusion 
the project showed the technology was successful curtailing charging when 
necessary 
during weekdays charging more likely before and after work creating 
morning and evening peak 
weekends charging more likely between and 
approximately evs are charged only once day 
more than evs are charged until the battery full 
the report concludes that curtailing charging when necessary manage loads 
could prevent roads being dug and new higher capacity cables being installed 
estimated this could lead economic saving 
this leads bigger questions around grid design and management technology set 
out some the issues its smart options paper again commissioned for sse and 
published october and using the electric avenue work the smart 
project looks how some the potential higher network cost from higher demand 
could mitigated least some degree takes the results from the initial project 
around external management charging and questions how this could best 
delivered the arrival smart meters and grids should drive these ideas forward exhibit 
shows how demand curves can managed and potentially flattened using evs 
combined with smart meters this will important tool lessen costs and 
maintain system integrity but this will require closer collaboration between regulators 
and consumers 
many the industry are also looking vehicle grid will ultimately allow evs 
effect large mobile batteries store energy will allow evs interact 
with smart grids enabling bidirectional flow energy again this will mean dnos 
should able manage the networks smarter way which should reduce peaks 
and lower costs whether time the relationship between the consumer and dnos 
around evs managed charging done through regulation consumer incentives 
market mechanisms the focus the smart options paper 
exhibit managing charging via smart grids should enable demand curves flattened 
reducing peaks and increasing troughs but this still some way off 
source iea global outlook 
managed charging 
managed charging allows utility third party remotely control vehicle 
charging turning down even off better correspond the needs 
the grid much like traditional demand response programs 
what about shared mobility this report are using estimates and not miles 
estimates the latter could more appropriate world where shared mobility 
becomes prevalent this scenario there would likely fewer new evs but each one 
would used more and given the falling cost consumers travelling many more miles 
this could see the overall mileage increase perhaps materially but this then 
raises the question around whether the would mobile battery were 
charged run until empty and then recharged could have very different impact 
the grid these questions are being considered across the industry today and the 
current pace development are unlikely get clarity until the late 
the near term will likely fall network operators continue invest networks 
maintain asset integrity demand increases these could many cases part 
rab regulatory asset base growth this will tend more course business given 
the relatively small amount anticipated extra demand however there will discrete 
investments potentially needed for areas around specific new charging points 
particularly super fast points for detail see new charging point requirements 
but the technology work shows number evs along single street could 
potentially cause network issues without joined thinking technology puts the 
avoidable cost the distribution network the put this 
content annual totex for the dnos today money and the impact 
spreading over number years may not great but could get compressed 
into short timeframe and will come top further grid spend which yet 
ill defined 
sse ceo noted its results may think difficult say what the 
numbers are but may the next phase big investment within networks and 
the distribution side working hard make sure 
new charging point requirements 
types charging infrastructure 
charging points are primarily defined the power they can produce and 
therefore what speed they are capable charging zap map 
charging points can described slow fast rapid and ultra fast this will 
depend the speed which the vehicle can charged typically from number 
hours down number minutes which will dependent the power 
the charge point can produce the higher the power the faster the charge 
all else equal 
there are different types connector that charging points and evs use until 
now different oems have manufactured evs with different sockets for example 
tesla has its own infrastructure the target having one charging connector 
looks unlikely reached this stage given different electrical grid systems 
around the world and competing technologies however most evs are built with 
small number connectors preferred often depending the speed charge 
slow charging the lion share the charging points today mostly located 
residential properties and businesses however terminology not hard and fast 
home charging can range from however zap map would classify 
the upper end fast charging whilst the iea would classify fast charging above 
home charging can done from plugs the draw 
power from more specialised wall boxes domestic charging tends although increasing chargemaster offers home charge until 
now anything above has typically been for offices businesses put these 
sizes into context renault zoe with battery will take over 
charge with box but with the box the box would take 
less than hours there cost difference chargemaster will sell you 
box for incl installation and vat box for and box for 
the latter material the starting cost renault zoe the 
although you can lease battery from renault rather than purchasing 
outright 
typically slow charging infrastructure points not include the charging cable 
each manufacturer provides their own cable that fits the charger outlet 
one end and the vehicle inlet socket the other most slow charging can done 
standard plugs the case wall boxes can charged off gun shaped 
type typically north america standard pin type mennekes 
connector typically european standard 
dedicated fast charging points however are different slow ones there are three 
fast charging standards chademo ccs and telsa supercharger that are the 
most representative the majority fast charging points offers connection for the 
first two standards even though some charging points only have one 
standard the tesla fast charging points are exclusively for tesla vehicles 
however telsa joined the charin association which promoting the ccs 
system globally currently the standard europe and the 
fast charging zap map calls fast chargers power which discuss 
above suitable for home business solutions the charging time for 
standard battery much reduced the slow power outlets for this 
speed charge mennekes connectors are often standard within the european

the hardware deliver electric charging will need grow quickly accommodate the 
growth evs there argument that this needs come first gain public 
confidence buy new evs getting network charging points and running will 
course key the roll out evs but the growth evs alone and the political and 
regulatory backing gets will mandate more charging infrastructure 
this has already been big growth area the iea shows that global charging points 
grew from over million unsurprisingly most these are 
private points estimated million with the remaining being public 
charging points evs number more than public charging points which line with 
the thesis that charging done home business 
exhibit global supply equipment surpassed million note that most equipment 
private chargers for people charge the home 
source iea global outlook morgan stanley research 
until now there has been little rule thumb around the number public charging 
points needed service the fleet the numbers vary greatly from country 
country depending the maturity the market the iea calculates that the number 
evs per slow charging point broadly fell the range with the global average 
the numbers cars per fast charging point was understandably much 
greater the country level often for countries with more developed 
market the number evs public charging infrastructure tends higher 
norway market share sales the ratio was for slow charging and 
for fast charging 
utilities will probably not get too involved with home charging what the optimal 
charge point ratio will ultimately remains unclear most consumers with will 
have the ability charge home couple utilities have told they expect 
charging done home work imagine this would done slow charging 
today often this either done through the plug home dedicated wall box which 
often supplied oems who include home charging kit telsa powerwall for 
example with the vehicle some governments are also incentivising consumers buy 
evs with subsidies for home charging installation see little opportunity here for 
utilities other than the increased demand that evs can bring homes coupled with the 
potential for some load management work the local networks these will both 
relatively small the near term 
greater interest utilities public infrastructure what can the utilities here 
they are developing hardware charging points that can installed public locations 
how many could needed for employers utilities have told that they are seeing 
point for every but this only one part the infrastructure picture 
for ease and simplification taking the range evs slow charging points above 
would imply public charging points globally our estimate 
versus public points today points western europe our 
car estimate there that sharp increase the number public charging 
points today not surprisingly this could involve infrastructure spend 
presumably the power chargers will increase costs fall but how this will play out

utilities will not deliver all this again put some context around this the german 
utilities eon and innogy are perhaps little further ahead than most utilities 
developing this sort infrastructure between them they have charging points 
there are charging points the alone the june according zapmap and over across europe today according the iea there are 
independents and others this market already look chargemaster and garo 
bit more detail the next section but oems are also involved albeit more help get 
cars sold rather than new business line 
more ultra fast charging points will also required but this will not large number 
the near term 
the site all important for public charging point comparing charging points 
operator not necessarily meaningful what more important the utilisation the 
charging point charging point that not being used clearly not valuable asset 
own 
subsidies will crucial for the roll out with renewables and the themselves 
government incentives will continue play key part driving charging point growth 
these subsidies are enable consumers add wall box home for example but 
there are also subsidies for public charging points where utilities can become more 
involved and being able tap into this source funding lowers risk for utilities 
exhibit support mechanisms are place across many european countries for supply 
equipment charging points 
source iea global outlook morgan stanley research 
innovative city solutions determining the optimal number charge points 
challenge some cities are therefore coming with innovative ways deliver new 
points amsterdam has adopted one such policy will only deploy charging point 
infrastructure areas where knows there critical mass for and only there are 
off street private alternatives consumers can sign the municipality have 
charger installed near their home when they purchase 
for utility can either look find sites install its own third party 
infrastructure taking merchant pricing risk use power term site with high 
utilisation means the prospect high returning charging unit likewise low utilisation 
means low returns this respect different retailer looking for 
appropriate site and having assess cost versus footfall 
however utility can also partner with businesses municipalities deliver the 
infrastructure well service offering which could lower the risk the utility 
service provider opportunities 
well the hardware the physical charging unit there also the software 
consider again some utilities are developing their own software solutions with the likes 
innogy eon fortum enel and iberdrola involved energy supply complex pricing 
energy products and software that will handle customer billing should fairly 
routine some utilities are therefore understandably creating their own software 
used the hardware they can then sign contracts with businesses municipalities and 
others provide end end service installing and maintaining the infrastructure 
well delivering the electricity the points and maintaining and servicing the 
customer billing all for fee 
complexity strength for utility utilities will not get rich selling more kwhs 
about managing the chain european integrated utility business head 
novel tariffs should utilities strength should payment made per charge 
should depend the power the charging point and the time takes charge 
should depend the time day and the level demand the system should 
fixed cost per week month year with unlimited charge permitted akin 
unlimited calls mobile phone centrica free weekend bundle which allows free 
electricity use for certain times weekend days there are many ways this can evolve 
and already utilities are charging customers many different ways 
many utilities are looking into value added energy plus type services this would fit 
neatly into this complex management energy needs exactly what utility retail 
businesses this different and different from managing and optimising 
energy use for large businesses and municipalities elsewhere this the edge that 
utilities have over third parties indeed oems who might want enter this space 
but again there are already independents competing this space and undoubtedly 
more will come look chargemaster and garo the next section 
how profitable can again profits are unlikely meaningful the near term 
given the relatively low level usage and one has careful not double 
count potential increase supply volumes well service contract revenues but 
one utility puts complexity strength for utility utilities will not get rich selling 
more kwhs about managing the chain 
what about software access whilst interoperability crucial for the hardware 
owners will want able charge their cars many charging points possible 
also just important the software side there are ever more web based 
solutions coming already there are platforms that allow drivers unlock charging 
stations with their navigation system app and pay for the electricity based 
agreements established with charging providers see more this the next section 
and payment how will customers end paying for charging public points 
home simply greater electricity use and can included the household electricity 
bill but there fixed model for public infrastructure today some instances 
charging free this was one way tesla incentivised new customers first although 
has since started charging its infrastructure hotels could another place you get 
free charging like wifi could used tool get customers come and stay 
some instances payment can made per visit but there are also schemes where the 
end user pays fixed monthly fee say which affords them unlimited miles eon 
denmark akin mobile phone pricing this nascent market and there will 
many different ways pay for charging the coming years 
which utilities are involved 
some utilities have been more vocal than others what they are doing around electric 
vehicles iberdrola will hosting technical session led its team focused 
the electric vehicle and its potential implications for the utility industry june 
german utilities eon and innogy have both had slides presentation packs and talked 
about impacts conference calls see the innogy ceo quote below national grid 
the has incorporated assumptions into its future energy scenario views which 
updates annually many other utilities are also looking future implications 
charging electric vehicles 
not everybody can make high voltage charging point but even fewer people can 
the whole back end the load management and whole accounting and audit and that 
where specifically are strong peter terium innogy ceo results call 
exhibit summaries where the value chain some utilities are focused could time 
focus have broken this down into grid investment around charging point 
infrastructure and the hardware for charging point infrastructure top that the 
ability build software into the infrastructure and run the facility end end finally 
some will benefit from higher levels generation output and the potential for 
additional supply demand

years ahead 
iberdrola iberdrola will hosting technical session evs june london 
which should give more information what doing iberdrola has division 
part which tasked with looking this possible area growth has over 
charging points today mostly spain and focusing countries where has retail 
exposure for now growth clearly interesting for iberdrola focusing all 
parts the value chain from infrastructure upgrades this could partly rab based 
time and charging point equipment software and services management would 
also benefit from higher electricity supply levels albeit discussed earlier this 
unlikely material soon 
edp edp likewise looking the whole value chain for evs today there are 
charging points portugal today and spain two countries where has 
exposure currently has charging points portugal fast and normal points 
spain has installed charging points and acts mobility retailer there are currently 
subsidies place for charging nor infrastructure spend included rab the 
industry still clearly nascent 
innogy innogy has charging points across countries with the majority 
germany exhibit had charging sessions and using energy 
demand with more than municipal utility partners has been the business for 
years now and with the realignment innogy away from rwe last year also brought 
new approval from the board develop its business further like eon innogy has 
been vocal about the potential benefits for utilities that get actively involved this 
area 
exhibit innogy has charging points across europe 
source company data morgan stanley research 
innogy offers end end services the space provider hardware and has 
system will operate and manage infrastructure systems for third parties the 
business will depend what the innogy customer wants innogy can sell the 
infrastructure and related software its customers and earn service fee from 
maintaining the system well potentially earning additional supply revenue from 
the demand take but the innogy customer who owns the infrastructure 
business can charge its end users per charge flat fee indeed allow the end users 
free access the infrastructure perhaps hotel operator that using charging 
way attract customers 
eon the german utility has been particularly vocal around its activity the space 
has charging points across europe has applied under the german funding 
regime for more with these fast charging eon installs everything from 
wall boxes columns now installing faster charger with faster 
charging points coming and potentially very soon tenders are under way for this 
german government support helping drive growth charging infrastructure within 
germany but eon not focused germany alone bought the market leader 
denmark and big player scandinavian markets the latter are proving 
interesting laboratory for roll out infrastructure elsewhere penetration 
scandinavian countries much higher than the rest western europe and 
customer data and understanding what makes good charging point more 
advanced eon outsources the manufacture the physical infrastructure 
eon charge point installer operator and service operator working along the value 
chain can sell its software white labelled product other smaller utilities and 
munis can buy stand alone but eon can also package with the infrastructure and 
managed service product 
eon also selling evs these are under leasing contracts whereby earns service fees 
and can for new real estate developments certain areas cities denmark 
for businesses for car sharing purposes 
this complex business more than just adding rab selling little more power 
about developing end end offering that will fit with customers requirements 
some will need only the infrastructure some may need only the software but some 
will want package that eon can service and manage and earn fee 
enel endesa enel has charging points italy and spain through 
endesa also piloting points latam has focused date charging 
points public places and private areas with other european utilities 
enel makes money charging infrastructure sales and from charging increased 
demand some its charging infrastructure allows third party access where these 
parties can provide long term contracts with the final customer indeed allow the 
third party collect payment for each recharge 
enel owns the development process the infrastructure but does contract 
manufacturers for production whilst installs some the infrastructure itself will 
also outsource this third parties given its recharging infrastructure software and 
hardware designed support smart charging sees little impact the grid italy 
the near term 
national grid national grid ceo john pettigrew commented evs its results 
presentation may grid responded the industrial strategy consultation recently 
the potential for creating strong backbone infrastructure with fast chargers 
noted that fast charger every motorway service station the would lead 
about charging points this could come from the transmission system and would 
ease consumer concerns about range grid has gone further the with number 
tests charging stations new york also looking opportunities

source future energy scenarios national grid 
managing peak demand will important from transmission operator viewpoint 
well that dno the electricity transmission owner and operator the grid 
will focused stresses the system during peak times penetration increases 
frequency control and maintaining power reserve margins will key 
interestingly the impact peak demand the national grid scenarios below the 
sensitivity showed exhibit and exhibit when looking the impact from 
moving the car park evs across european countries this because the national grid 
scenarios assume certain amount hybrids still the system lower demand 
well mitigation some scenarios from shift away from charging peak times 
smart grids and time use tariffs propelling this shift how this will play out 
unclear 
sse sse has been investing time and effort into understanding the impact evs 
highlighted with its work the electric avenue project penetration could 
positive for sse through its networks business reinforcement and maintenance spend 
well increased supply both for wholesale generation well higher demand from 
retail customers 
there was also comment results from the sse ceo alistair phillips davies 
the potential impact evs and the work sse undertaking interestingly given sse 
integrated utility the ceo started his answer with focus the rab potential 
think provides significant opportunity for distribution networks invest probably 
the end the current price control but particularly going into next price control 
they probably present challenge the end the current price control because there 
may not enough money baked there and that sure will conversation that 
have the mid term review how much work should doing went 
further say think difficult say what the numbers are but may the next 
phase big investment within networks and the distribution side 
working hard make sure 
the potential generation impact from greater penetration said and think 
with wide range projects got both onshore like seagreen dogger arklow 
ireland and lot sites that got for gas turbines well high efficiency gas

look the competition friend foe 
look here few examples what companies outside the sector are doing 
deliver charging infrastructure and services that traditional utilities could and are 
providing oems have come together europe help deliver charging 
infrastructure potentially work collaboration with utilities capital goods 
companies are also active you expect they have good working relationships 
with utilities and overlap across many business areas would expect 
collaboration this space well also look couple independents 
show what areas the value chain they are looking this clearly not 
exhaustive list what every non utility doing within the infrastructure space 
but give flavour what competitors utilities are doing 
oems 
oems are clearly overlapping with utilities some degree particularly around charging 
infrastructure whether this will persist open debate until now and for the 
foreseeable future has been the interest oems engage customers buying 
integrated private charging kit will also the interests the oems help 
develop large public charging infrastructure network address the perception that 
range issue for evs dealing with grid management not the natural forte 
oems they will likely need the help utilities with this skill set 
tesla the early days when there was limited visibility standards having the 
charging infrastructure was key selling cars the tesla has made big play 
around its powerwall wall boxes and the benefits owners get from being able use 
public tesla charging infrastructure for free which longer the case but has 
recently signed the charin association that promoting the use the ccs 
charging system therefore possible that future tesla models could have 
wide standard charging infrastructure for public charging this would therefore less 
need for stand alone telsa charging points and less need for tesla actively 
involved charging
