update pond management 
problem with pond management was identified mid february when errors the inventory model 
were detected investigations showed that although the total lithium brine inventory was correct the 
profile through the pond system was incorrect and would result lower forecasted production than 
previously expected 
further investigation showed that the ponds were being operated with some ponds underfilled and 
some ponds overfilled due poor control brine volume transfer between ponds combined this 
resulted significantly reduced concentration effect for the system and consequential build 
inventory the lower concentration ponds well lack inventory the harvest ponds 
response the company has undertaken number steps rectify the issue and improve pond 
operating practice and controls these have included 
rapid rebalancing brine volumes through the ponds which resulted increase 
the area subject solar evaporation and reduction brine depths overfilled ponds this 
has resulted improved pond utilisation and concentration efficiency 
modifications brine transfer systems which will see the increased use pumps deliver 
scheduled brine volume transfers between ponds the first the new pumps has already been 
installed and the plan will see additional five pump stations installed improvements 
brine transfer systems are expected cost approximately million 
new pontoon based pump recently installed provide better brine movement control april 
additionally number improvements have been made are planned the management 
processes through augmenting the operating and process departments with the creation new 
positions pond operations superintendent and senior pond process engineer respectively the 
external recruitment highly experienced person for the former position advanced and the latter 
position has been filled internally part the process described above number external expert 
consultants have been retained improve pond operating practices undertake training and develop 
monitoring control and sampling systems 
these changes are expected deliver major improvements the operating performance the pond 
system 
guidance 
previously advised the half year results the process establishing the correct inventory profile 
volume and concentration will take approximately six months total and such expected 
completed august this year the duration the profiling due the pond system having 
significant inertia and the process occurring during the low evaporation time the year 
the company continues expect half year production the range 
tonnes while production expected rise significantly formal forecast cannot 
provided until bathymetric survey has been completed provide more accurate estimate brine 
volumes across primary intermediate and harvest ponds and more precise basis for production 
modelling 
the bathymetric survey commenced mid april and will take approximately weeks complete 
feature this technology that uses sonar measure the profile the salt precipitating the base 
the ponds beneath the brine 
projects 
orocobre previously advised that production the purification circuit was limited thickener 
residence time post the purified product crystallisers the thickener the final step the purification 
circuit prior product entering the drying circuit solve this issue hydrocyclones have been installed 
remove solids loading from the thickener and increase the overall capacity this solids liquids 
separation stage 
initial results indicate that the hydrocyclones are operating expected and have removed around 
the solids that were previously overloading the thickener the hydrocyclone project was completed 
budget for million 
prior installation the hydrocyclones the purification circuit has achieved maximum throughput 
rate tonnes per day tpd and runs consistently tpd nameplate the 
hydrocyclones are expected allow the purification circuit achieve nameplate capacity 
approximately tonnes per day 
the primary circuit consistently runs above nameplate capacity with maximum achieved throughput 
tpd some above nameplate

brine inventory 
the end the march quarter brine inventory was approximately tonnes lithium 
carbonate equivalent 
brine gathering pond olaroz lithium facility 
market and sales 
lithium carbonate sold the march quarter totalled tonnes increase the december 
quarter lithium carbonate prices increased tonne for the quarter increase 
excess tonne the weighted average price achieved the december quarter 
tonne fob the price achieved result higher pricing short term contracts this 
quarter compared last and increased price moving into 
lithium market 
remains the company view that short term market fundamentals remain strong 
the supply side remains tight with new supply spodumene concentrate from hard rock producers 
australia being delayed one very recent case direct shipping ore dso has been supplied the 
dso will require more processing china order produce suitable spodumene concentrate and 
the acceptance this lower grade form further illustrates the strong demand for lithium and impact 
supply delays high grade concentrate from hard rock operations and lithium carbonate from brine 
operations 
the chinese domestic spodumene and lepidolite market was equally tight recent months the cold 
weather hindered production with alack raw material from imported and domestic sources lithium 
note orocobre reports price fob free board which excludes additional insurance and freight charges included cif 
cost insurance and freight delivered destination port pricing the key difference between fob and cif agreement the 
point which responsibility and liability transfer from seller buyer with fob shipment this typically occurs when the goods 
pass the ship rail the export port with cif agreement the seller pays costs and assumes liability until the goods reach the 
port destination chosen the buyer the company pricing also net ttc commissions 
the intention reporting fob prices provide clarity the sales revenue that flows back sdj the joint venture company 
argentina 
carbonate producers the qinghai province reportedly shut down and decided prolong 
maintenance periods asian metals march 
while chinese domestic spodumene concentrate expected become increasingly available the 
weather warms china recent annual production has not exceeded tpa lithium carbonate 
equivalent lce china minimal domestic supply and the slow ramp imported materials mean 
any new conversion capacity unlikely well utilized until supply improves 
market growth 
research development and the rapid expansion lithium powered products supports the views 
customers that there will significant growth the battery market over the next few years which will 
key demand driver for lithium carbonate and hydroxide 
lithium carbonate from the olaroz lithium facility sold range markets across spread 
geographies orocobre intention continue cultivate diverse customer base end use and 
geographic sales base however the pace growth the battery market expected increasingly 
impact our customer mix the future particularly once the purification circuit approaches design 
production rates and the planned lithium hydroxide plant operational japan 
argentine export data 
orocobre recently undertook investor road show during which number groups indicated they 
have been following the administracion federal ingresos publicos afip export statistics from 
argentina the company recommends degree caution applied the interpretation afip data 
over the longer term the actual exports and the afip export data will broadly line but 
live monthly and quarterly data subject variability 
the variability could due corrections afip numbers made post export such changes 
volume price data exports not recorded the month export early late and 
duplicate counting exports 
way example the afip data for the month december overstated the volume 
exported the march quarter demonstrated variations january and march 
common for customs data any country reviewed and corrected ongoing 
basis hence variability between customs data systems and actuals will occur

lithium hydroxide plant japan 
update progress 
during the scoping studies for the expansion the olaroz lithium facility construction lithium 
hydroxide monohydrate lioh plant argentina was considered based the chemical 
composition the lithium carbonate produced from the primary circuit basic process design 
and quotations were received for supply major equipment for tonne per annum lioh 
plant from three specialized engineering firms that have designed and constructed similar plants 
several parts the world decision based these studies and results was taken refine the 
project scope building plant japan reduced scale tonnes per annum 
visit the laboratories and pilot plant installations the three pre qualified companies was 
completed january well several meetings with their subsidiaries japan two companies have 
been shortlisted and are both undertaking test work with olaroz primary and lime from 
japanese suppliers this will permit the process engineering design finalised after the test work 
has been finalized one the companies will selected the engineering partner part the 
selection criteria that the plant would turn key including commissioning and personnel training 
with process product quality and performance guarantees 
lithium hydroxide currently sells significant premium compared lithium carbonate one tonne 
lithium carbonate makes approximately tonnes lithium hydroxide monohydrate with 
approximate conversion cost tonne 
capital requirements and timing 
the capital cost the lithium hydroxide plant japan will approximately million prior any 
government incentives expected that the funding will involve project debt and potentially offtake 
financing the project also eligible for government incentives least the expected capital 
expenditure orocobre does not anticipate the need raise equity capital for this project 
subject joint venture approvals and finalisation financing and permitting construction could 
commence november with commissioning months later 
expansion study for olaroz 
the phase expansion investment decision remains dependent achieving phase design production 
rates and the expansion being funded without further equity capital funded project finance and 
stage operating cashflow 
revised scope phase expansion studies 
december orocobre announced the results scoping studies into the expansion olaroz 
and the proposed doubling production cost million including million 
contingency subsequently these plans have been simplified remove the purification circuit from the 
incremental production the resultant product mix tonne per annum battery grade lithium 
carbonate from the existing purification circuit and tonne per annum industrial grade 
lithium carbonate avg which tonne per annum will used feed the planned 
tonne per annum lithium hydroxide plant japan 
this simplified strategy results lower capital expenditure approximately million including 
million contingency and lower implementation risk the project based around simple 
duplication the bores ponds and primary circuit phase olaroz should noted that the full 
cost the pond system contained within the total capital expenditure estimate for phase 
million 
late following site visits five engineering firms were pre qualified for the olaroz lithium 
carbonate expansion and following receipt proposals ausenco has been selected the process 
obtain the necessary permits and approvals for phase has commenced and running concurrently 
with engineering and design work the expansion studies are not managed the sdj operating team 
but consultants and dedicated study manager

low cost lithium carbonate 
the olaroz lithium facility has low environmental footprint because the following aspects the 
process 
the process designed have high processing recovery lithium with its low unit costs the 
process will result low cut off grades which will maximise resource recovery 
the process route designed with zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored 
permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds the end the project life the ponds 
will capped and returned similar profile following soil placement and planting original 
vegetation types 
brine extracted from wells with minimum impact freshwater resources outside the salar 
because the lithium sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are 
limited the salar itself this different from halite hosted deposits such salar atacama 
salar hombre muerto and salar rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface 
permeability and the drawdown cones can impact water resources around the salar affecting 
the local environment 
energy used concentrate the lithium the brine solar energy the carbon footprint lower 
than other processes
