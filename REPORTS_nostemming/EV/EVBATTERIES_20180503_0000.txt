executive summary 
china battery value chain potential beneficiary the 
global boom will likely see secular growth volume 
penetration increases over the next decades however will also face oversupply issues and affected 
different degrees the subsidy cut leading margin 
contraction such favor the players that are best 
equipped combat margin pressures and exhibit bottom 
line growth 
separator one the key components lithium ion batteries 
placed between the cathode and anode terminals help prevent 
the current from short circuiting there are dry type and wet type 
separators compared dry type wet type much thinner allowing 
higher energy density batteries 
electrolyte and graphite anode components are least preferred 
think margins will likely decline materially the medium term 
given excess capacity already place and further newbuilds the 
prefer leading ncm cathode producer easpring despite aggres 
prices both graphite and electrolyte components are already 
sive capacity expansion plans industry players believe leading 
declining 
ncm cathode producer best placed protect margins thanks 
product mix improvements believe easpring the leader 
battery makers are affected most the subsidy cut based 
cathode technology will benefit from china bat 
financial results within the value chain battery makers have 
tery upgrade cycle and increase the proportion higher margin 
been most affected the subsidy cut due their relatively high 
sales its product mix the next three years besides 
margins and direct links oems supply chains for other segments 
the company client exposure top global battery makers should 
such cathode anode and electrolyte margin moves correspond 
result solid volume growth along with robust battery demand 
more their respective supply demand dynamics think leading 
chinese battery companies will defend margins via higher bargaining 
also like wet separator player chuangxin new material 
power this year thanks the new subsidy scheme that favors more 
chuangxin has significant cost advantage the battery sepa 
advanced products battery volume increases and cost reductions 
rator market thanks its innovative technology with capacity 
should add further support please refer our recent report sub 
sqm for single line most peers have single line capacity 
sidy dims but earnings can recharge for details

anode and electrolyte production the company 
owns cathode capacity anode capacity

provides cathodes top global battery producers 
including catl and samsung sdi also has solid 
anode customer lineup including catl and chem however for its electrolyte business has not penetrated top 
battery companies supply chains and its business 
this segment volatile with slim margins don think

advantage attempting provide one stop service for 
battery companies and also not advantage across

expanding ncm exposure improving sales mix and margins supported prime marketing channels shanshan plans expand its 
ncm cathode capacity meet strong demand driven china battery upgrade cycle shanshan says that its new project ningxiang 
phase began operation with capacity 
and the company also commenced operation for its 
ningxia shizuishan project which has capacity 
further the company plans continue build new 
lines for changsha between and with 
total planned capacity and phase capacity 
end 
shanshan cathode segment will likely see margin improvement

ncm nca battery and component producers solid state bat 
next few years due the subsidy cut result they are likely 
teries apply solid state electrolytes rather than liquid electrolytes 
attempt reduce raw material prices including separators 
they may not require separator between cathode and anode pre 
save costs for top battery companies such catl and 
vent short circuiting though some academic research reports indi 
guoxuan have cut separator prices significantly after chuangxin fur 
cate that solid state batteries also need ceramic separator 
ther reduced separator production costs however think the spot 
however this technology still the experimental stage and could 
price should remain high thanks significant support from high cost 
years away from commercialization our view given the long 
capacity japan and korea 
development history lithium ion batteries from invention commercial production 
potential increase competition many new entrants china plan 
launch new capacity the next few years attracted the sepa 
addition ncm batteries with grade are able double the cur 
rator business high margins though the recent price cut borne 
rent range and lower the manufacturing cost parity with ice 
chuangxin has cooled sentiment some degree possible that 
cars much easier path follow compared the effort required 
increase market competition could lead price war the 
for solid state battery development 
future while note that the new entrants haven been certified 
top battery companies yet they could become threat chuangxin 
also the energy storage market unlikely use solid state batteries 
when they make progress terms quality and cost reduction 
given the high cost lithium ion batteries are good enough for energy 
storage requires long rechargeable recycle and low costs 
rather than high energy density which needed evs for longrange travel

helps improve cathode energy 
the most advanced technology chuangxin the only company 
wet process segment landscape japan producers have domi 
able build and operate sqm size single capacity line 
nated the market thanks high technical entry barrier involving 
chemical formula equipment design and precision casting they 
cost leader the company has the lowest production cost due 
account for half global market share now the other hand chi

what are cathode materials and how are 
they produced 
foundation 
exhibit 
cathode active material production process 
cathode active materials are one the three main chemical elements dictating the properties and performance battery cell 
along with the anode and electrolyte the cathode facilitates the 
charge discharge process battery therefore depending the 
materials used will influence properties such energy density 
kwh power density cost kwh safety and cyclability 
simplistically put the production process involves grinding the various metal salt precursors before compressing and baking these 
materials large ovens high temperatures reality more 
complicated ensure the quality the material and account for 
additional alterations the materials such coating and doping 
global cathode supply large portion capacity additions 
coming from chinese producers believe china sees the potential 
achieving global leadership plug hybrid vehicles and has 
been moving build its own supply chain centered lithium ion 
batteries and other components support the industry the strong 
growth china recent years has seen many cathode material 
producers change their focus from portable electronics the high
