cathode evolution what are the 
risks from new capacity 
the revolution attractive growth story but see 
risk ignoring the evolving supply story explore the 
competitive landscape and potential disruption that cathode 
capacity additions could have current market dynamics 
with all the cell components the cathode material market expected grow 
meaningfully the coming years from demand acknowledging this attractive 
outlook also examine the supply side risks from significant extra capacity 
technology improvements and increasingly competitive production backdrop 
cathode capacity additions look set accelerate materially since 
june have identified significant number additional cathode 
ncm nca capacity projects come online between and well 
new entrants most notably sinochem this capacity wave combined with the 
technology evolution cathode toward higher energy density materials less 
cathode but more kwh could have significant impact industry utilisation 
and turn challenge industry price discipline this similar what have 
seen the separator market this year where prices are down between 
depending grade consequence material capacity increases 
china strategic investment evs should not overlooked near term china 
will make over demand for evs and battery capacity globally china 
aspiration the global leader proliferates throughout the whole supply 
chain and the cathode market exception chinese producers technical 
competence continues progress with many players now providing material 
korean and japanese battery manufacturers while investment scale continues 
accelerate cathodes well raw material refining 
could the market demand cast eye out the 
market dynamics appear more challenging even under the more bullish our 
scenarios where demand pulled forward and supply lags 
significant capacity ramps ncm nca cathode capacity being front loaded 
build out capacity for future demand even our most bullish scenario 
this could still see supply demand similar position that seen 
fast growth industries solar electronics the past 
how play the opportunity given our concerns around the risk cathode 
materials commoditise with associated price deflation believe investors 
should ascribe greater value those companies investing the development 
future materials where valuations don yet reflect the potential upside johnson 
matthey rather than those investing large scale capacity today where 
valuations not appropriately discount the risks commoditisation umicore

cathode materials not discounting the risks 
how does our view the cathode material market differ from consensus while 
not dispute the volume growth expected evs and therefore for battery materials 
question whether the supply chain risks are being appropriately discounted the 
market this was never more apparent than umicore recent success raising 
additional capital modest discount last close price invest 
into additional cathode material capacity this note examine some the risks 
well exploring number scenarios how this may play out 
key questions 
are cathode materials commodity 
can china become the global market leader 
when will supply expansions become visible the market 
are cathode materials commodity 
believe for the most part oems intend dual source some instances trisource cathode materials the market develops and see this evidence the 
substantial fungibility cathode materials this even visible the kwh 
vehicles using the same generation battery materials today believe differentiation 
between the producers not based access technology but instead focuses 
the production process quality control and the availability and quality input 
materials don see any these longstanding barriers the industry rapidly 
industrialises most apparent china 
what are cathode materials how you produce them 
cathode active materials are one the three main chemical elements dictating the 
properties and performance battery cell along with the anode and 
electrolyte the cathode facilitates the charge discharge process battery 
therefore depending the materials used will influence properties such 
energy density kwh power density cost kwh safety and 
cyclability 
simplistically put the production process involves grinding the various metal salt 
precursors before compressing and baking these materials large ovens high 
temperatures reality more complicated ensure the quality the 
material and account for additional alterations the materials such coating 
and doping 
exhibit cathode active material production process 
source journal power sources vol pages 
lower energy dense materials commoditise first would expect lower energy 
dense materials commoditise initially given the material stability safety cyclability 
less concern for commercial applications however are seeing increasing 
competition with each step along the technology roadmap ncm 
with some producers repurposing skipping entirely the production less 
energy dense materials ncm based our channel checks expect significant 
mix shift ncm cathode materials this year with significant capacity 
addition either having ramped the end ramping now 
ncm next given increasing concerns over cobalt the industry looking 
accelerate the adoption ncm which has the potential greatly reduce the cost 
improve performance and importantly reduce the oem risk over cobalt availability 
although the roadmap clear there are still technological challenges 
manage optimise produce these higher energy dense materials today making unclear 
whether they will produced scale near term however note that leading 
chinese cathode producers have now ramped pilot scale plants ncm with their

they expected producing material volumes ncm batteries years pilot

batteries that will used models the company acknowledged that this 
tight window but stressed the industry focus make the shift given concerns over 
cobalt availability and price believe the consensus view for materially later 
adoption period and slower rate 
technology and innovation may demand premium but what base the rate 
innovation will crucial staying one step ahead commoditisation but there may 
near term technology ceiling for ion are concerned that current cathode 
materials ncm and even next generation ncm materials will 
commoditise rapid pace given the level market competition and intended 
expansion plans while would expect the technology leaders best placed 
push the technology boundaries existing materials there risk that current ion 
technology will reach ceiling where the incremental performance improvements 
longer justify the cost 
possible technology disruptors 
solid state lithium this often perceived the natural progression current liion batteries with the ability store twice the energy although there are some 
concerns over the loading capabilities and production costs ion solid state 
batteries continue use current cathode materials but typically replace the 
anode with lithium and use solid electrolyte limitations include material 
degradation the anode short cycle life and poor thermal operating range 
fuel cells the increased focus evs has raised interest fuel cells again fuelcell vehicles typically run off hydrogen and while range and power are less 
limitation the infrastructure build out remains the greatest hurdle material 
limitations include fuelling infrastructure and energy efficiency liquifying 
hydrogen transportation 
lithium sulphur lithium sulphur often cited the long term solution given its 
very high specific energy about three times that conventional 
lithium ion battery the other advantages are the relatively low cost raw 
materials specific power density and good cold temperature 
discharge characteristics well low temperature charging 
limitations include material degradation low cycle life and self discharge 
high voltage lithium ion much research going into next generation ion 
increase the operational voltage and therefore energy density while not 
compromising the stability the cathode material this includes alternate 
material structures olivine spinel and material doping increase stability 
higher voltages limitations include reduced cyclability and material degradation 
high voltages 
lithium air lithium air believed offer the energy density 
conventional ion battery the theoretical specific energy lithium air 
would par with gasoline fuelled vehicle widely 
acknowledged least years from commercialisation and only some 
the material challenges can overcome limitations include material degradation 
due air purity short cycle life and poor thermal operating range 
and many others 
where could wrong the supply side believe that cathode materials will 
not commoditise think you have assume that chinese cathode producers are not 
able obtain quality raw materials advance their production equipment and 
processes and prove quality and consistency finished product the other side 
the equation demand could simply continue outrun supply 
can china become the global market leader 
evs are strategic importance china china intends continue lead the global 
revolution given three strategic pillars improving china competitiveness the 
global auto industry market addressing inner city emission concerns and 
reducing reliance oil imports improve self sufficiency the ade china 
blueprint clearly details china intention the global leader across the complete

improvement energy density compounds the oversupply risk believe the industry 
shifting quicker than many expect nickel rich materials ncm which 
increasingly consistent with the message from automotive oems both europe 
daimler and china byd example moving from ncm ncm 
would see energy density the cathode improve from 
improvement this means additional future capacity will supply more kwh than has 
been seen historically similarly there will the potential for meaningful 
debottlenecking from existing assets 
chinese market dynamics differ europe and north america 
china set make installed gwh demand playing 
central role unlike the korean and japanese battery manufacturers the chinese 
producers renegotiate cell component pricing each year this important because 
increases market transparency around pricing also allows for greater 
competition between producers which turn could lead deflation the most 
recent evidence for this has been separators where sizeable capacity additions 
from shanghai semcorp have led price decreases 
depending the various grades they looked take market share and 
fill this additional capacity 
umicore has been very clear regards the market tightness experienced 
which consistent with our models also likely remain tight least 
the first half the year and think most likely support umicore pulled forward 
guidance however look out into the market dynamics appear more 
challenging even under our more bullish assumptions significant capacity ramps 
ncm nca cathode capacity being front loaded with the aim build out capacity for 
future demand which our bullish assumptions could see supply 
this reflects something similar what has been seen fast growth industries
