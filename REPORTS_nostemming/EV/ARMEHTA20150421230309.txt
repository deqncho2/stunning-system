the world most valuable company were design and engineer 
car are convinced would battery electric propulsion 
system apple potential sponsorship the far beleaguered 
technology could have transformational ramifications for the 
industry 
simply cannot imagine apple developing internal combustion 
engine vehicle now think further ever since apple top secret auto 
efforts rumored code named project titan started getting attention 
the mainstream media the autos shared mobility team has been 
flooded with questions about precisely how apple would approach autos 
potential partnerships and competitive considerations what have not been 
asked about the impact the market apple were throw its full 
investment weight and creativity behind electric transport 
ecosystem how significant could that very very significant our 
key thoughts the topic 
increases scale evs currently account for less than global auto 
shipments and the pace adoption has fallen far short most predictions set 
years ago sharp decline fuel prices and rapid improvement prevailing 
internal combustion tech have pushed out pay back periods typical 
high years one can assume apple foray into vehicular mobility 
would have aspirations for the mass market transportation and platform for 
its broader ecosystem devices and content our opinion wouldn take 
much multiply the size the entire annual market with successful 
commercialization mobility service enabled existing technology and 
executed master human machine interface 
doubles development efforts for much the past months 
have noticed much the global auto industry pulling back delaying 
development favor other pursuits autonomous safety platform 
engineering hmi etc see our note from may tesla motors inc evs are 
dead long live tesla apple sitting nearly cash amount 
materially excess that the entire global auto industry combined 
imagine even small portion these funds were put use with collection 
scientists and software engineers transport application 
broadens consumer acceptance with the notable exception tesla the 
majority auto company efforts commercialize evs have been packaged 
unexciting mundane ways that betray the natural safety and performance 
attributes electric vehicles consumers were offered car service

physical infrastructure charging and service stations believe there 
could far more opportunities adopt apple car mode transport 
apple natural advantages connected devices software development 
machine learning and energy storage can all applied help make evs that 
can perform better cheaper safer with the ability learn with over the air 
software updates over time 
offered significantly reduced cost the consumer one the 
biggest impediments the mass adoption evs current cost per kwh 
the prohibitive cost relative the prevailing internal combustion system 
setting aside government incentives one can easily spend more 
for vis vis comparable internal combustion vehicle and save 
year implying year payback for the premium paid this ignores 
other disadvantages evs such charging time and lower density 
charging stations the primary reason for the elongated payback period that 
the prevailing model vehicle ownership cars are driven only hour 
day average around miles year now imagine massive fleet 
evs were managed business offering uber like service shared 
mobility model what under such model the cars were used hours per 
day miles annually the payback period could collapse 
year payback becomes years year payback becomes years applied 
transportation service with cost per mile revenue model the excess cost 
the battery tech can amortized faster resulting order magnitude 
improvement affordability per mile the consumer this precisely what 
morgan stanley technology hardware team led katy huberty believes 
apple has planned for project titan see our note from feb apple auto 
world most valuable company meets most disruptable industry 
natural fit with autonomous all electric car lends itself 
autonomously driven car autonomous car the multi domain controller 
mdc the electronic brain the car that replaces the driver connected 
and controls virtually every hardware component the car including the 
powertrain the autonomous car was powered regular ice engine and 
transmission this would mean hundreds different mechanical components 
supervise which has quite literally one mechanical component the 
motor and battery that already electronically managed the complexity 
autonomous significantly lower than autonomous ice engine car 
secondly autonomously driven car helps overcome some the 
impediments electric driving improved range through smoother driving 
and self charging while the occupant away 
will apple have become battery manufacturer make evs 
not think think apple approach ev can mix their own 
approach smartphones well tesla approach batteries tesla has 
been able make evs work not using the state the art cell chemistry 
quite the opposite tsla cell relatively primitive but instead 
developing the industry best battery management system which the real 
secret sauce the tsla battery management system primarily responsible 
for maximizing range and safety apple takes similar approach with its 
smartphones systems integrator and sometimes uses off the shelf 
components but maximizes battery life and performance designing its 
own processors operating system etc believe developing the best battery

key investment implications tesla frequently get asked apple

felt apple wanted develop line human driven high performance sports 
cars don and don expect tesla the business autonomous 
mega city pods for quite some time come either aside from having new
