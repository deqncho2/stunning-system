raise our price target faster adoption nmc battery materials 
increase our ebit estimates reflect the acceleration 
demand for nmc materials ternary nickel rich materials become the choice for 
automotive batteries also reflect higher valuation for the battery materials 
business within our sum the parts line with the rating seen other 
exposed names our bull case moves assuming that the cathode 
material market grows with umicore taking material share our bear 
case remains and reflects more negative view the value generated from 
growth with price declines offsetting some the volume growth well 
protracted ramp the recycling capacity expansion 
electric vehicles pricing all the credit none the risk today report 
cathode materials conclude that while cathode material technology roadmap 
will provide fit for purpose solution technology step change will needed 
drive fit for the future solution while umicore market leader 
question the value ascribed capacity additions given near term challenges 
from rapid capacity expansions increasing chinese competition nascent evolving 
market contract structure and near term technology limitations the last 
months capacity expansion has accelerated among chinese and european 
producers with basf the latest announce investment nickel rich 
cathode materials think this rate expansion fit for purpose materials 
could speed the rate deflation across the battery supply chain 
valuation uncompelling stay underweight the shares have rated 
the last months disconnecting from the business fundamentals where 
have seen little change consensus the shares trade instead line with the 
thematic consensus expectations look too rich over the near medium term 
with the shares and ebitda premium 
the sector expect returns compress further capex runs high well above 
depreciation particular are concerned over the returns profile umicore

cathode material risks not properly discounted 
umicore battery material division has driven material rating over the last 
months investors most notably europe have sought opportunities gain 
exposure the growth thematic this rating has added somewhere close 
equity value which ascribed automotive batteries would put the energy 
and surface technologies division ebitda estimate while 
expect the company grow the top line remain more cautious what returns will 
achieved and the value being ascribed the market given the risks facing fit for 
purpose capacity explore these detail our depth report cathode

what does umicore 
umicore battery materials business sits within its energy surface technologies 
division also included this division its cobalt and nickel refining business which 
refines precursor material umicore has long history consumer electronics 
cathode material and the market leader lithium cobalt oxide lco cathode 
materials from technology and capacity standpoint umicore has been invested 
most other cathode technologies some point time and has accelerated its 
investment nickel manganese cobalt nmc primarily for automotive 
applications umicore exited from lithium iron phosphate lfp cathode materials 
selling its stake joint venture belife its partner prayon within umicore

umicore has been active building its position fit for purpose materials 
umicore nmc cathode material business recently acquired number nickel rich 
nmc patents from most likely making the majority the intangible additions 
reported which totalled this family licences provides the blueprint 
for nmc and and will run depending the licence 
umicore has also announced relatively short space time two expansion plans for 
nmc cathode material that will increase its current capacity sixfold the first expansion 
set ramp during and will treble capacity from today 
cost the second capacity expansion will then double the total capacity 
adding further cost and will start available 
are the risks fit for purpose capacity being appropriately discounted our indepth report cathode materials also published today unearth some interesting 
observations that not believe the market has yet factored relation 
umicore these include material chinese nmc cathode material capacity expansions 
low capital barriers entry low market visibility given short capacity build time 
possible near term technology ceiling for nmc materials unclear contract 
structure with some platforms approving multiple materials and aggressive industry 
cost roadmap with the investor debate often centred terminal value question 
the consensual view that nmc will the lasting technology while nmc technology 
fit for purpose and will help reduce costs kwh belive that the fit for 
the future technology that will really add value and generate decent returns

growth likely cannibalise other parts the business often overlooked 
investors our view the risk that growth poses the remainder umicore 
portfolio increased penetration will have negative implications for catalysis the 
penetration rate vehicles requiring autocatalysts declines this mix shift also has 
connotations for the recycling business longer term with the key demand driver for 
platinum and palladium being driven autocatalyst demand which receding could 
detrimental availability and price 
what the bull case our bull case predicated largely the industry failing 
innovate leaving nmc the material choice and the global cathode material 
market growing cathode making the total battery cost 
also assumes that umicore takes disproportionate market share whereas chinese
