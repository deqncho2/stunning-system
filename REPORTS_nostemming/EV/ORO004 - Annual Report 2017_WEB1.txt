dear fellow shareholder 
this has been another year significant progress 
report our maiden operating profit and firmly establish 
our position global lithium carbonate supplier 
our focus underpinned our commitment our shareholders optimise 
the value your investment maximising the opportunity from our existing 
and prospective resources this while ensuring the long term interests and 
wellbeing all our stakeholders are protected and enhanced giving particular 
focus the communities which operate 
have worked create company that 
delivers the potential the olaroz resource and exploits its full potential 
not only meet the demands the growing lithium market but make lasting 
positive change the communities which operate 
employs the principals shared value through the pillars education

the olaroz operations generated total sales revenue million 
basis and orocobre recorded net profit after tax million 
orocobre has strong balance sheet with net attributable debt june 
reduced million from million june 
was disappointing downgrade our production expectations during the 
year primarily due pond management issues and inventory distribution the 
effect this will continue into the early part this financial year however 
expect production increase significantly the december quarter resulting 
from increased evaporation rates through spring and early summer and the 
increase inventory the harvest ponds continue learn and develop 
our operating practices olaroz and comparison other lithium facilities 
remain pleased with the overall ramp process continue investigate

these robust demand dynamics have

sometimes unpredictable challenges 
the risks involved raw material 
operations processing supply security

the recent funding arrangements 
hard rock projects demonstrates that

significant 
long life assets 
borax argentina has operated the 
salta jujuy region for over years 
and its operations include three open 
pit mines concentrators refining 
capacity and significant land holdings 
the mining operations are located 
tincalayu porvenir and sijes 
the products produced borax 
argentina can divided into three 
groups being minerals refined 
products and boric acid the minerals

current operating 
environment 
costs have been 
higher than 
expected margins 
have been lower 
expansion studies 
underway 
historically produced are ulexite 
colemanite and hydroboracite 
ulexite has traditionally been used 
feedstock for the production 
boric acid however hydroboracite 
now the primary feedstock allowing 
for lower cost production and 
product with lower chloride content 
produced hydroboracite and 
colemanite are supplied into the 
ceramic market and more recently 
hydroboracite into agricultural and oil 
and gas markets the refined products 
are comprised borax decahydrate 
borax pentahydrate and borax 
anhydrous these refined products 
have applications wide range

the economic environment 
argentina has proved difficult the 
past financial year due inflation 
impacts not being completely offset 
currency devaluation resulting 
cost pressure this symptomatic 
the economic transition period being 
experienced due the economic 
reforms implemented the new

reforms although positive nature 
have created short term disconnect

and currency devaluation resulting 
higher peso denominated costs 
making more difficult achieve 
production unit cost reductions 
production performance 
the focus for borax argentina 
has continued improving 
manufacturing efficiency and 
achieving reductions the unit cost 
production despite the economic 
environment hurdles over the past 
year the business has demonstrated 
track record consistently reducing 
the unit cost production across the 
tincalayu campo quijano boric acid 
plant and sijes operations 
the tincalayu operation produces 
refined sodium borate products 
borax decahydrate and borax 
pentahydrate during the year the 
operation had some production 
process challenges and was 
negatively impacted adverse 
weather conditions during the recent 
winter period 
the boric acid plant has recently 
been producing average 
production tpd with maximum 
production rates tpd achieved 
production costs have also been 
reduced significantly with the previous 
introduction hydroboracite the 
main feedstock last year and plant 
augmentation that occurred during 
the year 
production sijes has been 
reprofiled with focus higherspecification higher value products 
that are sold predominantly into the 
ceramics and agriculture markets the 
tailings from these products used 
feed for the boric acid plant assisting 
lowering the unit cost production

expansion study continues

from its current production capacity 
borax
