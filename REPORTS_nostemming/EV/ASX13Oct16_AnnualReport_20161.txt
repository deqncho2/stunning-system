dear shareholders 
orocobre has made major steps forward the last year its journey 
become world leading lithium and chemicals company achieve this goal 
your board and management team are focussed creating company that 
delivers the promise olaroz and exploits its full potential not only 
meet the demands the growing lithium market but make lasting positive 
change the communities within which operate 
expands borax argentina meaningful contributor orocobre 
financial results and future value 
employs the principals shared value through the pillars education 
health sustainability and employment maintain our license operate 
with our local communities are respected intrinsic element 
the jujuy province and the broader argentine economy 
continues invest our people and their culture integrity 
transparency problem solving commitment and sustainability 
the annual report valuable scorecard and pleased report that 
finished the year strong position with many substantive achievements 
through sheer hard work and innovation our team has brought market 
the first new lithium brine production over years with the knowledge 
and know how have accumulated are confident can expand olaroz 
production capacity possible tonnes with commissioning 
such achievements are far from straightforward and the many new observers 
the lithium market should reflect this when looking new sources supply 
our borax business responded tough market conditions south america 
implementing significant operating and structural improvements restoring 
margin the second half but more importantly developing pathway grow 
and expand our operations and realise the undeniable value the resources 
pricing for borax products appears the low point the cycle with 
our production expansion plans are confident that are well positioned 
when economic conditions and market prices recover 
much has been written about the emerging lithium market some informed 
much not orocobre developed its view the market some time ago and 
remains confident that the fundamentals for lithium demand remain strong 
underpinned growing demand for electric vehicles power storage and 
mobile devices estimate that supply will not readily available and 
that the supply response will slower and more expensive than anticipated 
this augurs well for existing producers such orocobre 
however the year has not been without its challenges and would like 
thank our shareholders who have supported through the capital raising 
process that allowed debottleneck our olaroz operations and continue 
ramp production will work hard over the next few years repay 
the confidence shareholders have placed and achieve our goal 
being world leading lithium and chemicals company particular the next 
annual report orocobre 
few years should see the olaroz 
lithium facility repay loans and 
bank guarantees orocobre 
these funds will support orocobre 
achieving its growth aspirations 
and pursue the opportunities that 
buoyant markets always provide 
are planning the next stages 
growth for our company with 
confidence and the experience 
operating argentina this 
knowledge not easily gained 
and distinguishes orocobre the 
macri administration has laid the 
groundwork for the economic revival 
argentina through number 
reforms including floating the peso 
reduction export duties and 
import restrictions and the removal 
capital transfer restrictions 
for orocobre this has made our 
operations more competitive and 
should expedite the delivery and 
lower the cost our planned 
expansion 
are proud the contribution 
make the communities 
which operate through our 
philosophy shared value our 
businesses argentina employ 
over people directly and 
further support our communities 
purchasing locally and employing 
local contractors and services 
are confident that create

into and are subsequently measured fair value derivatives are carried financial assets when the fair value 
positive and financial liabilities when the fair value negative 
any gains losses arising from changes the fair value derivatives are taken directly profit loss except for the

investment can recognised profit loss and there impairment recycling disposal the instrument 
financial assets can designated and measured fair value through profit loss initial recognition doing 
eliminates significantly reduces measurement recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring 
assets liabilities recognising the gains and losses them different bases 
financial liabilities
