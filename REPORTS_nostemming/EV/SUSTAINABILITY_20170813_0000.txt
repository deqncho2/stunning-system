clean air climate change 
air pollution moving the regulatory agenda due its 
significant health impacts cutting diesel though could 
become hurdle meet industry targets and lead 
heavy fines for car oems 
the clean air agenda gaining momentum over the last months the decline 
diesel has accelerated with regulators taking more actions curb air 
pollution one the key reasons the significant health impacts with 
people dying europe prematurely from particulate matter emissions 
every year according the european environment agency estimates this 
around times the number people killed road accidents the legal 
actions from the commission and ngos are also forcing change with cities 
and countries being held accountable for not sticking legal air emission limits 
this report have collated evidence the increasing regulatory 
developments the space france the country with the most announcements 
with new air pollution sticker systems introduced well the 
convergence diesel and petrol prices and ice ban 
car oems are reacting previously discussed research german oems 
have agreed software upgrades for german euro and cars help 
german air quality improvements addition manufacturers will contribute 
fund finance series measures reduce air pollution cities 
daimler was the first oem announce voluntary fix cars europe wide 
costing attempt avert german city driving bans however these 
solutions are not enough solve air quality issues those vehicles will still 
pollute with real world emissions above legal limits more generally 
expect car oems add new technology meet planned emissions standards 
thus rising the cost ice and accelerating the shift towards evs 
however the diesel decline raises the risk insufficient action climate 
change whilst diesel cars have real world nox emissions levels around times 
higher than petrol cars they benefit from better efficiency per 
compared petrol cars and thus emit less carbon dioxide within the same 
vehicle segment addressing one issue has implications for the other and the 
moment the balance appears shifting towards air pollution due its more 
immediate and direct consequences people 
what does this mean for targets annual improvement rate 
emissions necessary meet the target from current 
levels taking into account diesel share declining from this 
could even reach see different scenarios for how 
this could develop there accelerated shift towards hybrids supported 
new regulatory incentives from countries car oems face heavy fines 
iii the commission postpones the achievement these targets

executive summary 
the clean air agenda gaining momentum 
the road transport sector the largest contributor nox emissions accounting for 
total emissions also the second largest contributor fine 
particulate matter well carbon monoxide the european 
environment agency estimates that and people die prematurely each 
year europe because fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides 
respectively this compares deaths per year from road accidents europe 
and deaths from tobacco air pollution also has considerable economic 
impacts including medical costs and reduced productivity through working days lost 
across the economy the economic cost the health impacts alone estimated the 
commission billion gdp 
believe that the clean air agenda has taken over the priority now from climate 
change given the increasing litigation and penalty risks countries are still not meeting 
the air quality limits and these are less strict than the who guidelines due the 
significant associated health burden france germany italy spain and the have 
received last warning feb from the commission without any action the 
will take those cases the court justice with potentially heavy fines ahead 
ngos are also increasingly suing countries for their poor track record meeting air 
quality limits thus forcing countries react example munich diesel ban 
announcement followed court judgement ordering the city improve its air quality 
planing result legal action taken duh and client earth similarly july

amongst the countries france has made the most announcements recently including 
plan for ice ban from for new cars low emission zones air pollution stickers 
and convergence diesel and petrol prices the european level initiatives include the 
real driving emission testing procedures reduce the real world nox emission gap and 
the euro legislation requiring gasoline particulate filters 
car oems are reacting 
car manufacturers are responding these regulatory developments august 
german oems reached agreement with the german government make 
software upgrades for million german euro and cars help german air quality 
improve see autos shared mobility easy fix aug addition 
manufacturers will also contribute fund finance series measures 
reduce air pollution cities attempt avoid further diesel bans daimler was the 
first oem announce its intention recall cars and update the engine software 
limit nox emissions costing the company million our auto analysts believe that 
these initiatives might cost more for other oems given their sales volume europe and 
the technological hardware differences amongst car oems for more details see who 
can match daimler diesel action july 
believe these solutions will not enough solve air quality issues and rebuild 
consumer trust the aim those software upgrade initiative reduce the vehicles 
average nitrogen oxide output according vda the german automotive 
industry association however note that the euro vehicles still have real world 
emissions times above legal limits and that the german courts might want 
take more drastic measures significantly improve air quality many polls shows that 
germans want their politicians introduce tougher air pollution policies 
some car oems have started question the future diesel but others still expect 
that diesel decline turns around the european automobile manufacturer association 
acea still defends the diesel powertrain and calls for rapid fleet replacement 
euro diesel cars are deemed cleaner provided that they are equipped with the most 
advanced exhaust technology scr which are also more expensive daimler and psa 
are well positioned this front they have been using scr for long time note that 
august bmw daimler and all announced cash incentives between 
trade old diesel cars for new germany which could help diesel share recover short 
term overall expect that overall take from these programmes will limited 
especially for the limited discounts offer from bmw and daimler see autos 
shared mobility environmental incentives few thoughts aug believe 
consumers have already turned against the diesel power train technology and seems 
very hard reverse that trend porsche and volvo have respectively announced that 
current generation diesel engines could last for more details see autos shared 
mobility electric car volvo gets jul might indeed difficult rebuild 
consumer trust diesel cars 
have also seen car oems psa and daimler announcing that they will fit all 
their gasoline direct injection engines with gasoline particulate filters given the stricter 
emission limits coming the introduction the legislation 
september will indeed set tougher emission levels limits for gasoline direct 
injection engines similar other diesel engines and car oems have gradually prepared 
for that the aecc estimate the cost just per car whilst the commission 
more cautious with range per car 
all this contributes making ice more expensive which should accelerate the shift 
towards hybrids the short term and evs the longer term bmw and renault nissan 
are the forefront the moment phev and bev have share and 
further accelerate car manufacturers are also calling for more regulatory support 
either the form tax incentives stimulate demand setting the necessary

however this raises the risk insufficient action climate change 
diesel declines european oems are likely miss its targets given the 
average emissions per europe annual rate improvement 
needed meet the target factor decline diesel share 
from this rate may even need increase 
achieved improvement just 
yet also believe that diesel not the only way reduce emissions 
significant reduction has been achieved the and japan where diesel 
penetration rates are fairly low and respectively the reduction has 
been the most significant japan from 
notably due the high share hybrids new cars the the

what does this mean for the targets 
see main scenarios for how this could develop 
there shift towards hybrids the short term and the longer term 
supported regulatory incentives norway good example follow the 
introduction generous incentives have enabled the country make and hybrids 
represent around half its new car registrations shifting 
hybrids could also the cheapest option comply with regulation for car oems 
diesel cars become more expensive manufacture and hybrid incentives are 
typically significant drivers sales and are already place all major electric vehicle 
markets there are different financial incentives offered governments support the 
growth electric vehicles from tax credits access waivers upfront rebates 
decrease purchases prices and stimulate demand 
car oems may face heavy fines failing achieve targets could result fines

each air pollutant has specific health risk ratio and are generating the most 
health concerns the relative risk air pollutant defined the estimated increase 
pollutant are for for nox and finally for 
has the highest health burden with links cardiovascular respiratory diseases and 
cancer looking particulate matters important note that they are usually 
classified according size categories typically less than equal micron 
referred coarse particles and less than equal micron referred 
fine particles particles less than micrometers diameter pose the greatest 
problems because they can get deep into your lungs and some may even get into your 
bloodstream moreover larger particulates are also more easily trapped into particulate 
filters and the body eliminates most the larger particles inhale beyond the mass 
also critical limit the number particulates distinction should also made 
between primary particles that are directly formed from combustion processes and 
secondary particles formed the atmosphere from emissions other pollutants and 
notably nox therefore the health impacts and nox are correlated the main 
health impacts are well documented and include cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases well lung cancer 
contributes well secondary and mainly associated respiratory 
diseases oxides nitrogen nox the term usually used refer mixture 
nitrogen monoxide colourless and odourless gas and nitrogen dioxide 
red brown gas soluble water normally measured when considering the 
health impacts breathing air with high concentration can irritate airways the 
human respiratory systems long term exposure can decrease lung function increase 
the risk respiratory conditions and increases the response allergens nox also 
contributes the formation secondary and ground level ozone both which 
are associated with adverse health effects 
ground level formed the presence sunlight and other gases also issue 
for respiratory systems ground level ozone not directly emitted into the atmosphere 
but rather formed the atmosphere from chain chemical reactions certain 
precursor gases such nox and and the presence sunlight ozone the air 
can harm one health especially hot sunny days when ozone reaches elevated 
levels causing the muscles the airways constrict addition breathing 
problems can also cause cardiovascular disease 
air pollutants also have other damaging impacts 
exhibit economic cost deaths from air 
pollution gdp 
there are also significant costs associated those health impacts the european 
region including russia air pollution cost gdp trillion according 
who elsewhere the commission estimates that total health related external costs 
were the range billion including direct economic damages 
billion from lost work days healthcare costs crop yield loss and

finally all these air pollutants also affect the environment and can contribute 
climate change nox and can indeed all act greenhouse gases moreover air 
pollutants can affect vegetation directly well the quality water and soil the 
most harmful air pollutants terms damage ecosystems are and 
countries are increasingly taking regulatory actions 
additional european regulation limit air emissions come 
increasing costs 
limit high road nox emissions from diesel vehicles the commission 
introducing the real driving emissions test procedure rde starting from september 
rde will better reflect the actual emissions the road and reduce the current 
discrepancy between emissions measured real driving those measured 
laboratory and will also completed the new test cycle wltc for air pollutants 
and emissions compliance factor will applied enable comparison between 
regulatory benchmark tests and real driving emissions tests the road the tolerated 
differences will september before reducing for 
particles factor will applied september comply with the new 
regulation more robust and expensive aftertreatment systems such selective 
catalytic reduction systems will thus required for car oems daimler and psa are the 
forefront with this they have been using scr for long time 
curb emissions fitting gasoline particulate filters gpfs gasoline direct 
injection engines cars will become required with the introduction 
september all petrol vehicles with direct injection systems will need introduce 
gasoline particle filters gpf reach the particle number limits under euro limit 
which times lower from now this legislation will apply from 
september for new vehicle types and from september for all new vehicles 
real world emission testing will extended cover particulate number emissions 
from gdi gasoline direct injection engines the costs fitting gpf meet euro 
limits have been estimated range studies the aecc estimate the cost just 
whilst the commission more cautious with range per car this 
contributes make ice more expensive and support the shift electric and hybrid

clean air moves the regulatory agenda could slip 
more effort needs made achieve targets 
the impacts from diesel decline the achievement targets 
diesel engines have been the backbone europe policy reduce car emissions 
these vehicles are typically more fuel efficient and emit less emissions 
per than equivalent petrol powered vehicles within the same vehicle segment per 
litre diesel contains more energy than petrol and the vehicle engine combustion 
process more efficient thus leading higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions 
this one the reasons for the diesel ascension europe the share diesel has 
gradually increased from and peaked new cars registrations 
europe the better fuel efficiency from diesel particularly used the upper 
vehicles segments shown exhibit the market share diesel has increased for 
larger vehicle segments whilst gasoline dominates for smaller vehicle segments 
our auto analysts estimate that every fall the diesel penetration rate adds 
approx oem fleet average going forward our auto analysts expect the 
diesel penetration western europe decline from thus 
leading potential increase 
exhibit market share diesel vehicle segments 
exhibit emissions normalized nedc 
source icct since the emissions average the has dropped per 
source icct 
however diesel not the only way cut emissions other markets have achieved 
significant reduction without turning diesel highlighted exhibit the 
and japan have succeeded significantly reduce emissions cars without turning 
diesel power trains respectively and diesel penetration 
emissions from petrol cars have gradually reduced through the use friendly 
technologies including engine downsizing turbocharging and gasoline direct injection 
engines the reduction has been the most significant japan from 
notably the high share hybrids new cars 
more efforts need made reach the average target 
improvement rate year until required meet the target 
looking the average performance across new cars sold note that car 
oems need increase the annual reduction rate until they 
are going achieve the average target this looks ambitious when 
compared the reduction just that was achieved 
take into account our autos analysts assumption the share diesel declining 
from this will add another addition the 
average emissions such the annual improvement rate will need increase 
three possible scenarios for climate change clean air 
there shift towards hybrids the short term and the longer term 
supported new regulatory incentives 
shifting hybrids could cost effective way meet the targets the 
regulatory developments make diesel and petrol cars more expensive according 
icct while target could met without significant deployment 
electric vehicles average per vehicle cost increment between and 
compared the baseline they found that exhausting the full potential 
combustion engine technology before transitioning electric drive would 
relatively costly approach for vehicle manufacturers switching sooner from 
conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles plug battery electric vehicles would 
reduce compliance costs per vehicle hybrids appear 
intermediary solution meet targets but expect the rising costs for ice 
mainly push oems towards full with zero and nox and particulates coming 
from emissions 
more policy support needed accelerate the shift towards hybrids and 
ambitious targets and policy support needed reduce consumer barriers number 
countries norway clear leader europe and this notably due the range 
regulatory measures favoring consumers that opt for electric cars those measures 
typically takes the form tax exemptions waivers circulation restrictions 
applicable for all other cars 
norway the best example with hybrids and representing half new registrations
