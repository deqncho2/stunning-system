one the largest capital goods end markets facing unprecedented 
transition with combined capex and spend and sales 
the autos industry ranks top customer for cap goods more 
skewed towards capex historically with autos team believing electric 
vehicles could reach penetration new cars from less than 
this technological shift now key topic auto mentioned four 
times more european oems managements earnings calls than year before 
the level attention the theme however far lower cap goods 
trends from the transition are emerging for capital goods whether this 
coming from the disappearance combustion engine led powertrain removing 
close car metal content including about bearings car 
potential increase terms wiring electrification management content 
there are plenty changes from this technology shift that can affect our 
sector notwithstanding the need for incumbent oems ramp new 
portfolio adding sales the medium term comply with new 
testing inspection requirements new products still while now proven 
can commercial proposition its mass adoption will also depend 
underlying electrical infrastructure notably charging stations 
this long term shift but short term dynamics should not overlooked 
arguably and still evolving market environment the effect the 
transition cap goods seems far away and would agree this probably the 
case for meaningful eps moves driven directly that however think 
investors should not overlook the significant pressure earnings that could 
faced incumbent oems with our autos team expecting ongoing profitability 
deterioration from here under the transition pressure something have seen 
other industries for instance lighting see risk the autos industry may 
want share this burden with its suppliers 
preliminary view potential winners and losers capital goods from the 
transition this stage see abb melco nexans siemens and spectris 
able get new content from themes such testing wiring adas and 
charging station infrastructure the contrary think bodycote nsk 
schaeffler skf and vesuvius have headwinds offset due potential content 
loss notably due their high exposure metal powertrain car

manufacturing changes between

threats opportunities from

content changes 
benefiting impacting capital goods 
why electric vehicle important topic for capital goods 
what the value autos for cap goods one the largest end markets 
the global autos industry generated over sales and estimate 
its capex have reached almost and similar level all data for 
oems only while would expect the content for capital goods related sales 
below think overall capex good proxy for related autos demand 
capital goods while has been historically little impact our sector 
still while autos not the only proxy for earnings performance our sector this 
indeed top customer for capital goods together with metals mining 
utilities and construction and this customer experiencing its first significant 
technological shift over century the transition electric vehicle 
infrastructure possible business 
models support expansion 
case study what learned 
from other technological 
disruption 
assessing the supplier customer 
relationship during the transition 
the shift long term but implies structural changes numerous 
capital goods companies 
fewer than cars sold were evs nevertheless and even though 
business models technology around this industry are still evolving and could take 
long time reach the point where widespread electrical driving becomes reality 
not too early look where capital goods companies could benefit from the 
shift and where they could impacted simply because their customers the oems 
are seeing increased pressure from this transition indicating will not business 
usual 
see clear benefits terms incremental revenues from higher involvement 
the process and testing higher electrification and electricity management 
within the car being player infrastructure charge the cars well ongoing 
existing growth trends robotics and advanced driver assistance system adas 
sensors with key beneficiaries being abb mitsubishi electric melco nexans 
spectris and siemens 
the other hand expectations around are confirmed see pressure 
mounting especially for businesses exposed transforming metals vehicles with 
metals representing vehicle weight and about related 
powertrain the industry tries optimize the weight car see companies 
such bodycote nsk schaeffler skf and vesuvius most risk losing content 
and need finding offset this transition arguably there debate around the 
industry but while oil demand autos driven the fleet metals mostly 
driven new cars sales 
few key numbers 
electric vehicle represented the global annual sales with auto team think this ratio could reach 
the move will remove bearings car internal 
combustion engine ice car with most that coming from the powertrain 
metal ice car weight with that being 
powertrain 
wiring for ice this number could that for 
tesla gigafactory expected produce vehicles this 
about more than average car factory currently 
european oems are step sales for 
oil consumption comes from the use motorized vehicles 
public charging stations the petrol stations 
price charging unit can from 
what the awareness that theme today capital goods seems low 
think the debate around has caught very quickly the automotive sector but because the timing seems far away other topics have taken the limelight recently 
notably metals mining but also industrial digitalization very diversified 
capital goods sector this well illustrated the prevalence not the mentions 
electric conference calls clearly increasing topic autos but seemingly nontopic for capital goods 
exhibit number times the word electric was mentioned ceo cfos earnings calls clear 
focus for oems almost absent for capital goods 
source thomson reuters transcripts euro oems include bmw daimler and volkswagen oems include ford and general motors both covered 
adam jonas and cap goods include siemens skf abb and bodycote 
are surprised this considering the potential impact for some companies our 
sector also while some companies seem have implemented corporate actions for 
instance spectris and its acquisition millbrook abb early launching charging 
station business are surprised have heard little perspectives far the topic 
from the likes skf bodycote for instance our view these companies will have 
come with plan offset their potential loss business from the transition 
could the transition impact capital goods faster than expected think 
possible 
aside from the transition impacting manufacturing content and electrical 
infrastructure which indeed long term shift see case for increased pressure 
the customer supplier relationship between auto cap goods why simply because 
pressure incumbent oems mounting with increased requirements exhibit 
but also tangible risk evs are not profitable until their generation 
well after this long time for incumbent oems bear that pressure and 
see risk they will want share the burden with their suppliers especially those 
providing fairly standard non critical products for which multi procurement 
possible this could the first impact transition capital goods 
how imminent 
oems accelerated their strategies significantly with many new model 
launch announcements for post and some cases ambitious penetration 
targets planning electric vehicles its annual 
sales daimler launched entirely new electric range and even toyota 
which has long focussed hybrids and fuel cells announced plans 
commercialise battery electric car although many questions over evs 
remain believe the sharply rising cost regulatory compliance existing 
internal combustion engines that pushing oems change their strategy 
towards evs much improvements battery technology more oems 
commit launching more evs accessing more consumers think 
penetration forecasts could rise potentially more than three 
times current forecasts see autos shared mobility future car earnings risks

how the emergence electric vehicle will impact capital goods 
about electric vehicles evs were sold global autos sales 
with autos team estimates projecting this reach and 
highlighted our september note numerous capital goods companies 
are involved both the manufacturing and the content cars and this transition 
could potentially change how they supply into the automotive industry look 
below threats and opportunities manufacturing car content but also 
infrastructure support the development penetration 
how will electric vehicles manufactured 
the key question here will there difference the way evs are manufactured 
standard cars and consequences from this technological shift 
generally not see fundamental changes the manufacturing process and its 
order execution evs and standard cars today look very similar shape and 
perform similar functions the main difference being what powers them for instance 
expect all the steps around the press shop body white body shop paint shop but 
also installing the interior the car well glazing rather similar fact while 
the components itself are different current are also seeing the installation the 
battery pack electric motor and inverters made from below the car coming into 
already assembled and painted body this also the way combustion engine 
powertrain and exhaust systems are being installed 
exhibit simplified flow chart car production main change the manufacturing around 
the powertrain 
source morgan stanley research 
what matters increasing scale but also higher requirements and 
inspection 
average standard car requires about hours ready from the start the 
body assembly inspections looking total production capacity almost 
vehicles source lmc auto and close plants globally running 
average capacity utilization means that roughly every minutes car can come 
out average factory about cars per hour nevertheless elon musk tesla ceo 
covered adam jonas and the largest pure player globally planning 
annual output tesla new factory about car coming out 
the factory per minute while not given tesla objectives will fully materialize 
there least aim significantly increase output out single factory 
exhibit tesla gigafactory aims deliver almost times many cars average 
factory 
source lmc morgan stanley research estimates tesla 
meanwhile think technological shift need think new products 
launches currently takes about years develop new model considering 
powertrain off the shelf this last point particularly important developing 
evs incumbents oems are going starting from product concept without 
powertrain which could lengthen the process 
finally considering the radical technological shift how the car powered the 
testing inspection process will need adapted ensure drivers safety 
who risk and who could benefit 
exhibit see siemens better placed get more content the transition takes place 
while kion forklifts use will see little benefits from this shift 
source morgan stanley research 
while not see particularly attractive the classic automation offering siemens 
the transition the automotive industry drivers that business are 
unchanged between ice and evs think the company particularly well placed 
thanks leadership product life management and smart factories the former also 
benefiting renishaw the industry transitions and larger number cars present 
clear differences with the previous way being powered functioned see capabilities 
testing and the ability respond new standards and requirements attractive 
with spectris the first beneficiary that move our coverage finally think 
robotics leaders will benefit from increased focus reaching higher production scale 
the industry notably automating tasks which are today done manually such 
interior assembly 
where are the opportunities for capital goods 
supporting the process build entirely new portfolio 
exhibit european oems fiat chrysler sales increase planned 
historical period and despite strong step already 
source company data morgan stanley research estimates 
expect european oems increase bps over the coming years the 
last years average the industry gearing towards and needs build 
entire portfolio new models think this opportunity for capital goods 
companies involved the product design and development the car from design 
the vehicle and its components design the manufacturing process incl simulation 
prototyping new products testing 
setting new testing and certification relevant for the new technology 
the electrification powertrains for evs and hybrid vehicles requires range new 
approaches automotive testing developed from analysing the performance and 
safety new components such motors batteries relays and inverters adapting 
the more conventional environmental thermal shock and sustained temperature testing 
methods the same way various testing standards have been set for ice those will 
need further developed for evs 
increasing productivity the short medium term with robotics and digitalized 
manufacturing 
exhibit stock robots installed the automotive industry has 
more than doubled ten years 
exhibit annual shipments robots the autos industry has 
surged after 
source international federation robotics morgan stanley research estimates 
source international federation robotics morgan stanley research estimates 
estimate the stock robots operating the automotive industry almost 
units the end cagr during the 
period the same time have seen almost cagr robots for automotive 
sold suggesting accelerated retirement robots installed during the period 
think this was enabled clear improvements robotics technology offering oems 
attractive returns investments but also ease financing and rather healthy autos 
industry since 
still while this picture would suggest the autos industry highly robotized think 
this only partially true indeed according our estimates over robots used 
today the automotive industry are used for the body white part manufacturing 
and for painting the car robotics less prevalent the tasks around the engine for 
small interiors assembly exterior finish and inspections for instance order 
offer solution for these parts the manufacturing the robotics industry has focused 
over the last few years lighter and more precise robots collaborative robots 
able work directly near human labor without fence also while today the 
assembly process around the combustion engine mainly driven human labor 
could think more automated ways around the battery pack for instance move 
towards 
productivity gains will continue key objective for oems especially the 
transition phase where scale evs manufactured sold remain below levels that are 
optimal economically expect increase robotics sales automate further the 
manufacturing process and potentially reach tesla ceo objectives one car per 
minute leaving factory however and address this topic the section below 
forecast this meaningful driver only the medium term the autos industry 
trying increase profitability generation for electric vehicles 
finally car factories get gradually revamped modestly modified for see 
opportunity for the industry adopt more thoroughly digitalization the 
manufacturing process with the capabilities improving predictive maintenance that 
prevents bottlenecks leading well increased productivity highlighted our 
notes digital manufacturing the tipping point and digital manufacturing into 
the light 
where there lack opportunities even long term headwinds 
current factories can used for manufacturing 
disagree with the view the move will boost demand for classic automation 
hardware such conveyor belt motors drives software such plc arguing new 
factories will needed the reality most existing cars factories can manufacture evs 
and have examples today where transitory period between manufacturing both 
standard vehicle and evs possible the same plants illustrated the 
manufacturing the nissan leaf the chevy bolt from economical standpoint 
and unless one would expect overall cars demand boom from here would not 
make sense for incumbents oems have large number greenfield factories for evs 
what would happen then their existing standard vehicle factories the long term 
they would scrapped down for value 
nevertheless expect oems try concentrate manufacturing much 
possible the medium term notably relation the battery pack indeed 
investments are required around the assembly the latter for readily available 
during the car production assembly process however while this can create modest 
additional demand for standard automation the bulk cars assembly process 
remaining the same does not necessarily require whole new set equipment and

increased focus scale could the very long term lead rationalization the 
number plants and demand for automation 
while this long term trend our view see case where increasing level 
automation could lead decline demand for new automation equipment and 
software though maintenance demand will remain but could optimized predictive 
demand mentioned above indeed any modern car plant has already hundreds 
robots today number depending the size and productivity the plant conveyor 
belts plc software and motors drives but ramping portfolio volumes that 
will remain low absolute terms for many years means that there will likely 
increased focus costs and productivity tesla objectives terms scale factory 
output illustrates this trend our view 
increasing factories output can achieved pulling several levers simplifying the 
assembly process increasing productivity human labor increasing overall 
process productivity automating new tasks when automation allows deliver 
higher output than human labor historically and despite variations from one year 
the other these three components have played out together over the years and 
factories have continued produce more cars which were absorbed increasing 
global demand 
exhibit tesla gigafactory aims deliver almost times many 
cars average factory 
source lmc morgan stanley research estimates tesla 
the technology changes and incumbents oems are facing 
profitability challenge front developing completely new 
portfolio low volumes see case for attempting 
increase even further productivity gain reach and increased 
output per plant while believe the medium term the 
addition robots automation can support this objective 
question whether there could point where productivity gains 
alone almost allow sufficient supply from existing installed 
base factories limiting new automation demand 
similarly how many conveyor belt and drives motors will 
needed the future especially for the later part the assembly 
process autonomous driving becomes more mainstream and 
the car powered electrically could the car move itself from 
one station the other under the era previously this was 
not possible have the car being driven within plant due emissions 
managing automation and human labor transition 
often blamed for reducing the size human labor the automotive industry 
automation has also generated considerable benefits terms health safety 
but has also focused human labor towards more value added tasks even 
today robot cannot operate the entire manufacturing process car going 
from stamping final inspections alone human labor needed one question 
that being asked the transition the future human labor currently 
working the combustion engine one hand new skills will need 
developed workers relation the battery pack but also the electrification 
the car this opportunity for employees serving the automotive industry the 
german oems particular seem keen retain much the electric powertrain 
content house daimler and perhaps part due pressure from unions 
the other hand many incumbent oems will not fully active the battery 
pack with some notably general motors covered adam jonas having already 
signaled partnership with the battery chemists for that part the process also 
the nature the battery pack assembly itself our view faster less complex 
than the combustion engine assembly and could more easily automated 
against that backdrop gains ground key question around employment 
current staff could one the many challenges incumbent oems will have 
face 
how the content electric vehicle changing

see more changes terms car content those being related the way the car 
powered but also maximizing the energy use within the car and the ongoing evolution

what matters focusing making the works the most effectively 
when think about the car the future clear the main goal make the 
electricity within the car work and optimize the content the battery capacity 
maximized while there are several levers for the latter lowering the weight the car 
one them for instance today the average car has around metal 
content with about one third that coming from the powertrain engine transmission 
exhaust but wiring also impacting the weight with average car today containing 
wiring metals close the double for premium sedan number that could 
triple with order power the vehicle well infotainment existing 
electronics also need consider ongoing evolution the autos industry especially adas autonomous driving and led lighting these trends have developed 
the conventional world already and not expect change that though growth 
potential still significant today estimate adas penetration 
new vehicles and penetration led headlamps higher for interior lamps 
current fleet 
all all raises the question the balance between the required car performance 
from electrical standpoint but also the structural changes make that work 
who risk and who could benefit 
exhibit see melco well placed terms generating new content followed 
nexans the wiring the contrary metals exposed names face the risk losing content 
new sales while think exposed companies may challenged only the very long term 
source morgan stanley research 
among our universe companies exposed the electrification the car and adas will 
see the biggest benefit our view they fit exactly the industry shift with melco 
and nexans most exposed here see more risks companies directly involved 
transforming metals used the automotive industry metal components the 
content those will impacted the disappearance the powertrain within the car 
with the battery pack and related electrification offering little direct replacement 
opportunities affecting the likes bodycote and the ball bearing manufacturers skf 
nsk and schaeffler finally while very long term demand for oil could impacted 
the transition the fleet size using combustion engine will remain very large hence exposed names should see impact the next decade 
where are the opportunities for capital goods 
ensuring the electrification the car could boost demand for more innovative wiring 
with about volts now flowing through and the car being fully powered 
electricity electrical wiring the car and electrical capabilities bound increase 
significantly even before thinking increased content terms autonomous driving 
and electronics board vehicle 
exhibit high voltage wiring harness system 
source fujikura technical review 
the challenge with increasing the wiring the metal content and especially copper 
content that could multiplied average standard wiring the industry 
moves and result increases the weight the car requiring more energy then 
make sustainable 
see here interesting opportunity for autos cables manufacturers their content 
including the high voltage side into the car could significantly increase though 
partially mitigated for those players supplying harnesses for the engine that will 
disappear however the requirement increasing wiring without metal weight 
increasing too much challenge but could actually lead more innovation the 
industry and potentially better pricing power have already seen some cables 
manufacturers developing cables with mix between aluminium and copper content 
more miniature components connectors trying reduce cabling for less critical 
components the cars minimum typically multimedia and onboard navigation 
systems for instance the nexans datagreen cable 
enabling autonomous driving small driver cap goods but growing 
this typically area where cap goods companies have far very limited exposure 
with strong players this area from the tech and autos sectors however see led 
lighting and semiconductor based light sources having the potential used 
sensors car rather than used solely lights also note some cap goods 
companies are beefing their existing automotive exposure entering some segments 
adas advanced driver assistance systems notably mitsubishi electric melco 
with forward looking cameras adas electronic control unit long range ultrasonic 
sensor 
though capital goods companies are expected get modest share adas 
market which forecast grow cagr from reaching usd 
globally according research firm markets and markets still see this 
exposure attractive adding their current businesses 
where there lack opportunity even long term headwinds 
metals content reduced represents structural headwind the long term 
mentioned earlier believe the powertrain represents average the 
total metal content the car for average value about bit excess 
average vehicle costs goods sold exhibit and the total car 
value from our perspective this content coming with which will not require 
engine transmission and exhaust system axles and electric motors are bringing 
alternative but will not one for one replacement terms value only 
cogs 
also see the potential for some non critical metal components replaced 
alternative materials notably plastics other chemicals order allow the reduction 
weight and therefore optimize the battery capacity ihs had estimated that 
average car was using plastics but that number could reach 
solely match fuel efficiency standards while the latter will become gradually 
less relevant comes into the mix the industry will still have concerned 
the car weight and therefore alternative materials metals could potentially continue 
increase for instance victrex covered paul walsh has already signaled can 
produce plastic gears that are lighter than metal gears 
exhibit basf estimates the plastics content car could from the current almost 
source basf 
what does that mean for capital goods see three areas with structural risks albeit 
medium long term 
ball bearings while ball bearings present the chassis should remain our channel 
checks suggest that world about the ball bearings currently the 
powertrain could disappear mitigated bearings the new electric powertrain 
the total number ball bearings the car this about loss half 
their content for ball bearings manufacturers the next five years their 
addressable market autos could reduce significantly consider 
penetration new sales and 
metals cutting and treatment the overall metal content the car could 
reduced the need for metal cutting and metal treatment may reduce similar 
magnitude

value chain could come slowly under more pressure but this very long term 
highlighted report our team published january the car 
industry currently accounting for oil consumption according the iea and 
arguably one could worry the impact growing industry into the industry 
and its suppliers many which are capital goods companies while concerns metal 
production and related products may seem similar they are actually different the 
industry does not only serve vehicles sold given year but also serves the entire fleet 
cars globally though there indeed aftermarket metals pieces for cars for the 
existing fleet most investors would probably agree that getting the gas station 
probably more frequent than having fix metal piece anyone car

what the infrastructure needed for the electric vehicle 
work 
what matters finding the right business model 
electric vehicles will only work two key drivers are reunited our view 
affordability and reliability the technology for the consumers ease terms 
powering the vehicle without those broad based raise electrical driving will remain 
dream 
the technology seems come slowly together questions remain regarding the 
infrastructure required charge the cars which speed and under which business 
japan for instance there are recharge points many them private 
gas stations but the count only public charging points 
petrol stations and the the doe published number electric stations 
and charging outlets for gas stations but none these countries the 
business model similar and even within the same country business models for 
charging stations may vary 
who risk and who could benefit 
exhibit see abb the potential key beneficiary setting infrastructure for electrical 
transmission thanks its global leading position electrification equipment

large share renewables being currently added the grid supporting our 
view any increase electricity first phase penetration expect investments 
made transmission adapt that though those would taking place even 
without the transition where see more related potential regarding infrastructure

support those with already established offering and global position this 
industry see abb very well positioned this area also combined with historical 
relationship with utilities companies thanks its global leading position power 
equipment prysmian inovance siemens could benefit their power distribution 
business but see this less transformational for these companies 
also highlight the lack defined standard and business models currently for 
charging stations such while think the topline opportunity could attractive 
this incremental for all companies being involved the profitability level remains

their benefits and drawbacks 
charging station sponsored the oems and exclusively used cars that 
brand while this supporting the oem marketing strategy terms feasibility 
driving electrically think this model unsustainable more and more oems 
electric and ultimately would mean the oems would responsible for 
large fleet thousands charging stations 
private charging stations connected private distribution sources think this 
possible and already widespread japan but raises the question having the 
appropriate electrical infrastructure supporting the increased requirement 
energy flows well the management the station itself see this case 
more easily feasible for large and modern buildings whether residential 
commercial 
public semi public network charging stations managed and financed 
governments utilities while this could mean potential for broad based 
installation see potential issue regarding the funds used for that investment could mean that via taxes citizens not using would pay for the network 
used others while would not something unseen for instance with public 
transports could raise questions especially the first stages penetration 
charging stations installed and managed charging stations manufacturers but 
commissioned external entity local government utilities private entity 
such hotel company for instance this model could work but would 
involve the charging stations manufacturers expand significantly their business 
model notably the fleet management and installation 
charging stations commissioned external entity installed contractors and 
operated that same contractor tertiary entity this case each player stays 
firmly where its competence decision lies whether this being supplier 
installer fleet manager that model our view more similar than petrol 
stations but does not offer necessarily the flexibility heterogenous fleet base 
more difficult manage install and may require significant power distribution 
step specific areas 
each case the question remains who gets paid whom and how much the 
electricity needs get paid for unless the society adopts completely decentralized 
generation model which see very far away the hardware and its use needs 
paid for well the installation and the fleet management 
numbers charging stations need increase steeply while requirements the 
grid remains first more modest 
according ihs the range price for charging stations can vary from usd for 
simple domestic wall box usd for charging station without installation 
the latter potentially adding another usd for station 
thinking market size ihs estimates suggest over billion investments 
electrical charging stations installations would needed the alone barely 
reach numbers charging stations roughly equal petrol charging points larger 
countries like china for instance market research reports usd planned 
deployed with global charging stations market potentially reaching usd 
but note other market estimates more modest usd 
highlighting the divergence view what truly needed and feasible 
terms feasibility question that tends come back the capacity the grid 
assume additional electricity demand while this relevant question think spans 
decades similar the concern around indeed penetration for the total fleet 
expected reach auto team while this demand will need 
served note that globally additional electrical capacity with 
from renewables planned added the retirement capacity 
according the iea that backdrop not see immediate pressure power 
generation for the foreseeable future arguably power distribution connections will 
need installed between the grid and charging stations while expect some 
technological innovation increase the speed charging which still tends too 
slow for most users and even more where there are several high speed charging 
points 
also the increase renewable energy raises questions about the best way 
transmitting this energy regardless increased penetration which tends 
more volatile and how that fits with potential charging patterns notably during night 
time where solar energy for instance will not producing and where historically 
consumption has been more modest which may change with this could launch 
the concept energy storage our view with evs being themselves storage base 
indeed thinking long term large fleet evs would possible optimize grid 
loads any time when the evs are not use that time charged station idle 
evs could sending back energy the grid connectivity and iot allowing minimal 
requirement any single but also control how much energy sent order not 
impact the user experience thereafter while sounds far away from current reality 
where the industry still questions business models for charging stations this still 
interesting concept for the decades ahead 
thinking about the transition how this impacts the 
customer supplier relationship 
oems come under pressure this could impact relationships with 
their cap goods suppliers 
similar led lighting the move from analog digital photographs see case 
study section the automotive industry facing meaningful technological 
change and could take few years before goes back normal autos shift 
electric vehicle see risk incumbent oems become more financially 
constrained having one hand step build completely new 
portfolio sustain healthy level capex sustain underlying market but also 
increase productivity and face lack scale and price deflation their new 
portfolio making the business likely unprofitable until reach the third 
generation electric vehicles 
that context whether not product service needed for this shift 
see risk for increased pressure capital goods companies which are suppliers 
the oems meaningful end market for them but also fairly consolidated 
one top oems represent over production investments where their 
bargaining power will most cases rather limited aside from structural and 
long terms risks and opportunities from this transition think this 
headwind many cap goods companies may face the short medium term 
exhibit european oems fiat chrysler sales increase planned 
historical period and despite strong step already 
source morgan stanley autos team research estimates 
the view from autos 
oem budgets are clearly set rise development work evs well 
connected and autonomous cars accelerates the existing business model oems 
control much the value the car design and production all major structures 
most the powertrain major systems integration and design the final product 
well branding and distribution this set change significantly with the move 
evs although the oems will continue control major structures the car overall 
design and branding and distribution they could lose lot their branding power with 
the loss powertrain differentiation with new autos operating system the centre 
the new electric autonomous vehicle the question becomes where the overall 
balance branding power will lie 
potential impact capital goods companies 
capital goods companies have been historically little exposed oems though 
long standing business relationships allowed some partnerships the side often 
times the development aspect with the development product life management 
businesses well increased and faster prototyping have seen over the last few 
years increased exposure 
while capital goods names have here incremental revenues opportunity with 
earnings typically attractive these type businesses believe oems will not 
splurge but will come with clear targets terms maximizing the scope and impact 
their processes comparison and the transition happens think this area will 
the most resilient from bargaining power standpoint for capital goods oems 
need build their portfolio 
capex 
exhibit global autos capex expected remain high level but similar level 
source morgan stanley autos team research estimates 
the view from autos 
believe that the car content changes oems will forced spend more 
but capex less clear this depends their strategies for new sub systems like 
batteries their strategy for platforms integrated into ice technology standalone its investor conference bmw was clear the need for flexible 
architecture that can cope with uncertainties over customer demand powertrain type 
could see period ahead key launches where capex the existing business 
could conceivably fall not currently forecast such change but the german 
oems likely face the greatest capex risks given much higher capex sales and fixed 
assets vehicle the french mass market oems 
potential impact capital goods companies 
the oems focus shifts autos capex expected remain relatively stable 
though high levels highlighted our september note actually see risk 
for this capex the first expenses line risks case too much pressure the 
autos industry shall there from technological market demand related 
standpoint indeed with not much more than capacity utilization across global 
autos factories the need increase capex questionable while can see 
incremental investments significantly step productivity and efficiency think 
those will more focused specific robotics niches lightweight robots cobots and 
digitalization 
that backdrop see standard automation equipment and software risks 
being pressured the autos industry needs achieve savings finance something 
else

source company data morgan stanley research estimates exhibit from future car earnings risks 
the view from autos 
our autos team has modelled the effect sharply rising penetration oem 
earnings future car earnings risks exhibit based long list assumptions 
including forecasts and ice pricing assumptions and operational leverage 
starting ebit margins group autos ebit margins turn negative the mid 
result ice price deflation and costs development continued deterioration 
the ice business due lower volumes from cannibalisation and lower prices 
offsets the improving profitability after despite our cost restructuring 
assumptions however from there the outcome remains very uncertain flexing 
assumptions ice and pricing gross margins and offsets gives ebit 
margin range many these assumptions are likely proved wrong this 
early stage but clear that oem profitability faces huge challenges 
potential impact capital goods companies 
while preliminary this stage considering the almost nascent stage this technology 
commercial terms our autos team initial penetration model suggest the industry 
could see operational profitability turn negative post post years process 
profitability deterioration since this scenario were happen believe the 
market should not too candid thinking oems alone will bear the burden fairly

sourcing procurement possible 
case study what can learn from the history disruptive 
technology 
key conclusions 
the advantage enjoyed the historically dominant player disappears 
breakthrough technology emerges 
companies that come after disruptive technology has emerged can 
successful they have the necessary fire power and technological capability 
price point important although cannot draw universal conclusion 
note that the two examples cited below the price point for both digital 
cameras and smart phones went down significantly pressuring somewhat the 
margin level compared before the technological breakthrough 
case study the demise analogue photography 
kodak dominated the photography market until the start the when digital 
photography started emerge response the changing technology and competitive 
environment kodak which developed the first digital camera also started 
focus digital printing and digital photography however given its size and the 
strength its bonds with its historical business films coupled with the growing 
competition for digital cameras especially from asia kodak margin sank previously 
unknown lows twenty years and kodak filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
period which its share price had fallen contrast canon had risen around
