borax argentina 
borax argentina has extensive operations and fifty year production history producing borax chemicals 
boric acid and boron minerals production currently comes from the principal mines tincalayu and 
sijes with concentrators both locations and chemical plants tincalayu and campo quijano producing 
refined products 
production optimisation projects completed 
the relocation the pentahydrate manufacturing plant tincalayu and the augmentation the borax 
decahydrate plant are due for completion april time and materially budget this project will 
consolidate the production decahydrate and pentahydrate the same location allow for tpd 
production rate borax decahydrate from the current provide lower production costs per unit 
for both decahydrate and pentahydrate and also open options export finished product directly from 
tincalayu international markets via chilean ports 
the changes the flow sheet the boric acid plant campo quijano are track for completion 
may these changes will improve efficiencies and manufacturing throughput and make the plant 
more suitable for processing hydroboracite ores the boric acid plant and the borax anhydrous 
manufacturing will remain campo quijano 
conjunction with these projects there was also production efficiency review implemented 
this has also resulted initiatives significantly improve performance the sijes 
concentrator 
tincalayu expansion study 
expansion study evaluate potential expansion the tincalayu refined borates operation from its 
current production capacity tpa tpa scheduled commence 
anticipated that the scale this expansion will further enhance efficiencies the production 
refined borates tincalayu and contribute improved manufacturing cost per unit this study will 
include the work the gas pipeline already undertaken 
market conditions 
borax argentina has been experiencing some challenging market conditions result the economic 
recession brazil historically its largest market and soft market conditions argentina its second 
largest market previously advised the downturn has resulted downward pressure market prices 
for all borate products and this has been coupled with increased competition from other producers 
although these conditions fundamentally remain brazil there have been some positive results from 
efforts diversify the product and market offering brazil with sales recently developed products 
new customers although changes product mix downward pressure market prices and increased 
costs production usd experienced result the managed ars exchange rate has put significant 
pressure gross margins the recent free float the currency has had positive impact earnings 
borax argentina during the quarter 
sales and market development 
the sales and market development focused product and market diversification and reinforcing 
positions with home market customers based sound value propositions including leveraging borax 
argentina geographic position and the benefits shorter lead times assist customers managing 
supply risk 
operations 
approximately tonnes combined products were sold during the quarter this decrease 
tonnes the previous quarter and decrease tonnes the same quarter last year

for the quarter borax argentina returned being operationally ebitda positive 
positive impacts government policy changes 
the recent argentine government policy changes resulting the removal export taxes and the 
devaluation the currency has had positive impact the borax argentina business through the 
devaluation the operating unit costs terms have been reduced and the removal the 
export duty refined products and mineral concentrates enhances revenue combined these 
impacts will improve competitiveness 
argentine government policy changes 
since taking power december the business friendly government president mauricio macri has 
quickly implemented economic reforms address economic imbalances and deepen argentina 
integration with the global economy exchange and currency controls have been lifted and the

including intellectual property market access and cooperation agricultural matters well 
collaboration shared objectives the world trade organization the united states and argentina 
committed work together expand global trade including working expand bilateral trade and 
resolve outstanding market access issues agriculture and across the full range products and services 
this agreement opens the way for the possible incorporation argentina into the trans pacific 
partnership and the future agreement trade deal between the and mercosur argentina

through the construction and operation its portfolio lithium potash and boron projects and facilities 
the puna region northern argentina the company has built partnership with toyota tsusho 
corporation and jemse the first large scale greenfield brine based lithium project years the 
salar olaroz with planned production tonnes per annum low cost battery grade lithium 
carbonate 
the olaroz lithium facility has low environmental footprint because the following aspects the 
process 
the process designed have high processing recovery lithium with its low unit costs the 
process will result low cut off grades which will maximise resource recovery 
the process route designed with zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored 
permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds the end the project life the ponds 
will capped and returned similar profile following soil placement and planting original 
vegetation types 
brine extracted from wells with minimum impact freshwater resources outside the salar 
because the lithium sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are 
limited the salar itself this different from halite hosted deposits such salar atacama 
salar hombre muerto and salar rincon where the halite bodies have very high near 
surface permeability and the drawdown cones can impact water resources around the salar 
affecting the local environment 
energy used concentrate the lithium the brine solar energy the carbon footprint lower 
than other processes 
the technology developed has very low maximum fresh water consumption which 
low industry standards
