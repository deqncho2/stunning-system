measuring impact climate 
change solution stocks 
continue advance our approach impact investing 
quantifying the positive environmental impact climate 
change stocks from across the globe 
over the last months there has been notable increase the number 
questions have received impact investing the key debates focus around 
measuring impact should externally internally focused what the net 
result the various different impacts and how should this quantified 
this report consider these issues from the perspective climate change 
solution stocks 
there needs positive and material primary impact our view impact 
investing needs begin with companies whose products and services have 
notable positive environmental social impact use our sustainable solution 
stocks database see here identify such companies that generate more 
than their revenues from the provision solutions climate change 
ability quantify the climate change impact varies significantly for utilities 
renewable manufacturers and companies our list there sufficient 
company disclosure necessary data points such amount power 
generated however for infrastructure related companies led lighting 
energy efficiency equipment lack information product volume and 
energy savings renders the analysis impossible 
addressing secondary and tertiary impacts has more qualitative very few 
any stocks will have net positive impact however the extra layer 
analysis subsidiary effects must subjective judgement call based 
whether the additional impacts which there may many are sufficiently 
negative offset the positive effect created the core business even 
struggled find total emissions data for most companies 
top climate change impact stocks are all solar and wind manufacturers 
canadian solar china high speed transmission gcl poly daqo new energy 
and jinko solar our biggest surprises were the negative results for tesla and 
guoxuan high tech where our illustrative calculations suggest the carbon 
emissions generated the electricity required for electric vehicles are greater 
than those saved cutting out direct vehicle emissions

quantifying the impact 
this report continue advance the debate impact investing quantifying the 
positive impact created list climate change stocks 
impact investing and the sdgs the sustainable development goals can 
useful framework for impact investing something have previously discussed 
sustainable development goals measuring impact 
the sustainable development goals address social and environmental challenges 
whilst also aiming generate economic growth importantly the implementation the 
goals focused mobilising investment from multiple stakeholders this will include 
the private sector and thus many companies that feature our interactive global 
sustainability solution stocks database see page for access the interactive the 
companies the list provide products services that help solve one more 
seven sustainability challenges climate change water scarcity waste management 
food availability health wellness improving lives and demographics 
this report take the climate change theme for which have list stocks 
filtering for those with over revenues ebita exposed this theme 
reduced the coverage list companies that can categorised into four groups 
utilities power generation companies with focus renewable sources 
electricity 
renewables manufacturers industrial and technology companies that produce 
various components renewable energy plants principally solar and wind 
transport mix companies with exposure various parts the autos marine 
and aviation industries 
infrastructure industrials companies that manufacture energy efficient products 
such led lighting and air conditioning units 
our interpretation impact focus the primary positive environmental and 
social impact that the products and services sold the company generate 
externally the key primary impact examine from the climate change solution stocks 
the amount that saved using renewable energy more energy efficient 
products 
once this has been determined secondary impacts can considered help form 
view the overall impact created these are directly linked the provision the 
products and services creating the primary impact some examples these are 
utilities environmental impact changing the use land when building power 
plants particularly hydropower facilities 
renewables manufacturers carbon dioxide generated electricity needed 
power industrial facilities make the products 
infrastructure carbon dioxide generated electricity needed power industrial 
facilities make the products 
transport environmental and social impacts mining for commodities needed for 
electric vehicles evs such lithium and cobalt for example water consumption 
human rights 
some investors may also wish consider tertiary impacts this mean all the other 
impacts the environment and society that are generated the company both 
externally and internally examples this might the number jobs created gender 
diversity and amount waste recycled 
for any individual company the number primary impacts will relatively small 
often just one but the magnitude the impact could high conversely there will 
numerous tertiary impacts each with smaller level materiality 
exhibit different levels impact 
source morgan stanley research 
this report have focused the primary impacts and calculated the savings 
achieved from the products and services sold the companies which differ depending 
the region which the company operates sells its products into obviously bigger 
companies are going generate greater savings and then standardise the 
conclusions generated looking what impact investor would helping create 
investing into the company the full results this analysis can found 
exhibit and exhibit 
the top impact companies found are all solar and wind manufacturers canadian 
solar china high speed transmission gcl poly daqo new energy and jinko solar 
perhaps surprising were the negative results for tesla and guoxuan high tech whilst 
the evs and lithium batteries manufactured these two companies indeed help 
reduce direct emissions from vehicles electricity needed power them and with 
their primary markets still largely weighted towards fossil fuel power the 
and china the emissions from this electricity generation are still material 
another recent report from argues though the economics renewables should 
favour shift towards more renewable electricity the future see what cheap clean 
energy means for global utilities july 
also stress that our calculations are based best assumptions for carbon 
emissions saved the actual savings may vary depending inputs such load factors 
and the actual energy mix the countries which the companies are exposed for 
example 
for some stocks has been impossible make the necessary calculations there are 
two key areas where data particularly lacking 
carbon savings per product for manufacturers multiple products difficult 
know what carbon can saved using specific product compared less energy 
efficient version 
volume data some companies report excellent carbon savings data for their 
products but volume data per product also required typically large diversified 
industrials companies only report revenues and often this division rather than 
product line 
were also surprised that only small minority the companies analysed actually 
report their total annual carbon emissions impact investing gains momentum 
look companies increase disclosure these areas

for the utilities sector aim calculate the amount carbon emissions that has 
been saved generating electricity from renewable sources rather than fossil fuels 
order achieve this need make assumptions for the carbon intensity the fossil 
fuel power generation use the current power generation mix country 
six the companies that analyse are renewable pure plays and thus only 
calculate the amount carbon saved 
for those companies with fossil fuel power generation their portfolio then

has proved impossible calculate the carbon savings generated the majority 
the infrastructure related companies whilst many companies may provide data 
revenues from certain products such led lights none disclose the actual volumes 
sold the one exception hannon armstrong which discloses the amount carbon 
believes has offset through its investments 
for now can only provide qualitative data the positive environmental impacts 
that these companies create 
lights 
mls the majority mls revenues are generated the production and sale leds 
which includes led packages and led lamps the company does report volume data for 
led packages however doesn report volume data for its other products such led 
lamps recently acquired osram lamp unit ledvance gaining access distribution 
channels patents and brand business increase its global footprint according the 
department energy leds can reduce energy consumption compared 
traditional incandescent lighting 
epistar pure play led chip company the largest taiwan the firm chip solutions 
can used various applications including lamp led display backlight cob smd 
led etc the company has dominant position globally for four element leds 
which has seen rapid growth due the rise led displays and sensor applications 
november epistar has filed over patents with over engineers 
within its labs 
sanan optoelectronics its three divisions focus the research production and 
marketing led chips and wafers governmental street lighting projects and 
compound semiconductors the company the largest led chip manufacturer china 
and has focus indoor outdoor lighting display backlight and handset backlight 
philips lighting revenues are generated from led based products across two 
business divisions led lamps electronics and professional luminaires systems 
services part its philips brighter lives better world program commitments for 
philips lightings aims generate its revenues from sustainable products 
systems and services and deliver more than led lamps 
zumtobel led exposure across the group sales the tridonic brand invests 
more than all its expenditure development projects relating led 
technology and connectivity the company has begun develop solutions for the 
internet things which can also help improve energy efficiency smart buildings 
seoul semiconductor manufactures and sells light emitting diode led products 
worldwide its product line includes surface mounted device leds through hole type 
leds custom displays and sensors the company products are used mobile 
automotive and display solutions around revenues generated came from led 
sales 
buildings 
hannon armstrong makes debt and equity investments sustainable infrastructure 
including energy efficiency and renewable energy the company actually reports its 
estimated carbon offset annually for this was the biggest impact 
came from its wind investments per invested compared 
for efficiency projects and for solar 
daikin industries around the group operating profit comes from air 
conditioning products and its inverter air conditioners save more energy compared 
traditional air conditioners whilst also using refrigerants with low impact global 
warming daikin had sold million air conditioners countries the 
end fiscal and these products have contributed emissions reductions 
encourage the further adoption air conditioners daikin has provided royalty free 
use patents both developing and developed nations 
ingersoll rand revenues were generated the climate segment 
examples products include the ecowise portfolio hvac products which use low 
global warming potential gwp refrigerants and connected home solutions the 
company aims achieve reduction the direct ghg potential for products 
and incorporate lower gwp alternatives across the portfolio 
abb around revenues were linked improving energy efficiency 
according the company the company redefined its eco efficiency portfolio during 
include energy efficiency renewable energy and resource efficiency criteria 
some examples abb many products this area include voice operated smart home 
automation system fast charging systems for electric buses mining automation 
platform improve efficiency and productivity and switchgear that uses new ecoefficient gas which has lower global warming impact 
transport 
with the transport category there mix different types business model from 
car company tesla lightweighting company arconic this variety matched the 
level disclosure data that makes possible quantify the impact that the 
companies make targeting climate change 
two companies are exposed electric vehicles for both tesla and guoxan high tech 
calculated the amount carbon dioxide saved driving rather than 
internal combustion engine ice then offset this the generated the 
electricity needed power the evs for both calculations looked the geographic 
footprint where the cars are sold order make assumptions for the average 
emissions new car each region and the typical mix power generation fuel 
split 
exhibit and exhibit show our calculations suggest that the two pretty much 
offset each other would note that study the iea looks the effectiveness 
evs decarbonisation efforts considers different regions globally taking into 
account average car sizes and grid carbon intensities under different decarbonisation 
scenarios the one hand found the decarbonisation benefit provided evs 
france significant power generation has relatively large nuclear and therefore 
clean skew however the benefits decarbonisation from the transition china 
for example less clear given its power generation skew relatively dirty coal fired
