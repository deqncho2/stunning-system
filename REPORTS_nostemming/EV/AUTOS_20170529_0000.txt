appendix new evs why think they really coming this 
time despite major hurdles still ahead 
the following section includes excerpts adapted from one billion bevs 
may 
political and scientific pressure oems about ices has risen 
sharply 
despite the very sharp increase bev focus and news flow and increasing number 
strategic oem investments and launch plans for bevs many investors continue have 
question marks over the viability and eventual likelihood battery technology 
taking over the automotive drivetrain why have battery electric cars never been 
successful before why different this time think the key answer that 
political and scientific concerns about and particle emissions impacts public 
health have risen sharply and this driving regulatory change which sharply raising 
the cost development and production the internal combustion engine petrol 
well diesel and may set targets that ice drivetrains simply cannot meet least 
economically 
soon bevs become cheaper not only viable way for global oems meet 
long term emission targets the oems will incentivised sharply improve their bev 
consumer offerings and incentivise consumers buy those bevs they previously 
did with diesel europe think this change happening now evidenced 
recent strategic changes announced and daimler particular but now followed 
other global oems including hyundai toyota and honda 
last european ice platform 
one the largest global auto parts suppliers continental suggested its recent 
powertrain strategy presentation that the last ever european ice based platform 
would launched around tier suppliers bid for new model contracts three 
years out and for need look substantially beyond this take this view 
very seriously direct insight into product strategy across all the global oems 
conti bev penetration base case ahead the base case have 
modelled here thus our base case this report that bev market share penetration 
rises quickly after new products are launched and then accelerates 
technology improves and consumer acceptance rises 
many many hurdles remain there still bear case 
nevertheless are fully aware the potential objections that investors may have 
our assumptions and highlight those key hurdles here have reflected much 
more bearish view these developments our bear case model not exclude 
such eventuality 
don high battery costs make evs uneconomic 
battery costs remain very high battery electric powertrain costs are heavily dependent 
the cost the battery much which driven the cost battery cell materials 
although economies scale could substantially reduce cell manufacturing and 
packaging costs battery energy density has improve reduce the material cost 
content not clear that consumers are willing pay higher prices for bevs relative 
ice vehicles 
energy density really sufficient 
battery range remains too small and batteries are still too heavy battery energy 
density improving but not yet good enough can current material energy density 
improve sufficiently allow the more aggressive bev targets met with the 
battery material and cell capacity plans that are place current energy density 
current bev plans will start consume high proportion global material production 
for some materials 
where all the charging infrastructure going come from 
battery charging infrastructure has not been sorted out many countries high levels 
bev adoption are likely sharply increase the demand for electricity charging 
rates that may well exceed the capabilities the existing infrastructure oems are 
starting invest more heavily new infrastructure plans especially europe with 
tesla well ahead the evs are mostly leased owing uncertainties over long term 
battery values and most packages come with home chargers included 
there really any consumer demand for evs 
demand for bevs seems have been very limited for most models launched date 
excluding tesla the fact remains that few bevs with commercial range have yet been 
launched fact global bev sales approx units driven china are dependent 
yet very few fully electric models the major oems launch their current bev 
model plans and the bev range expands miles and beyond believe 
the consumer proposition will change swiftly and with tesla consumer interest will 
improve quickly the other side the sharp declines diesel powertrain demand 
europe recently 
are bevs actually environmentally friendly given through life cost and 
environmental impact 
while current regulatory thinking focuses the reduction and nox the total 
impact the environment electricity production and the production and eventual 
disposal battery materials may reduce the net benefit from bev emissions however 
our discussions with regulators have convinced that tailpipe emissions reduction 
their key focus 
won evs mean substantially more electricity demand 
electricity generating capacity significant rise bev penetration could have 
material impact global electricity demand the average bev uses per 
average annual mileage approximately would add approx 
average household electricity consumption europe and 
average china just over persons per household full bev penetration 
could lead higher electricity consumption these assumptions and 
would likely concentrated major urban areas 
subsidies are being phased out can you sell bevs without them 
bev subsidies may ending governments have been subsidising bev and lowemission cars many countries some those subsidies are now being phased out 
china look likely run out the subsidies have helped consumers bridge the 
acquisition cost differential for their bev purchases without which bev demand could 
lower still 
why would governments incentivise when tax revenues from fuel duty are 
significant 
the impact tax revenues with governments especially europe receiving significant 
income from fuel taxes and electricity often not taxed follows that sharp rise 
bev penetration would lead sharp gap tax revenues think this could lead 
pressure tax electricity instead that said with more than fleet penetration 
our model more severe impact tax revenues may years away 
bev trend driven emission regulations 
have highlighted above many the reasons most often cited why investors believe 
bevs will not succeed have noted believe that many these issues can 
overcome especially given the long term nature the changes the fleet look 
here various different reasons why large oems such daimler and have moved 
towards their new strategies and why even japanese oems such toyota and 
honda long opposed bev technology are now looking introduce bev models 
soon possible 
cost regulatory compliance for current ice engine 
the costs compliance for ice engine technology are rising sharply show this 
analysis below regulatory oversight increases sharply post recent industry 
revelations remember that diesel was key part the oem strategy for future 
performance the change regulatory focus nox and the related fall diesel 
penetration changing that strategy altogether 
with the help european government incentives diesel went from just overall 
market share well over see reason why evs should 
not similarly incentivised just diesel incentives are removed with the change 
political emissions policy remember also that while may our focus many 
these companies are thinking about and beyond just the 
first step how can oems achieve future targets even lower with 
existing ice engines will regulators some regions even push towards zero emissions 
the real change our view that may have informed and daimler strategic 
changes that wltc and rde worldwide light duty test cycle and real world driving 
emissions testing regimes coming europe over the next two years are likely drive 
significant increase the cost complying with the standards compared the oems 
original assumptions for the cost ices recent years have seen several changes 
adding the global customer preference for larger and higher emissions 
suvs 
the gradual but accelerating decline lower diesel 
the introduction the new wltc much tougher for nox europe and china 
the new rde targets combining and nox standards 
model these changes exhibit below while the falling cost battery 
technology remains question mark dependent future technological chemical 
breakthroughs and timing this seems uncertain maybe the rising cost ice that 
proving the real driver oem strategy show below how the two cost scenarios 
interact have little concept the exact shape each curve the exact timing 
the cost changes but our chart clearly highlights what happening the original 
cost regulatory compliance assumptions the ice engine and the fact that higher 
ice costs cross over with falling battery drivetrain costs earlier whether not our 
chart proves accurate its exact timing would not like speculate 
exhibit major changes battery cost calculations but the costs getting conventional engines comply with and particulate 
emissions standards keep rising

while battery costs may not coming down quickly oems would like the point 
which ice and drivetrain manufacturing costs match getting closer oem 
longer term view longer term regulations and nox emissions tighten further 
seems likely evs may not even the cheaper alternative they may become the 
only alternative see our commentary below recent political and regulatory 
statements this regard political demand for zero emissions clearly increasing and 
the political environment for the previous industry solution diesel engines has 
changed considerably oems will have find new alternative 
emissions absolute may become unachievable 
believe that adding nox the focus already raises regulatory costs very 
substantially and changes the technologies available meet such targets especially 
take real world driving emissions rde into account what would happen likely 
emissions standards were simply unattainable with existing ice 
technology even zero some cities states assume very sharp increase 
penetration for mild hybrids and other ice emission control technologies maybe these 
technologies are not sufficient meet absolute emission ambitions further out there 
risk that some regions emission requirements will fall zero reduce healthcare 
risks from air pollution 
fleet average nox regulations apply each car standards are based

clearly oems still have meet those targets although seems that rde testing 
may reduce the engine downsizing turbocharger option given the changes think this 
making the cost curve calculations around ice and the recent announcements 
higher penetration targets seems that oems are shifting towards managing 
targets via mix hybrids evs and away from reducing internal combustion 
engines 
oems must achieve average across their new car sales model year 
around the exact target varies slightly manufacturer based mix larger 
vehicles get slightly higher allowance for bmw the target oems 
have achieved average annual reductions europe since and 
must now achieve order meet the targets evs and hybrids

however bev costs come down even minimally and the cost compliance 
existing ice engines rising sharply then oems will move bev strategy long 
they can see the two cost curves crossing over show above think that 
inflection point their thinking has now happened now happening many oems 
while many investors remain sceptical the viability battery electric technology 
given the lack range and battery expense today are sure other technologies have 
beaten similar scepticism the past auto market volumes expand the potential 
future battery demand expect the investment battery technologies multiplying 
and should lead technological breakthroughs reducing the cost per kwh look

below show model attempting calculate the impact monthly running costs 
much higher current transaction prices have also assumed that least 
early evs have much lower residuals than ice cars suggesting that lease costs will 
much higher given greater depreciation will have covered during the life 
the lease thus monthly lease costs for phevs and bev could much 
higher than the monthly lease costs for petrol engined alternatives 
however then continue compare total running and ownership costs evs can 
start quickly reduce that price disadvantage assume phevs and bevs have lower fuel costs lower insurance costs and lower service costs than current 
vehicles calculate that based european fuel prices fuel and running costs for 
bevs could much lower than for current petrol diesel engined cars 
then add all calculate that although hybrids and extended range evs 
continue more expensive all the bev cost per month comes just

believe that automakers not have wait for demand for their vehicles pick 
strongly believe that leading oems use their distribution arms and financial 
services business proactively generate demand for models and when they need 
think that globally lower interest rates have sharply contributed their ability 
oems have been able control monthly spend converting savings from 
lower interest costs into higher average selling prices and content per car 
believe oems can achieve the same feat with evs they are incentivised 
the example above might possible for oems bundle total cost 
ownership tco for consumers capture the through life savings offset some 
the initial capital cost the bev phev alternatively oems face significant 
penalties for non compliance with emissions legislation then again would quite 
possible for oems cross subsidise evs from their existing ice business and yet still 
maximise business profitability politicians are starting understand incentives for 
consumers may not the only way raise penetration levels 
what clear however that key variable this debate the level residuals that 
assume new evs although have already allowed for significantly worse 
performance residuals than current ice vehicles performance may even 
worse depending battery performance the other hand the availability much 
lower tco evs could similarly have sharply negative impact residuals current 
ice vehicles consumer demand switches quickly the market will face glut offlease ice cars which could severely depress their residuals 
thus seems clear that oems will have agile managing their total financial 
services lease exposure seems likely that given the uncertainty consumers will 
choose lease initial models leaving the oem take the residual risk this 
suggests that fast conversion rate from ice models consumers would require 
significant growth market lease penetration requiring further growth oem financial 
services balance sheets and adding their risks however given that many 
these launches won happen until after first real residual risks won 
appear until the earliest however may have impact and leasing 
strategies before then 
future regulations and incentives 
key parts our arguments favour the are not necessarily just the regulations 
laws and incentives that have today car companies have manage generations 
vehicles that will launched over decade from now and may continue selling and 
operating various guises until this means that auto oems are looking 
future changes and political trends much current laws thus many auto oems 
strategies are already set stone unfortunately being affected new 
test cycles and real world driving emissions tests these have clearly increased the need 
reduce nox emissions further 
germany banning ices however initial industry negotiations regarding 
european emission standards are another huge step and seems unlikely these trends 
will ease significantly much less reverse thus even germany the german bundesrat 
has passed resolution ban the ice starting the bundesrat resolution calls 
the european commission approve only zero emission passenger vehicles for use 
european roads while the bundesrat representing german states has legislative 
power its recommendations clearly help shape the overall european debate the 
resolution suggests the stimulation emission free mobility the use taxes and 
stimulus boost zero emission vehicle sales 
china quotas for evs phevs soon certainly seems that diesel tax 
advantages will ended europe soon contrast germany approved subsidy 
for electric car purchases only may allowing consumers subsidy for full 
vehicles and for phev with goal getting vehicles the road 
any debate around zero emissions must concern for european oems 
providing further fuel for recent strategy conversion further development 
german environment minister barbara hendricks was quoted bloomberg 
november saying she backed aggressive new targets for sales china being 
proposed draft legislation from china industry minister miao wei now china 
considering legislation requiring all automakers sell specific quota zero and lowemission vehicles starting overall deliveries almost vehicles this 
proposed target then set rise and oems that fail 
meet the targets would face penalties forced buy credits from competitors 
meet the targets for the german oems the initial target would mean having sell 
over and phev vehicles each for bmw and mercedes and over annually 
for such short timeframe this could prove very difficult

battery electric vehicle fundamentally different product from the current 
production car the bev drivetrain substantially simpler build and design than 
combustion engine with far fewer regulatory hurdles fewer parts and much lower 
capital intensity however not only the drivetrain that needs change increased 
electronics content and connectivity combined with increasing security risks that 
electronic connectivity mean that the whole electronic architecture the car could 
change from loosely assembled domain based network more centralised 
network based central computing capability this the way tesla designs its 
electrical architecture 
exhibit new drive components bev fundamentally simpler than ice vehicle 
source reproduced with kind permission from volkswagen 
start showing the potential changes the automotive supply chain highlight 
three key differences from the current supply chain 
oems lose content without the control over the ice powertrain and with the 
potential for far greater sourcing bev components oem content the vehicle 
declines further without the right level content oems face question marks over the 
way that they can brand the vehicle the barriers entry the decisions they need 
make regarding existing workforces and the level future outsourcing they can afford 
further can oems afford are they able build the software skills they will need 
maintain control over the future integrated and autonomous car operating system 
technology electronics and software gain content with future bev arguably 
built around central vehicle operating system and with sharply higher content from 
autonomous driving functions electric drive and connected systems the 
value future bev may come from the technology sector not automotive recent 
acquisitions samsung and intel have already seen some the consumer electronics 
and technology leaders enter directly into the automotive parts markets potentially 
disintermediating existing tier suppliers google and apple have also made their 
automotive ambitions clear 
existing suppliers face loss content and potential disintermediation existing 
automotive parts suppliers will lose many historical markets the automotive drivetrain 
moves bevs all the powertrain related components will change disappear 
altogether bev much group revenue for some suppliers could 
affected while there will doubtless new opportunities inverters converters 
chargers and electric motors not yet clear how much this will outsourced 
oems and who will successful supplying these new components with much 
the future content value coming from technology suppliers the risk that these 
suppliers will become tier suppliers their own right and displace existing powertrain

terms risks the automotive companies would split the impacts into three 
separate phases 
development phase which where are today auto oems are under enormous 
pressure meet emissions regulations and have accelerated bev strategies meet 
the deadlines close possible those deadlines oems are accelerating bev 
technology spend and and capex costs are rising fast developments 
autonomous and connected cars will have paid for the same time while 
development costs are hitting oem margins daimler spent more 
than almost underlying business demand and profitability have 
remained strong further tesla share price suggests investors are happy look

key oem clients continental powertrain strategy highlighting the emphasising its 
mechanical and hydraulic powertrain products and sharp increase investments 
electronic products highlights the cost auto parts suppliers also today powertrain 
supplier market fragmented overall but actually made many smaller highly 
consolidated markets today conti and faurecia have very little direct competition and 
turn each has limited overlap with valeo schaeffler for suppliers seem face

transition phase many the european and global oems will 
launching their first mainstream bev products fast followed many other derivatives 
this stage the oems will producing cars using two completely different 
powertrains and suppliers will have prepared meet the any growth 
demand two different risks apply this stage first the degree that bevs are 
successful and take market share our base case global sales assume 
oems will have able ramp production bev vehicles then 
equivalent global capacity growth that time cost that allows them 
replicate current ice model profitability that not yet given second what happens 
utilisation pricing and profitability the other ice vehicles sold bev 
sales rise capacity utilisation ice production facilities will presumably fall sharply 
reducing profitability that production capacity 
further believe that oems are successful getting consumer acceptance for their 
new bev models will have huge negative perception effect the existing model 
line ups causing sharp falls pricing power for such products the extent that 
oems depend ice vehicles that stage suspect ice profitability could fall very 
sharply time when bev profitability not yet optimised believe this pricing 
effect may already starting happen consumers become aware future

bev phase are not necessarily bearish the future profitability bevs 
think many the companies that are dominant ice may remain dominant bevs 
well fact the current technology spending phase already leading some 
consolidation the sector the question whether barriers entry fall 
dramatically and technology giants enter the automotive sector some shape 
form the current premium oem brands will able maintain their current cache and 
pricing power the success tesla the luxury market suggests there will 
challenges the legacy oem market positions the other hand with greater 
degree outsourcing and with simpler manufacturing process and arguably fewer 
regulations meet bev development costs should much lower than the current 
ice world and bev production should much less capital intensive remains 
seen whether returns will allowed rise result the lower capital intensity 
whether pricing and return sales will adjust sustain the current low return 
capital employed 
conclusion believe that the technology disruption risk the global automotive 
sector real and significant both the development phase and transition phase pose 
significant questions and investment requirements that will diminish short term sector 
returns longer term the full shape the bev market remains discovered and 
while think there will strong growth for long period the profitability that 
growth cannot yet ascertained
