debate china nev rules from call for recognition risk for 
traditional japanese parts makers 
the chinese government announced sep that will introduce rules 
making incumbent auto makers ensure that new energy vehicles nevs account 
for their sales bans sales gasoline and diesel vehicles are also for 
consideration and expect the takeoff nevs chiefly bevs into full swing 
announcements from sources including the ministries industry and information 
technology finance and commerce are aimed makers who manufacture and sell 
more passenger cars per year china and make obligatory sell 
certain percentage nevs evs phevs fcvs out their total sales volume this does 
away with the previous plan for but calls for ratios and 
companies that fail meet these levels will required purchase credits 
from others that sell more nevs than the quota 
details can found our oct asia insight report revenue opportunities from 
china nev quota july france july and the july unveiled 
proposals ban sales gasoline and diesel vehicles but the introduction 
these rules china the world largest market for automobiles that brings real 
urgency the nev response since nevs not include hevs area strength for 
japanese companies japanese makers with business china will also have come 
with response bevs phevs and fcvs and expect japanese auto parts makers 
well face increasing need develop nev technologies 
over many years the japanese auto parts industry has formed pyramid structure 
oems the top followed tier makers that supply brake transmission and steering 
systems directly the oems tier makers that supply the system composite parts 
tier makers and tier makers that supply formed and fabricated materials including 
cast and pressed parts screws and springs particular toyota has had advantage 
the strong auto parts group which formed through capital investment for example 
engines and transmissions which are very complex structure are produced 
collaboration between oems and auto parts companies the collaboration 
technology works efficiently thus given these characteristics the japanese auto 
parts industry think transition more risk than opportunity this 
point 
relatively high exposure powertrain evs are headwind japanese auto parts 
companies cooperate with oems accumulate technologies and strengthen 
competitiveness internal combustion parts engines and transmissions response 
environmental regulations and more efficient fuel consumption maintain our 
positive assessment this point however penetration and expansion place

accelerated technological innovation and restructuring the supply chain stand 
bring huge revolution have already seen accelerated strategic revisions 
business portfolios through and spin offs the european and auto parts 
industries contrast instances such strategic approach are still rare this point 
the japanese auto parts industry companies may possess excellent technologies but 
the risk declining value remains 
denso and keihin could survive chinese evs traditional auto parts companies 
our coverage produce batteries however expect denso and keihin have 
opportunities utilize the software knowledge they have accumulated through 
producing engine control ecus supply motor control pcu power control units and 
bms battery management systems they have potential survive establishing

week and rather than seeing the impact from slowing north american market 
actually look for number positives show namely stronger support from the 
weaker yen one year ago healthy domestic production levels helped new 
models and favorable sales japanese vehicles china such expect 
results show comparable even better momentum apr jun 
however believe that profit momentum will wane from onward the impact 
from slowing north american market and from costs for next generation

top top ideas asia auto parts coverage 
top ideas denso guoxuan high tech and motiv 
denso related technologies for battery monitoring and 
motor control are the firm strength which nurtured through the work with toyota 
hevs expect opportunities grow more for its software rather than hardware 
business the medium term look for sales expansion non toyota clients including 
local oem businesses china while the added value car has been 
ongoing downtrend due technological maturation expectations are the rise for the 
heat management technologies for evs which contributes significantly extending the 
cruising distance when the heater used offer more value and denso has 
overwhelming lead this field globally competitors include valeo etc 
guoxuan high tech turn more positive guoxuan 
its competitiveness increasingly strengthened thanks material battery cost 
reduction expect cost reduction continue the next three years due 
energy density improvement the next three years driven new bigger size battery 
capacity save energy loss amid packaging battery upgrade and capacity 
newbuilds and new innovation silicon based anode 
motiv despite lackluster volume growth 
outlook for the korean oems believe motiv should benefit from the 
accelerating production growth especially with stricter environmental regulations 
and china proposed nev credit quota triggering more robust structural growth 
among the korean oems moreover unlike other parts suppliers its hev motors 
business already generating healthy operating profit margin the high single digits 
top ideas aisin and toyota boshoku 
aisin while evs not require transmission the existing 
form foresee growth decelerators and motors business the firm has nurtured 
through its work with toyota hevs that said expect tougher competitive climate 
for decelerators motors compared the firm lead multi step ats expect jump 
from units units further shifts multi step ats speeds etc well move from oems outsourcing however look for 
investment toward bolstering not just assembly but casting and other material 
processing weigh heavily the earnings impact lost content the era will take 
some time materialize but heavier downward pressures valuations looks 
unavoidable 
toyota boshoku the role seat makers likely the 
era next generation mobility contribute towards improving the comfort 
drivers passengers within the vehicle rather than simply provide seat the 
challenge incorporating new technologies related electronic devices and displays 
and expect the resulting rise cost squeeze margins overseas alliances 
between and faurecia may and between autoliv and adient sep have 
been announced collaborations with other industries suggests that competition 
offer value inside the vehicle set intensify while the firm faces little risk losing 
content following the shift the rise profit momentum date driven improving
