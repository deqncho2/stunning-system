recognise the momentum umicore shares and the 
positive near term runway for earnings and growth this not 
traditional chemicals story that end ask what 
the price concluding many the risks highlighted our 
cathode market analysis are being overlooked 
time revisit umicore shares have continued rate the back the 
market expectations around the future earnings power its battery materials 
business near term spot valuation metrics have understandably been deemphasised favour discussions around the total addressable market for 
cathode materials evs our what the price model suggests the shares are 
now discounting enterprise value for energy surface technologies 
divisional ebitda which back out imply umicore commands 
share the cathode material market generating ebit margin 
our concerns remain the absolute market share and margins the 
company will ultimately command this market for the following reasons 
rising competition cathode materials despite umicore global lead 
high nickel grade batteries expect see here standard grades cathode 
materials commoditise given significant capacity expansion low barriers 
entry and relatively short industry capacity build and lead times rising 
competition could have material implications for the value ascribed umicore 
battery division which estimate represents its enterprise value 
unbalanced risk reward profile built wide ranging assumptions the 
timing adoption rates the fashion which the technology landscape 
evolves and the sizable capital cost umicore investing heavily its first 
mover advantage inherently present risks think too much upside risk being 
discounted today versus the downside risks 
raised roll forward valuation and raise eps due stronger near term earnings power est upgraded company 
guidance and use tam analysis for battery materials our sotp 
introduce our new quant analysis section here highlighting key performance 
drivers umicore shares 
what are the risks our call there scope for valuation move still higher 
have seen with other exposed names momentum around evs were 
remain very bullish addition greater cathode material share higher 
incremental margins returns and stronger adoption rates could drive value 
from the thematic beyond what currently forecast achievable

what you need believe for the battery materials business 
umicore battery materials business within the energy and surface technology est 
division has driven material rating the shares over the last months based 
positive sentiment towards the thematic optimism the future total 
addressable market tam for cathode materials and scarcity premium the 
current market enthusiasm was never more apparent than the company recent 
success raising additional capital modest discount 
close price what was the time relatively volatile market below explore the 
tam debate for cathode materials better understand what risks any are being

what changed 
accelerated battery materials capacity additions drive upgrades must first 
acknowledge that near term est growth has exceeded our expectations thanks 
the ramp battery materials following equity raise materially higher 
nickel and cobalt prices and strong demand for consumer electronics battery 
materials have therefore updated our forecasts reflect the stronger nearterm earnings power est and newly announced cathode capacity expansions 
the back the recent equity raise modestly raise our near term catalysis 
forecasts reflect the positive effect euro european earnings near term while 
edging our recycling forecast lower consequence increased competition and 
negative mix effects from lower commercial terms 
have increased our price target this consequence earnings
