mrl ltip designed fulfil the retention function the overall remuneration structure and achieves 
this outcome without requiring any additional retention initiatives from the stip 
the remuneration committee considers the single payment sti award appropriate because sends 
clear message both existing and future kmps that the company places considerable value properly 
structured incentives and rewards good performance when that performance occurs 
the remuneration committee recommended the board that earned sti award should continue paid 
single payment upon release the annual results for the assessment year and the board adopted that

aasb revenue from contracts with customers aasb 
this standard applicable annual reporting periods beginning after january the standard provides 
single standard for revenue recognition the core principle the standard that entity will recognise revenue depict 
the transfer promised goods services customers amount that reflects the consideration which the entity 
expects entitled exchange for those goods services 
revenue recognition streams are continually evolving across the group and management will continue assess the 
impact this standard accordingly the group planning adopt this standard july using the modified 
transition approach june the group has assessed the following key areas likely impacted from the 
application this standard from july 
freight revenue sale products cfr cif terms for products sold the group under cfr cif 
terms control the final product passes the customer although the group still retains obligations perform 
freight insurance services aasb requires the individual components revenue recognised separately 
and therefore freight insurance revenue likely deferred until the product delivered rather than when the 
product shipped 
mobilisation charges crushing contracts aasb requires the allocation the transaction price the 
separate performance obligations basis relative stand alone selling price each distinct good service 
estimation approach distinct observable prices exist and recognition revenue when each performance 
obligation satisfied mobilisation charges are allocated each performance obligation over the contractual 
period and therefore likely deferred until each performance obligation delivered being each tonne ore 
crushed rather than upfront when the mobilisation occurs 
apart from providing more extensive disclosures the group revenue transactions the group does not anticipate that 
the application aasb will have material impact the financial position and financial performance the group 
the new standard introduces expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements these are expected 
change the nature and extent the group disclosures about its revenue from contracts with customers the year the 
adoption the new standard 
aasb leases aasb 
this standard applicable annual reporting periods beginning after january the standard replaces aasb 
leases and will primarily affect the accounting operating leases for lessees 
subject exceptions right use asset will capitalised the statement financial position measured the 
present value the unavoidable future lease payments made over the lease term depreciation charge for the 
leased asset included operating costs and interest expense the lease liability included finance costs will

incentives received initial direct costs incurred and estimate any future restoration removal dismantling costs 
exceptions will apply short term leases months less and leases low value assets such personal 
computers and small office furniture where accounting policy choice exists whereby either right use asset 
recognised lease payments are expensed profit loss incurred 
the earlier periods the lease the expenses associated with the lease under aasb will higher when compared 
lease expenses under aasb however ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation results 
will improved the operating expense replaced interest expense and depreciation profit loss under aasb 
for classification within the statement cash flows the lease payments will separated into both principal 
financing activities and interest either operating financing activities component
