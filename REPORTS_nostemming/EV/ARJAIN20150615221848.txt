electric vehicles have failed achieve mainstream success given 
inferior economic payback periods high years but the 
shared autonomy model highly utilized mega fleets completely 
flip the script evs can stage major comeback 
the main reason why ev have been categorically failing date the 
cars aren used enough per gallon and today efficient 
internal combustion engine car achieves fuel cost per mile approximately 
cents cents per kwh and miles per kwh today achieves fuel 
cost per mile around cents the average car the drives around 
per year meaning that cent fuel cost per mile arbitrage results 
annual savings that sounds great until you consider that 
battery mile range kwh requires consumer pay 
more for the car front how does year payback sound not awesome 
the problem the average miles driven year disguises the fact that 
cars are used average for less than hour day for only utilization this 
low utilization the current automotive ownership model drove our rather 
bearish outlook penetration earlier see our note from may 
tesla motors inc evs are dead long live tesla now take the same 
scenario and have the car used taxi ride sharing firm for 
miles year around utilization and the payback falls years take 
battery costs kwh and gas price gallon and the payback falls 
further years yeah but who drives miles year robot taxi

the biggest sea change developments that can save the business 
model 
shared mobility mobile technology and relatively simple software 
increases driving utilization rates order magnitude bring taxis and 
chauffeur services the masses this transforms the auto business model 
from ownership shared enabling each car drive far greater 
number miles per year helps amortize the front cost battery far 
more rapidly shrinking the payback greater numbers evs enable oems and 
contract manufacturers achieve unprecedented scale economies battery 
pack production yielding further benefits 
take the point vehicle utilization payback rates the 
extreme imagine that the owner battery car used the vehicle for 
the very rare sunday drive miles year the extra premium paid for the 
car owning car gallon gasoline would take years 
pay off break even internal combustion engine such vehicle would 
have purchased the century the founding rome during

homer epics ignoring inflation the same car were used miles year 
the breakeven payoff would years purchased when george 
washington was year old lad rambling around the fields the colony 
virginia the flipside the were operated miles year the 
payback would years achieve the same year payback only 
shrinking the battery cost holding miles driven flat year would 
require kwh reduction from tesla current claimed level cost 
achievement kwh would require technological breakthrough while 
miles year just requires smarter use technology that already exists 
autonomous cars eliminating the human from the driving equation can 
further improve utilization even higher levels and efficiency and lower cost 
per mile far the largest cost today ride sharing service the person 
behind the wheel replace the driver with few million lines code and some 
commoditized sensors and the savings can really begin shared autonomous 
fleets address many other problems with today model such slower 
charging time lower charging station density and range limitations out 
total autonomous taxi fleet say vehicles perhaps would 
involved some portion the charging process please note are not 
considering any material differences maintenance repair costs between 
and ice vehicle 
the apple effect have thought through what this really means 
the world most valuable company were design and engineer car are

next largest competitors trying the same thing see our april note 
tesla motors inc can apple save the electric car 
fully autonomous car meant shared not owned why 
autonomous car technology important the development evs it 
simple fully autonomous car steering wheel pedals can work 
hours day will consumers buy car capable doing all the work itself 
just have sit idle for more than hours day why are you buying all 
this technology only amortize over utilization perhaps you may 
spend more time your own car but really more than hours day run 
business taxi service the autonomous car can generating revenue 
for much hour day our simulations nearly 
hours day average some days more some days less the higher utilization 
means expensive tech can far cheaper per mile basis

valuation risks 
valuation methodology argue tesla cannot valued near term multiple metrics like traditional auto 
companies given that expect tesla multiply revenues more than from and 
around have thus chosen year time horizon for our dcf which captures the full 
maturation the model model and top hat derivatives and also the ramp its mass market electric 
vehicle the gen have applied wacc with range the terminal value calculated 
midpoint ebitda accounts for roughly the total dcf value across the range 
methodologies have applied arrive our 
key risks 
investors should allow reasonable level execution risk the many unprecedented innovations brought 
market the model including never been done before attributes like the double ringed doors 
tesla guaranteeing the value its model lease finance transaction exposing the company residual 
value risks months out 
volatility commodity prices such oil materially change the economic benefits electric vehicles 
particularly when commercialized lower price points and higher volumes 
expansion into non auto business like grid solar energy storage exposes tesla operations untested cost
