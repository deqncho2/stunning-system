cathode evolution dissecting 
the battery supply chain 
the revolution has meaningful implications for many 
sectors notably chemicals resources this report 
deconstruct the battery supply chain from basic materials 
through cell capacity technology and overcapacities near 
term remain the biggest risks

noted our deep dive will cathode evolution drive the revolution 
believe the cathode one the key technology enablers within the battery and 
will play central role the rate adoption depending the cathode 
producer ability improve energy density range and reduce cost total 
cell cost these two are intrinsically linked higher energy density reduces 
material intensity per kwh 
paul walsh 
cathode capacity additions look set accelerate materially since 
june have identified significant number additional cathode 
ncm nca capacity projects come online between and this 
capacity wave combined with the technology evolution cathode toward higher 
energy density materials less cathode but more kwh could have significant 
impact industry utilisation and turn challenge industry price discipline 
the cathode evolution has meaningful implications for metal intensity per kwh 
over the medium term the industry moves more energy dense nickel rich 
materials the overall metal intensity the cathode per kwh will decrease 
and the per kwh demand for such metals cobalt will decrease reducing 
cost and industry concerns over security and ethics supply however must 
bear mind that near term kwh demand will usurp any decline material 
intensity putting pressure producers meet demand 
china strategic investment evs should not overlooked near term china 
will make over demand for evs and battery capacity globally china 
aspiration the global leader proliferates throughout the whole supply 
chain and the cathode market exception chinese producers technical 
competence continues progress with many players now providing material 
korean and japanese battery manufacturers while investment scale continues 
accelerate cathodes well raw material refining 
underappreciated battery integration future technology leaders appear the 
best way play the opportunity from here given our concerns around nearterm cathode commoditisation and industry cost pressures believe investors 
should ascribe greater value companies investing the development 
future materials where valuations don yet reflect the potential upside johnson 
matthey rather than those investing capacity today where valuations 
not discount the near term risks commoditisation umicore
