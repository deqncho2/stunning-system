production and sales 
production for the quarter was record tonnes since early september evaporation rates have increased 
significantly resulting increased brine concentration increased harvest pond inventory and increasing production 
rates brine feed concentration has risen this trend has continued throughout the december quarter 
sales revenue for the quarter was record million total sales tonnes with average sales prices 
operating costs cost goods sold basis were tonne down qoq due 
higher production levels and reduced reagent costs cost inflationary pressure continued through the quarter 
with argentine peso devaluation against the united states dollar less than inflation

operational update 
over the december quarter the focus has remained pond management both from the perspective inter pond 
brine transfer operational controls and monitoring the design and upgrade for the improved transfer and pumping 
system required the installation six new pumps remote monitoring systems and additional water cleaning lines for 
revised capital cost the system operating stable manner subject the normal seasonal variations

carbon dioxide recovery 
carbon dioxide used the olaroz lithium facility the production battery grade lithium carbonate currently 
sourced from near buenos aires cordoba and mendoza and transported kilometres truck 
consequently significant component reagent costs and the company installing recovery systems 
various parts the purification circuit recover from the production process 
results from engineering studies and trial plant over the last year have demonstrated that recovery 
total possible and orders have now been placed for provision and installation permanent equipment capital 
expenditure this project expected less than the plant supplied package specialist

phase expansion olaroz 
the phase expansion olaroz now underwritten the announced equity and proposed debt funding 
arrangements final investment decision remains subject orocobre and board approvals 
revised scope phase expansion 
based forecast strong demand growth the joint venture partners have concluded that expansion should increase 
tonnes per annum total tonnes per annum from the previously proposed tonnes per annum 
engineering studies were completed during the quarter 
the increased expansion plans retain the simplified design remove the purification circuit from the incremental 
production with the proposed development lithium hydroxide plant japan the resultant product mix 
tonnes per annum purified lithium carbonate from the existing purification circuit and tonnes per 
annum prime grade lithium carbonate avg which will provide feedstock for the planned lithium hydroxide 
plant 
this revised strategy results capital expenditure approximately million including million 
contingency and retains the lower risk implementation the project based around simple duplication bores 
ponds and primary circuit phase olaroz the capital cost intensity the expansion has increased from 
the previous principally due the increased accuracy with the engineering study compared the previous 
scoping level additional redundancy the design increase indirect costs and inflationary pressures however this 
capital remains extremely competitive when compared with other greenfield developments 
multinational engineering firm ghd continues oversee engineering design studies for the olaroz phase expansion 
key permits have been received for process water brine extraction additional bores and new ponds from the jujuy 
provincial government for the expansion 
plant layout and pond design have been finalised and soil tests have been completed over the new pond area 
flowsheets mass balance and equipment list and design criteria have also been completed preliminary design for the

market and sales 
total volume lithium carbonate sold the december quarter was tonnes lithium carbonate prices increased 
tonne fob for the quarter 
since operations commenced olaroz has developed strong customer base customers who have tested and 
accepted the high grade purified and prime products the purified product regularly tests lithium carbonate 
and sold battery and cathode end users the prime product regularly tests lithium carbonate and sold 
variety technical and industrial end users neither these products require any additional processing for their 
respective markets and uses 
lithium market 
the lithium market remained tight during the december quarter existing supply bottlenecks remained supply from 
brine operations recovered after the weather related disruptions impacting south american operations the march 
and september quarters albemarle negra project reported production growth while our own 
olaroz operations continued ramp sqm and fmc volumes were similar total tonnes but with 
greater share lithium hydroxide versus carbonate response battery cathode customers shift toward high 
nickel cathodes nickel manganese cobalt nmc and nickel cobalt aluminium oxide nca chemistries 
market expectations that increased volume spodumene concentrate and direct shipping ore dso would result 
increased volumes lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide were not realised due lack conversion capacity 
and conversion efficiency china despite widespread announcements conversion plant expansions china very 
little new capacity was added the market this year due extended commissioning periods due part production 
lines adjusting new different feedstock albemarle and fmc both reported higher hydroxide production from their 
chinese processing facilities although this added new total supply lithium units the market significance 
both companies used their own lithium carbonate feedstock 
existing suppliers have shifted some production lithium carbonate lithium hydroxide capitalize the price 
premium many battery cathode customers are prepared pay for lithium hydroxide fulfil raw material 
requirements the latest generation high performance cathodes nmc and nca lesser extent nmc based 
cathodes have grown popular among car manufacturers due higher energy density longer cycle life and improved 
safety when compared earlier generation cobalt based batteries lithium cobalt oxide lco and lithium iron 
phosphate lfp navigant cobalt based batteries requiring greater carbonate still have place popular 
consumer electronics like iphones tablets ipads and laptops the company planned lithium hydroxide plant 
japan built conjunction with our joint venture partners ttc would supply into this rapidly growing market 
sector demand was strong during the final quarter customers reported desire build additional stocks 
buffer against inactivity during the upcoming chinese new year holidays robust demand combined with supply 
constraints lithium carbonate resulted notable growth chinese lithium carbonate spot prices 
although the disparity market prices between lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide has narrowed with more 
hydroxide volume becoming available and lithium carbonate volume experiencing continued strong demand there still 
remains price premium the top end the lithium hydroxide price range tonne for new contracts set 
for early supply industrial minerals december 
downstream participants the battery market supply chain indicated strong interest financing mining projects 
based limited supply lithium salts and growing demand for electric vehicles and energy storage systems key car 
manufacturers announced electric vehicle growth plans including 
toyota announced partnership with panasonic develop prismatic cells with the target million ev 
per annum including million pure ev per annum 
ford created dedicated team edison focus the development all electric cars the automaker 
also pledged invest billion over five years new all electric and hybrid vehicles with new models 
slated for release 
jaguar land rover plans electrify its entire vehicle line with new powertrains ranging from mild 
hybrid vehicles all electric systems 
plans models 
volvo will electrify its entire vehicle line with five all electric models slated roll out between 
the automaker hopes sell total one million hybrid and electric cars and 
group parent european automakers like volkswagen audi and porsche will invest billion 
development roughly billion the total will dedicated battery production but the company also 
plans offer electric and hybrid versions vehicles 
key thematic among the car manufacturers plans was chinese market development and the country ambitious 
targets and the growing share pure ev versus hybrids september the chinese ministry industry and 
information technology miit released revised new energy vehicle nev policy requiring automakers increase 
nev production and the policy incorporates both credits and penalties the structure 
the policy said benefit large scale manufacturers china such byd catl zotye saic geely and chery and 
aligns with the chinese governments aim consolidate the battery supply chain estimated that compliance with 
the policy will result million new passenger nev sales implying annual sales growth 
roskill currently the global average sales growth rate 
the confidence car manufacturers demand underpins robust demand expectations for lithium strong demand 
from the rechargeable battery industry combined with supply chain bottlenecks for lithium salts and slower ramp 
new projects likely support continued price growth during the company forecasts demand growth
