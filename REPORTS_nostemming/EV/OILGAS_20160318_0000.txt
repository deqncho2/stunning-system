electric cars have the potential reduce oil demand considerably 
the long term however this unlikely the case over the next 
years and possibly longer even assuming rapid adoption evs 
will likely displace less than current oil demand 
electric vehicles still small electric vehicles accounted for just 
the global car parc and new car sales and many see little 
change opec predicted its world oil outlook that cars the 
road will still powered oil based fuels exxonmobil sees this 
percentage commenting its own long term outlook report that 
even though battery costs are likely fall coming decades electric vehicles 
will continue face significant challenges other alternatives also improve

but growing fast last year global sales increased suggesting there 
least the potential for far greater impact norway electric vehicles 
already accounted for total new car sales from 
this note ask the question how quickly and what extent evs 
could impact oil demand more optimistic scenarios for market share gains 
three rapid adoption scenarios for the future the combination 
small base and high growth rate inevitably makes for imprecise modeling 
this stage our ambition not have specific forecast but merely 
demonstrate range possible outcomes evs take off this focus 
three scenarios that are all optimistic the first two the share evs 
new car sales follows curve that passes the mark and 
respectively also explore even more optimistic blue sky scenario 
which evs already reach market share but this appears highly 
unlikely 
under these scenarios the global fleet reaches mln units 
market share tracks towards the period 
sales would continue grow over the next years reaching 
million new units per year from thousand the 
worldwide fleet would reach million cars this scenario the blue 
sky scenario this would reach million new sales and total fleet 
million cars 
current fuel efficiency these would offset oil 
demand the million evs the road likely displaced more 
than thousand barrels per day oil demand this based 
assumed average fuel efficiency mpg and typical annual mileage 
miles both are based data for the from the eia which 
have assumed indicative globally the global fleet were reach the

how much oil will electric vehicles displace 
continues from from page 
projected million mentioned above that would offset million barrel gasoline and 
diesel per day the blue sky scenario mentioned above this would increase million 
this amount small relative the natural decline 
rate existing oilfields these amounts are the 
order global oil demand which currently 
mln also currently producing oilfields will 
likely see their production decline over 
the next years due natural decline according 
estimates from rystad keep production stable the 
oil industry will need develop significant amount 
new resources the mln impact from evs 
does not meaningfully change this 
exhibit producing fields look set decline 
despite evs this still needs 
offset new field development 
oil production from currently producing fields mln bbl 
after the impact evs could accelerate 
have focused above the coming years 
however market share does track towards 
rce rystad ergy 
sometime the amount oil demand 
displaced could larger and beyond that scenario evs could displace mln 
transportation fuel with upside blue sky scenario 
each scenario the conventional car fleet continues grow until least for this analysis 
assume car sales line with the estimates from our autos team which sees sales growing from mln units 
million units after that assume steady annual growth rate even with the 
optimistic assumptions for adoption the three scenarios described above the conventional oil fueled car 
fleet continues grow from bln cars bln units this represents growth rate 
over the last years fuel efficiency cars has improved per year this indicative for 
the global car fleet well and continues into the future demand for transportation fuels likely continue 
grow for some time come
