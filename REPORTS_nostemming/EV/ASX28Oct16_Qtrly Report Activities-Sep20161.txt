sales revenue for the september quarter was million representing the first full quarter 
commercial production and sales from the olaroz lithium facility pro rata sales tonnes based off 
may june were while the average price received was cash operating costs were

still remained higher than the june quarter production the december quarter forecast between 
and tonnes 
the focus continued improvements operating practice plant optimisation and process 
control with the operation consistently achieving good performance the primary circuit the focus 
has been the purification circuit following various minor modifications the circuit now operating 
with improved control increased residence times reactors and good temperature profiles through all 
parts the circuit addition changes carbon dioxide injection points and diffusor design 
modification have resulted the elimination process material and the achievement more 
stable operating conditions throughout the circuit

europe asia and the usa normal production sold either battery technical industrial grade 
products and sold into the chemical manufacturing industrial and battery application sectors 
commercial dispatches high purity product battery market customers continued during the quarter 
and additional customers will supplied the december quarter 
the september quarter sales price was against the june quarter tonne the 
customer orders fulfilled during the quarter included significant number back orders that were 
priced levels much lower than current contract levels and the weighted average price achieved 
course dependent upon the mix customer orders fulfilled during the quarter which influenced 
number factors including shipping schedules the company maintains price guidance fob 
basis for the december quarter approximately tonne strong market demand and supply 
side constraints are expected maintain robust market prices for lithium carbonate

the tincalayu borax plant expansion and modifications completed the previous quarter were fully 
commissioned and ramping production rate during the quarter going benefits the recent 
works include lower unit production costs for both decahydrate and pentahydrate and additional 
options export finished product directly from tincalayu international markets via chilean ports 
modifications the boric acid plant campo quijano were completed july and undergoing 
commissioning during the quarter recent production rates above have been achieved line 
with expectations 
the modifications both tincalayu and camp quijano are expected result improved unit costs 
both facilities 
tincalayu expansion study 
study commenced evaluate potential expansion the tincalayu refined borates 
operation from its current production capacity tonnes per annum and 
integrated tonne boric acid plant 
anticipated that the potential expansion will further enhance efficiencies the production 
refined borates tincalayu and contribute improved manufacturing unit costs this study will 
consolidate the work already undertaken new gas pipeline for which permitting underway

tsx orl and building substantial argentinian based industrial minerals company through the 
construction and operation its portfolio lithium potash and boron projects and facilities the 
puna region northern argentina the company has built partnership with toyota tsusho 
corporation and jemse the first large scale greenfield brine based lithium project years the 
salar olaroz with planned production tonnes per annum low cost battery grade lithium 
carbonate 
the olaroz lithium facility has low environmental footprint because the following aspects the 
process 
the process designed have high processing recovery lithium with its low unit costs the 
process will result low cut off grades which will maximise resource recovery 
the process route designed with zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored 
permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds the end the project life the ponds 
will capped and returned similar profile following soil placement and planting original 
vegetation types 
brine extracted from wells with minimum impact freshwater resources outside the salar 
because the lithium sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are 
limited the salar itself this different from halite hosted deposits such salar atacama 
salar hombre muerto and salar rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface 
permeability and the drawdown cones can impact water resources around the salar affecting 
the local environment 
energy used concentrate the lithium the brine solar energy the carbon footprint lower 
than other processes 
the technology developed has very low maximum fresh water consumption which 
low industry standards
