rce rgan stan ley research 
believe tesla possesses all critical attributes needed become high performing shared 
mobility firm 
vehicle design and engineering the model achieved the highest overall rating consumer reports 
history and the safest car ever crash tested nhtsa this the first car tesla has ever made from the 
ground believe subsequent efforts could achieve even more impressive results 
leadership connected car tesla vehicle fleet connected the internet with the ability 
execute over the air firmware updates that affect almost every electromechanical and content attribute the 
driving experience other automaker today has the same proportion connected vehicles connected cars 
are critical the commercialization and performance shared model most ride sharing firms give their 
drivers iphone communicate with passengers and collect data from tesla perspective the entire car 
iphone 
autonomous cars software expertise the holy grail shared mobility replacing the mistake prone 
fatigued and expensive human driver with robot that drives with greater accuracy and precision many times 
better than the best human driver tesla investing significant sums into the development autonomous 
technology strategic imperative while many auto companies are developing their own autonomous 
capabilities believe the composition tesla workforce with tech and software engineers proximity 
key tech enablers and risk taking culture separate from the pack fully autonomous cars are required 
achieve high utilization rates hour day which see tesla mobility potentially 
approaching late next decade 
battery electric powertrain expertise tesla the global leader electric vehicles particularly when 
measured aggregate annual production energy storage the inauguration the gigafactory reno 
should vault tesla into the global lead lithium ion battery production given the poor payback math evs 
ownership model years compared ice engine gallon gas and year miles 
driven the shared economy model critical achieving mass adoption evs with today battery technology 
due the far lower number moving parts and instant torque evs provide superior powertrain for 
algorithm controlled autonomous vehicles

proprietary infrastructure network the business selling miles rather than just cars requires followthrough infrastructure support the many thousands vehicles the fleet more than any other company 
tesla has developed extensive global network company owned service stations and charging 
infrastructure two key ingredients support shared electric fleet tesla had supercharging 
stations globally and apparently opening one new station nearly every hours while data the 
number supercharging stations not widely available believe tesla proprietary network may 
much larger than the next biggest competitor 
tesla leads each these five attributes any which itself would advantage entering the 
shared mobility space look for tesla milestones autonomous tech coincide with the introduction 
its new model catalysts include the introduction the model september unveiling the model first 
prosecution the gigafactory and competitive announcements from the likes google which 
attempting have fleet autonomous cars the road and uber which beefing human 
and capital efforts their advanced technologies center atc following the purchase cmri carnegie 
mellon robotics institute and the hiring brian mcclendon from google brian worked google maps for 
years see these important milestones the competition for sustainable mobility the sixth attribute 
missing from the list above tesla leadership culture believe elon musk combines the vision expertise 
and sense urgency commercialize these efforts faster than the market may anticipating

executives both traditional and start automotive companies support this view 
while the destination the auto business model clear the shape the journey less clear

every day this stage have enough conviction include incarnation tesla application shared 
mobility model into our bull case valuation the stock please note that our forecasts not this time 
incorporate tesla mobility the revenue and profit assumptions due uncertainty about how the company 
would account for such revenue and the associated costs anticipate that this will change once have 
greater visibility timing and strategy going forward have assumed that the launch tesla mobility 
would funded internal cash flow forecast tesla have more than net cash balance sheet 
following the conversion debt equity our key assumptions are follows 
miles traveled forecast tesla launch demand mobility service around one full year after 
expect the commercial introduction the model anticipate they would start with average fleet size 
units less than weeks production anticipate for that year with average miles car 
initially slightly more than the average annual volume daily rental car would envision 
potential global tesla mobility fleet size cars with nearly miles car for comparison sake our 
projected global fleet size for hertz the daily rental car company around vehicles 
forecast tesla have more than billion miles traveled the global market for miles traveled 
forecast fleet million cars and billion miles nearly billion miles month slightly 
eclipsing the global market share for miles while expect tesla initially manufacture its own fleet from

three potential stages tesla mobility 
would expect the initial version tesla mobility human driven shared model before 
transitioning more automated and then fully automated shared model the future additionally 
assume tesla would enter the shared mobility arena standalone basis not partnership 
model with other players also anticipate that like many tech firms tesla would outsource production 
its vehicles contract manufacturers and that the physical fleet may held party financial model 
reit structure that tesla leases for fixed term with embedded depreciation and interest charges underpinned 
residual value assumption see the technological and commercial lifecycle tesla mobility 
following phases over time 
phase semi autonomous cars with human driver the first cars that expect 
introduced into the tesla mobility may capable autonomous driving the vast majority driving 
conditions but would not autonomous requiring human driver perform the mobility service the 
driver may tesla employee independent contractor mix both depending the application 
geographic region the prevailing regulatory environment may also depend the quality and consistency 
mobility experience tesla trying offer the passenger given tesla track record for building brand 
authenticity and premium experience would lean towards tesla using its own associates while the human 
still has much control over the vehicle 
phase near fully autonomous car with human operator the mobility fleet will likely 
begin seeing the introduction vehicles capable driving without human intervention much 
driving scenarios but would notify the driver ahead time impairments exceptional conditions areas 
where human intervention needed these circumstances cars are likely equipped with elon musk 
explained recent earnings call some auxiliary steering thing that pops out only emergency that 
looks more like nintendo controller playstation controller something like that these versions 
autonomous cars the tesla representative more operator rather than true driver there just case 
something goes wrong potentially regulatory requirement 
phase phase shared fully autonomous cars and beyond this application autonomous 
tech based cars without steering wheel pedals commercialization these mobility devices will likely 
grow select cities coordinated and highly regulated public private partnerships note there may 
earlier examples fully autonomous pods confined areas other cities early but 
don believe such cars would available significant enough number comparison what see 
years out this ecosystem see combination phase and all working together team 
communicate with each other the changing road traffic weather and pedestrian conditions throughout

key risks 
key risks the thesis tesla risk taking entrepreneurial company with risk taking culture that has taken 
some the largest most capital intensive industries properly executed the rewards equity holders from 
our tesla mobility thesis could potentially big tesla fails the cost would cash burn lost time 
opportunity cost and management distraction each tesla primary business initiatives launching the model 
investing batteries and launching tesla energy have involved many risks that still persist today tesla still 
burns significant amounts cash pace that takes gross liquidity down rather low levels for company 
that has many investment needs believe the opportunity enter the shared mobility space ultimately the 
shared autonomy space worth the risk but investors must comfortable identifying and quantifying them 
lay out the four biggest risks below 
competition nearly every auto company interact with potentially developing some form shared 
mobility business model while believe most the traditional auto companies could struggle 
commercialize such models that attack the very core their current human driven individually owned internal 
combustion manufacturing sales model this won stop them from trying even unsuccessful efforts auto 
companies offer shared mobility services can potentially add competitive disruption they race for scale 
particularly the early years additionally any number very large tech firms are girding for piece the 
mobility market with commercial introductions expected from the time frame investors these 
firms can allow larger losses the industry matures before reaching sustainable competitive equilibrium 
reflect these risks our expectation front losses tesla mobility secular deflation average 
revenue mile margins higher than the inefficient traditional car rental model around airline margins 
and market share have allowed vehicle miles traveled earth held other 
players implying large degree fragmentation and continued persistence owned miles and partiallyhuman driven miles 
regulation the auto industry one the most regulated industries the world particularly due the 
high big ticket nature employment workforce scale impact infrastructure environment impact and 
consumer safety implications the auto industry transitions more pure public transportation network 
anticipate the regulatory impact would remain extremely high even autonomous cars are scientifically 
proven drive much better than any human would still expect any number regulatory gating factors 
what happens when not the first autonomous semi autonomous car involved pedestrian fatality 
the recent vehicle hacking examples have shed light just small portion the execution risks that lie ahead 
with the development the car the future have learned much from the development airbags which 
have been responsible for thousands accidental deaths and injuries yet still penetrate every car made today 
the value life preservation and injury prevention far outweighs the risks reflect the regulatory risks 
our tesla mobility model through slow adoption curve share over years and estimated licensing fees 
which account for revenues far the single largest cost item our unit economics model 
consumer adoption when the horseless carriage began appearing roads the early century 
most people were horrified the thought giving the use their horse many people enjoy driving cars 
and have interest giving control and freedom movement robot physiological grounds 
principle many people didn like cell phones and computers the dawn their commercialization these risks 
may seem intangible but they real the onus the firms that are developing the new mobility model 
offer product that vastly superior many forms the status quo don expect shared vehicles 
replace all cars quickly the battle starts with taxis livery cars then car rental then the household car then 
the car the car it long journey that believe likely characterized punctuated 
equilibrium the status quo reflect these risks implying that much global miles 
traveled are still not shared miles 
execution are fond the saying vision without execution hallucination tesla still work inprogress auto manufacturer and developer energy storage solutions while moving into the area 
shared mobility may not big stretch for tesla there are many factors that would likely remain outside the

what tesla saying 
what has tesla communicated this topic not much all however numerous statements from 
earnings calls and presentations enable envision path for mobility tesla among select few firms 
the forefront autonomous car development and the only auto manufacturer with its sensorsaturated fleet connected the internet available for over the air firmware updates all the time these 
advantages are not small recent discussion with tesla executive the topic autonomous mobility 
stated addressing the utilization the automobile brainer for the industry the automobile easily 
the most underutilized machine the world has ever known whenever hear tesla advancement 
human substitution the driver seat are drawn one our central tenets the future mobility 
fully autonomous car must shared not owned fully autonomous car designed work take 
people and things places efficiently possible people only want spend much time car but the 
car can theoretically work all day long not just minutes per day 
take look tesla mission statement teslamotors about tesla mission 
accelerate the world transition sustainable transport 
our opinion sustainable transport shared mobility autonomous vehicles and evs are inextricably 
linked don just suspect that tesla could launch shared mobility model take advantage market 
opportunity think would launch shared mobility service because has accelerate sustainable 
transport does not somebody else would even does somebody else would there are trillion miles 
traveled annually the surface the earth representing trillion market opportunity somebody will

jonas first question steve jurvetson was recently quoted saying that uber ceo travis kalanick told him that 
tesla cars are autonomous that want buy all them this real mean forget the for 
moment but this real business opportunity for tesla supplying cars ridesharing firms does tesla 
just cut out the middleman and sell demand electric mobility services directly from the company its own 
platform 
musk that insightful question 
jonas you don have answer 
musk don think should answer 
jonas sometimes you can tell more from the non answer than from the answer

why serious bulls again 
the following section has been reproduced from our june piece entitled tesla motors inc why 
serious bulls again 
electric vehicles have failed achieve mainstream success given inferior economic payback periods 
long years but the shared autonomy model highly utilized mega fleets could completely flip the 
script takes hold evs can stage major comeback 
the main reason why evs have been categorically failing date the cars aren used enough 
per gallon and today efficient internal combustion engine car achieves fuel cost per mile 
approximately cents cents per kwh and miles per kwh today achieves fuel cost per mile 
around cents the average car the drives around miles per year meaning that cent fuel cost 
per mile arbitrage results annual savings that sounds great until you consider that 
battery mile range kwh requires consumer pay more for the car front how does 
year payback sound not awesome the problem the average miles driven year disguises the fact 
that cars are used average for less than hour day for only utilization this low utilization the current 
automotive ownership model drove our rather bearish outlook penetration earlier see our note from 
may tesla motors inc evs are dead long live tesla now take the same scenario and have the 
car used taxi ride sharing firm for miles year around utilization and the payback falls 
years take battery costs kwh and gas price gallon and the payback falls further years 
eah but who drives miles year robot taxi pod course 
the biggest sea change developments that can save the business model 
shared mobility mobile technology and relatively simple software increases driving utilization rates 
order magnitude bring taxis and chauffeur services the masses this transforms the auto business model 
from ownership shared enabling each car drive far greater number miles per year helps 
amortize the front cost battery far more rapidly shrinking the payback greater numbers evs enable 
oems and contract manufacturers achieve unprecedented scale economies battery pack production 
yielding further benefits 
take the point vehicle utilization payback rates the extreme imagine that the owner 
battery car used the vehicle for the very rare sunday drive miles year the extra premium paid 
for the car owning car gallon gasoline would take years pay off break even 
internal combustion engine such vehicle would have purchased the century the founding 
rome during homer epics ignoring inflation the same car were used miles year the breakeven 
payoff would years purchased when george washington was year old lad rambling around the 
fields the colony virginia the flipside the were operated miles year the payback would 
years achieve the same year payback only shrinking the battery cost holding miles driven flat 
year would require kwh reduction from tesla current claimed level cost 
achievement kwh would require technological breakthrough while miles year just requires 
smarter use technology that already exists 
autonomous cars eliminating the human from the driving equation can further improve utilization even 
higher levels and efficiency and lower cost per mile far the largest cost today ride sharing service the 
person behind the wheel replace the driver with few million lines code and some commoditized sensors 
and the savings can really begin shared autonomous fleets address many other problems with today 
model such slower charging time lower charging station density and range limitations out total 
autonomous taxi fleet say vehicles perhaps would involved some portion the 
charging process please note are not considering any material differences maintenance repair costs 
between and ice vehicle 
tesla motors inc august 
the apple effect have thought through what this really means the world most valuable 
company were design and engineer car are convinced would battery electric propulsion 
system apple potential sponsorship the far beleaguered technology could have transformational 
ramifications for the industry the same could applied other well capitalized technology players such 
google samsung amazon any number other public and privately held firms who may have 
vested strategic interest addressing trillion global mobility market apple posted profits billion 
and billion its last two quarters against revenues billion and billion just quarter worth 
free cash flow apple approx equal nearly months combined spend all the world 
automotive oems combined what sliver this cash flow were directed serious manner the 
development the state the art electric vehicles energy storage now imagine apple next largest 
competitors trying the same thing see our april note tesla motors inc can apple save the electric 
car 
fully autonomous car meant shared not owned why autonomous car technology 
important the development evs it simple fully autonomous car steering wheel pedals 
can work hours day will consumers buy car capable doing all the work itself just have sit idle for 
more than hours day why are you buying all this technology only amortize over utilization 
perhaps you may spend more time your own car but really more than hours day run business 
taxi service the autonomous car can generating revenue for much hour day our 
simulations nearly hours day average some days more some days less the higher utilization means 
expensive tech can far cheaper per mile basis 
tesla motors inc august 
end auto sales 
the following section has been reproduced from our april piece entitled detroit kodak moment 
the end the auto sales model 
kodak invented the technology digital photography yet misjudged the business model digital 
photography many cases detroit the forefront autonomous technology but can make the 
business model leap from cars sold miles minutes traveled 
forget cars sold it miles traveled and revenue per mile that matters the auto industry transforms from 
big ticket consumer expenditure mobility service 
the morgan stanley global auto team thinks it time consider the total addressable market 
automobiles radically different way the established paradigm the business model substantially 
unchanged for the past years that you manufacture vehicles and sell them people one time 
purchase with variety after sales and service accoutrements keep the machine good working order 
our opinion this model dying the new model mobility service where the car and driver either 
human being robot are bought needed demand for the precise distance required have written 
extensively this topic over the past year see our april note shared autonomy put this chart your 
wall it sad life 
fastest growth market share miles traveled coming from miles driven computer and 
miles paid for passenger make the mental transformation helps one can think the global 
auto industry from the perspective rather elegantly round yet believe accurate number trillion 
miles traveled annually you got now think about this 
what portion miles traveled will executed robot when ask this question are not 
merely referring miles traveled fully autonomous cars are also referring the autonomous portion 
the journey executed the semi autonomous car for example assume years from now your morning 
commute you get your semi autonomous car back out your driveway and drive mile with minor 
computer oversight the ramp the highway once the highway your smart cruise control with active 
forward collision warning takes over and keeps you your lane for the next miles you get off the onramp you encounter bumper bumper traffic the suburban strip your car takes over again you nudge 
forward mph for the next miles traffic frees and you drive the remaining mile the office 
parking deck the mile journey you drove miles and the robot drove miles was the car fully 
autonomous and capable doing the driving for you all conditions was your journey 
autonomous yes defined this way the share autonomous miles driven growing exponentially from 
starting point near today thinking ahead the technology advances and regulations and tastes evolve 
see the share autonomous drives approaching the more humans experience the tech the more 
they need there going back the only thing moving faster than the pace machine learning 
the pace human learning 
what portion miles traveled will done taxi like where the passenger paying the 
minute the mile the average car america drives around miles per year there are million cars 
roads driving around trillion miles per year what share these miles are done taxis and uber like 
services there precise data this topic but would estimate something closer than where 
will this years years one can attempt simulate the adoption curve but are confident the 
destination close miles traveled will paid for demand service 
tesla motors inc august 
tesla energy 
our analysis still subject several unknowns suggests that full deployment and customer 
adoption within years our view tesla energy products could potentially add share 
value assuming the gigafactory output were sold the power sector seen another way 
each million units powerwall sales assuming price kwh gross margin capitalized 
would worth estimated per tsla share shares around tesla current 
share price the past tesla has suggested that much the gigafactory annual mwh 
output could sold the power sector 
achieve equivalent revenue the car business equivalent million homes with powerwall 
estimate tesla would need sell units average price incremental margin 
our opinion tesla profitability and share price development would continue dominated its ability 
disrupt the trillion global mobility market trillion miles traveled value mile 
exhibit potential impacts tesla valuation from energy storage sales 
rce rgan stan ley research 
while are optimistic regarding the commercial potential tesla storage products there are 
number unknowns that cloud their outlook most notably 
utility adoption rate possible that utilities begin very cautiously exploring the deployment storage 
and that demand ramps relatively slowly given the low current penetration rate solar power most 
states and given that the grid actually highly robust and resilient renewables additions many utilities may 
not feel compelled make major bet energy storage within the next several years 
degree competition from other storage products other storage manufacturers have sense for the 
growing market potential storage and there always possibility that some these players could become 
aggressive pricing order secure large volume orders while this possibility like the industrial 
tesla motors inc august 
logic tesla gigafactory and the scale that tesla pursuing producing more batteries this one factory 
than the rest the world produces combined basis appears challenging replicate 
regulatory dynamics the entire off grid business model would our view not come fruition until and 
solar net metering policies become less favorable solar power that while the utility grid treated 
free low cost battery under net metering policy why would customer pay for storage replace the grid 
other regulatory dynamics such the spread between off peak and peak power prices charged utilities 
well the payments made for grid stability services could significantly impact the demand for storage all 
this being said given solarcity intends include storage all solar projects within years believe 
there some evidence for the attractive economics storage under range scenarios 
will continue monitor new customer adoption rates especially among key early adopters such 
california utilities solar power firms such scty and independent storage developers such aes the next 
several months would our view likely telling terms how much commercial traction tesla would have 
with its storage products are use clich cautiously optimistic
