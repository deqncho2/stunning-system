orocobre continues actively manage the business produce the best possible economic outcome 
while considering long term strategic objectives the optimisation operating cashflow takes into 
account the significant profit margin that currently available the industrial market and the ability 
operate the primary circuit industrial product higher production rates

brine inventory 
the end the quarter brine inventory was approximately tonnes lithium carbonate 
equivalent 
brine ponds olaroz lithium facility 
sales orders 
during the december quarter commercial shipments lithium carbonate continued dispatched 
from the olaroz lithium facility with growing geographic diversity from asia europe and the usa 
lithium carbonate meeting the specifications battery technical and industrial markets was sold into 
wide range applications within the chemical manufacturing industrial and battery sectors 
the december quarter sales price was tonne sales tonnes while our base 
battery market and high specification technical market customers continues grow the company 
weighted sales price was impacted legacy contracts agreed during the early part with terms 
that span beyond just one quarter meet our contractual commitments the company prioritised 
these orders which will allow for higher average contract value 
the price received the december quarter was also impacted contracts that were negotiated and 
delivered toyota tsusho corporation based the weaker pricing and demand that occurred 
china related uncertainty created the electric vehicle subsidy policy reviews additionally some 
higher priced shipments scheduled for late december have been delayed into due delays from 
strike antofagasta port and customs clearance over christmas 
strong contract pricing has been achieved thus far for both industrial and battery technical market 
product delivered during and the company maintains the strategy offer mix short 
and long term contracts support sustainable customer base for the future the company expects 
pricing for the march quarter higher than the december quarter 
short term lithium market outlook

the chinese government subsidy policy resulted significant growth throughout the lithium battery 
manufacturing supply chain over suppliers battery cells and producers battery packs were 
reportedly operating china during source automotive news china 
the chinese government announced adjusted policy late and the company believes that the 
adjusted policy will support consolidation smaller players will disadvantaged more stringent 
battery design requirements including higher energy discharge rate increased duration greater 
energy density threshold and more robust safety measures due diligence requirements will also 
more thorough before permits are granted and subsidies are paid 
nonetheless the chinese government maintains the target achieving five million units the road 
from estimated chinese consumers are increasingly shifting from 
preference for phevs past years full ev large manufacturers improve the range models 
byd began offering version its best selling phev model and recorded sales 
units making the fourth best selling globally furthermore byd will longer offer it phev 
version its song suv instead only manufacturing the full version source lux research 
terms lithium consumption the absolute effect china industry reform positive and will 
support continued growth outside china key markets including the usa and europe continue 
gain government support for production with fleet targets remaining place for european 
countries such norway 
traditional end use markets such glass ceramics and portable devices are also forecast grow 
well above gdp rates supporting baseload demand 
lithium hydroxide plant japan 
construction tonne per annum battery grade lithium hydroxide plant will expedited 
following completion initial site visits japan three engineering firms svenson gea and veolia 
have submitted proposals construct the plant which will based proven off the shelf design 
and constructed turn key basis 
the project being fast tracked meet growing demand which not being fully met with constrained 
feedstock supply exising hydroxide plants least estimated capital costs are expected 
provided the japanese government support their world class battery industry 
expansion study for olaroz 
number different expansion options were assessed focusing the production both lithium 
carbonate and lithium hydroxide using either conventional and non conventional technologies and 
combinations technologies with different rates production the stage expansion strategy has 
considered product market conditions processing risk capital costs and potential returns 
the key results the studies were 
there are key strategic advantages add lithium hydroxide the orocobre product range 
feed the growing demand the battery sector 
the preferred location for lithium hydroxide plant japan order close 
integrated with cathode manufacturers servicing the growing electric vehicle sector 
only existing conventional processing technologies will used the expansion all 
unconventional technologies reviewed carried significant level process risk and were not 
seen hold any commercial advantage over conventional technologies 
stage olaroz expected fully funded project debt and internal project cashflows 
olaroz stage will entail the construction tpa lithium carbonate production facility adjacent 
the stage operations salar olaroz northern argentina the expansion expected include 
both primary and purification circuits capable producing battery grade lithium carbonate 
capital requirements 
the stage capital cost estimated million including million contingency for 
construction tonne lithium carbonate facility 
lithium hydroxide plant constructed japan the approximate capital cost will million 
before any government incentives 
expected that the funding both developments will involve project debt circa and operating

orocobre does not anticipate the need raise equity capital finance either the stage expansion

the process obtain the necessary permits and approvals for stage has commenced and will run 
concurrently with engineering and design work 
orocobre and its joint venture partners expect reach final investment decision mid stage 
commissioning planned commence late early which aligns with projected

about orocobre limited 
orocobre limited listed the australian securities exchange and toronto stock exchange asx ore 
tsx orl and building substantial argentinian based industrial chemicals and minerals company 
through the construction and operation its portfolio lithium potash and boron projects and 
facilities the puna region northern argentina the company has built partnership with toyota 
tsusho corporation and jemse the first large scale greenfield brine based lithium project 
approximately years the salar olaroz with planned production tonnes per annum 
low cost battery grade lithium carbonate 
the olaroz lithium facility has low environmental footprint because the following aspects the 
process 
the process designed have high processing recovery lithium with its low unit costs the 
process will result low cut off grades which will maximise resource recovery 
the process route designed with zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored 
permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds the end the project life the ponds 
will capped and returned similar profile following soil placement and planting original 
vegetation types 
brine extracted from wells with minimum impact freshwater resources outside the salar 
because the lithium sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are 
limited the salar itself this different from halite hosted deposits such salar atacama 
salar hombre muerto and salar rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface 
permeability and the drawdown cones can impact water resources around the salar affecting 
the local environment 
energy used concentrate the lithium the brine solar energy the carbon footprint lower 
than other processes 
the technology developed has very low maximum fresh water consumption which 
low industry standards
