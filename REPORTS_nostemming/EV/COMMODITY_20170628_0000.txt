graphite copper aluminium nickel manganese and cobalt these cobalt 
market the smallest and already dominated the end use

demand surge has prompted aggressive stockpiling lifting its spot price from

supply demand model

vehicles was electronics that consumed most cobalt rechargeable batteries 
but our europe automotive analyst harald hendrikse expects global 
emissions legislation prompt auto oems invest production capability 
coming years forecasting million sales autos shared

artisanal output swing supply 
the most price responsive source cobalt the drc artisanal supply totaling its nature this poorly tracked supply source which has recently come 
under increasing scrutiny following amnesty international report child labour see 
sustainable cobalt while the industry push adopt ethical practices may limit 
artisanal supply growth our forecasts assume that output from this source holds 
current levels 
china controls refined supply 
the drc dominates global mine supply china dominates refined output 
producing total global supply mostly the form sulfates and 
oxides for battery cathodes just metal with limited domestic resources china 
requires imports concentrates intermediates mostly from the drc 
low prices downstream destocking and constrained raw materials supply led 
decline china refined output last year mse but demand recovers 
output expected lift too mse expanding despite 
this growth our base case assumes that global refined supply growth lags mine output 
resulting lower overall processing rates key risk our base case more rapid 
expansion refining capacity consider this scenario our price section 
recycling 
cobalt recycling derived from electronic waste and batteries still undeveloped 
flow material collection waste has proven difficult according unep 
gold industrial applications recycled but only gold 
electronic goods commercial recycling will probably expand with increase global 
sales given the homogeneity the waste source and the existing process for other 
battery waste processing 
supply risks 
the global dominance drc mine supply and china refined supply are source 
concern among cobalt end users particularly auto oems the drc history 
power shortages and political conflict are particular issues for the security cobalt 
supply however the nearterm automakers attempts secure long term supplies 
from elsewhere presents upside risk price since little growth mine supply 
forecast drc much which tied the nickel price outlook 
project pipeline 
global cobalt resources are estimated usgs with reserves 
drc the trade recent price lift has prompted the roll out several greenfield 
projects drc including syerston australia nico canada

with most mined metal markets have limited visibility projects post 
most supply expected still product copper and nickel mining follows 
that cobalt production heavily dependent the demand price outlook copper 
mse real and nickel mse real and not that cobalt 
price 
historical perspective 
cobalt price has averaged real terms over the last years for much the last century there was little volatility handful dominant 
producers controlled supply and set the price that stability disappeared the late 
when rebels invaded the drc then zaire disrupting that key source global 
supply driving the price its peak nominal this precipitated 
the development cobalt free market although producer pricing persisted 
the mid the market had returned surplus and the price stabilized lower 
levels further spikes occurred through the early primarily supply cuts and 
renewed political unrest zaire drc the late early brought new sources 
supply particularly from product nickel mines finally the sale cobalt from 
strategic stockpiles drove price its low real terms 
nominal 
the next price spike occurred late strong demand for electronics and 
superalloys together with the drc export ban and some industry consolidation prices 
remained relatively soft after the global financial crisis capped expanding global 
supply averaging just the lme cobalt contract established has 
reported progressive improvement liquidity now rivaling the long standing metal

cobalt key mineral that enables transition electric vehicles however there are

commodity market

the high concentration cobalt supply the drc presents raised political and 
supply risk compared other minerals that are sourced from more diversified group 
countries this particularly important given the unstable political regime 
transparency international ranks the democratic republic congo score 
out 
conflict minerals 
the state department defines conflict minerals those whose exploration and 
production are potentially connected human rights violations specifically the 
democratic republic the congo congo however present the term only 
applies tantalum tin tungsten and gold known there the potential for 
expansion the list include cobalt should this happen then companies who use 
cobalt their products would need file conflict mineral disclosure reports the 
sec under the dodd frank wall street reform act 
europe the recently finalized regulations that require similar compliance 
some ways regulations are stricter than those the geographical 
application extends beyond congo includes any conflict affected and high risk 
areas worldwide however here too cobalt currently not included from the list 
affected minerals only covers tantalum tin tungsten gold 
for now the responsibility appears end users cobalt enhance the 
transparency their raw materials supply chain follows that companies using 
conflict minerals are exposed reputational damage increased regulation stricter
