with infineon delivering growth its automotive business and 
growth the power chips for electric cars business momentum very 
strong for the company that said with questions around the level sellthrough the car market believe fair separate what structural from 
cyclical those very strong numbers reported yesterday 
believe that infineon sold about worth power chips electric cars 
with about market share the top selling evs contain 
infineon igbts representing total sales and automotive sales 
bullish scenario whereby infineon maintains market share and there 
price decline for its igbts electric cars power chips could represent 
total sales for infineon this bullish because price decline 
assumption 
that said believe there price reduction those chips and when 
attended the automotive power electronics conference paris saw toyota 
showing price reduction per annum for its home made igbts through 
reduction the die size better transistor characteristic and more efficient 
packaging result with more realistic price decline our model and 
stable market share power chips could represent double

more silicon carbide 
there significant premium for sic transistors could find sic mosfet from 
stmicroelectronics for while the equivalent igbt would cost both automotive 
grade important otherwise the prices would lower the cost premium just 
about offset the savings made the components around the chip today but for sic 
gain proper traction the main inverter module increase the car range and 
the charger decrease the charging time prices need fall further after 
discussing with industry specialists believe that the greatest potential cost saving 
comes from the substrate wafer happened the solar panel industry before the 
automotive industry commits looks like will follow tesla silicon carbide there 
will enough capital build capacity silicon carbide furnaces and sawing equipment 
make more and wafers lower price the cost premium could fall from 
but not parity silicon wafer manufacturing line would always cost less 
than silicon carbide 
not all igbts car would replaced sic chips while there are 
igbts tesla because tesla does not use modules there are our view igbts 
more normal car like the nissan leaf renault zoe bmw 
believe that for average car the power chip content would close 
assuming all igbts and for mix sic and igbts that would 
compare with today more semiconductor content good for infineon but the 
unknown the market share timeframe its assumed market share 
today with igbts assuming the market size remains the same because 
accelerated pricing pressure legacy igbts because the more efficient sic but 
infineon market share could fall then power chips for evs would represent
