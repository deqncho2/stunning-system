investment summary 
electric vehicles will become increasingly important 
growth driver for the industry see electric vehicles crucial part the future china mobility 
although china currently the world biggest automobile 
and market terms sales volume penetration 
remains low compared with developed regions asia 
such japan believe will take time for the auto 
industry gain momentum light the challenges 
ahead however given china current position and ambition develop nevs expect penetration reach 
and over 
see heightened risk and uncertainty for domestic oems 
the nev market until challenges are overcome although are 
bullish the potential for evs transform the auto industry and for 
china become one the leaders nev development see the 
hurdles highlighted above risk for oems such anticipate 
that nev penetration will increase only but will 
then scale rapidly forecast annual sales 
continue rise albeit slower cagr over versus 
cagr over but pick rapidly thereafter 
the same time anticipate that the sales growth plug 
hybrid electric vehicles phevs will decline over the same period 
three key hurdles could inhibit china leadership the devel 
the back less favorable nev policy and reduced demand due 
opment nevs and place pressure oem margins the short 
higher tco addition forecast that the reduction and eventual 
medium term despite china significant growth and extended 
phaseout government subsidies coupled with slower than 
leadership the development nevs overall penetration 
pected decline battery costs and improvements technology 
remains low reach tipping point sales see three hurdles 
will push back tco parity for bevs two years from 
that china needs overcome 
these challenges will not only inhibit demand and china leadership 
nevs our view but also place pressure the margins auto 
inadequate charging infrastructure the accessibility and 
makers potentially forcing industry consolidation 
adequacy charging infrastructure stands fundamental 
concern for existing and potential nev consumers without 
see imminent opportunities for auto parts suppliers profit 
bevs are effectively useless means transport 
from content changes models move bevs huayu minth 
reduction government subsidies subsidies have helped 
and nexteer are our top picks among greater china auto parts 
consumers bridge the acquisition cost differential for their 
greater china auto parts makers have been distant laggards core 
bev purchases thus far however with subsidies being 
ice technology and the reshuffle the supply chain evs take off 
phased out see the total cost ownership tco gap 
could give the greater china supply chain opportunity catch 
between ices and nevs widening thus reducing demand 
while margin risk likely climb amid the industry slowdown 
technology and battery costs electric battery powertrain 
see good strategic value from selected auto parts names given locali 
costs remain heavily dependent the cost the battery 
zation spec upgrades china and increasing exposure the rapid 
although battery costs have fallen significantly recent

evs the rise new charging behavior 
believe the differences between charging electric cars and refueling gasoline cars has resulted new type charging 
behavior making increasingly difficult persuade consumers jump the bandwagon 
see two key reasons behind the development this behavior 
time money with traditional ice vehicles refueling simple and straightforward process petrol stations are spread out 
conveniently across the nation and refueling only takes minutes yet for bevs depending battery size and station charging 
speeds charging times can range from minutes hours for instance baic popular series has average charging time 
minutes yet topped the charts sales volume among the top five best selling bev models only one 
model saic roewe offers fast charge option minutes 
out battery again common consumer complaint that current bev models lack the driving range that gasoline cars 
provide this reduced range translates higher required charging frequency regions where drivers have ample 
opportunities recharge home work this less problem yet china where passenger vehicle driving distances 
average per day and nev driving ranges average this more issue noted our global auto team the fact 
remains that few bevs with commercial range have been launched such the financial viability charging infrastructure 
remains critical 
such changes consumer behavior ultimately affect consumer demand for nevs although tesla stands successful case 
demonstrating that consumer preferences for ice can overcome believe that the discrepancy between feasibility and 
social acceptance requires mind shift that arguably has yet arrive china although monthly sales nevs are 
accelerating what cannot forgotten that penetration the overall light vehicle market remains low around 
compared norway where one four cars sold was electric china still has much room for improvement
