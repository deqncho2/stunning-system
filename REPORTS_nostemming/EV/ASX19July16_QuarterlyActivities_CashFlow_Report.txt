the olaroz lithium facility orocobre flagship project located the jujuy province argentina 
together with partners toyota tsusho corporation ttc and jujuy energia mineria sociedad del 
estado jemse orocobre now operating the first large scale lithium brine plant commissioned 
approximately years 
the olaroz lithium facility joint venture operated through argentine subsidiary sales jujuy sdj 
the effective equity interests are orocobre ttc and jemse 
production update and guidance 
during the june quarter tonnes lithium carbonate was produced this increase 
tonnes over the previous quarter and line with forecast production forecast 
between and tonnes 
the focus continues improvements operating practice plant optimisation and process 
control with the operation achieving good performance the primary circuit the focus has been the 
purification circuit following various minor modifications the circuit now operating with improved 
control and increased residence times reactors and good temperature profiles through all parts 
the circuit addition changes carbon dioxide injection points and diffusor design modification have 
resulted the elimination process material and the achievement more stable operating 
conditions throughout the circuit 
with these changes made the circuit has capacity approximately tonnes per day purified 
product however production above this level currently limited thickener residence time post the 
purified product crystallisers the thickener the final step the purification circuit prior product 
entering the drying circuit throughput will increased coming months adding cyclone bank 
augment the thickener capacity thereby allowing nameplate production rate achieved 
november delay two months 
positive operating cash flow was achieved and this continued

sales orders 
commercial shipments lithium carbonate continue dispatched from the olaroz lithium facility 
europe asia and the usa normal production sold either battery technical industrial grade 
products and sold into the chemical manufacturing industrial and battery application sectors 
process material recovered from within tanks the purification circuit has previously been sold 
plants china for further processing minor modifications the purification circuit have now reduced 
this process inventory zero and improved the availability the circuit commercial dispatches 
high purity product battery market customers continued during the quarter and additional customers 
will supplied 
many back orders were filled during the quarter with approximately volume and orders supplied 
above the tonne price level the company maintains price guidance basis for 
tonne manage risk inventory lithium carbonate kept minimum and 
reasonable time allowance made from material production sales recognition during this period 
vessel must booked and official documentation including bill lading and commercial invoice 
must produced and subsequently transported the port addition container shipping schedules 
commonly drift which can extend the timeline

short term lithium market outlook 
the lithium market continued tighten during the june quarter with robust demand being met 
constrained supply 
sale prices for olaroz lithium facility product have been steadily increasing and are expected 
average over tonne strong market demand and supply side constraints are 
resulting continued upward pressure market prices for lithium carbonate customer demand 
excess production forecast the market likely out balance and heavily 
net agency fees international freight and insurance 
dependent upon new hard rock entrants delivering forecast for the company expects that 
supply discussions for and beyond with large strategic customers will begin september october 
customers with back orders from previous quarters were eager fulfil contracted volumes and set new 
contracts place for the september quarter price levels above per tonne fob 
which double recent historical levels tonne fob expected that prices will remain 
above tonne fob basis demand outpaces supply growth the second half 
and into 
all available forward indicators market demand remain positive including 
increasing government subsidisation for electric vehicle production and purchase china 
the usa and europe 
continued production buses china following the introduction government incentive 
program requiring large volumes lithium 
continued construction gigafactories with seven plants currently being built and expected 
growing consumer awareness and interest ev over the next two years new makes and 
models electric cars have been announced for release 
strong demand from other non battery applications including mobile phones laptops and 
tablets 
healthy demand from traditional end use markets 
the company short term outlook for continued tight market dynamic with new supply required 
meet growing demand not becoming available for some considerable time

construction and operation its portfolio lithium potash and boron projects and facilities the 
puna region northern argentina the company has built partnership with toyota tsusho 
corporation and jemse the first large scale greenfield brine based lithium project years the 
salar olaroz with planned production tonnes per annum low cost battery grade lithium 
carbonate 
the olaroz lithium facility has low environmental footprint because the following aspects the 
process 
the process designed have high processing recovery lithium with its low unit costs the 
process will result low cut off grades which will maximise resource recovery 
the process route designed with zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored 
permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds the end the project life the ponds 
will capped and returned similar profile following soil placement and planting original 
vegetation types 
brine extracted from wells with minimum impact freshwater resources outside the salar 
because the lithium sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are 
limited the salar itself this different from halite hosted deposits such salar atacama 
salar hombre muerto and salar rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface 
permeability and the drawdown cones can impact water resources around the salar affecting 
the local environment 
energy used concentrate the lithium the brine solar energy the carbon footprint lower 
than other processes 
the technology developed has very low maximum fresh water consumption which
