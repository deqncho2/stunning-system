production sales and operational update 
production and sales 
production for the quarter was tonnes the previous quarter operations continued impacted slow 
evaporation rates related winter weather conditions and the finalisation the pond rebalancing process previously 
disclosed since early september evaporation rates have increased significantly resulting increased brine 
concentration increased harvest pond inventory and increasing production rates feed brine concentration has risen 
this trend has continued into october discussed later the report 
sales revenue for the quarter was million total sales tonnes with average sales prices 
operating costs cost goods sold basis were tonne qoq due lower 
production levels and the impact higher soda ash unit costs reported june bad weather 
argentina resulted olaroz procuring alternative sources soda ash during june and july significantly higher than 
normal cost the soda ash costs resulted higher inventory unit costs being carried forward into july which combined 
with lower production months july and august resulted higher costs for the september quarter lower unit costs 
from higher production rates the month september are carried forward with inventory into october

operational update 
during the quarter the olaroz operations recorded the production cumulative tonnes lithium carbonate 
since operations commenced this milestone testament the operational team olaroz who have 
relentlessly pursued operational excellence developing the first new brine operation years these development 
and operating skills provide going competitive advantage for orocobre the multi phase development 
olaroz 
over the september quarter the focus has remained pond management both from the perspective inter pond 
brine transfer and operational controls and monitoring the design and upgrade for the improved transfer and 
pumping system required the installation six new pumps remote monitoring systems and additional water cleaning 
lines for revised capital cost this program mostly complete and the final two pumps are expected 
installed the first weeks november time for increased evaporation rates which will necessitate increased 
inter pond brine transfers 
noted february the process establishing the correct inventory profile volume and concentration would 
take approximately six months this now complete and concentrations across the entire pond system are now 
approaching steady state conditions with increasing brine concentration the production rate and recovery have risen 
and reagent consumption rate has decreased production during october track deliver the budget 
tonnes for the month the same produced july and august combined the last seven days production has 
averaged tonnes per day design and record production expected for the december quarter the 
company reiterates guidance for the full year tonnes with production split approximately between the 
first and second halves the financial year 
the chart below shows the seasonality average evaporation rates and the historical and forecast harvest pond 
inventory profile the harvest pond inventory continues increase generally line with expectations and 
approaching maximum historical levels the deviation through october was due one harvest pond being taken out 
circuit for maintenance works recover brine storage capacity which had been reduced the secondary liming 
process which occurs the brine feed that pond last week the pond was brought back into circuit and now 
being filled the primary and intermediate ponds are showing very good correlation modelling the company 
encouraged that the measured data across the pond system much predicted from the pond evaporation and 
production model 
bathymetric surveys are complete and data being analysed the company does not expect any significant changes 
inventory levels production guidance from this work such brine inventory levels will reported half and full 
year results 
prior pond management issues and constraint feedstock the purification circuit has achieved maximum 
throughput rate tonnes per day tpd and run consistently tpd nameplate hydrocyclones 
have been installed and are operational these are expected allow the purification circuit achieve nameplate 
capacity approximately tonnes per day over the coming months 
the primary circuit runs consistently above nameplate capacity with maximum achieved throughput tpd some 
above design rate tpd 
carbon dioxide recovery 
carbon dioxide used the olaroz lithium facility the production battery grade lithium carbonate currently 
sourced from near buenos aires cordoba and mendoza and transported kilometres truck 
consequently significant component reagent costs and the company installing recovery systems 
various parts the purification circuit recover from the production process 
results from engineering studies and trial plant over the last year have demonstrated that recovery 
total possible and orders have now been placed for provision and installation permanent equipment capital 
expenditure this project expected less than the plant supplied package specialist

third party review pond design 
review the olaroz pond system team experts from the chilean office multinational engineering group 
ghd pty ltd who collectively have more than years pond design and management experience has been 
completed the review concluded that there were design faults that would prevent overall plant production 
tonnes per year since february the company has spent million the addition pumps and 
monitoring systems and considers this work now effectively complete and has achieved the aim adding robustness

market and sales 
total volume lithium carbonate sold the september quarter was tonnes lithium carbonate prices increased 
tonne fob for the quarter the price achieved for the quarter result higher pricing short 
term contracts compared last quarter 
since operations commenced olaroz has developed strong customer base customers who have tested and 
accepted the high grade purified and prime products the purified product regularly tests lithium carbonate 
and sold battery and cathode end users the prime product regularly tests lithium carbonate and sold 
variety technical and industrial end users neither these products require any additional processing for their 
respective markets and uses 
lithium market 
analysis orocobre determined that demand for lithium continued grow rate which supply struggled meet 
leading into the quarter existing brine producers including sqm albemarle and fmc confirmed ambitious expansions 
amounting approximately lce additional supply however significant new supply from the majors 
thought have entered the market during the quarter resulting sustained market tightness 
australian hard rock projects continued steadily ramp following what chinese import data showed was slow 
start the year supply spodumene concentrate from marion cattlin was quickly absorbed chinese 
conversion plants which otherwise rely scarce domestic production and imported lithium carbonate key 
downstream processors are slowly moving meet growing market demand with expansions announced tianqi 
ganfeng albemarle yahua ruifu general lithium however while those expansions would double the current 
installed conversion capacity will require over capital company announcements asian metals security 
supply remains concern with number capital guarantees and offtake agreements proposed finance projects 
the shift toward partnerships between raw material suppliers and compounders processors that occurred 
appears have stretched further downstream with battery and car manufacturers eager secure future raw material 
supply needed meet electric vehicle targets seems likely that this form disintermediation will continue with 
volvo volkswagen jaguar land rover and bmw all announcing plans have completely electrified vehicle fleets 
the future 
car manufacturers have been encouraged accelerate expansion plans with growing awareness future raw 
material supply bottlenecks and the continued implementation regulation requiring the switch electric vehicles 
china continues develop new policy with the recent proposition point system july similar that employed 
california which penalizes internal combustion drivers and subsidises manufacturers and owners industrial 
minerals the european union has also announced plans form consortium that seeks address the lack 
battery cell manufacturing capacity which may impact the speed new ev can come market currently cell 
manufacturing dominated japanese firms like panasonic and nec korea and samsung and china byd and 
catl 
new and varied forms collaboration between government and industry provides greater certainty that short and 
long term demand for lithium can only grow and push penetration rates over the 
company expectation that any new lithium supply enter the market during this time will quickly absorbed 
keeping prices above per tonne fob the short term 
assumes capital intensity tianqi kwinana plant for lce conversion plant 
lithium hydroxide plant 
update progress 
olaroz industrial grade lithium carbonate and locally sourced japanese lime have been used feedstock for testing 
process design produce lithium hydroxide two specialised engineering firms the test work demonstrated that 
very high quality lithium hydroxide could produced from olaroz lithium carbonate using customised process the 
test work has also highlighted opportunities reduce lithium losses during conversion from carbonate hydroxide 
contract negotiations are continuing with the two engineering firms determine the preferred contractor the 
selection criteria for choice engineering contractor includes turn key commissioning and personnel training with 
process product quality and performance guarantees 
capital and operating costs have been supplied one the engineering firms during the september quarter 
information from the second firm expected november 
discussions with ttc are well advanced determine the optimal joint venture structure for ownership and operation 
the hydroxide facility 
submissions have been made september japanese national and provincial governments for development permits 
and subsidies for capital costs and results from the submission are expected the end november successful the 
subsidy support could amount total capital costs for construction lithium hydroxide plant 
subject joint venture approvals and finalisation financing and permitting construction likely commence 
june quarter with commissioning months later orocobre does not anticipate the need raise equity capital 
for this project 
olaroz lithium facility 
expansion study for olaroz 
the phase expansion investment decision remains dependent achieving phase design production rates and the 
expansion being funded without further equity capital funded project finance and phase operating cashflow 
sustainable production rates are expected achieved during the current summer period southern hemisphere 
and construction therefore likely commence the first half 
revised scope phase expansion studies 
december orocobre announced the results scoping studies into the expansion olaroz and the 
proposed doubling production cost million including million contingency subsequently these 
plans have been simplified remove the purification circuit from the incremental production the resultant product 
mix tonne per annum battery grade lithium carbonate from the existing purification circuit and 
tonne per annum industrial grade lithium carbonate avg which will provide feedstock for the planned 
lithium hydroxide plant japan 
this simplified strategy results lower capital expenditure approximately million including million 
contingency and lower implementation risk the project based around simple duplication bores ponds and 
primary circuit phase olaroz the full cost the pond system contained within the total capital expenditure 
estimate for phase million 
multinational engineering firm ghd has been appointed oversee engineering design studies for the olaroz phase 
expansion 
key permits have been received for water extraction additional bores and new ponds from the jujuy provincial 
government for the expansion 
plant layout and pond design being finalised and soil tests have been completed over the new pond area 
flowsheets mass balance equipment list and design criteria have also been completed six layout options for the 
plant and three options for the liming plant are currently being considered and the preliminary design for the 
road pump stations piping and electricity lines new extraction bore holes were completed
