with battery cathode technologies power chips are our view the most important 
components electric car 
exhibit silicon carbide game changer for the and hybrid car industry 
source morgan stanley research estimates 
what the technology the future today the majority electric cars use silicon 
chips called igbts which currently the most powerful transistor architecture 
silicon following discussions with industry specialists such stmicroelectronics 
rohm and infineon and attending the sia powertrain the future conference paris 
chaired jochen langheim stmicroelectronics the april well 
stmicroelectronics smart driving presentation its analyst day london the 
may believe that transistors constructed silicon carbide sic are likely take 
share the coming years car manufacturers exploit the benefit more 
mileage from the same battery pack and less charging time with less weight 
smaller form factor and reduced need for heat dissipation device particular 
need for water pump and water cooling hence heading towards simplification the 
car architecture note that the improvement mileage variable and depends 
the driving conditions car drives long distance constant speed the increase 
mileage will less than and could lower than car used town with 
lots stop and goes and changes speed the improvement mileage will more 
significant than the increased efficiency should even better when the sic chips 
can integrated into the motor according infineon that said silicon carbide comes 
with some teething issues terms reliability which believe are solvable and 
infineon has already offered path very good reliability burn chips before they 
leave the factory 
implication for car oems sic proves efficient chip manufacturers claim car 
oems will likely offer the technology their customers either augment the range 
the car for the same price offer the same range for lower price and morgan 
stanley global autos team has calculated that based the assumption 
better efficiency the cost the overall car could reduced stmicroelectronics 
assumed price reduction its analyst day which broadly line with our 
calculations 
how many power chips are needed electric car and full hybrid cars through 
discussions with industry specialists and analyses electric car design have 
identified two different architectures build car especially the level the 
inverter which impact the number power chips 
have identified that tesla uses boards with discrete power chips the inverter 
level with igbt chips them just igbts for the last stage inverter and with 
the other stages requiring total power chips for the car powertrain some 
versions tesla use more than hundred igbts like the four wheel drive version 
according infineon tesla does not use modules but larger number igbt chips 
simple circuit board 
following discussions with industry specialists have found that other cars use 
power module that more optimised terms heat dissipation but takes more time 
develop result non tesla cars require fewer chips sometimes without 
encapsulation packaging called dies about for the most cost optimised cars with 
some versions using dies for the main inverter alone but with more money 
spent the module compared tesla models for most cars today according 
rohm there are igbts for every phase motors and electric motors for the 
higher end versions this range with pricing being key element for the 
penetration cars believe that while there will wide range architecture 
for the powertrain and full hybrid cars the most optimised solutions with lower 
number higher end chips could prevail that what have used our bottom 
model instead modeling per car type 
pricing igbts silicon carbide have found through discussion with industry 
specialists and searching for chips through distributors and oems that the high voltage 
igbt chips cost with their protection devices diodes while sic mosfet 
chip from stmicroelectronics costs each for quantity car oems could 
have access igbts lower price they specify lower end chips and buy very 
large quantity relative the cost the car and taking into account the reduced 
system cost sic and increased mileage decreased charging time would argue 
that with time sic could become dominant scenario but scenario igbts would 
remain the dominant technology with twice the size the sic market for cars 
term even beyond that said the speed adoption could vary and the market 
leader igbts infineon argues that market penetration for sic will slow first 
based the roadmap its own customers for the next five years starting with the car 
charger and them only moving the main converter linked the motors from 
however know that tesla has already started using sic and toyota working 
dual track roadmap for the next generation prius main inverter with igbts but also sic 
chips made house japan the competitive situation between silicon igbts and 
silicon carbide transistors remain fluid our view and car oems will decide for 
themselves like toyota with dual track strategy for the next prius and tesla already 
using silicon carbide 
pricing forecasts while there currently much exuberance around stocks related 
electric cars would argue that even analog chips tend down prices 
volume increases have found from the toyota presentation the sia paris 
powertrain conference that igbts and igbt modules used toyota and made its 
own factory have decreased price between the launch the third generation 
and the fourth generation models toyota also expects the same kind price decline 
for the fifth generation this represents cost reduction per annum much higher 
than investor and some semiconductor companies expected our view infineon for 
instance believes that adding more features the price power chips could stay flat 
have shown our forecasts how pricing could evolve with little pricing decline 
currently expected the majority investors and with price decline more line 
with historical price declines toyota oem has more incentive reduce cost and 
using the statistical model have used before for smartphone pricing see later 
paragraph our pricing assumption 
what matters most the incremental chip content and there range outcomes 
with some high end cars with super fast charging and super long range with 
incremental chip content internal combustion engine more than while 
other cars optimised for cost could have incremental semiconductor content 
hence the mix important and with cost sensitive customers believe chip 
architecture for cars optimised for costs could prevail volume ramps

selection chips and highlighted orange the price elasticity curves 
automotive mcus and infotainment chips the curves the three product categories 
are steep steep even steeper than chips used smartphones this implies that 
these two product categories are less price elastic than chips used any generic arm 
based logic chip put another way unit shipments not increase significantly with 
price cuts this contradicts the notion that price deflation benign autos semis there 
price negotiation with car parts makers either annually semi annually and 
depending supply and demand can lead different results 
another way look price deflation look the options list car oems typically new features are sold high end cars and end standard models about

what are power devices 
reducing power loss key global issue 
increasing energy efficiency issue that the entire globe must tackle order make 
efficient use finite fossil fuels and help prevent global warming caused 
emissions many discussions have been centered around expanding the use renewable 
energy such solar and wind that not generate however the case solar 
power the amount electricity generated varies greatly with the time day and the 
weather the amount electricity generated wind power the other hand varies 
greatly with the strength the wind and although nuclear power can provide stable 
supply electricity presents the risk major damage surrounding areas the 
event serious accident and the possibility opposition driven public opinion 
the wake serious accident like that seen fukushima unit japan 
order increase energy efficiency important not just diversify energy sources 
and expand the use renewable energy but also minimize power loss the process 
delivering the electricity produced generators over transmission equipment end 
users for example running electronic device that consumes power requires 
energy source equivalent exhibit lost when the power 
generated and lost transmission and the process conversions run 
power supply circuits power semiconductors are devices that help reduce this sort 
loss and increase energy efficiency 
exhibit energy are needed power electronic devices electricity lost the process power transmission 
source morgan stanley research based data from infineon 
the role power semiconductors 
power semiconductors are devices that control and convert electrical power they 
primarily convert electricity from from and from and 
serve switches that control power efficiently changing its voltage while end users 
have little opportunity sense their performance unlike processors and memory 
these devices work behind the scenes improve energy efficiency 
when making analogies for electronic devices the human body mpus and memory 
can viewed the brain processing and memorizing information sensors are the eyes 
and ears providing the five senses motors actuators and mems are the hands and the 
feet and solar cells are the digestive organs turning food into energy this vein power 
semiconductors then are the blood vessels and nerves that supply energy the 
hands feet and

the key applications are follows 
industrial electric power consumption motors accounts for global 
electric power consumption power semiconductors are used control the speed 
factory pumps and fans belt conveyors and industrial equipment that use induction 
motors 
automotive boost and buck circuits are needed for both the high voltage the 
running systems that supply power from the power supply system battery the 
motor and the low voltage for other electrical systems electric and hydrogen vehicles 
power semiconductors are used these battery boost and buck circuits 
home appliances power consumption can cut substantially using power 
semiconductors for inverter designs within appliances among emerging economies 
there remain countries where ratio air conditioners with inverter design still low 
data centers demand for data centers grows keeping power consumption and cost 
down are key issues demand for power semiconductors servers and air conditioning 
equipment expected grow 
data centers and the like are also equipped with uninterruptable power supplies ups 
supply stored power equipment when the connected commercial power supply 
goes down that equipment does not suffer momentary voltage drops power 
outages power semiconductors for upss such thyristors and igbts play important 
roles here 
types power semiconductor 
the ideal power semiconductor serves perfectly switch other words has 
zero electrical resistance when has infinite resistance when off and switches 
instantly between and off producing power loss and generating heat 
however today technology has not reached this point switches not yet react 
immediately have slight lags response time and their resistance not perfectly zero 
when 
the ideal switching operation switches large amounts electric power instantly 
however reality difficult achieve both instantaneous and large amounts for 
this reason variety power semiconductors are used depending the application 
and the operating characteristics sought the primary power semiconductors used 
switches are mosfets and igbts 
mosfets can handle several kilowatts while igbts can handle several 
megawatts 
mosfets metal oxide silicon field effect transistors boast high response speed but 
have low withstand voltages measure the voltages they can endure due 
structural constraints higher speeds mosfets are used low power applications 
such smart phones and power supplies 
igbts insulated gate bipolar transistors igbts have lower response speed but high 
withstand voltages and their power loss when with high current flowing low 
because these characteristics they are used home appliances autos industrial 
equipment and the like 
nevertheless power semiconductors that use conventional silicon substrates are 
approaching their theoretical limits performance which are determined the 
physical properties silicon and are unlikely see dramatic improvements

what are sic power semiconductors 
sic silicon carbide and gan gallium nitride have smaller crystal lattice constants and 
large band gaps compared with silicon and are thus called wide gap semiconductors

features power devices that use sic substrate are shown below 
lower power loss sic has about times the insulation breakdown field strength 
meaning its drift layer key source electrical resistance about one tenth thick 
which greatly lowers resistance values and enables large reductions power loss this 
greatly reduces power device conduction loss and switching loss 
high temperature switching operation sic not only reduces power loss with its high 
insulation breakdown field strength also facilitates higher withstand voltages 
allowing the use schottky barrier diodes sbds unlike sbds are diodes that use 
the schottky barrier created the connection metal semiconductor compared 
with junction diodes they not have charge carriers and can switch faster 
high temperature operation conventionally temperature rises electrons migrate 
the conduction band leakage current increases and devices sometimes stop functioning 
normally sic has band gap about three times wider than the increase leakage 
current small even high temperatures enabling high temperature operation 
high heat dissipation effect sic has three times the thermal conductivity 
improving heat dissipation 
expected applications for sic power semiconductors 
with its superior physical properties sic based power devices are expected for the 
following applications 
autos use sic power devices onboard chargers well progressing onboard 
chargers are component that only necessary when phv charging auto oems 
are working hard make them smaller and lighter they try boost fuel efficiency 
changing the power semiconductors used inverters for the main motor 
hydrogen and electric vehicles the future from sic inverter efficiency will 
improved noise will reduced size shrink and light weight will achieved and space 
will saved

smaller footprint terms heat dissipation devices around the chip european power 
conditioning system pcs manufacturers lead the adoption sic sbds and sicmosfets which they use boost converters inverters they enable higher conversion

why sic adoption has been slow 
most research institutions forecasted years ago that the sic power semiconductors 
market would reach scale above however this point has become 
common view that the market will less than the following are 
possible reasons why sic adoption has been far slower than previously forecasted 
slow shift full mass production for sic wafer leaders such cree and rohm 
sicrystal are currently mass producing sic sbds and sic mosfets mainly 
wafers sic mosfet mass production wafers ramps earnest around cost reduction and speedy expansion will likely happen after 
the history semiconductors proves that the most important factor for the adoption 
semiconductor devices not performance but cost long mass production 
performance does not improve sic based devices will unable become the 
mainstream power semiconductors 
lags solution sic technical issues sic chip performance improving but issues 
remain terms highly heat resistant materials for modules sealants bonding 
materials internal inductance etc noise vibration reliability and elsewhere 
mosfet cost being reduced and performance being improved infineon has started 
mass production mosfets super junction mosfets wafers and further 
cost reduction expected many believe that for the spread sic mosfet pick 
speed its cost differential with has double better further cost reductions 
sic are needed 
heat resistant performance igbt modules improving for inverters achieve 
the desired compactness and lower cost igbt modules need higher power density than 
the past which means operating temperatures must rise technological improvements 
have increased igbt performance heat resistance 
sic device applications are limited inquiries the area industrial machinery are 
constrained special power supplies and the like although sic devices have begun 
adopted the automotive arena onboard chargers their deployment main 
inverters generally expected happen sooner than 
factors that should accelerate the adoption sic

view from autos sic could material support battery 
penetration 
victoria greer harald hendrikse european autos 
sic could reduce component costs car bringing total 
cost ownership below internal combustion engine cars 
supporting our battery penetration forecasts 
broadly the feedback get from european autos companies sic that its 
efficiency clear positive but costs remain very high here show that sic 
could mean material cost reductions evs offering oems the ability increase 
range achieve the same range lower cost expect oems both 
offering range battery capacities different price points across the same 
model engine variants are priced today and tesla already does for battery 
evs 
component costs petrol car today are around depending battery 
capacity and cost assumptions this rises for battery without sic 
battery kwh relatively bullish assumptions all else equal using 
sic reduce battery capacity but maintaining the same range could see 
cost car fall assuming the same system cost estimate that battery 
evs reach total cost ownership parity with ice cars around sticker price 
premium with sic mile range could come lower monthly 
payment cost than petrol diesel car 
trade off between increased range and reduced cost 
range miles today going today the newest evs are 
achieving fully electric ranges around miles using the epa standard 
which tougher than the european nedc certified ranges the chevy bolt epa 
certified miles range the tesla model expected have least miles the 
next generation nissan leaf due expected step range miles from 
the range miles the larger battery option both estimates are from 
cleantechnica information remains closely guarded new launches particularly 
what ranges can achieved under the epa certification regime but targets for the 
porsche mission audi tron quattro and the mercedes suv are all around 
miles almost 
range has been the priority but think miles will sufficient 
thus far new launches have mostly seen improved energy density deployed 
increased battery capacities higher kwh order achieve longer ranges range per 
kwh has not really improved but the physical size and cost per kwh has come down 
hard gauge exactly where the tipping point would consumer acceptance but 
think that miles major step from current levels over time certainly 
see potential for some much longer range evs the market but also believe that oems 
will seek offer range battery capacities not least support pricing for variants 
with larger batteries tesla already prices its models this way think that oems 
could use the efficiency improvements that sic brings increase range some cases 
and reduce cost others charging times are also key making smaller batteries 
workable for consumers but for the launches charging times are already 
expected fall sharply and sic further development that could reduce charging 
time
