production sales and operational update 
production and sales 
production for the quarter was tonnes operations were impacted weather conditions slowing 
pond evaporation rates and preventing delivery soda ash key reagent the production process 
which resulted the cessation operations for three days 
for total production tonnes 
sales revenue for the quarter was million total sales tonnes with average sales 
prices the cash cost sales was tonne qoq due 
lower production levels and higher soda ash consumption from lower brine concentrations costs are 
expected decrease brine concentration and production increases with accelerating evaporation 
rates through spring and summer

operational update 
operations during the quarter continued focus pond management both from the perspective 
inter pond brine transfer and operational controls and monitoring during the quarter the design for 
the improved pumping system was finalised resulting the program being increased six pumps 
remote monitoring systems and additional water cleaning lines the pumps for revised capital cost 
this program will undertaken two stages with the most important stage being 
completed october when evaporation rates increase conjunction with the need increase interpond brine transfers day day operational level additional management positions have been 
established including pond operations superintendent and process manager indicator improved 
pond management the increase area under evaporation which maximises evaporation efficiency

previously advised the half year results the process establishing the correct inventory profile 
volume and concentration would take approximately six months and expected completed 
august the six month duration due the pond system having significant inertia and the process 
occurring during the low evaporation time the year 
the chart below shows the seasonality average evaporation rates and the historical and forecast 
harvest pond inventory profile the inventory profile reaches the minimum level july prior rapid 
increase through september december driven the corresponding increase evaporation rates 
and movement inventory from earlier ponds the actual pond profile deviates slightly from that 
predicted due the recent cloudy and snowy weather conditions previously reported can also 
seen that the level deviation harvest pond inventory relatively insignificant compared the 
increase that modelled occur throughout the rest the calendar year the relative performance 
similar primary and intermediate ponds and the company encouraged that the measured data 
overall correlating well with predicted performance from the pond evaporation and production 
model 
one the key findings the review pond operating practices has been that production reliability 
and resistance adverse weather conditions will improved through maintaining higher level 
inventory the harvest ponds such the future lowest point inventory will significantly higher 
than that experienced this past year and result higher concentrations the plant throughout the 
cycle 
enable production modelling and forecasting orocobre commenced process bathymetric surveys 
april however strong winds severely slowed the process flat surface conditions are needed 
for the surveys the work has been suspended until october when wind conditions are normally more 
favourable provide alternative source data the focus has changed more direct 
measurement and surveys drained areas this work has highlighted that some further testing salt 
density required prior finalising the production model and issuing formal production guidance 
which now expected august 
prior the pond issue the purification circuit has achieved maximum throughput rate tonnes 
per day tpd and runs consistently tpd nameplate recently fitted hydrocyclones 
are expected allow the purification circuit achieve nameplate capacity approximately tonnes

contract prices for lithium carbonate remain above after doubling market growth 
rates have lifted from over and are expected reach over the key 
driver for demand growth has also shifted the adoption lithium ion battery personal electronics 
such laptops tablets and phones which drove the first demand surge has reached the mature phase

these robust demand dynamics have compounded concern regarding significant lithium carbonate 
supply shortage given the current market tightness slower than expected project ramp ups have 
moderated supply expectations the industry has become aware the challenges involved ramping 
lithium projects given scarce industry experience and highly technical bespoke operations with 
unique and sometimes unpredictable challenges the risks involved raw material operations 
processing supply security and financing become more apparent strategic partnerships have become 
necessity vertical integration and strong partnerships are particularly important for hard rock 
operations given the additional capital required for spodumene mining processing and conversion 
well the broad technical skills required produce lithium carbonate hydroxide 
the recent funding arrangements hard rock projects demonstrates that funding new lithium 
production remains challenging high cost and impediment new production 
given growth not expected slow the foreseeable future vertical integration likely continue 
there significant potential for greater involvement and investment lithium projects from 
downstream participants including battery and manufacturers however widespread understanding 
capital intensity project ramp challenges and supply chain lead times from lithium production 
consumption end use segments required encourage the necessary investment 
lithium hydroxide plant 
update progress 
olaroz industrial grade lithium carbonate and locally sourced japanese lime have been used 
feedstock for testing process design produce lithium hydroxide two specialised engineering 
firms the test work demonstrated that very high quality lithium hydroxide could produced from 
olaroz lithium carbonate using customised process the test work has also highlighted opportunities 
reduce lithium losses during conversion from carbonate hydroxide 
lithium hydroxide currently sells significant premium compared lithium carbonate 
contract negotiations are continuing with the two firms determine the preferred contractor the 
selection criteria for choice engineering contractor includes turn key commissioning and personnel 
training with process product quality and performance guarantees 
capital and operating costs for the lithium hydroxide plant japan will advised the engineering 
firms during the september quarter 
subject joint venture approvals and finalisation financing and permitting construction could 
commence november with commissioning months later orocobre does not anticipate the 
need raise equity capital for this project 
expansion study for olaroz 
the phase expansion investment decision remains dependent achieving phase design production 
rates and the expansion being funded without further equity capital funded project finance and 
phase operating cashflow 
revised scope phase expansion studies 
december orocobre announced the results scoping studies into the expansion olaroz 
and the proposed doubling production cost million including million 
contingency subsequently these plans have been simplified remove the purification circuit from the 
incremental production the resultant product mix tonne per annum battery grade lithium 
carbonate from the existing purification circuit and tonne per annum industrial grade 
lithium carbonate avg which will provide feedstock for the planned lithium hydroxide plant 
japan 
this simplified strategy results lower capital expenditure approximately million including 
million contingency and lower implementation risk the project based around simple 
duplication bores ponds and primary circuit phase olaroz the full cost the pond system 
contained within the total capital expenditure estimate for phase million 
ghd has been appointed oversee engineering design studies for the olaroz phase expansion 
arrangements were terminated with ausenco after they withdrew services from south america 
following corporate restructure significant delays are expected with this change however progress 
against schedule being actively monitored 
the process obtain necessary permits and approvals for phase continues run concurrently with 
engineering design and selection mechanical equipment such centrifuges filters and reactors 
test work continuing allow further optimisation design and process beyond that already 
identified from commissioning and operation phase 
the expansion studies are not managed the sdj operating team but consultants and dedicated

market conditions 
market conditions remain difficult the core south american markets argentina and brazil borax 
argentina continues grow strong long term relationships with key customers while expanding the 
customer base the continued focus production efficiencies required cushion the effect 
market pricing remaining the bottom the price cycle 
prices all borate products remain under pressure particular boric acid pricing continues decline 
shown below 
addition price pressure the operations are seeing inflation costs which exceeding devaluation 
the peso has seen inflation while the peso has only devalued 
the combination low prices inflationary costs and difficult operating conditions have resulted 
disappointing financial performance borax argentina

tsusho corporation and jemse the first large scale greenfield brine based lithium project 
approximately years the salar olaroz with planned production tonnes per annum 
low cost lithium carbonate 
the olaroz lithium facility has low environmental footprint because the following aspects the 
process 
the process designed have high processing recovery lithium with its low unit costs the 
process will result low cut off grades which will maximise resource recovery 
the process route designed with zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored 
permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds the end the project life the ponds 
will capped and returned similar profile following soil placement and planting original 
vegetation types 
brine extracted from wells with minimum impact freshwater resources outside the salar 
because the lithium sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are 
limited the salar itself this different from halite hosted deposits such salar atacama 
salar hombre muerto and salar rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface 
permeability and the drawdown cones can impact water resources around the salar affecting 
the local environment 
energy used concentrate the lithium the brine solar energy the carbon footprint lower 
than other processes
