risk skew the street earnings estimates from more fundamental factors like lower 
anticipated average selling prices retail prices pool prices and large scale generation 
certificates competition for customers and higher depreciation charges 
our org rating relative call and rests fcf expansion and deleveraging 
unrelated energy markets developments see dividend resumption and 
delivery efficiency gains guided the key catalysts see incremental 
downside risk our org energy markets divisional earnings which not incorporate 
potential out cycle price cuts this time 
what the prices far this year agl down and org down the 
down over the same period terms agl has derated and 
org far this year and both stocks are below long term averages and 
below our bear case scenario values historical correlations with fundamental 
commodity variables have also broken down exhibit and exhibit elevated policy

vdo black green grid carc 
view the federal government proposed conceptually equivalent the 
victorian vdo both cases 
implementation the schemes not yet confirmed the vdo would embodied 
victorian legislation the passage which contingent the election the 
victorian government with sufficient majority november the current 
proposal relies changes the national energy consumer framework 
and the national electricity law which relies agreement the state 
governments queensland nsw and south australia the federal government 
has flagged the potential for other legislative pathways agl and org have said 
they remain unsure the exact legal mechanism involved 
the will effectively cap retail prices our view implemented the will 
replace the current standing offers the generally available retail prices which 
usually form the base for discounts within market offer 
independent regulator would set the tariffs implemented the essential 
services commission victoria escvic would set the vdo and the australian 
energy regulator aer would set the the other mainland nem states 
tariffs would set reference reasonable cost stack think 
implemented anticipate that the regulators would publish methodology for 
consultation but with limited avenues appeal for networks think the 
tariff methodology will likely reflect estimate the reasonable costs 
theoretical energy retailer including allowance for the costs wholesale energy 
black environmental compliance schemes green network charges grid and 
marketing activities known customer acquisition and retention costs carc 
the initial level the the key investor debate our view set too high the 
policy objective lowering bills for households would not met set too low then 
incentives for competition and investment would dampened which might play the 
advantage large incumbents agl and org but against the longer term interests 
consumers the affordability objective and ability the exhibit survive 
earnings margin compression suggest that regulators might initially err the side 
lower 
our proprietary alphawise retail electricity data series provides investors with 
granular view the starting points for average standing offers and market offers 
should retail markets transition policy setting 
other policies 
our view the stock impact the other policy announcements made last week 
either 
incorporated within our rough scenario estimates the impact banning 
unreasonable pay time discounts also known late payment fees 
low the reliability guarantee which the coag energy council may revisit 
december coag energy council press release october 
longer term underwriting new dispatchable generation under four year 
scheme designed with stakeholder input federal government press release

many the policies are likely positive for consumer confidence the industry and 
agl and org have supported them reference bills allow comparability 
discounts that consumers are less likely misled
