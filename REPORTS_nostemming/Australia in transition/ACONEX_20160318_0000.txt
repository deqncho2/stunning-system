what changes 
see two key changes addressed out the transaction announced today namely 
the financial implications 
meaningful synergies management which has track record conservatism was willing factor 
meaningful synergies into near term forecasts terms conject sales growth profile and especially the rapid 
margin expansion clearly there are material sales marketing support and overhead synergies but ebitda 
margin moving three years took surprise 
forecast low double digit eps accretion the company forecast high teens though these calculations 
are very sensitive given acx low absolute dollar earnings base highlight the changes make our

the strategic impact 
familiar game plan one the key takeaways from the call was how management stressed the similarity 
between conject and acx terms 
product functionality and business model 
pricing structure namely project value but with enterprise wide and project deals 
the proportion contracted revenue budget very similar for conject 
for acx 
clients and projects there significant overlap the type clients scales projects future 
pipeline and sales functions 
retention rates lvts and churn finally management indicated that the key drivers lifetime 
value such retention rates growth client activity and willingness adopt enterprise wide 
are similar acx existing business 
this means that acx should able completely sunset the existing conject products three years 
market leadership extended acx becomes the clear leader this market europe and adds significant 
scale its global business europe huge construction market including four the top construction 
markets globally its own right but european construction and development industry leaders represent 
even larger share the construction market europe also market with high labour costs which drives faster 
adoption workflow and collaboration solutions 
step change network scale our view remains that this winner takes most market that less than 
penetrated acx today took another big step forward towards long term global leadership conject was 
one very few competitors with meaningful scale there now one less competitor and larger gap the 
rest the field addition expect meaningful leverage overheads the near term see step change 
conject ebitda margins from and improved supplier terms further out expect improve 
beyond with acx current sits 
cross selling potential acx will have the ability sell its entire suite conject customers and pick the best 
parts conject offer enhance its own expect upselling will meaningful driver top line growth 
the coming years

valuation and scenario analysis 
base case valuation 
continue value acx using blended average 
valuation relative sales and discounted cash 
flow this takes into account short term multiple 
assessment the most relevant metric saas 
comps sales and the long term value opportunity

rce rgan stan ley research estimates 
blended valuation assumptions 
dcf was see our assumptions realistic but very conservative forecast more than 
fcf conversion npat over the forecast period given the attractive payment terms acx has with its 
customer base continue assume risk free rate market risk premium and beta our 
target gearing which see conservative given the capital light model and the strong fcf with 
cost debt our terminal growth rate which kicks well before maturity and well below the longterm construction industry growth rate 
relative was see acx having proven self reinforcing network effect driving 
long term sales growth large but immature construction saas market highlight acx track record 
taking dominant market share australia and replicating that success other markets globally compare 
acx other capital light small caps that have opportunities for international expansion and trade range 
apply multiple previously our estimate the company now profitable and 
has become increasingly relevant metric have increased our multiple the high end comps because 
see strong profit acceleration 
sales was given acx early stage maturity profile and heavy reinvestment sales and 
marketing well argue that the earnings leverage significant earnings multiples are highly 
variable when comparing acx with its closest vertical saas peers globally our view with industry penetration 
sales the key measurement competitive position and value providing businesses can funded 
ongoing basis 
our ascribed multiple which apply our estimate sales unchanged this implies that 
months time acx will trading line with its closest comps note that comps are predominantly 
december year end building additional element conservatism our assumption see scope for 
further rating over time
