sustainable tax reform 
australia transition score 
tax reform has rightly been the focus public debate and better alignment the tax structure 
policy objectives growth and fairness could provide meaningful boost economic activity while 
addressing the structural deficit think there has been bipartisan failure acknowledge the scale 
the problem and put place strategy for budget repair 
going forward hope see better alignment tax concessions policy objectives including 
changes negative gearing and other workplace deductions also see scope for shift tax burden 
away from income taxes which produce more negative economic distortions towards consumption and 
wealth taxes recent proposals modestly tax high balance income superannuation accounts 
positive are efforts address multinational tax avoidance 
why matters sovereign credibility 
outlook need accelerate reforms 
tax structures affect income consumption and 
investment patterns effective changes tax 
structure can boost growth while maintaining tax 
revenue and are ultimately more important 
discussion than traditional zero sum debate 
more versus less tax spending 
the coalition budget proposed modest 
small business tax cuts funded stronger taxavoidance measures and upper income tax cuts funded cuts top end superannuation tax 
concessions efforts were also made impose 
greater tax burden wealth with new 
retirement balance transfer cap limiting the taxfree asset base proposed for the superannuation 
system while more generous arrangements were 
slated for lower income balance transfers 
tax reform matters now more than ever given the 
structural and cyclical challenges faced 
economy transition well the need rein 
structural budget deficit over coming years 
while there seems broad public acceptance 
the need for change both major parties have 
struggled implement specific change

what think should happen 
simplify tax reduce distortions 
from income consumption tax 
believe that negative gearing housing 
full deductibility investment property costs 
against personal income tax increasingly out 
line with global best practice the interaction 
with the cgt discount see below has 
arguably seen over investment housing 
asset class between and nginvestment into established dwellings meaning 
has driven land values and household 
leverage for little productivity gain believe 
changes should not grandfathered but instead 
phased over years prevent pullforward lock effects 
key global study was conducted the oecd 
the impact tax structures growth with the 
results summarised exhibit they found that 
taxes with the largest negative distortions 
growth were income and corporate taxes having 
the effect reducing employment human capital 
productivity and foreign investment 
the cgt discount should also reduced 
which would reduce the tax distortion that 
penalises income producing asset classes like fixed 
interest lower cgt discount could meanstested alongside the income tax brackets although 
see merit retaining the existing discount 
for productivity boosting start 
investments 
work related deductions now amount around 
the concern whether the concession 
has close enough nexus income practice 
well the operational burden placed the tax 
system think moving towards standard 
deduction with tougher tests the income link 
would improve fairness and allow lower tax rates 
there have been initial steps addressing tax 
avoidance multinationals private businesses 
and hnw individuals such the ato tax 
avoidance taskforce and strengthened ato firb 
powers requesting compliance reports 
australia should continue one the leading 
proponents oecd reforms 
contrast taxes with fewest distortions were 
consumption taxes wealth taxes and cross border 
taxes consumption taxes when applied evenly 
across goods and services have relatively lower 
impact economic decision making pivot 
from income consumption tax could encourage 
the workplace more productive and 
rewarded commensurately 
however the regressive nature consumption 
taxes means should paired with income tax 
relief for the low middle income earners 
increasing property wealth taxes 
taxes fixed assets and wealth contrast 
taxes income have been identified the oecd 
study progressive source tax revenue with 
less economic distortion 
think greater focus wealth taxes while 
politically sensitive may lead better outcomes 
for the economy increasing effective property 
taxes presents opportunity this front 
finalise super tax treatment 
hold open and comprehensive review 
superannuation tax treatment that further 
changes are seen sustainable and final which 
would help restore confidence the system 
think progressivity could increased 
reducing the threshold which contributions tax 
lifts from line with bipartisan

demographic foundations 
australia transition score 
australia looks better placed than oecd peers deal with the challenge demography our view 
particular australia has developed sizeable immigration program that highly targeted and provides 
international students with pathways citizenship the private defined contribution superannuation and 
hybrid private public healthcare systems mitigate the fiscal pressures aging population and leave 
employers clear internalised welfare cost structures 
however think more should done manage the demographic changes policy generally 
based pre transition growth forecasts migration slowing and more emphasis needed job 
creation and the attraction skilled labour addition the generational bargain wealth transfer 
from younger older generations will need addressed more urgently tax concessions and user 
payments can better focused improve system efficiency and close avenues for aggressive tax 
minimisation although recent proposals are positive also think the family home should included 
pension assets test and line with global trends retirement and eligibility ages should increased 
australia transition may 
why matters budget and growth challenge 
outlook further super tax changes proposed 
demographics are crucial determinant longterm economic growth while ageing cannot 
avoided much can done facilitate the right 
quantity and structure migration that will 
support core population growth and soften the 
age dependency inflection 
the federal budget built progress made 
over the past decade tackling demographic 
challenges proposed cuts superannuation tax 
concessions for high income earners but 
incentives for low middle income accumulation 
improving public service delivery models has also 
been feature recent initiatives 
more importantly the tax and transfer system 
plays crucial role driving workforce education 
levels and participation especially outside 
prime age males the population ages will 
crucial maintain employment least the 
extent permitted technological change this 
dovetails with need reshape eligibility ages 
and wealth tests for social benefits including the 
aged pension 
other areas have received less attention recently 
but believe there need revisit pension 
and superannuation eligibility adopting some 
the financial system inquiry recommendations
