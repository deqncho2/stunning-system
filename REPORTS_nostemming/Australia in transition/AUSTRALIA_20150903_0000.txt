exports are picking with the lower aud but the external balance 
remains concerning 
slow real gdp for came below consensus qoq bringing 
year ended growth down surprise boost public spending that 
added gdp helped avoid the contraction had forecast but the 
real story these national accounts that the economy faces even longer 
transition phase than consensus has factored the terms trade are now 
down from the peak and expect them fall another our 
current commodity price profile export receipts are down yoy despite 
volume growth yoy and result the current account deficit has

transition away from the resources boom and towards more balanced growth 
the latest data showed average employee compensation rising only
