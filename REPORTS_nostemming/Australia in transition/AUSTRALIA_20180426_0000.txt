importantly believe this initiative has been largely conceptual for the

executive summary 
what the australia transition theme australia transition from 
economy overly reliant resources and credit fueled property cycles continues 
and more necessary than ever our view growth gdp and wages has 
slowed over the past year the level and growth household debt has become 
even more pressing issue for australian policymakers this overhang reduces the 
prospects for future growth and requires pivot for the economic growth model 
and corporate strategy 
nuf place australia transition our blue paper march 
australia transition ten winners from five structural themes identified five 
strategic themes that believed would influence both corporate strategy and 
operating performance these are global expansion new economic infrastructure 
new export economy technological disruption and demographics 
believe that these five themes should embedded into the investment 
process when assessing australia five year outlook and recently ranked 
our coverage that basis see australia transition scoring the opportunity 
set jan the report highlighted nuf increasing leverage the global 
expansion theme following two recent acquisitions the century portfolio and 
fmc europe florasulam the broader crop protection segment consolidating 
and believe nuf will continue have role play nuf also has potential 
leverage disruption through the omega project this report 
assess the omega opportunity earnings capacity and valuation 
our perspective the omega opportunity while nuf has discussed its opportunity for some time believe that the little associated value from 
investors evident the current share price our view this overly punitive 
but likely stems from lack company guidance market conviction around the 
project potential earnings capacity bridge this gap have assessed the 
project earnings capacity the project clearly retains risks and will take time 
achieve sustainable earnings however believe worth something now 
value the initiative per share with the project expected focus 
nuf may investor day expect this will start see omega reflected 
nuf share price key regulatory and commercial milestones over the next should increase conviction this opportunity 
our approach the omega opportunity have assessed the project 
earnings capacity years time which allows year ramp period 
achieve sustainable earnings assume nuf able achieve market 
share the global fish oil supply over this timeframe key variable our 
analysis our assumption equates share the anticipated fish oil supply 
deficit based demand growth importantly our assumptions allow 
for alternative competing projects key risk over the medium longer term 
this proprietary initiative ascribe ebit multiple forecast earnings 
capacity and assign probability the present value the initiative 
omega focus but continue see upside from the base business our 
view nuf has measurably improved its business over the past years and 
continue see path for further improvement and robust earnings growth over 
the forecast period via organic growth recent cost out and further 
incremental balance sheet efficiencies working capital management more 
specifically forecast significant growth ebit eps 
underpinned incremental contribution non recurrence one offs cost 
savings and relatively conservative underlying growth our view nuf 
transformation yet reflected nuf current valuation our base exomega valuation implies upside the current share price 
but see substantial upside from nuf omega initiative beyond 
fundamental valuation support the base business see significant scope for 
upside associated with nuf omega project conjunction with the csiro and
