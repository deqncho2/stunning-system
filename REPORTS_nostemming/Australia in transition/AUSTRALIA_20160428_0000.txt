changes delivery care and housing for the elderly discuss the significant increase the 
addressable market people aged over cagr from that will drive substantial increase 
demand over the next decade however believe funding constraints and the high cost operations will 
force residential aged care which heavily relies government funding increasingly 
focus end life care 
this opens opportunity for retirement fill the care gap people who require less than hour care 
increasing the penetration rate over there potential for further upside through the removal 
disincentives release capital the family home from exclusion the family home age pension means 
testing this has been recommended number government sponsored reviews and would lower 
government expenditure forecasts remove distortion how the elderly invest and improve the utilisation 
housing 
segmental view cautious aged care the near term prefer retirement are positive aged care 
over the long term becomes more hospital like focusing end life care but are turning cautious 
aged care the near term due two factors 
lower organic growth the gap the maximum aged care funding instrument acfi rate for the 
listed operators evaporating which limits organic growth our view furthermore expect 
the government limit acfi creep the top end signaled the mid year economic and fiscal 
outlook myefo changes with cost inflation largely fixed believe this will put pressure 
margin 
acquisition catalyst not positive our analysis and discussions with industry participants 
suggests acquisition pricing getting more expensive and return investment will lower 
from acquisitions this has been key avenue growth for the listed players significant 
increase interest the segment also evident the recent aged care approvals round 
acar round when applications doubled supply could issue bed licences are 
regulated 
will watch for changes the funding mechanism acquisition pricing and supply levels track these 
headwinds for aged care 
prefer retirement the near term not believe the market appreciates the opportunity for this 
segment integrate care offerings and potential upside should age specific housing encouraged directly 
indirectly policy changes increased average age increased resident turnover and delivery care services

aveo our top pick its exposure retirement and strategy offer continuum care positions the 
company benefit from changes the delivery care and housing for the elderly believe aog will 
outperform developments retirement and aged care are ramped care services are established and 
there margin expansion potential positive catalyst will come from increase the average age and 
increase resident turnover older sicker residents are attracted villages this will have the effect 
increasing the return asset base show our resident tenure sensitivity analysis exhibit 
there upside our which implies slight premium the peers 
which trade which premium the average trading multiple since july when the 
business announced the strategy transition pure retirement company there further upside over the 
longer term discuss this note how believe the company will valued when the market 
looking circa months time 
more defensive with strong thematic relative our coverage this stock attractive relative our 
emerging companies coverage universe even with circa upside believe more defensive with 
greater earnings certainty this because significant asset backing nta the portfolio has high 
portion middle ring suburbs villages within city center and there increasing focus 
care which making earnings less discretionary 
read through for llc and sgp the largest and third largest retirement operators respectively 
retirement makes small part these businesses sgp and llc group ebit and 
strategically fits into the residential land development which bigger focus for both these companies sgp 
looking increasing the care offering improve the retirement offering and returns this could positive 
catalyst believe the market does not put much focus this division implied but llc 
looking lower its direct exposure retirement and maintain smaller exposure able integrate this 
offering into larger mixed use urban developments which main focus due limited disclosure not 
separately value the retirement division for llc 
australia emerging companies april 
downgrade jhc and maintain for ehe 
downgrade jhc due the lower growth the back lower valuation well potential 
negative catalysts relating government funding also maintain rating ehe despite the recent 
share price underperformance prefer jhc over ehe which value lower multiples believe has 
better long term opportunity extract extra service revenue and generate returns from its development 
pipeline believe ehe higher debt balance acquisition related strategy and highest ebitda margin leave 
more exposed any unfavourable regulatory changes 
lower earnings and growth adjust our forecasts for both jhc and ehe reflect lower organic growth 
and potential margin impact exhibit 
lower valuation multiples lower our valuation multiples reflect the lower organic growth and our view 
that there less opportunity for accretive acquisitions now use average premium hospital operators 
and lower multiple medical services companies reference point for the base case 
lower our for jhc and for ehe 
why don remain positive this segment over the long term and our new forecasts take 
into account very little organic growth some way already reflect some downside from funding pressures 
and lack positive catalysts from acquisitions which key our cautious view 
negative regulation changes occur believe the share prices will underperform initially due the change 
market sentiment but believe the current share prices which imply multiples slightly above the high risk 
medical services companies our low growth estimates correctly account for the low growth funding risk and 
lack acquisition catalyst without ignoring the significant long term opportunity aged care that becoming 
even more nondiscretionary than currently the case 
why prefer aog versus jhc and ehe 
prefer aog over jhc and ehe believe this company will deliver strong growth transitions 
being pure retirement company with focus care there regulatory risk for aveo fully funded the 
resident compared japara and estia which receive circa revenue from the government have 
stronger growth forecast for aog with eps cagr from this front end loaded but the 
more important figure the retirement contribution cagr which shows significant growth the 
underlying business compared for jhc and for ehe furthermore expect deceleration 
growth for jhc and ehe from lower organic growth and less acquisition catalysts for aged care this justifies 
the rating for jhc and for ehe implied our price targets 
how compare consensus 
our ratings are not entirely different the average consensus but believe that our earnings and price 
targets imply stronger view than the average the market furthermore for jhc and ehe although the 
consensus shows fairly even distribution ratings from believe there are some very positive 
views the market from which our research this note differentiated our earnings see exhibit and price

older sicker people going aged care before the living longer living better lllb changes july 
aged care had two tier system low care and high care and the average age was lower and people tended 
stay longer the lllb changes encouraged operators offer high care returns are now more attractive 
with higher acfi fees and following the changes operators could collect accommodation bond rad refundable accommodation deposit from high care residents that they previously couldn the shift has

retirement has opportunity fill the low level care gap and provide solution some 
housing problems 
believe there potential for the penetration rate retirement over grow retirement fills the 
gap left aged care shifting end life care and asset rich but income poor elderly are encouraged 
release capital from the family home are confident this transition the next five years see 
significant benefits from such changes including lower government expenditure the age pension 
increase the supply housing and providing the elderly with more cost efficient way provide care the 
elderly 
filling the care gap aged care increasingly focused end life care gap created the offering 
lower levels care where elderly people require less than hour care but can longer live independently 
home care the obvious solution and funded two separate commonwealth programs and the 
government has clearly focused shifting this form care from residential aged care cheaper and 
line with the strong preference for older australians age place however home care alone will not solve 
the problem and believe retirement provides attractive solution for elderly people receive more cost 
effective low level care this could drive the retirement penetration rate 
within retirement village low level care home care equivalent services can provided significant 
scale thus lowering the costs staff can hand provide care services over the day and sporadically the 
case emergency expect serviced apartments within retirement villages take more the load 
healthcare services while independent living units will increasingly offer more hotel like services such food 
cleaning etc furthermore retirement living units are better set for frail elderly people with stairs and 
assistances 
will take time for this process play out retirement companies will need change their operations offer 
care and their perception place receive care rather than lifestyle choice aveo and retireaustralia the 
second and fourth largest operators are already executing this shift and believe will more difficult 
for smaller operators and property company operators although stockland looking for ways outsource 
these services make this shift providing competitive advantage for the early movers 
releasing capital from the family home retirement attractive option for elderly release capital 
from the family home that can utilised for care and other living expenses however government policy 
discourages this activity especially through the exclusion the family home age pensions means testing 
elderly person sells their family home and buys place retirement village discount the excess capital 
released will included means testing that could see this person lose some all their pension 
entitlements 
australia emerging companies april 
believe changes policy will major positive catalyst and number independent and government 
sponsored reviews including the henry tax review national commission audit grattan institute and centre 
for independent studies have recommended value cap for exemption this will not easy with the history 
the principal resident exemption dating back the early being rarely challenged and being 
ingrained part the retirement savings system but believe there chance the government will follow the 
recommendations recent reviews see three positive outcomes from testing the value the primary 
residence partially full 
this change would help lower expenditure the age pension which expected increase 
substantially with ageing population see exhibit including the value the 
principal residence means testing fewer people would eligible for the pension this 
would help manage the growth government expenditure the age pension which under 
the current rules will increase percentage gdp from 
the productivity commission has conducted illustrative analysis that shows that applying 
cap would have fairly modest effects overall eligibility for the age pension see exhibit 
but given the magnitude australian government expenditure the age pension even 
small changes could have noticeable fiscal effects exhibit based house prices 
when the median price was this has increased this analysis today 
would require higher dollar value hurdles achieve the same outcomes

there potential for other policies that would equally positive for the retirement segment and would not see 
reduction the number people entitled the pension these include the continued exemption capital 
released from the family home when moving age specific housing for example used buy annuity 
this kind policy has been discussed recent times and although doesn help lower age pension

segmental view positive retirement but cautious aged care the 
near term 
have positive view both segments over the long term and see potential for outperformance for exposed 
companies over the long term retirement with increasing focus care and increasing penetration rates will 
see improved returns and lower risk over time while aged care will still see strong uplift demand even 
penetration rates reduce and will significantly risked over time its services are increasingly hospital like 
positive retirement the near medium term 
retirement still largely regarded lifestyle choice and residential property play see substantial upside 
over the near medium term for retirement operators that focus care fill gap for people requiring less 
than hour care believe this along with incentives for elderly people release capital from the family 
home currently the family home excluded from wealth testing for the aged pension will result 
increased penetration rate persons aged over the near term 
assume that the penetration rate over increases over the next ten years this will see 
requirement for new places cagr the number places over this would still

furthermore see potential for reduction the variability demand for retirement the asset class 
transitions from being lifestyle choice affordable care offering significant increase the addressable

but cautious aged care the near term 
are positive aged care over the long term but see some major headwinds that have prompted 
become cautious the near term are now concerned that near term funding changes will impact the rate 
earnings growth and the acquisition catalyst less positive than before 
current funding not sustainable and changes may occur sooner than expected discuss above 
believe the current model funding not sustainable this not new and have always considered this 
medium term headwind but see this near term concern now due two factors 
exhibit listed operators acfi growth has 
been substantial but upside the maximum rate 
closing 
jhc 
ehe 
reg 
maximum potential acfi rate for each year 
firstly the listed operators have increased the acfi rate 
substantially and have had strategy acquiring 
facilities where they can quickly increase the rate 
substantially without changing care the idea that the 
corporatised operators are better reporting the level 
care they are providing believe this rate 
getting high point and the underlying acfi will 
moderate from here there little sustainable upside 
compared the maximum potential rate the average 
acfi rate only below the absolute 
maximum much smaller gap than historically has 
been the case see exhibit 
secondly the mid year economic review dec 
the government flagged its intention change 
the scoring matrix effectively make harder 
achieve the highest acfi rate and also increase auditing reduce the level over charging the government 
this shows focus reducing the funding per resident but budgeted spending still growing the expected 
number residents continues grow and while the details these funding cuts are yet released 
believe this will headwind the near term and the underlying inflation rate which has tended circa 
may lower for longer 
rce data dep artmen health site rgan 
stan ley research 
the combination these two factors should see the organic growth the established portfolio the low 
single digits and some cases where the acfi rate has been already fully optimised almost flat the same 
time see little opportunity for reductions operating costs staff make total costs industry data 
for and wages are generally indexed while there are few opportunities reduce staffing the 
contrary see that the acuity residents diminishes there may requirement increase staffing cost 
ratios and further cutting could met with increased risk around care levels the outcome potential 
reduction ebitda margins over time which have trended upwards mainly due reduction staff costs see

increasing activity the segment may reduce incremental returns the organic growth aged care 
fairly low and may come under pressure discussed above the listed operators deliver growth via acquisitions 
and developments but believe there has been clear increase competition for acquisitions and bed 
licences which could detrimental returns over the next years 
acquisitions acquisitions have been significant source 
growth see exhibit and more detail the 
earnings changes section and the opportunity for 
consolidation the segment which still highly 
fragmented has been one the key reasons have 
been positive 
exhibit annual percentage growth 
operating places from acquisitions

key catalyst that resulted improved returns was the 
lllb regulatory changes that were place from july 
allowing operators take rads from all residents 
and high low care bed designation was removed this 
allowed operators buy underperforming assets 
collect significant rad inflows residents turned over 
and attract residents who required more care thus 
taking higher fee 
lllb changes provided three year window 
fund acquisitions the average stay now years june almost all residents will have 
entered since the lllb changes and would have been charged rad daily accommodation payment dap 
this point valuation multiples will need decline there will less opportunity improve the earnings 
acquired operator likely that vendors will struggle accept valuations substantially lower than what 
has become the market norm this will make hard for the listed operators successfully execute acquisitions 
our view ehe has already put more focus developments its strategy 
from june the rad intake the existing portfolio the listed operators will also begin flat line which 
takes away key source funding for acquisition led growth show this our forecasts the net rad 
inflow reduces substantially from and the majority the rad inflow development related which 
effectively being used fund the development pipeline rather than acquisitions 
acquisition pricing inflating then there the current valuations being paid which believe are getting 
more expensive this high level analysis that difficult conduct more detail the specifics each 
portfolio make them difficult assess for example the profke acquisition jhc requires significant level 
investment the company will need redevelop facilities noosa and coffs harbour nevertheless 
believe looking the net gross acquisition cost per bed and multiples potential ebitda from the acquired 
facility which calculate per bed potential upside value provided the company are 
relevant metrics with which assess pricing 
australia emerging companies april 
this basis believe acquisition pricing has 
increased above our previous assumption when 
initiated coverage jhc and ehe had assumed 
acquisitions would occur circa ebitda after 
operational improvements earnings but show 
below the rate has proven more like 
this calculation not take into account the 
potential rad uplift believe there risk 
assuming rads continue current take and high 
valuations into perpetuity 
exhibit rad cash inflow start declining 
after 
jhc 
ehe 
this basis the incremental return capital 
our measure each company has unique way 
rce data rgan stan ley research estimates 
looking the return capital with the treatment 
rads being the key variable but use method the potential ebitda over the net acquisition value 
want factor the embedded opportunity for upside earnings which still fairly significant but not 
factor any further rad uplift believe this banking too much the upside that yet delivered 
this return not much above the wacc use our dcf which equal our theoretical cost 
equity assume debt the capital structure assume that rads represent operating cashflow 
working capital leverage does not leave capacity for further debt over the long term with return capital 
only slightly above wacc the accretion from the deal limited the further uplift rads from the acquired 
facilities 
finally cost per bed basis acquisitions are also looking fairly expensive although land value will impact 
build costs believe replacement value circa with gross acquisition prices per bed 
above this level think these acquisitions look expensive this measure especially considering that new 
facilities will attract higher rad value have less capex requirement and more attractive potential residents 
than older acquired facility

more favourable contracts are another pillar near term earnings growth 
the third pillar growth from margin improvement the value each transaction retirement unit this 
result aveo moving standard contract most villages where residents pay dmf 
initial entry price and share the capital gains this was generally more favourable for aog than the 
average the prior contracts over the next two years almost all residents vacating would have entered this 
more favourable contract and calculate this will increase the dmf margin from circa 
and closer percentage the transaction value 
aveo way offers even higher returns last year new contract was introduced called the aveo way where 
the dmf fee increased the entry price and aog receives the capital gain offset the 
higher fee aog guarantees buy back units and funds the refurbishment the units currently requirement 
the tenant exit providing residents certainty the outlay when they enter 
this new policy will substantially increase the potential margin every transaction from maximum circa 
under current contracts the impact will occur ten year time but capex will increase 
maintenance now funded residents exit and aog will take more risk they guarantee buyback under that scenario believe the company would have run lower level gearing than its already 
conservative all all this would major positive for aog our view would give the company 
more control over its villages and generate substantially higher roa than the targeted over 
the long term 
think this new policy has been successful due aog good product lack supply and strong residential 
property markets think there chance that this policy continues evolve over time not factor 
any upside from this our dcf but does pose potential catalyst should become the norm note that 
retireaustralia has recently publicly stated that looking developing similar product aveo way that 
offers residents sense certainty 
upside delivery returns the market can focus earnings 
expect the growth aveo retirement contribution accelerate cagr over the
