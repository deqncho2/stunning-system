agricultural food processing provides investors with long term opportunities outperform australia gdp 
growth factors supporting this theme include return mid cycle grain volumes the progressive shift 
towards the use healthier canola oil food processing demand for livestock feed second derivative 
global protein consumption and increasing demand for craft boutique beers that require high levels 
malt input

bulk grain ports gnc also the fourth largest independent maltster the world with market shares 
the the and australia operating malt plants gnc expanding its pocatello facility 
meet increasing demand for craft boutique beers lastly gnc imports and exports australia edible 
oils through its liquid bulk terminals business that will benefit from expansion and network consolidation 
projects near term discussed later 
strong self help opportunities think gnc strong self help story with substantial opportunities for 
consolidation across its grain storage and oil processing network self help opportunities are independent the 
agriculture cycle furthermore gnc has capital investment program that will pivot the group 
further towards the more stable oils and malts businesses and reduce the contribution grain businesses 
and marketing 
investment concerns 
inherent revenue cyclicality gnc grain throughput volatile and varies with the australian east coast 
grain harvest and global grain trading conditions global weather patterns which are increasingly erratic 
typically drive both oil seed crush margins key driver oils profitability have also been volatile driven 
the supply demand canola substitutes and european canola oilseed demand management has little influence 
over either 
strong fixed cost leverage given gnc asset intensity the business has naturally high fixed cost base with 
limited offtake arrangements grain and limited pricing power oils fixed cost leverage significant higher 
volatility limits sustainable leverage typically attracts valuation discount and limits the breadth the investor 
base 
increasingly little balance sheet headroom core debt gearing excluding marketing and barley inventories 
expect this peak capex spend starts taper given the inherent cyclical 
volatility see increasingly little balance sheet headroom particularly with poor east coast grain harvest 
our interest coverage cash ebit net interest forecast however assuming style grain 
conditions the poorest harvest years interest coverage would still 
execution capital expenditure execution capex remains key driver fcf both terms revenues 
and completing projects time and within budget note have only included growth capex the 
announced management and capex beyond this will negatively impact fcf least the near 
term 
new market entrants the grain supply chain with the ongoing disaggregation the australian east 
coast grain supply chain see the potential for new supply chain operators beyond quattro bunge and 
emerald the advent grain containerisation has meant the ability enter the grain supply chain has become 
far less capital intensive new entrants represent risk our base case

where could wrong 
our group sotp valuation includes storage and logistics our mid cycle ebitda forecast the average 
our defined ebitda range above while assume the average our valuation range note four 
valuation risks 
positive near term valuation catalysts are hard identify while like gnc assets catalysts for 
valuation rating remain hard define particularly with the current pressure earnings 
inherent cashflow volatility limits leverage and roe given the seasonality export grain volumes and 
the lack offtake agreements cashflows are highly volatile result sustainable leverage likely 
significantly lower than other port assets this reduces balance sheet optionality and roe making the asset 
less attractive traditional infrastructure investors 
new port entrants while the construction the new quattro facility provides strong readthrough for gnc port replacement cost the other side the coin the increase competition provides 
the quattro consortium building capacity with offtake arrangements place potentially 
guaranteeing significantly better capacity utilization than the currently experienced the east coast 
worst case think gnc grain exports could risk with assumed loss loss already 
our numbers while this would negative have some comfort that the risk new entrants will 
contained just quattro with channel checks pointing improved gnc service which has lowered the 
customer appetite for alternate supply chain solutions 
the shift containerized exports risk port share addition added quayside competition 
see another slow burn risk the progressive shift towards the containerisation grain movements containers 
already account for all grain export movements with scope for this share increase note 
other transport operators are increasingly pushing into containerised soft commodity exports combat this 
threat gnc are also investing container packing with recent investments geelong 
graincorp may 
issue can gnc experience structural rating 
key issue does gnc have rating potential 
graincorp trades cyclical commodity stock not industrial infrastructure play based 
recent trading history gnc trades closer underlying movements the volatile storage and logistics 
business however addition latent value potential from infrastructure assets discussed previously 
see two catalysts that could change gnc trading pattern 
rate catalyst expect pivot more stable earnings estimate the 
contribution from storage and logistics group ebitda will decline from 
think more stable cash flow dividend base could increase investor confidence and the upfront 
through the cycle multiple investors are willing pay 
rate catalyst gnc goes capex and trading fcf yield our 
forecasts gnc trading mid cycle fcf yield see significant scope for this 
close particularly the context the industrials fcf yield 
where could wrong execution growth capex remains major driver fcf both terms 
driving revenues well completing projects time and within budget further growth capex 
beyond the initiatives already announced beyond our base case representing downside 
risk fcf least near term 
gnc trades like volatile commodity business 
gnc recent trading history has been volatile with movements the stock price mirroring temperamental 
grain trading conditions the progressive grind lower from mid mirrors eps downgrades which were 
driven grain related downgrades storage and logistics earnings short gnc trades like commodityexposed business though below identify two important shifts group strategy that could drive rating

issue thematic exposure australia transition 
how gnc placed australia upcoming economic transition 
australia economic transition our research team expects australian gdp growth and corporate 
profitability growth will slow the commodities super cycle ends household leverage peaks and 
iii oligopoly growth slows this theme was recently explored the morgan stanley blue paper 
australia transition ten winners from five structural themes march 
five structural themes dominate australian equity valuations australia makes its economic 
transition morgan stanley research analysts have identified five core structural themes that think 
will most impact corporate earnings and equity valuations global expansion new economic 
infrastructure new export economy technological disruption demographics 
gnc has positive leverage two these themes 
global expansion think gnc solid play this theme with invested 
capital sunk offshore malting assets gnc assets offer scalable growth earnings 
diversification and future optionality 
new export economy like gnc play this theme for two reasons gnc 
already has latent infrastructure capacity meaning highly accretive roic and 
significant capex being invested edible oil refining and processing 
assets pushing gnc the agri product value curve 
potential for longer term outperformance gnc management executes well the above 
measures outside the inherent cyclicality storage and logistics think gnc could meaningfully 
outperform the broader given the expected divergent growth profiles 
gnc well placed outperform australia economic transition 
against this backdrop think gnc well placed outperform the broader market over the next decade for 
two reasons first gnc levered new agri food processing export channels export enabler through its 
export and refining infrastructure second gnc fits into the global expansion theme with high quality offshore 
assets that are being expanded giving investors access areas stronger foreign growth 
gnc key enabler the new export economy 
agriculture play important role australia shifting export economy china growth transition 
the ongoing development emerging asia and less commodity intensive developed world mean that 
australia current account deficit ever narrow more appropriate levels new sources export revenues 
need found also note that the australian dollar will structurally weaker the event that trade 
deficits are not closed through policy and corporate success given the currency sensitivity the agriculture and 
food processing industry think either case will play increasingly important role supporting 
australia gdp and income growth 
graincorp may 
pushing further the value curve key growth agribusiness not new channel and already 
contributes australia gdp australian rural exports are meaningful accounting for 
total gross exports however the ability further tap the asian food bowl thematic and leverage australia biosecurity linked brand premium key higher value added growth the most significant issue for equity 
markets providing capital the industry remains one sub scale asset bases and lack retained valueadd after the farmgate 
gnc assets solid play this theme gnc export infrastructure and edible oil refining assets make 
both enabler and beneficiary the agriculture food processing theme like gnc assets for two specific 
reasons 
latent infrastructure capacity limited substitutes gnc already has latent capacity across 
its storage and logistics with only average utilisation giving high roic leverage 
further commodity exports gnc already handles australian east coast grain exports 
and edible oil imports exports 
gnc slowly shifting the value curve gnc also pivoting away from commodity 
handling and supply chain logistics pushing further the food processing value curve the 
numurkah expansion and redevelopment gives new low cost capabilities edible 
oils and fats processing and gnc now has the ability tap into the positive longer term 
shift towards healthier canola based fats and edible oils while gnc does not own any 
brands also has the ability produce increasingly complex edible oil blends key 
ingredient baby formula offering small but growing leverage china growing income 
and demand for high quality australian food products 
future focus think gnc well placed add scale and value agriculture related exports significant 
progress the australian government securing free trade agreements with korea japan and china and the 
potential trans pacific partnership create opportunity tap scalable markets lower australian dollar will 
assist this boosting gnc customer profitability expect that key areas within the broad agricultural 
space will consolidated and made more efficient with increased vertical integration and time become 
much more relevant industry for asx investors 
gnc well placed participate high quality global expansion 
three reasons offshore earners should outperform 
when assessing the australian economic outlook think asx listed companies with high quality offshore 
growth channels could meaningfully outperform competitors for three key reasons 
weaker australian gdp growth australian gdp growth set slow and remain discount other 
markets particularly the and asia businesses with offshore earnings diversification should naturally benefit 
from this theme addition any benefit from lower aud 
there less scope for domestic market acquisitions market share gains many australia 
largest industries have become more concentrated over the past decade limiting the opportunities for further 
consolidation market share gains that can meaningfully improve growth prospects 
more intense competition australia from new entrants given the oligopolistic industry structures 
embedded the economy there are number industries that generate both high roes and high margins 
relative global peers think domestic incumbents will face competition from international businesses 
expanding into australia from new business models these excess returns are targeted are already 
seeing this unfold staples discretionary retailing banking and insurance 
graincorp may 
gnc invested capital focussed offshore making strong play this theme 
estimate gnc invested capital offshore comprising gnc total capital base 
result think gnc relevant global expansion play the australian market gnc offshore assets 
include european and north american malting facilities where gnc the fourth largest independent maltster 
also gnc still growing these assets evidenced the recent north american investment

three benefits from malting expansion 
like gnc expansion malting for three key reasons 
gnc malting assets offer economies scale large offshore markets while the and european 
economies face both cyclical and structural challenges their size alone offers compelling opportunities for 
example despite relatively weak malt demand growth gnc malting size gnc the fourth largest maltster 
the world and market concentration capacity utilisation still produces strong incremental returns for 
example think the pocatello expansion could comfortably yield roic time malt roic over 
already significantly above group roic 
valuation optionality australian companies with credible offshore growth options have tended trade 
premium their domestic peers the broader australian market for gnc think the malt assets offer 
option blue sky earnings not available australia particularly the north american craft beer sector 
where growth averaging 
diversification one the traditional motivations for expanding outside domestic market buffer 
the shocks that periodically hit individual countries regions this true for gnc given the volatility 
storage and logistics however with structural pressures expected impact the aud offshore earnings could 
also increasingly valued 
looking forward 
the australia transition paper identified five factors that contributed success failure offshore 
expansion these include best class capability and execution the right market and partners iii 
innovation differentiation scalable model core business and strategic leadership 
these factors think gnc malt assets offer best class capability particularly following the expansion 
gnc north american assets that will allow for increasingly differentiated and specific malt products service 
the craft beer sectors second think gnc already has the right market and partners evidenced the strong 
market position and already high capacity utilisation
