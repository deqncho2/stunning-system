voc partial vertical integration from the mtu merger set

what changed

from 
backhaul optionality complete vertical integration voc gained 
partial vertical integration with the mtu merger but complete this chain 
needs increase its holding australian backhaul assets this means would 
own international bandwidth infrastructure domestic backhaul infrastructure 
and last mile corporate fibre simply would control its whole cost base this 
important because would mean that voc could still offer products that are 
cheaper than telstra corporate and cheaper retail our 
view this would mean further market share wins for voc currently 
forecast voc corporate market share increase from 
its retail broadband share rise from over this period 
which turn further rating there unconfirmed press speculation 
about voc acquiring nextgen based our analysis deal could beneficial 
both this would provide voc the final piece its vertical 
integration and thus think that voc could rate way similar tpm 
when completed its vertical integration journey acquiring aapt 
december tpm rated from one year forward voc 
were rate from its current reflects multiple point 
increase similar tpm but higher percentage increase plus

clear neither voc nor nextgen has publicly commented any deal 
voc trades discount tpm but with higher growth

voc investment case 
voc increasing vertical integration set generate super normal returns over the next years have 
been bullish tpg telecom another telco for its increasing vertical integration and the cost advantages this 
provides voc following the same path its merger with mtu and consequently set gain many the 
same advantages this should result voc continuing win corporate telco market share extracting greaterthan expected synergies from the mtu merger this report add the balance sheet optionality which could 
allow consolidation the backhaul telecom segment and rating for voc all this vertical integration means 
voc positioning itself key player the new economic infrastructure australia and has lead 
include voc our morgan stanley blue paper australia transition ten winners from five structural 
themes mar 
rate voc overweight for four reasons 
vertical integration advantage driving earnings momentum voc set enjoy strong eps growth 
cagr historically this has been the key driver stock price appreciation voc has 
announced synergies released from the merger with mtu however believe the 
vertical integration benefits this merger could release another synergies over this period 
including another synergies our bull case could mean that voc eps growth rises cagr clear mtu broadband subscribers migrate across onto the nbn much these 
cost savings should reduced however they are worth highlighting 
corporate market share opportunity voc has share the australian corporate telco market and 
forecast this grow two years this driven voc strong product quality cheaper prices cheaper tls and strong customer perception network quality for every share gain this

debate can voc transform its business strengthening its backhaul 
position 
market view uncertain the market can see the potential benefits from the industry 
consolidation that could accrue voc however think yet explore whether this 
plausible 
our view yes there unconfirmed press speculation about voc acquiring nextgen and based 
our analysis deal could plausible explore hypothetical range funding 
structures and potential synergies and believe voc could fund accretive acquisition think 
this would provide voc the final piece its vertical integration which would allow continue 
win market share the corporate fixed line market and retail broadband market clear 
neither voc nor nextgen has publicly commented any deal surrounding nextgen 
where could wrong further could limited potentially reduced access the 
capital markets which vital requirement for funding 
why are considering this now the australian telco industry has undergone considerable consolidation 
the retail broadband segment the number internet service providers isp fell from 
and with tpm acquisition iin the big four players telstra tpm iin optus and group 
now control retail broadband subscribers our view further consolidation this market segment 
now unlikely consequently telcos will have look adjacent market segments for horizontal mergers 
one area which think important examine the australian backhaul telco market backhaul fibre 
pipe which travels from one capital city another from sydney perth and any telco which wants 
provide national broadband services needs use this service the backhaul market characterized large 
upfront capital costs which means this market far more consolidated today than the retail broadband market 
nonetheless this market segment has moved from seven players its current five tpm voc tls 
optus and nextgen assume vocus voc has been named potential consolidator press reports 
because for voc become fully integrated telco operator similar tls tpm and optus needs 
improve its backhaul offering 
estimate that voc currently pays its cost base use these backhaul services hence removing this 
cost base would mean that voc could maintain its price advantage over telstra both the corporate and retail 
market consequently thought important take look the australian backhaul telecom market for 
opportunities for further consolidation clear neither voc nor nextgen has publicly commented 
nextgen potential target 
conclusion upfront voc were successfully acquire backhaul asset think would significant 
positive would allow voc become fully integrated telco provide cost synergies and strengthen its 
product offering have run number scenarios the speculated deal with nextgen based different 
funding structures and synergies and believe acquisition could value accretive estimate eps 
impacts from voc acting consolidator range from 
vocus communications march 
industry structure key profitability and long term returns 
first look analyse why telco firms are looking consolidate the industry the most important reason 
that they are moving protect themselves from declining revenue streams with the shrinking fixed line phone 
segment offering broadband and mobile services group was the most risk here with 
revenue being generated from voice services for iinet and less than for tpm vocus nows owns 
group hence its exposure fixed line now group revenue tpm now owns iinet and its 
exposure revenue this means that whilst voc exposure less than group was there 
still declining revenue stream result voc has incentive drive industry consolidation over the past 
few years group iinet and tpm have employed acquisition strategy through which they created value 
extracting synergies from the acquired businesses voc has also been recent consolidator the corporate 
market merging with amcom june 
there are three main ways which believe value accretive could enhance profitability smaller 
participants 
cost synergies these immediate cost synergies come the form backhaul consolidation 
back office systems integration international bandwidth rationalization and process 
enhancements 
greater scale and ability compete against the incumbent telecommunications firms 
economies scale with fixed costs such customer call centres and variable costs such 
backhaul costs 
consolidation reduces the chance price wars nbn rolls out nbn world each 
telecom firm going offering service that direct replacement for the others 
broadband service this means providers shall only able differentiate themselves 
price bundling products and value added services believe consolidation thus far 
has been very important reducing the potential for price wars because the number 
competitors has decreased hence this likely positive for ebitda margins for the 
industry also vertically integrated telcos network owners international bandwidth 
domestic backhaul and last mile services shall have cost advantage players who not 
own these services 
exhibit the top four players control 
broadband subs the australian market iin and 
tpm are one firm now

being consolidator would allow vocus become fully vertically integrated telco 
the merger between voc and group means that for the first time voc and group become telco 
servicing both corporate and retail consumers however when comparing along each the different industry 
segments clear that voc underweight domestic backhaul assets its peers see exhibit 
consequently for voc gain the benefits explained above believe that makes sense for act 
consolidator 
divide the fixed line telco industry along three industry segments 
international bandwidth this the undersea cable connecting countries together for 
example australia the west coast the usa 
domestic backhaul the fibre connections that run between the large capital cities around 
australia including metro fibre 
last mile retail pre and post nbn and corporate this the connection from the 
exchange which sits the end suburb houses businesses the last mile different for 
corporate customers retail customers today corporates already have fibre connection 
running into the building whereas retail customers have rent copper line which owned 
telstra maintaining dslams within exchanges means smaller telcos telstra not need 
rent all the equipment from telstra and consequently pay lower wholesale price nbn 
world things will not change for the large corporates however they will change retail 
dslams become redundant and internet service providers like group and tpm would rent 
the fibre line from the nbn rather than copper from telstra

exploring the numbers industry consolidation 
this analysis shall demonstrate the impact industry consolidation voc earnings and balance sheet 
clear believe voc would have consolidator not consider any scenarios voc being 
consolidated because think the australian regulator would likely not allow this rod sims chairman the 
australian competition and consumer commission recently stated would find very hard allow any 
consolidation amongst the now big four players telstra optus tpg and 
there are now four key players the telecom domestic backhaul market 
telstra public company with broadband market share fixed phone market share and 
mobile share telstra has domestic backhaul fibre and the largest player australia 
optus wholly owned subsidiary singtel optus has broadband market share the fixed 
phone market share and mobile share optus has domestic back haul around australia 
tpm public company with retail broadband market share and the corporate fixed line 
market tpm acquired aapt december providing tpm with inter city back links which 
adds tpm intra city links 
nextgen nextgen privately held firm which owned ontario teacher pension plan nextgen 
owns national inter city back haul links 
there are also smaller players with networks less than like transgrid but have been unable 
find financials for these players 
our analysis set out three key assumptions 
takeover price for the purpose this hypothetical analysis consider the most recent takeover offer 
australia appropriate starting point there have been three key domestic backhaul transactions over the 
last three years exhibit shows that these transactions had average ebitda target over multiple 
also have provided second valuation scenario using ebitda multiple which may 
look very expensive the previous scenario however this the average multiple currently for the 
telecom infrastructure players use our high point our range scenarios

funding structure consider three different funding scenarios cash funded bid scripfunded bid and cash scrip bid assume the cost debt and corporate tax rate 
have assumed that voc would offer scrip with discount the current market price and have used the 
market price march 
cost synergies consider three different cost synergies numbers reduction the total cost base 
reduction and reduction recognize that greater cost synergies could occur but believe 
this would likely affect the overall sustainability the business hence our view they would unachievable 
finally have used morgan stanley estimates for tpm tls and optus nextgen numbers are based their

market view cannot trade premium the market continues apply discount

our view voc could rate and ebit

valuation summary 
our month price target increases per voc share was this implies potential total 
return dividend yield capital return based the current share price our 
price target increases for two key reasons have increased mtu merger synergies from 
which increases our eps and have slightly increased target multiples increased 
confidence that the combined voc mtu business shall win corporate market share 
derive our valuation for voc business from the average our three methodologies from 
ebitda based sum the parts from and discounted cash flow dcf 
from use the multiple reflect short term earnings and dcf valuation because think dcf 
better captures the changing industry dynamics surrounding the nbn 
target multiple valuation for core business 
our valuation voc share was based our adjusted eps estimate 
was which apply target multiple was our market multiple 
unchanged apply premium was the market multiple which premium voc 
long term average which think justified considering the vertical integration this business has 
achieved with its the merger with mtu clear voc gains vertical integration synergies from the mtu 
merger but backhaul vertical integration synergies are not included this valuation have increased the 
premium slightly reflect our increased confidence that this merger shall result increasing market 
share corporate markets for voc our eps estimate adjusted does not include the amortization charge 
reflected subscriber acquisition costs because this non cash charge think removing this charge better 
reflects the cash generation the business this line with the market thinking this adjustment 
adds eps and adds our price target implies multiple

ebitda valuation for core business 
our sum the parts valuation voc share was our valuation increases reflect 
higher earnings forecasts via increased cost synergies and increased target multiple increased 
confidence that the combined voc mtu business shall win corporate market share 
apply target ebitda multiples for voc fibre ethernet and internet earnings was 
for voc data centre for voc voice business for projects business and for mtu 
business these latter four are unchanged this implies average ebitda was which 
premium was the historical average ebitda multiple for voc think justified 
considering the vertical integration this business undergoing the merger with mtu 
apply ebitda multiple was voc fibre ethernet and internet business increase this 
target multiple reflect the balance sheet optionality which explored this report 
apply ebitda multiple voc data centre business peer next not covered australian 
pure play data centre and trading ebitda based consensus are comfortable 
applying discount for voc data centers because smaller size which means there reduced network 
effect for attracting customers and reduced scale efficiencies gain from power and greater reduced national 
footprint 
apply ebitda multiple voc voice business this slight premium the multiple 
apply tesltra pstn business justify small premium because voc focused business subscribers

for tpm mobile business for tpm pipe network business for tpm aapt business and for iin 
business line with target over multiple 
calculate the dcf valuation months taking the net present value npv today based
