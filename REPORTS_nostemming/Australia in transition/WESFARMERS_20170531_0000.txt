are downgrading six reasons 
the market under appreciates amzn impact wes australia largest non food 
retailer see wes the most impacted amzn arrival australia despite generating 
ebit from non food retail wes shares are little changed from news amzn would 
enter australia believe that wes department store businesses kmart and target are 
particularly susceptible amzn rolls out its party product and its prime offer based 
our estimates for amzn share gains and incremental margins see wes losing 
ebit and have lowered our valuations for kmart target and bunnings 
coles has resurgent competitor woolworths margins won recover continue 
think the australian supermarkets industry challenged yet still highly profitable 
global standards the key change the past months has been the market leader 
woolworths focus shifting from maximising margin profit coles the player suffering 
and expect this continue 
australian housing has had its best days bunnings growth will slow years 
booming australian housing market and outstanding execution has driven bunnings growth 
story housing outlined our macro team slowing think bunnings will continue 
report weaker than expected sales the housing market slows further wesfarmers are 
cracks emerging 
management change bunnings upcoming ceo and management changes make cautious 
given the potential for changes strategy and acquisitions 
coal prices are rolling positive consensus earnings revisions over the past months have 
been driven its lowest multiple business coal since sales have lowered our coles 
petrol target and bunnings ebit forecasts but positive coal 
revisions have been the offset with coal prices rolling over see consensus revisions turning 
negative 
valuation and earnings sell side earnings estimates have been too high over the past 
years lower our eps reflect amazon arrival australia lower coal

kmart and target have long lease agreements too 
however when retailers lease all their stores like the australian 
department stores kmart target big store closures are rare 
one the differences between the australian retail market and 
and because the leases that the department stores have entered into 
other developed markets such the and the that because 
are very long over years plus some cases the retailers need 
the success malls most retailers lease virtually all stores 
wait long time close stores are also aware that because 
see this potentially huge problem for the department store 
the department stores are anchor tenant the landlords force the 
sector australia when retailers have stores that are marginal 
retailer agree must trade clause which basically means the 
loss making that they own the remedy fairly straightforward close 
retailer forced have the doors open they drive traffic the 
the stores arguably execution improves the retailer can focus 
mall smaller specialty retailers effectively pay for this traffic 
fewer stores likely that few competitors are the same boat 
through higher rents per sqm and sales basis 
everyone closes stores which supports the industry profitability

management change 
share price underperformance failing strategies are spurned 
often the expense earnings and new direction taken 
wesfarmers prides itself its long term investment horizon 
february wesfarmers appointed rob scott its 
don expect wholesale changes under the new ceo but see 
managing director taking the reins from richard goyder july 
the possibility inorganic growth the reason being the new ceo 
while internal appointments tend viewed less risky than 
will likely the seat for while and thus can see any deal through 
external appointments who generally have more mandate for 
success wesfarmers balance sheet looks overcapitalised 
change view all ceo changes with some caution recent ceo 
currently especially following the sale its coles credit card 
changes the australian consumer space have tended lead 
business which had gross receivables around and 
should sell its coal business per publically stated plans could 
have war chest pursue acquisitions further the absence 
acquisitions would see divestments its officeworks and coal 
valuation looks stretched given lack 
growth 
businesses slightly dilutive eps note that the company has 
made comment about potential acquisitions 
sell side earnings estimates have consistently been too high for wes 
over the past years and think they still are lower our 
long serving bunnings john gillam has stepped back from the 
eps forecasts reflect amazon arrival 
day day running bunnings few have good long term track 
australia lower coal prices and the softer australian housing market 
record gillam bunnings and with more complexity added
