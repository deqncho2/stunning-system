themes see driving investment outcomes over the next 
years global expansion new infrastructure export 
economy technological disruption and demographics 
the overall score average the scores the five themes 
excluding any themes that are not deemed relevant for the

increase the weight placed various themes depending 
each analyst rates the impact these themes using scale rating 
investor relative concern optimism 
reflecting the impact the theme has company representing significant negative impact representing significant 
positive opportunity score zero would represent neutral 
impact while companies that are not exposed theme are left 
unscored avoid biasing the results towards zero for the export
