investment positives 
solid long term track record dmp virtually peerless the australian market terms share price 
performance since listed per share the company success has been built strong 
execution and very stable management team believe that part dmp success stems from the highly 
entrepreneurial nature the business with all head office staff required work stores some point dmp 
track record innovation perhaps the best any asx listed company our view and think its online 
capabilities are world class the recent autonomous delivery vehicle launch shows just how far ahead the 
management team prepared think 
capital light model dmp generates its total network sales from franchisees that are responsible for 
building and operating stores this reduces capital intensity for dmp which enables the company operate 
with rofe and roe above the capital light model enables dmp expand very quickly new and within 
existing territories 
pizza attractive category consumers become increasingly time poor the attraction delivered food 
improves our view across anz europe and japan the fast food category taking share from the wider 
consumer food service market with chain pizza taking share from unchained stores dmp well positioned 
continue benefit from this ongoing change our view pizza because its high cheese content tends 
travel far better than other fast food products such burgers chicken 
dominant market positions dmp has market leading positions australia new zealand japan and europe 
that enable significant economies scale via buying power leveraging digital investment brand reach and 
distribution costs believe that strong market positions make dmp business model very difficult disrupt 
store rollout potential dmp currently after its feb joey pizza acquisition operates around 
stores and has plans expand stores representing cagr given dmp track record 
regularly raising its longer term store rollout targets believe the likely very conservative figure 
dmp anz penetration rate people per store implies stores across its various markets globally 
technology creates barrier entry dmp has very well developed digital assets our view that extend 
its ordering platform pulse driver tracking technology gps tracker and online marketing initiatives dmp 
has developed these systems with significant investment over more than years building considerable 
barrier entry our view 
potential for further international adjacent food category expansion dmp has publically indicated 
that would consider investing more new territories and given its success date europe believe such 
investment would appreciated the market dmp holds master franchise agreements five the world 
top ten developed markets but opportunities remain expansion the south korea canada and spain 
would yield further store rollout potential dmp could also expand beyond the pizza category given the 
company strong capabilities online ordering and delivery the company has the past indicated that 
would consider moving outside the pizza category 
lower aud provides earnings tailwind estimate that during dmp will generate 
profits offshore lower aud yields considerable earnings translation tailwind every fall the aud 
compared with the eur and jpy leads uplift ebitda estimate 
europe significant growth opportunity dmp has considerable opportunity take market share within 
the pizza category europe rolls out technological upgrades estimate that dmp generates 
ebitda per capita its anz regions which compares just per capita across the european countries 
operates this highlights the opportunity our view 
domino pizza enterprises limited april 
investment concerns 
key man risk dmp has long serving management team with key position holders having long tenures ceo 
don meij years cfo richard coney years ceo europe andrew rennie years ceo anz nick 
knight years and ceo japan scott oelkers years although management depth high believe 
key risk arises from the possibility that member the executive team could move competitor and 
potentially replicate dmp strategies 
franchisee subordination franchisees run their own stores and thus have certain level autonomy 
recently franchised business eleven was found have underpaid employees compared relevant award 
rates sydney morning herald nov eleven two thirds stores underpaid inquiry hears 
although dmp franchisees are required report monthly including labour payments possible that 
franchisees could employ practices that contravene those outlined dmp which could adversely affect the 
wider domino brand 
potential disruption from online aggregators much dmp recent success can attributed its early 
adoption online ordering realm which leads peers given that dmp competes with large number 
individual store owners who can afford such investment digital platforms this has created role for online 
ordering aggregators australia menulog and delivery hero these sites effectively perform the role 
order taking and delivery given the far wider range products offer such sites this may more 
attractive for the consumer than the dmp focused platform 
growing health focus consumer focus health and well being continues increase dmp may face 
headwind given that many its products may not fit consumer dietary trends for instance one slice chefs 
best grand supreme contains over the anz food standards code recommended daily energy 
consumption dmp continually working make its products healthier but think such items will 
always viewed indulgent purchase hence consumer focus the health dmp products will 
remain low 
royalty rate increases dpz dmp operates the master franchise exclusively across number regions 
but the franchisor dpz covered john glass could theoretically either terminate lift royalty rates given 
dmp strong track record dpz reluctance terminate contracts the past and franchise agreements that 
end between and think the risk significant changes are low dmp future growth outside 
the territories which now operates limited the extent that dpz allows more territories which 
potentially caps dmp growth potential 
potential exposure significant food scare dmp brand would significantly affected should its 
products linked with adverse quality preparation issues note that chipotle cmg covered john 
glass between november and december suffered from food contamination issues cmg sss growth 
declined during and its shares have fallen since october 
valuation too rich for many highlight our valuation section dmp one the most expensive 
stocks the asx trading our eps estimate clearly given the current trading multiple this 
precludes some investors from owning the shares and sets expectations very high should dmp fail meet 
expectations see the risk based rating high recall the period between june and 
august when dmp reported negative anz comp store sales growth which contributed one yearforward rating from and share price decline from 
domino pizza enterprises limited april 
valuation all the growth potential the price 
market view yes the average broker valuation brokers who cover the stock for dmp per 
share with most the market viewing valuation either fair stretched since dmp trades one the 
highest multiples within the 
our view comparing dmp domestic peers little relevance our view given the very long term 
global growth runway available think that more instructive comparison for dmp global peers that 
offer similar growth runways this basis dmp cheap dmp peg multiple eps cagr 
based our forecasts stands only which compares with dmp listed global qsr peers 
where could wrong with high stocks general the risks missing expectations are 
magnified dmp were report weaker than expected earnings the risk rating considerable 
our view given dmp track record delivering above expectations see this risk relatively low 
key metrics monitor believe the key metrics assess dmp financial performance are sss growth 
region longer term store targets region and iii ebitda margins dmp revenue and total network 
sales 
one year forward basis dmp the most expensive stock within our coverage exhibit and within 
the most expensive within the asx exhibit but feel that one year valuation doesn 
accurately capture the longer term potential for the business

dcf valuation 
our view dcf approach most appropriate for valuing dmp given that captures the longer term growth 
potential that believe the company likely enjoy our key dcf variables are line with peer companies 
our australian coverage universe risk free rate line with the long term average year 
government bond yield equity beta line with peer australian non food retailers and iii tax rate

risks our price target 
believe that key risks our valuation include 
significant change key management personnel given the track record changes the management team 
could lead loss confidence execution 
disruption from alternative business models dmp has date kept well ahead competitors however 
should new concepts like online aggregators automated delivery businesses usurp dmp this could 
adversely affect valuation 
iii franchisee subordination since dmp operates low proportion its stores there potential for 
franchisees operating outside its contracted terms 
slower growth leading rating dmp trades the highest multiple within our australian

scenario analysis 
provide scenario analysis assess potential bull and bear case valuations which flex long term store 
counts and europe ebitda margin estimates which believe are the two most critical factors when assessing 
valuation 
bull case our bull case reflects dmp reaching stores compared with the current store 
count and existing store targets for longer term our base case provides for stores 
potentially should pizza consumption rise japan and should dmp increase store penetration europe 
think that stores are possible our bull case factors europe ebitda margin 
and base case possibility believe dmp can successfully lever its commissary supply 
chain investment and achieve scale benefits similar that which has achieved anz 
bear case our bear case reflects dmp falling short its long term store target stores 
which could happen pizza consumption declines across its different operating regions store economics 
not improve such that there isn the need split catchments increase the store count our bear case reflects 
europe ebitda margins expanding from the current base case dmp faces 
stronger competition and thus can fully lever its supply chain investments and achieve similar scale benefits 
has anz 
australian consumer industry view line 
have line view the australia consumer industry while the consumer benefiting from lower 
petrol prices and interest rates stronger housing market and low unemployment feel that valuations now 
capture this outlook think that investors need stock specific when investing the industry this 
report are reclassifying dmp from australia emerging companies australia consumer given the stock 
expanded market capitalization 
domino pizza enterprises limited april 
assessing the european opportunity 
our view dmp has considerable opportunity take share within the pizza category europe its 
addressable markets within europe estimate that dmp currently has just share the total pizza market 
which compares its share across anz given the company strong pipeline technology updates 
including gps driver tracker and the pulse ordering system planned for europe over the coming 
months think performance will step change much the same way did anz over the past years put 
simply think that domino planned improvements will enable the company significantly out compete the 
current challengers illustrate the size the opportunity dmp generates ebitda anz 
based the population base ebitda per capita its european countries generates 
ebitda population base just per capita which indicates the significant 
opportunity

exhibit the impact online ordering from customer perspective 
rce rgan stan ley research estimates 
why think dmp technology edge sustainable 
dmp has built market leading perhaps even globally leading technology platform support its business 
anz clearly this begs the question could competitor replicate its success and potentially even surpass 
think that there are few reasons why dmp largest competitors including yum brands pizza hut business 
won catch 
dmp now amortising the cost its technology spend across seven countries australia new zealand japan 
netherlands belgium france and germany historically the anz region has been responsible for technology 
improvements however going forward all countries will share the load developing and optimising new 
technologies anything think that this enables dmp accelerate its investment technology time 
when its major competitor shrinking across australia and parts europe making difficult justify 
technology investments 
the starting points for dmp and pizza hut australia are vastly different for instance dmp launched gps 
pizza tracker early while pizza hut are yet offer this service customers dmp has been first 
market with virtually every not every major technology improvement including online ordering app 
fingerprint check for single click ordering and sms ordering pizza hut find themselves constantly catching 
with dmp and anything the differences the technology offer have widened 
the network effect dmp like other online businesses benefit from network effect where becomes more 
efficient and valuable the more customers use think that dmp able learn far more quickly compared 
with competitors generates significant majority online pizza orders especially australia able 
trial new technologies more quickly given the large volume orders which speeds the learning process 
dmp business has been built around delivery not dine important distinction between dmp and pizza 
hut that points part the reason for the difference technology that dmp has pre internet ordering been 
predominantly delivery business whereas pizza hut has predominantly been dine business think that 
pizza hut focus dine limits its ability invest technology given also needs invest the dining 
experience

the online opportunity france germany 
customers are shifting online ordering which offers benefits for both the customer and dmp 
the proliferation smart phones and ease with which consumers can access the internet today driving 
structural shift towards online purchasing which holds many benefits from both consumer and business 
standpoints for dominos penetration online ordering has been increasing and continues increase across 
dmp different geographies albeit different rates benefits online ordering both the consumer and 
the operations the dmp business include 
eliminating time wasted waiting queues getting through salesperson via phone 
taking advantage special offers promotions which the consumer may not have 
previously been aware 
customers can choose order their own pace and not feel rushed when store 
phone 
lower error rates 
customers have the ability track their orders 
customers can store delivery details save time future orders 
customers tend spend more online they have more product choice available their 
fingertips they tend order more items 
online more engaging and also allows ordering decisions made group easier 
improves store customer service and efficiency employees spend less time taking 
orders phone store 
reduces labour required store 
fewer ordering stations require less capital 
using the email addresses collected dominos can enable more cost effective means 
communicate customers 
online ordering has proven successful business model for anz 
anz dmp most established market with new products innovation usually trialled here first before rollouts 
other dmp geographies for example online ordering was first introduced into the anz market and 
has grown account for total sales today management has said that the average basket size 
higher online order than for order made offline store phone and hence has been one 
the drivers dmp solid sss growth across its anz network

examine the drivers anz sss cagr since 
dmp has expanded its anz network sales cagr from estimate that the drivers this 
have been ticket price and transaction growth usually rise ticket might cause for 
alarm companies can keep raising prices forever but feel that dmp has lifted ticket without necessarily 
increasing prices and point out that over this period dominos has introduced its value pizza range 
for pick before which would have the effect lowering ticket see the drivers the lift ticket 
price the shift online ordering where customers tend spend more compared with over thephone orders the introduction pizza mogul and pizza chef initiatives which enable customers 
customise pizzas which adds value the order the chef best range pizzas offering which drives highervalue pizzas and the expansion the range offer more non pizza products such desserts and sides 
declining transactions per store concern 
don think because this happening dmp continually splitting catchment areas which turn 
drives improved service customers become average closer their store this drives higher quality

the introduction the hour minimum wage germany risk opportunity for dmp 
january germany introduced minimum wage the country first such policy per hour 
this pressures profitability for pizza store operators germany because drivers usually paid low amount 
plus delivery incentives used earn per hour given driver delivery costs are amongst the highest 
costs for franchisee drivers tend deliver pizzas per hour the impact has led increase pizza 
prices much and prices rose volumes have declined much based our 
discussions with dmp competitors 
clearly the introduction the minimum wage germany headwind for franchisee profitability and 
turn for the master franchise operator but the medium longer term think that fosters competitive 
advantage for efficient pizza systems such that dmp since dmp will deploy many the systems that 
already has place around the world gps tracker pulse and online ordering the company will reduce 
labour dependency for its franchisees since competitors don have access these same systems think that 
relative sense dmp franchisees will become more competitive the marketplace much dmp success 
australia very high labour cost country stems from its ability use labour more productively compared 
with peers the company systems allow for this and think they will yield the same benefits germany 
how large the market share opportunity europe 
the european pizza market large but relatively low growth exhibit hence dmp 
needs take share meaningfully expand its business our view dmp completes number the 
initiatives europe that has completed anz exhibit think that will take share from competitors 
illustrate the market share opportunity each the european regions which dmp operates compare

another factor the potential new territory ability leverage the soon opened commissary 
just north paris 
august dmp plans open commissary effectively food distribution centre service large 
number its stores across france netherlands belgium and germany other countries that believe could 
leverage the commissary are order spain switzerland and italy although note that dmp has not 
commented any such plans course over time dmp could build further distribution points that could 
leveraged new territories for instance the distance from paris berlin just over could 
time make sense for dmp build another commissary service the eastern part germany which would 
also have the ability service poland the czech republic austria and denmark although again note that 
the company has not discussed any such contingency 
risks associated with expansion 
clearly companies move into countries with which they are not familiar risks increase different countries 
have different culinary preferences complexity also increases and management focus arguably decreases 
however feel that such risks dmp may somewhat mitigated 
dmp has executed successfully other countries europe 
the factors that have driven dmp success are highly scalable its online ordering and delivery technology 
domino pizza enterprises limited april 
menus can changed relatively easily across countries and dmp has sophisticated techniques assess which 
products are performing well

jubilant foodworks jubi covered our india consumer analyst nillai shah holds the domino 
master franchise for india sri lanka nepal and bangladesh the company also operates the dunkin donuts 
franchise india jubilant shares have fallen from high august just below 
february largely result declining sss growth given the very strong growth that jubilant enjoyed 
which not dissimilar that dmp anz business explore the drivers jubilant slowdown and 
illustrate why think domino anz business different 
why did jubilant sss slow from over the space two years 
the indian macroeconomic environment slowed which led reduced pizza consumption indian 
consumers purchase pizza average around four times per annum think that its purchase 
considered more treat than staple purchase when economic times become more difficult these kinds 
purchases become less frequent which has led slowdown the overall pizza market india while 
jubilant has managed take share overall sss growth slowed markedly 
jubliant was disintermediated the internet some extent the shift online purchasing has been 
slow india developed markets such that only pizza purchases are made online online 
aggregation websites tastykhana zomato have disrupted the chained pizza market india recently 
these websites have effectively enabled number restaurants and personal chefs provide delivered food 
very reasonable prices consumers began using these aggregator websites the pizza category suffered 
why think dmp anz business different 
pizza considered staple and cheaper than dining out should australia fall tougher economic 
times think that the pizza category would relatively insulated given that delivered pizza tends 
cheaper than dining out clearly transaction value orders may fall consumers may trade down more 
basic pizzas but given the value proposition that dmp offers australia the volume transactions should 
hold relatively well our view 
dmp the disruptor anz think that dmp the more advanced provider anz consumer food 
service industry terms online ordering and delivery consumers migrate order online think that 
dmp benefits online orders anz represent total orders compared jubilant clearly 
competing businesses could increase investment online capabilities but given that dmp technology spend 
split across many geographies and the fact that dmp already well ahead think unlikely that competitors 
can catch any time soon
