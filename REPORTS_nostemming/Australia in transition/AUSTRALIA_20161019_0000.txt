where are the housing cycle and what are the risks 
housing cycles are not all about prices 
australian housing valuations have long confounded bears and prospective 
buyers and see conversations start and finish with outlook for price 
while crucial household and bank balance sheets think this attention 
misplaced with price outcomes more likely driven the activity cycle that 
currently underpins growth and employment instead outline four key issues 
that need navigated 
housing oversupply see credit crunch resulting hard landing for 
the new apartment construction cycle given the substantial work the 
pipeline this would leave just manageable aggregate overbuild 
with rental vacancy rates reaching historical highs 
building settlement risk while the supply non bank finance has 
mitigated this risk date believe the settlements due 
end makes this genuine concern the negative feedback loop from 
broadening developer distress the fast track our bear case 
assessing contagion channels historically the detached market has been 
partially insulated from apartment price supply cycles but expect some 
fallout with australian investors having household net financial 
worth invested new apartments through end 
negative growth impact see housing longer contributing growth 
and becoming drag over this underpins our gdp 
growth forecast for and with jobs potentially risk retain 
our peak unemployment rate forecast 
hard landing for apartment development ahead 
overbuilding housing believe the australian housing market tipping into 
oversupply with further surge completions still the pipeline estimate this will 
take the cumulative national overbuild estimated stock 
mostly the apartment markets brisbane melbourne and perth although sydney 
has also seen large upswing commencements see factor housing supplydemand this softening fundamentals should seen most clearly the rental 
market despite adjustment real rents over the past years expect further 
deterioration ahead given our projection for vacancies head towards historical peaks 
depending how much foreign bought stock left off the market and the 
slippage rate between approvals and completions 
the resilience building approvals has worsened the projected oversupply since 
first fed the issue back september this view also stands contrast some 
the industry which project further pent demand perhaps the basis that net 
migration rates will revert toward the mining boom highs that the prior downtrend

lower valuations lending shortfall 
restricted lending foreign investors 
industry liaison suggests that lender valuations are typically 
coming through between below settlement price 
although this varies local area and project with sydney 
generally the best positioned this means buyers need 
make any lending shortfall with additional equity which 
turn may delay settlement and could even see buyers 
avoiding settlement the property value seen 
down more than their deposit 
the major australian banks have generally withdrawn from 
lending firb investors with only foreign sourced income 
westpac continues lend permanent visa holders with 
foreign income but has also reduced the maximum ltvs 
industry liaison suggests this the largest 
impediment apartment settlement although some 
foreign lenders are still making credit available and nonbank lenders are moving into the breach 
tighter lending standards 
tighter chinese capital controls 
the tightening credit conditions following apra 
ypothetical borrower study and asic investigation into 
interest only underwriting practices has anecdotally seen 
reduction credit availability for domestic buyers

multiple properties who will have faced more onerous

transaction uncertainty has been drag new project

are still being managed albeit with some delays and 
some cases assistance from vendors and other non bank 
lenders 
while believe widespread settlement failure still seen tail risk most

impact settlement failure scenario well the channels and extent any 
contagion the broader housing market and economy the most direct impact would 
developer profits and balance sheets through lost margins outright losses 
the extent that see insolvencies smaller developers would also expect banks 
have some exposure through higher npls over forecast our analysts 
see australia banks man land oct 
more broadly any weakness investment property would transmitted through 
household balance sheets via foregone deposits and weak investment returns put 
this into perspective the apartments due completed out end 
equates only the household net worth and any potential 
writedown would fraction this total value and shared with foreign investors 
however with australian household balance sheets tied housing assets 
and mortgage obligations fixed calculate the impact net financial worth liquid 
assets less total liabilities would about greater given net financial worth 
this basis any weakness would leave affected consumers more cautious 
and probably looking rebuild their savings 
detached market will see some impact just how much will the established detached 
property market suffer from any contagion from our projected apartment glut this 
complex problem given the multiple linkages including 
higher replacement value higher housing density result zoning reform has 
lifted the underlying value prime land with replacement cost providing support 
detached housing prices through any downturn 
versus shorter term oversupply however with overall dwelling supply now 
outpacing demand see less support from fundamentals vacancy rises and 
rental income prospects soften while the cross elasticity apartment and 
detached markets may low believe above zero this means that some 
will choose own rent apartment rather than house the price rent 
differential sufficiently attractive which means apartment weakness will have 
some impact detached property values 
negative balance sheet and sentiment effects the common investor channel one 
the main contagion mechanisms work crises where losses incurred 
one market are spread others through redemptions and rebalancing flows this 
likely factor detached australian housing given the number

credit with the impact accumulating just our projected oversupply starts erode 
fundamental price support especially for the swathe off the plan apartment

the rba has used the majority its conventional policy space having cut from 
november currently meanwhile financial stability concerns

property buyers 
relatively low government debt means fiscal stimulus still attractive option 
but the persistence structural deficits post and concerns around the aaa 
sovereign credit rating will likely make the federal government reactive rather 
than preemptive any downturn 
australia history house price cycles shows pattern strong upswings with

have not turned crisis without catalyst here identify four factors that have all 
been drivers previous housing corrections australia well our view its 
current dynamics 
unemployment external macro shock has historically transmitted global 
downturns through unemployment domestic housing markets affecting credit 
quality and sentiment expectations 
australian unemployment has trended down over the past year the back 
resilient part time jobs growth our concern that the slowing the housing 
transaction construction boom will put jobs risk and see unemployment drift 
back peak this will leave the housing market vulnerable but believe 
additional shock would still needed trigger housing crisis 
interest rates effective mortgage burdens are crucial determinant housing 
market performance and serviceability shocks can come from number sources 
including central bank tightening cycles widening spreads between policy 
rates and available mortgage rates product terms that see step from 
interest only teaser rates 
believe the rba unlikely under any pressure hike rates for the forseeable 
future given below target underlying inflation effective mortgage rates remain downtrend supported another the rba easing cycle this year however apra 
supervisory measures saw outright hike investor property mortgage rates 
with rba data suggesting average mortgage cash rate spreads have increased 
over the past years 
the share interest only mortgages which step fully amortising payment 
schedules after typically years had been trending but has fallen from 
over the last year put these products into perspective current 
average rates fixed maturity mortgage can see payments step over 
the completion the interest only period 
credit standards availability this also has several elements including lending 
standards maximum ltvs serviceability tests fraud structure the mortgage 
origination distribution market and capital position and risk appetite the 
financial sector 
australian underwriting standards are conservative global standards although the 
combination expensive valuations and large share mortgage brokers has seen 
reports fraud emerge through optimistic estimates income and expenses see 
asic warns sophisticated mortgage fraud the australian december 
however the traditional structure australian banks and the mortgage market make 
less exposed style breakdown capital market funding channels and the 
australian banking system well capitalised positioned the top quartile 
internationally comparable banks funding has also strengthened since with 
greater share deposits longer tenor wholesale debt and more liquid assets 
tax and transfer policies and government support housing interacts heavily with 
the tax and entitlement system and also receives direct implicit support most 
countries result any change these elements that not carefully calibrated 
can trigger sharp adjustment 
negative gearing believe australia tax treatment negatively geared investment 
properties ranks one the most skewed towards housing investment with mortgage 
interest expenses and depreciation fully deductible against primary income tax while 
capital gains are given discount and deferred until sale the property this 
favourable tax treatment has combined with strong historical returns reinforce 
optimistic expectations about future capital gains and hence any change negative 
gearing the cgt discount proposed the federal opposition labor party would 
need carefully managed although support reform the system see australia 
transition asia insight scoring difficult transition cutting rba trough rate 
may with the incumbent coalition ruling out changes believe this risk 
deferred until the next election due

while note that the lines defence against hard landing are stretched they are

below and weak investment returns globally make property more attractive 
than otherwise reaction major downturn would also expect the 
government develop infrastructure fiscal stimulus given net government

wholesale borrowing and resort rba liquidity the event funding crisis 
the most likely bear case prolonged balance sheet recession 
based the factors outlined this report think the most plausible near term bear 
case scenario australia occurs via 
credit crunch for new apartment investors foreign and domestic leading

than leaving future investors with incentive walk away from contracted 
purchases 
resulting developer insolvency and shock employment from sharp 
correction activity and associated hit wealth confidence and spending 
banks then tightening lending standards response deteriorating asset quality largely from commercial property but with delinquencies also rising 
this scenario would expect balance sheet recession the most likely 
outcome these are generally associated with over leveraged household sector with 
prolonged although not overly deep contraction activity the absence

australia economic history the side the optimists and with the knowledge that 
the housing market and economy have avoided major downturn for over years 
explore the question what could right this bull case needs contrasted 
our base case soft landing the detached market and overall property values but 
hard landing for apartment construction and rental conditions working back from our 
base case through plausible adjustment mechanisms this implies

stronger labour market material fall rental yields widespread falls house prices

that migration rates will sustained around current levels after pulling back from 
commodities super cycle driven rates

apartment construction for the purpose land banking and not made available the

model effectiveness and assumptions 
calibrating the weights ran sign constrained multiple regressions the individual 
housing factors against forward measures the housing cycle year ended growth 
dwelling prices and building approvals while these two measures have similar patterns 
did find that the optimal weights across the factors differed little between the two 
therefore the final weights for the aggregate mshaus indicator were selected 
average the optimal weights for each 
while running the regression across various quarterly leads the indicator was found 
have the best explanatory power over quarter lead and the weights were 
determined optimising against this time horizon optimal constrained combination 
the six drivers against forward dwelling price growth was found have squared
