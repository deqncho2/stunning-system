from 
ski outlook more balanced our view ski share price down this 
year utilities index off the main valuation driver 
has been the draft rate return guideline rorg which ski describes 
disappointing but which consumer groups have said meets the capable 
acceptance test set the australian energy regulator aer ski share price 
equates contracted regulated asset base multiple month 
forward crab near the middle historical trading ranges and distribution 
yield the upper end bond proxy stock yields our coverage albeit 
with muted growth exhibit anticipate some risk dividend cut 
under the new rorg should bond yields remain unchanged from current levels 
estimate that wacc allowances could fall and reductions tax 
allowances only partly offset crab growth move from but 
lower our 
does regulation affect future investment think the key question for 
investors currently does the proposed rate return discourage future 
efficient investment and hence future crab growth while returns 
economic infrastructure airports and toll roads which take volume risk are 
undoubtedly higher compared those offer the regulated utilities our 
coverage take the view that grids will continue play important role 
energy supply and investment rates will not slow the are hopeful 
that current policy measures and wholesale energy market curves will take 
pressure off retail prices over the medium term leading corresponding
