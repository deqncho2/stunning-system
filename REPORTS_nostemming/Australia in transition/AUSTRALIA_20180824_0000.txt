believe the widening policy gap across multiple fronts means investors need the groundwork the potential first and secondorder impacts now identify six key areas focus 
investment tax concessions the crosshairs the sustainability negative gearing capital gains tax discounts and imputation 
refundability are all being challenged the looming election over 
time changes these programs have the potential drive medium term diversification away from australian property and shares 
particularly blue chip yield for housing policy reform could help 
improve affordability and reduce leverage over time but the adjustment not without risks 
income tax lower but later the liberal national coalition 
recently passed long dated program income tax cuts 
which would flatten the system over time with the removal the 
tax bracket contrast labor alp has proposed steeper 
curve with larger tax cuts for low and middle income earners neither 
bring meaningful change household cash flows before but 
believe the new baseline would help service the high leverage carried the top end over time while the alternative would provide 
larger short term support for cost living challenges 
corporate tax chasing capex both parties are looking how 
corporate tax can improve the investment climate with the still 
intending eventually lower the rate while the alp favouring 
accelerated depreciation the former would boost reported eps 
lower franking generation and potentially bring forward distributions the latter would provide more targeted benefit for capital intensive business models 
immigration infrastructure and insurance less crucially 
believe policy risks across these three areas need close examination the debate immigration policy just getting started closely 
related infrastructure spending remains elevated but the funding and 
selection model under review finally the shape and role the private health system under increasing scrutiny with proposed cap 
phi premiums likely force cost savings protect profitability 
more policy come the alp proposed policies have had heavy 
revenue skew leaving potentially spending over the next 
decade yet announced several key areas also remain uncertain

policies that matter corporate tax 
chasing capex 
corporate tax reform has been actively debated australia over the past two election cycles with both parties balancing the desire 
stimulate investment against longer term revenue needs the government has recently put its proposal cut the corporate tax

assessing the opposition policy allowing accelerated depreciation new investment 
from macro standpoint both policies are likely boost private capex although the coalition plan has potentially higher impact

those with annual revenues under the coalition 
largely concentrated cash and credit constrained businesses 
has continued advocate cutting the corporate tax rate for larger
