current aemo forecasts the mechanism unlikely triggered according the 
esb 
the emissions guarantee proposed for with one year grace the first 
compliance year allow for initial uncertainty setting the target the current 
committed pipeline renewables will influence the starting point 
the next federal election must held between august and may 
the result which may influence australia future greenhouse gas abatement 
commitment levels under the current proposal the government the day will 
review the targets and set targets set out 
broad abatement scenarios here australia utilities negotiations continue apr 
based current major party positions 
the scheme have its first operational review after three years 
how could the emissions trading scheme work 
exhibit emissions trading recorded the 
proposed registry managed 
aemo 
assume that demand stays flat and the abatement budget modest with linear 
pathway then the published intensity targets will glide down gently 
estimate that the intensity target starting point will mwh slightly 
below current nem average intensity mwh adjust down for 
renewables currently under construction and assume that exempt emissions 
intensive trade exposed eite users will continue use existing baseload thermal 
generation 
source energy security board 
any given compliance year think that liable entity retailer supplying 
electricity the nem may look comply with the emissions guarantee 
acquiring compliance load from 
thermal generators the amount scaled retail load thermal plant emissions 
intensity target intensity and 
renewable generators make the balance exhibit 
note that compliance load meet the emissions guarantee not necessarily the same 
the physical electrons the retailer buys supply customers with power but rather 
virtual market the compliance load will also not equal the physical load because the 
retailer first supplied exempt cross subsidy for small retailers and then 
the total exempt eite load socialised across non exempt load crosssubsidy for the aluminium sector 
help liable entities manage variations loads and contracts the scheme allows 
meeting compliance with australian carbon credit units accus 
carrying forward over achievement capped load 
and 
cumulative non compliance deferral for years with make good year 
the neg abatement targets also overlap with state based schemes state based 
schemes will not additional the neg 
unintended consequences 
exhibit key technology cost 
assumptions 
source acil allen 
highlight the following potential unintended consequences drawing historical 
examples and overseas industry experience 
bias overcapacity the reliability guarantee designed ensure the system 
can supply forecast annual peak demand scenarios with several incentives for 
new capacity voluntary capacity auction via aemo book build procurer 
last resort polr scheme and penalties for retailers found 
short capacity once built such capacity might lower average prices during the 
non peak remainder the year especially demand were fall thus dampening 
new investment signals 
unstable additionality schemes with low abatement additionality can perceived 
higher risk investors who view scheme which does little susceptible 
further change conversely overly aggressive scheme may unduly harm 
incumbent market participants leading calls for scheme reviews scheme 
instability has historically led boom and bust investment cycles and more 
volatile prices 
moving targets the neg attempts translate abatement target 
into annual electricity intensity scheme for which there are 
global precedents changes demand levels may therefore lead over 
undershoot the warburton review the ret resulted reduction 
the requirement for new renewables because material demand reductions 
over 
gaming the neg relies market mechanisms find optimal solutions the 
knowledge that the nem oligopolistic oligopsonistic and highly vertically 
integrated with mix public and private ownership the scheme also contains 
number direct market interventions the market liquidity obligation which 
are yet fully designed modeled
