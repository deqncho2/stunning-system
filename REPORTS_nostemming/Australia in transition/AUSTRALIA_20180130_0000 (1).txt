type modeling has several advantages but its main disadvantages 
participation then the higher employment may actually cause wages 
are that inherently backward looking depending past rela

which alters the sensitivity wage growth employment growth

the rba estimate nairu which has been slowing since the mid 
market the unemployment rate which captures the share the 
implying less wage pressure from the labour market 
labour force that trying find work this accounts for some the 
factors the paragraph above for example increase participation may increase both the number employed and unemployed 
workers leaving the unemployment rate and therefore wage pressures unchanged however given the changes flexibility and
