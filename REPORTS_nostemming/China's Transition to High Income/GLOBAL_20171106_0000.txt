why while macau sometimes trades weekly ggr investors have been better served looking much longer term themes 
and trends usually the stock cycle lasts years exhibit and 
think the current one has just started macau ggr grew 
rate per annum due low penetration which remains the 
case even today macau versus this cycle 
think the quality growth will better more than the 
forecast profit should come from the mass market segment starting 
expect see game changer infrastructure developments with respect zhuhai macao bridge and hengqin 
also think that there will clarity around license renewal 
where our analysis inside around precedents suggest positive resolution development capex and infrastructure ramp however our 
long term valuation could come down there either one time 
payment increase tax for the license renewal

base case this driven visitation and spending growth 
with significant operating leverage ebitda and fcfe looks set 
grow higher rate with limited excess real estate 
develop macau expect capex fall from per annum 
the last four years per annum future resulting dividends capital returns growing from current per annum 
more than double believe the sector market cap could

why are confident about this upcycle running for another 
line attractive expect major uncertainties removed 
years the cycle only started mid when gaming revenue reg 
and stocks see growth per annum including dividend 
istered the first yoy growth after months decline clear 
yield per annum between now and step away from the 
not think this was dead cat bounce historically between 
near term noise and analyze uncertainties infrastructure ramp 
and macau ggr grew cagr without any annual 
capex and license renewal arrive our ggr ebitda divi 
decline not even during financial crisis which grew 
dend and valuation conclude that market cap for the six listed 
and exhibit this was driven low penetration and 
companies which the parents own could reach 
rising per capita income china believe this will happen again 
based dividend and target yield which 
our china economists are projecting the country transition into 
the current combined market cap six concessionaires 
high income country which directly drives macau revenue 
and infrastructure should support more visitation believe that 
why are the early part stock upcycle which nor 
the quality growth this cycle better than the previous cycle 
mally runs for years exhibit apart from completing 
due business mix the non vip segment contributes more than 
all development capex the overhang license renewals two 
the profit now versus the previous cycle contri 
expiring will removed despite volatility during this time 
butions from the volatile vip segment have reduced significantly 
anchoring valuation upside driven rising penetration 
monthly vip revenue tracking half the peak

stock ideas upside potential 
much more than our current pts 
while our bull case valuations are based higher market growth 
see two risks achieving our valuation estimates 
expectations and market share assumptions think our valuations are another way think about the long term potential the 
while expect dividends paid out fcf which 
sector see the greatest long term upside potential for sjm hold 
mostly higher than net income cannot done indefi 
ings and mgm china due their lower base size and upcoming 
capacity additions with high likelihood doubling the profit and trip 
nitely 
some companies like galaxy may continue invest and may 
ling the dividend what more interesting that companies like 
not pay all their fcf dividends even 
wynn macau wynn resorts mgm resorts and galaxy could also 
provide more than upside they can pay the majority their 
other key risks our thesis include regional competition from 
cash flows dividends think the first three companies are likely 
japan korea material financial commitments for license renewal 
follow this path based the companies history paying divi 
tightening credit china and regulations rmb devaluation and 
dends and given their listed parents however galaxy could still 
the planned smoking ban macau discuss these detail

dividend paying model yet maintains 
growth 
macau gaming stocks not trade tight valuation 
range sands china currently trades ebitda 
fcf yield and has traded average premium peers since this simply driven its dividend policy paying least per share which 
similar its fcf and higher than eps macau gets the 
end its development capex cycle believe more companies will follow this model 
moves towards high dividend payout ratio could provide unique 
combination growth and sustained dividend noted above 
sands china has followed this path and has traded average 
premium over peers since despite weaker growth profile 
given its sustained dividend more and more companies move 
towards higher payout ratios expect for instance wynn 
macau recently moved from special regular dividends expect 
the industry gravitate towards yield similar sands macau 
stocks traded fcfe yield early when dividends were 
how much could they rate macau stocks benefit from low pen 
raised and growth rates were accelerating way example

drivers into visitation and spending per capita see five 
key drivers for visitation and spending per capita the next 
five years maintain gaming revenue cagr 
china transition high income status visitation and 
spending driver our china economist robin xing expects china 
reach high income status china why are bullish 
china feb and two thirds incremental economic growth 
mainly propelled lower tier cities getting richer china 
transition high income lower tier cities bigger richer more 
transportation infrastructure visitation driver the govern 
eager spend may forecast mass revenue chinese 
ments china hong kong and macau have been investing more 
visitors grow cagr between and driven 
infrastructure the greater bay area and expect many these 
china private consumption growth cagr the same period 
projects benefit macau specifically bringing more chinese tourists from cities further away from guangdong province encouraging 
greater bay area development visitation and spending 
longer stays and increasing frequency visits these infrastructure 
driver current gdp per capita the area discount 
projects include the zhuhai macao bridge guangzhou zhuhai 
other bay areas san francisco tokyo and new york implying signifi 
intercity rail extension and expansion border gate facilities 
cant upside potential spending also gba development will accel 
top that macau also intends upgrade its border gate facilities 
erate population employment and economic growth guangdong 
build macau light rail transit has recently expanded one its

excess capacity existing rooms despite the fact that occupancy 
macau has risen the ltm increase available

drivers visitation growth 
macau visitor arrivals grew cagr since reaching million mainly driven transportation 
infrastructure improvement introduction ivs individual visit scheme china economic growth and the opening 
more integrated resorts however visitation growth dropped cagr between and 
the next five years expect the positive drivers from return and expect total visitor arrivals reach 
over million mainly driven the opening the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge due the extension 
the guangzhou zhuhai intercity rail hengqin due late and more hotel rooms the market within next five

macau government expects taipa ferry terminal boost market share ferry passengers from now 
eventually 
tourists can get macau flying airport the passenger capacity macau and follow 
land transport the bridge will take about minutes arrive macau border this shorter than 
hour ferry ride from hkia ferries per day only the governments expect the bridge have 
vehicles per day initially and increase 
phase scheduled complete end which connects gongbei port zhuhai hengqin 
over stations this should increase chinese visitor arrivals macau via the lotus bridge which hour 
operational but current utilization low with only visitors macau using phase scheduled complete from hengqin chimelong station zhuhai airport this will cut travel time 
between gongbei and zhuhai airport minutes 
this should drive higher traffic and mobility the mid lower end mass market customers within macau 
our view taipa section with stations covering residential taipa and casinos cotai and 
scheduled complete will further extend connect hengqin via the lotus bridge allowing chinese visitors transit from guangzhou zhuhai intercity rail the peninsula section has definite timeline

believe all macau gaming stocks under our coverage

mgm china expect mgm cotai opening jan 
they will rate fcfe yield the next five years 
uary with hotel rooms existing rooms drive 
based fcfe yield see the highest upside 
ebitda growth for mgm china the highest our 
potential current share price for sjm followed 
coverage other casino opening during the year fcfe yield for 
mgm china wynn macau and galaxy longer term 
one the highest our coverage 
perspective 
from earnings growth perspective the short 
galaxy galaxy owns about hotel rooms 
medium term think wynn and galaxy will outperform 
the second highest among peers after sands china the 
and mgm will outperform however 
pany will develop galaxy macau phase and the next few years 
sjm should underperform due market share risk before 
with around new hotel rooms thus close doubling its cur 
cotai opens the longer run after expect 
rent capacity see further earnings upside the company can get 
galaxy and sands which have the largest hotel room 
clearance for more gaming tables from the government for the new 
capacity see stronger earnings growth driven 
phases the company has the strongest balance sheet our cov 
galaxy macau phase and the londoner 
erage with net cash and fcfe yield 
respectively 
gaming stocks lvs wynn resorts and mgm resorts 
wynn macau think wynn palace not fully 
should benefit through their macau subsidiaries which 
ramped yet after driving overall wynn macau ebitda growth 
contributed and their consolidated 
yoy further upside will come from increasing hotel 
ebitda respectively also upgrade lvs 
room comp ratio from increasing cash yield 
overweight conjunction with this report 
hotel rooms using ota online travel agents less growing 
the mass market database and ramping chairman club which 
still underused and can better also believe the company will 
sustain high dividend payout ratio around implying 
dividend yield driven fcfe yield 
sjm see the highest upside potential from the 
current share price for sjm based our fcfe forecast driven 
the highest fcfe yield among peers the opening 
grand lisboa palace tables and rooms expect 
opening delayed from will triple the company 
self owned hotel room capacity however expect the company 
lose revenue market share before the new casino opens 
sands china the company owns close 
hotel rooms representing market share hotel occupancy lower than peers and industry peak 
cycle should allow sands china grow more than peers 
when the improved infrastructure brings more visitors macau 
also the company has the largest exposure the grind mass segment lower spending per capita thus think stands out 
benefit the most when lower tier cities become wealthier driving 
higher spending per capita
