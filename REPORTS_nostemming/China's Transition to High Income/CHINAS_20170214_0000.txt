see the start multiyear earnings upgrade and nim expansion cycle and 
continued asset quality improvement expect nim for most china banks 
rebound starting with potentially more rapid expansion and 
due rising financing demand supported accelerating nominal gdp 
growth given more balanced industrial supply and demand and healthy growth 
services and household income rebound private and industrial 
investment and continued growth consumer credit demand should further 
increase financing needs and support rebound market rates the next few 
years likely continued tightening contain inflation and financial market 
risks should also lead more rational credit supply and rebound market 
rates from overly accommodative levels believe rebound banks nim 
without economic slowdown and asset quality issues would prove major 
positive catalyst for china banks would strong evidence better 
capital allocation lower than expected debt leverage issues and rebound 
roe the real economy 
not expect negative asset quality impact from rising rates because real 
interest rates are still falling despite the likely continued modest pace 
interbank market rate increases rebound industrial and private investment 
would more than offset the modest slowdown real estate investment rising 
returns the real economy and policies contain capital market leverage 
would attract part the idle funds and capital market leverage 
back the real economy and strong traffic growth and rebound state 
assets would help reduce the rebound government net interest burden 
infrastructure debt believe further tightening the pboc and cbrc would 
support nim reduce irrational bank asset expansion and contain inflationary 
pressures and over reacceleration industrial capacity expansion 
banks with good deposit funding franchises will benefit more dividends also 
catalyst raise earnings forecasts for china banks for and for 
with potential further upside risk our estimates believe ccb cmb 
abc psbc boc and crcb will benefit more than peers from the rising rate 
environment also believe likely stable dividend payments announced 
march will serve key driver for strong bank share price performance

potential multiyear nim expansion cycle raising earnings estimates 
raise our and earnings forecasts for chinese banks and 
average and see further upside risk our forecasts 
according our estimates banks nim could increase average the 
impact from rising market rates fully repriced 
our revised earnings forecasts reflected the nim increase relatively 
conservatively raising nim forecasts and average and 
respectively 
the nim changes are driven mainly higher bond investment yields and interbank rates 
could see upside loan yields policy makers such the pboc and cbrc 
further tighten regulation shadow banking channels even the pboc does not move 
the benchmark rate banks could start price now new loans above the benchmark rate 
our estimates for asset quality metrics are largely unchanged higher corporate 
profitability will likely more than offset the impact gradual rate rise 
there could further upside banks earnings there are hikes the pboc 
benchmark rate 
our price targets and ratings for banks under our coverage remain unchanged due 
partly higher risk free rate 
believe rebound banks nim without economic slowdown and asset quality 
issues will prove major positive catalyst for china banks would strong 
evidence improved capital allocation lower than expected debt leverage issues and 
rebound roe the real economy

believe consensus estimates for china banks earnings will also increase the near 
term 
january china banks consensus earnings have shown slight pick which 
unprecedented the past two years 
since the end the consensus estimate for china banks earnings has 
continuously been revised down due mainly slower gdp growth concerns 
about asset quality and nim contraction 
our opinion china banks npl formation has already peaked which leads 
stable not lower credit costs and and also expect see nim

the aforementioned factors would provide policy makers with greater flexibility 
containing capital market leverage shadow banking channels and potentially with the 
need address economic overheating risks and rising inflationary pressures which 
would likely drive gradual increase market rates and even loan yield over time 
believe gradual rate rise cycle and typical residual impact during the following 
year will likely lead two three year nim expansion cycle for banks with strong 
funding franchises while those banks that rely heavily wholesale funding will benefit 
notably less

manageable according our calculations increase funding costs would 
increase the burden infrastructure related credit gdp from around 
which still manageable level given all the other returns that china 
government can generate from infrastructure investments and assets still controlled 
the government see our sensitivity analysis page our recent report china 
financials benefits from modest rate rise outweigh risks jan

returns even new credit growth slows 
amid continued regulatory tightening off balance sheet channels and rebound 
industrial profitability expect idle funds driven into the real economy which 
would more than offset the potential negative impact from the slower credit growth 
expect 
according our estimates capital market and idle funds pool liquidity reserve 
for the real economy contributed the debt gdp ratio expect 
the continued regulatory tightening channel business and rising market rates will add 
pressure the investment return capital market leverage together with higher

see further cbrc tightening potentially positive rather 
risk 
key risk not over tightening but overheating followed tightening 
are concerned that tightening measures might implemented relatively late real 
interest rates remain too low for prolonged period and regulatory tightening 
measures are not well timed the rebound industrial investment might 
overextended thus entering new round over capacity cycle this would lead 
renewed asset quality concerns for banks 
believe further tightening the cbrc could help the economy avoid overheating 
due over investment the industrial sector result low real interest rates 
more specifically the new bank wmp rule and regulation off balance sheet credit 
would help contain such risks our view 
not believe regulatory tightening action itself would issue for the economy 
banking system coordination among the various financial regulators has improved 
notably the past year under the macro prudential assessment system the pboc 
reviews all major new financial regulations the cbrc csrc and circ assess the 
macro and liquidity implications this will enable the pboc prepare adjust its omo 
operations accordingly offset the temporary liquidity impact when new policies are 
issued
