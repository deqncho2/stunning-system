global rail face off time 
change trains 
having derated significantly since the merger 
think time revisit crrc our preferred play global 
rail our depth comparison makes incrementally 
confident around our overweight thesis for crrc but 
think that alstom contrast may face long term challenges 
have relative preference for crrc shares over alstom this 
comparative depth analysis our china and europe capital goods research 
teams consider company fundamentals and industry prospects two 
leading global rail suppliers although see alstom strong and wellmanaged entity believe that crrc provides significantly better investment 
potential 
global rail crrc enjoys standout advantage rail expansion major pillar 
the one belt one road strategy and chinese companies are securing 
plethora international projects lending customers generous terms 
this new model game changer the rail sector from the value 
these contracts exceeds estimate crrc the primary supplier 
crrc alstom face off what learned crrc the size alstom 
more vertically integrated and enjoys significant economies scale crrc 
also more profitable with ebit margins nearly double the technology gap 
closing with crrc spending per annum versus its 
european peer crrc only now beginning internationalise 
localisation cash costs are high both companies have made significant 
progress establishing new manufacturing sites outside their traditional markets 
countries such india south africa turkey and the however are 
concerned that costs associated with localisation may persist these are 
manageable for crrc ebitda but are more material burden 
for alstom 
not all bad news the industry growing although the terms trade 
global rail are changing china financing more competition lower 
downpayments see the demand environment improving specifically 
estimate that from the industry grew cagr and estimate 
the growth will accelerate largely based significant 
demand acceleration outside china

executive summary 
this collaborative report between our china and europe capital goods research 
teams draw two important investment conclusions from equity market 
perspective have strong relative preference for crrc hshares over alstom and global rail dynamics are evolving 
rapidly evidenced the emergence crrc the international stage 
major force and resultant consolidation initiatives leading industry participants 
such hitachi ansaldo and potentially siemens and bombardier also 
terms our relative preference crrc shares over alstom this based 
largely crrc significant economies scale and financing advantages 
detailed this report although see alstom strong and well managed 
business are concerned that its preferred alone strategy presents high 
risk consolidating industry where the terms trade are fundamentally 
changing there are unfortunate parallels here alstom previous strategy 
power the last decade our opinion 
global rail dynamics are changing fast what different now many developed 
and emerging countries crrc and related china based epc contractors are 
being sponsored state driven entities such china bank china 
development bank asian infrastructure bank and others china effectively 
financing its customers the rail industry which step change while presently 
this only affects high profile mega projects national level doubt that this 
will the endgame over time expect crrc compete for bread and butter 
business many countries including the and europe 
terms mega projects the scale the project financing being undertaken 
massive not think the sheer scope china led project investments 
widely recognised investors outside china just yet china financing 
new rail projects this amount broadly comparable with the 
entire size the addressable rail market today which unife estimates 
rail expansion major pillar the entire one belt one road 
strategy and crrc primary agent this change believe 
rail suppliers have moved outside their traditional domestic markets they have 
been required make called localisation investments new markets including 
the south africa turkey and brazil crrc has for example spent 
new manufacturing facilities while alstom has also invested meaningful 
are concerned this investments three counts different 
manufacturers are often adding capacity the same countries the same time 
believe that the requirement make these investments may continue 
incentivising further capacity addition for alstom the financial burden these 
investments has been high portion ebitda versus crrc 
crrc alstom face off how they stack our comparative analysis shows that 
crrc rolling stock revenue the size alstom crrc more 
profitable than alstom with ebitda margin versus crrc 
invests each year versus alstom and crrc 
much less internationalised than alstom generating only sales overseas 
versus although alstom has clear technology leadership and has well 
formulated international strategy over many years known and trusted 
partner many developing countries for example reasonable ask what 
degree this can competed away over time 
what the bear case for alstom although our base case valuation 
broadly line with management growth and margin objectives this 
presupposes that alstom can maintain even grow its market share slightly over 
the next four years our bear scenario detailed below assumes that alstom loses 
international share crrc between and from base case 
bear case and price pressure means lower ebit margins versus 
assuming very modest derating also from ebit ebit 
alstom shares would worth per share implying downside our 
bull case valuation though see this much less likely 
what the equity story prefer crrc alstom 
have relative preference for crrc shares over alstom for the following 
reasons crrc enjoys major scale advantage crrc the size alstom 
industry where economies scale matter crrc technology position 
strengthening given spending per annum versus 
alstom crrc has significant financing advantage with china bank and 
china development bank financing large international projects between with total investment estimated crrc has strength 
procurement and vertical integration via times electric and yongji motors which 
drives higher ebit margins versus alstom international 
markets believe that crrc will show higher sales growth cagr 
estimated versus alstom and eps growth may also 
higher and relative valuation basis crrc share now year lows 
relative alstom discount while ebit discount 
seen exhibits and below crrc shares have undergone major rating 
since the merger euphoria while alstom has conversely rerated further 
the divestment its power operations 
what the bear case for alstom our bear scenario detailed below seems 
possible that alstom and other international rail suppliers concede market share 
crrc outside china our estimates crrc could gain ppt the global 
market share between and our bear case presupposes that alstom 
loses approximately market share over the next four years around ppt 
ebit margin versus the base case and its applied ebit versus 
the assumed our base case valuation the event that this scenario played 
out alstom market value would then closer per share

crrc alstom face off what learned 
crrc market share the china global rolling stock market set increase 
from while estimate the growth the china global 
rolling stock market will accelerate cagr from 
crrc international revenue will outperform that growing cagr 
the same period and increase its market share from 
alstom risks losing market share this new competitor the international 
markets while our base case for alstom sees the company holding its 
present share the global rail market possible that alstom and others will 
concede share crrc outside china bear case see alstom slipping from 
current share this may not seem like huge change but 
has material consequences for alstom revenue growth trajectory probably its 
margin profile and certainly its market valuation 
the main findings our face off revenues crrc rolling 
stock revenue larger than alstom crrc has business model that 
more dependent rolling stock the total versus alstom 
however still much less internationalised than its european peer with 
sales generated outside china versus outside europe alstom crrc 
more profitable than alstom despite less favourable mix sustaining ebitda 
margin versus alstom ebit margin versus cash 
conversion compares with while fcf sales versus and 
crrc spend sales above alstom but absolute terms 
spends per annum versus alstom terms soft 
factors believe that alstom has strong and very credible record contract 
execution each its markets while that crrc proven the china domestic 
market but its key products high speed trains are not yet sold outside china 
localisation investments account for ebitda alstom crrc this 
report also take close look called localisation investments estimate 
that crrc has spent approximately new manufacturing facilities 
outside the core market far versus alstom crrc investing 
the turkey and south africa and will continue add capacity several other 
countries over time alstom more focused south africa and india presently 
and already had built presence turkey and brazil alstom expects shift its 
manufacturing hub from europe today through but the 
company believes that thereafter will not need make transformational 
investments given its much larger cashflow crrc far better position 
make localisation investments estimate that needs spend ebitda 
per annum this capex versus alstom the next three years these 
capacity investments are major for alstom industry wide are concerned that 
localisation investments are simply cost entry for winning projects especially 
developing countries suspect that these will not necessarily decrease all that 
much over time believe that siemens has been correct avoid going down this 
path

global rail changing dynamics 
crrc developing new business model rolling stock industry crrc instead 
rolling stock standalone entity should rather seen part major 
strategic imperative china expand interests overseas and invest 
infrastructure projects more generally according our summary analysis 
individual projects announced between china will participate large 
international rail projects with total investment countries like 
indonesia malaysia kenya and hungary and will provide funding for many 
them crrc forms part project consortium which includes financing the 
china development bank the china bank the asian infrastructure 
investment bank well the epc contractors such china railway group and 
china rail corporation the non chinese rail manufacturers are effectively 
competing with this combined entity new rail contracts 
the scale the financing meaningful for example the china bank 
granted china railway corporation credit line fund international rail 
projects similarly has been set aside for projects vietnam laos and 
cambodia alone these credit lines are broadly comparable with the entire value 
the addressable market rail which according unife was worth 
approximately addition with the supports from the new funding 
sources such the asia infrastructure investment bank aiib and silkroad fund 
think the railway infrastructure investments asia still with strong upside for 
aiib the currently approved loan only its total capital and 
china recently invested into the silk road fund promote its obor 
initiative 
see this commercial model effectively game changer the recent rise 
china the international markets most these contracts have been awarded 
the last years will change the terms engagement within the industry 
previously international rail suppliers such alstom bombardier hitachi 
siemens won contracts based technical competency and execution track record 
but more often than not the customer financed the supplier via healthy 
downpayments not any more the supplier financing the customer order 
win the project and believe china massive financing power will become crrc

crrc versus alstom investment summary 
relative preference for crrc shares trades ebit discount 
alstom 
comparing valuations can see that crrc both share classes has 
undergone major derating since the merger csr and cnr april 
the market had very high expectations the new rolling stock giant 
quickly expand its overseas market and the share was once trading 
for share high expectations however led disappointment 
domestic orders slowed and international expansion has also taken longer 
than expected this has resulted sharp retreat share price and 
valuation with crrc shares now trading only see 
this derating providing attractive entry point just internationalisation 
takes hold and the domestic outlook improves 
specifically from operational standpoint believe crrc earnings have 
bottomed with the launch china renaissance high speed mus 
and strategic collaboration agreement signed between crrc and china 
railway corporation crrc earnings are projected recover notably 
and the visibility long term domestic demand has improved 
significantly the concern the domestic business fades believe 
the right time review crrc overseas expansion potential estimate 
crrc overseas revenue will increase cagr much 
faster than the cagr 
from our collaborative global analysis think that the prospect share 
gain crrc the expense alstom and siemens very real are 
surprised that asia centric investors are not giving crrc much credit for its 
international strategy while europe centric investors not seem think 
this material concern for alstom siemens management has however 
been quite open about the competitive risks 
absolute basis see alstom valuation and 
ebit sufficiently full representing premium the global rail 
sector average and respectively not consider alstom 
fcf yield especially attractive industry context terms 
investment thesis think that alstom shares are being supported 
technical expectations around the potential put option with that 
may come 
though are not outright bearish alstom have relative preference 
for crrc shares which are outright bullish the relative advantages 
are the cheaper valuation for crrc shares well the company higher 
growth and returns moreover with accelerating international rolling stock 
market and support from the chinese government terms financing 
international rail projects think now good time review crrc 
overseas expansion potential 
terms relative valuation crrc shares trade discount 
those alstom basis and ebit basis crrc currently 
trades discount its year average whereas alstom 
above its own year average addition crrc free cash flow yield 
also higher than alstom 
there are three main considerations that could make turn formally bearish 
alstom the event that crrc secures foothold europe via 
the planned acquisition skoda believe that greater consolidation 
industry peers such siemens and bombardier could seen negative 
catalyst further major contract wins outside china crrc and 
related epc contractors aside from these specifics increased competition 
and higher cash requirements would not help valuation indeed the 
majority rail companies are cash negative laid out our feb note 
with the additional strain new localisation investments would 
concerned that cash generation alstom may become very limited 
key points 
crrc the current share looks cheap relative peers and 
historically crrc shares are currently trading year forward 
which around below its historical average addition crrc 
valuation premium over other industrial stocks has diminished significantly since 
crrc average year forward was 
premium hong kong listed industrials shares however the premium has 
now turned discount august crrc shares are also trading 
discount global rail comparables trading with steady 
earnings cagr crrc current valuation looks very attractive 
alstom see normalised and ebit fairly generous 
valuation alstom ebit valuation which has been fully corrected for the 
cash element this premium rail sector norms while the 
consider alstom and normalised eps excluding any 
equity income relating the joint ventures believe that the company 
earning and continuing basis and presently trading 
and these forecasts the global rail comparables trade 
and ebit while the european capital goods sector 
and see alstom and premium rail and cap goods peers 
respectively quite generous given the competitive challenges and the cash 
requirements discussed our report 
alstom valuation versus crrc crrc shares are much less expensive despite 
better growth returns although not believe that many investors are 
necessarily making either investment decisions around crrc alstom 
worth comparing the relative valuation these two global rail leaders see 
alstom multiples quite full absolute terms given future growth prospects 
and competitive headwinds however crrc share much lower 
than alstom while crrc share ebit also discount 
alstom crrc share valuation lower despite the fact that expect crrc 
post sales and eps cagr and versus and 
alstom while its ebit margin compares with alstom 
crrc stocks are separately listed hong kong share and mainland china ashare with shares representing crrc total shares outstanding 
although the underlying assets are the same share investors value the stock 
differently share investors and crrc now trading discount 
crrc share this report use the share valuation instead the share 
hybrid for the purpose comparison this the market readily 
investable for international investors and thus makes more sense for the 
comparison with alstom

alstom what the bear case 
base case alstom gains share americas and margins expand our analysis 
the bear case have derived alstom market share region using its own 
financial results and independent market estimates rail association unife 
this basis alstom enjoyed market share addressable 
market with position europe but higher share middle east 
africa our base case assumes that alstom will grow revenues per annum 
which nearly the growth rate for the overall market estimated unife 
this based the current order backlog this base case alstom 
grows share especially the americas from last year 
while ebit margin improves from last year 
bear case alstom loses share price pressure lower margins the bear case for 
alstom competitor crrc grows its international revenues from last year 
which increase international market share from 
assume that alstom loses share europe and americas 
versus the base case and mea and apac overall alstom would then have 
international share versus the base case and last year 
seemingly not high change but means that alstom would fail show 
meaningful revenue growth over the period additionally the bear case assumes 
greater pricing pressure drives margins only base case 
and the ebit multiple derates from the base case 
should this bear scenario play out alstom equity would worth

alstom what the bull case 
although have clear concerns around the medium term threat from chinese 
competition attribute higher probability the bear case than our bull case 
think that alstom revenue outlook presently well supported backlog 
depending the phasing these contracts well the possibility other large 
awards possible that alstom may exhibit higher revenue growth than the 
management target similarly with higher drop through and cost reduction alstom 
may reach its margin goal little faster than our model assumes shown below 
assuming revenue cagr and margin march the shares could 
worth this would also require premium rating transport sector 
ebita averages also think that alstom has some competitive advantages 
urban light rail and similar local markets which will protect from the full force 
any international competition the whole business not affected this challenge

where could wrong 
think fair ask whether our competitive assessment too bearish believe 
that the push from chinese capital goods suppliers and epc can take time and the 
progress not always smooth the track record project completion can variable 
and there are technical considerations also true that crrc has not yet fully 
delivered its international expansion goals and these have been partially scaled back 
the event that chinese rail consortia face delays and technical issues this would 
significantly hinder progress also true that chinese epc project competition will 
only affect the called mega projects first traditional markets urban 
suburban and regional trains could unaffected for many years come

crrc versus alstom face off summary 
this report take close look two leading rail equipment suppliers 
crrc being the dominant supplier the massive china hsr market the 
other being arguably the leading rail franchise outside china different 
ways both companies have strengths and weaknesses alstom industry 
leader for technology has virtually unblemished execution history and 
partner choice for numerous global rail operators crrc relative 
newcomer the international sphere but has ambition scale and major 
financing muscle 
this section take quick look how the basic stats stack before 
going into more detailed comparisons industry where size matters 
terms procurement and other economies scale would na 
not see crrc scale the size its peer group advantage while 
alstom more international business today sales versus 
crrc this changing rapidly and expect that crrc outside 
china have revenues and alstom revenue size today 
the size advantage also translates into more spending power both 
and also localisation crrc spend not that much greater 
than alstom but absolute terms this versus 
crrc has significant amount catching replicate its european 
and japanese competitors but this challenge not impossible similarly 
take close look localisation investments later our report crrc has 
spent approx versus alstom but this only

comparative analysis summary points 
scale matters crrc the size alstom although obvious point 
think there getting away from the fact that scale maters the rail industry 
why because effectively assembly business relying sourcing and 
procurement components and there also reasonable technology component 
which requires spreading this over sizeable manufacturing base helps and 
localisation needs global footprint while crrc has less attractive mix than 
alstom with revenues coming from lower margin rolling stock 
versus alstom the fact that crrc operating from revenue base 
versus alstom important consideration believe 
alstom more international but crrc will the leading international supplier 
inside five years alstom generated revenues from overseas 
markets outside europe absolute terms while crrc still 
only sales this still represents sales outside china estimate 
crrc overseas revenue will increase cagr and 
reach alstom total revenue today believe crrc will 
become one the largest suppliers the international markets within five years 
and this presents competitive challenge for incumbents such alstom 
bombardier hitachi and siemens 
crrc more profitable than alstom ebitda margins are higher 
although need careful about comparing contract accounting different 
regions and standards reported basis crrc does appear have higher 
margins than its european counterpart specifically crrc achieved 
ebitda versus alstom ebit basis the differential 
versus believe that crrc does have some production advantages 
has captive market china effectively being monopoly supplier crrc has 
grown relatively high rate cagr versus alstom and 
vertically integrated via subsidiaries such times electric and yongji key 
component and systems such traction systems 
crrc more cash generative and localisation investments are proportionally 
smaller although believe that alstom fcf still not fully normalised the 
company targeting fcf conversion present crrc still 
generating more cash its fcf margin sales was last year versus 
alstom while absolute terms crrc sustains free cashflow versus 
alstom moreover believe that the drains cash are more 
material alstom for example exhibit alstom average annual 
localisation spend has amounted ebitda compared with 
crrc crrc has more cash spend and the investments required localisation 
are proportionally lower relation ebitda 
technology matters crrc spends versus alstom 
see alstom clear technology driven company that has invested the ext 
generation equipment over long periods time and also has safety track 
record the international rolling stock market crrc relative new comer has 
worked its way shorter period time become one the leading rolling 
stock suppliers with advanced technology note that crrc spending 
sales versus partly capitalised alstom given the sales base 
crrc this translates into differential around although there are some 
questions around payback investment this differential significant crrc

global rail china strategic expansion changing terms 
trade global rail markets 
believe that crrc should not seen standalone entity but rather 
part major strategic imperative china expand interests overseas and 
invest infrastructure projects more generally according our summary 
analysis individual projects announced between and china will 
participate large international rail projects with total investment 
countries like indonesia kenya and hungary and will provide funding for many 
them crrc forms part project consortium which includes financing the 
china development bank the china bank the asian infrastructure 
investment bank well the epc contractors such china railway group and 
china rail corporation the non chinese rail manufacturers are effectively 
competing with this combined entity new rail contracts 
the scale the financing meaningful for example the china bank 
granted china railway corporation credit line fund international rail 
projects similarly has been set aside for projects vietnam laos and 
cambodia alone these credit lines are broadly comparable with the entire value 
the addressable market rail which according unife was worth 
approximately addition with the supports from the new 
funding sources such the asia infrastructure investment bank aiib and silkroad fund think the railway infrastructure investments asia still offer strong 
upside for aiib the currently approved loan only its total 
capital and china recently invested into the silk road fund promote 
its obor initiative 
crrc winning multiple contracts worth average read the 
unife report the rail industry seen market growing 
estimated per annum however can seen that crrc and its peers are 
experiencing much more rapid uptake international contracts estimated 
contract per annum the last years with average investment china 
per contract the idea that this low growth segment with crrc only 
winning handful important contracts entirely bogus when considered 
these terms 
see this commercial model effectively game changer the recent rise 
china the international markets most these contracts have been awarded 
the last years will change the terms engagement within the industry 
previously international rail suppliers such alstom bombardier hitachi 
siemens won contracts based technical competency and execution track record 
but more often than not the customer financed the supplier via healthy 
downpayments not any more the supplier financing the customer order 
win the project with the possible exception the japanese rail manufacturers 
for which take look the mumbai ahmedebad year project loan 
below these suppliers will not able compete all they are shut out 
global rail growth moreover the other aspect that has changed the need for 
called localisation investments also 
suppliers now need finance customers and invest locally well aside from 
the project financing aspect how compete with chinese state owned entities 
project loans increasingly rail manufacturers are expected offer certain 
percentage two thirds local content good example this was alstom 
prasa contract south africa see below where order win the project has 
been required invest estimated factory durban similarly the 
recent loco project india has required investment the 
consortium held joint venture alstom with indian railways however 
this localisation requirement has not been confined developing countries with 
the notable exception the amtrak contract the most notable winner new 
business the has paradoxically been crrc the chinese consortia are 
investing new factories boston and chicago 
crrc strategic advantage scale and project financing 
crrc not stand alone entity part much broader strategic ambition 
initially the discussion around the competitive challenge from the chinese rail 
company the merged crrc business has focused technological comparability 
and the ability secure specific reference projects outside china believe 
that this completely misses the point crrc should not seen independent 
entity all rather key part major strategic initiative which includes but 
not exclusive obor the chinese government crrc works tandem with 
several other entities including the china rail contractors such crg and crcc 
and then the financing entities which comprise the china national development 
bank china bank and some cases the asian infrastructure investment 
bank also 
china has unassailable competitive advantage massive project financing the 
scope the competitive advantage that the chinese rail companies have cannot 
overstated according the official xinhua news agency november the 
china bank granted china railway corporation crc credit 
line fund international rail projects this credit line comparable with 
the entire market value siemens europe largest industrial additional credit 
line further was promised for specific projects laos and 
thailand although not have many examples specific project terms they 
are generally competitive 
getting closer major project award hungary november crg 
announced that the syndicate jointly formed the two chinese engineering and 
contracting firms china railway group and china railway corporation and the 
hungarian national railway corporation won contract build and procure 
high speed rail connection between hungary and serbia that will connect 
budapest belgrade the contract worth over two years the chinese 
firms will jointly share the value this announcement was part formal 
cooperation agreement between the two countries signed international 
summit suzhou the time estimated that the contract value 
equivalent per this compares with 
per for hsr china this looks like discount 
financing example kenya according the china africa research initiative 
johns hopkins university china providing kenya with financing for estimated 
the project value connect nairobi mombasa this being built the 
state owned china road and bridge corporation which will operate the project for 
the first five years the china bank will provide financing which 
year loan libor plus basis points the residual 
concessional terms percent interest repayable over years 
financing example indonesia the jarkata bandung high speed rail project 
indonesia with total investment was fully funded china national 
investment bank with premium funding rate and the chinese consortium will 
takeover the entire projects include designs construction signaling and rolling 
stocks crrc will supply sets high speed trains with total value 
the asp the train higher than the train supplied 
china domestic market 
financing example laos the china laos railway that connects china yunan 
province southwest china with vientiane laos capital city started construction 
december the total length the railway which locates 
within laos the projected total investment equity 
investment supplied spv formed china and laos company and the rest 
total investment will funded bank china with 
years loan and interest rate only while all the construction works the 
six sub section will constructed chinese companies also expect that crrc 
will become the rolling stock provider 
financing example malaysia the malaysia east coastal railway with total 
investment will funded the exim bank china 
according the star interviewing the malaysian transport minister the loan 
comes with very competitive interest rate and repayment period over 
years furthermore malaysia will not need repay any the loan either interest 
principal for the first years 
japan the main challenge offering free money india for years the main 
competitor chinese funding comes from japan while the japanese consortium 
lost out the recent jakarta bandung hsr connection see below won 
notable contract india april the japan international cooperation agency

china rail moves into america 
few years ago the common perception was that the china rail expansion would 
primarily developing regions such africa and latin america while chinese epc 
and manufacturers have clearly won the lion share those developing projects and 
this can seen the backlog trends the western manufacturers crrc has also 
been particularly successful winning new business and making localisation 
investments the also for example 
boston metro december crrc was awarded units metro train cars 
for boston red and orange lines with total contract value and the 
delivery scheduled start crrc also building assembly factory 
springfield massachusetts for the train manufacturing with total investment 
the factory scheduled start operation moreover april 
crrc was awarded another units metro train cars for boston red line 
with total contract value the trains will also manufactured 
springfield factory and the scheduled delivery period 
chicago metro march crrc was awarded units metro train cars 
chicago transit authority with total contract value and the delivery 
scheduled start from crrc also building new metro train factory 
chicago with total investment and the factory expected start 
train manufacturing from november according crrc the factories 
boston and chicago are the only two metro train assembly factories plans 
build the and crrc expects more metro trains for market 
manufactured within these factories 
los angles metro march crrc was awarded units metro train cars 
los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority los angeles may 
purchase addition units trains from crrc and the total trains are

comparative analysis how sustainable alstom competitive 
position given crrc scale advantage 
crrc economies and advantages scale see the chinese rail 
company relative advantages scale its relative size means that may 
have certain advantages terms procurement and where its annual 
spend bigger than that alstom financing crrc 
typically acts part consortium with chinese epc and banks which 
offer attractive financial packages iii crrc has also localised significant 
extent with manufacturing capabilities the south africa india and 
argentina 
alstom leading positions international markets while alstom clearly 
does not have the same scale advantages already has well established 
positions with position europe and the americas has broad 
mix businesses with services and signalling representing the total 
iii the company has significantly invested localisation adding 
manufacturing india and south africa addition europe alstom 
execution history better than any its international competitors 
believe 
relative disadvantages for crrc see the main barriers international 
expansion lack reliable track record high speed train exports and 
some challenging diplomatic relationships between china and its target 
markets india for alstom will clearly not able provide similar 
financial terms certain international markets additionally expect that 
the eventual cash requirements localisation may greater than presently 
forecast 
crrc 
crrc overseas revenue increased from and its 
global market share global excl china terms revenue has increased from 
over this period the same time crrc total new order from overseas increased 
from now project that crrc revenue from 
overseas increase representing global china market and 
cagr highlight the following factors that may support ongoing 
crrc expansion into overseas markets 
crrc expansion can supported global rail growth estimate the growth 
global rolling stock market accelerate cagr higher 
than that and this largely thanks the global china 
market where the trendline projected cagr significantly 
higher than the the faster development will mainly supported 
ambitious railway infrastructure investment plans both developed and 
developing countries accelerated high speed rail completion europe well 
steady increase passenger and freight transport demand 
crrc highly competitive price overseas contracts crrc has usually 
participated contract biddings with much lower prices than its competitors for 
example september the company was awarded metro train cars for 
boston subway crrc bidding price was below the runner bidder 
hyundai rotem the other chicago metro train contract awarded crrc 
march crrc bidding price was lower than bombardier offering 
believe that crrc higher margins give some leeway continue bidding 
meaningful discounts its competitors 
procurement high vertical integration drives lower cost structure crrc pricing 
competitiveness the global market also supported its lower operating costs 
first large scale suggests strong bargaining power towards its parts and raw 
material suppliers more importantly crrc not only rolling stock manufacture 
and assembly company also supplies itself with key parts and components for 
example throught its subsidiaries times electric and yongji motors crrc supplies 
itself with train traction systems which are train value high speed trains 
locomotives and urban transit vehicles crrc also collaborates with several other 
companies developing key parts and systems such wheels bogies and braking 
systems 
government support crrc enjoys significant financing advantages key 
strength for crrc its ability enter into international projects part 
chinese railway company consortium clearly crrc can benefit from china 
obor initiative which already includes pre signed new contracts 
rail markets outside china some recent overseas railway projects chinese 
companies including constructors rolling stock and signaling suppliers well 
banks have formed consortium order offer complete product and service 
solution new railway projects from financing infrastructure construction 
signalling systems and rolling stock 
crrc has invested localisation already has strong global footprint some 
the key international rolling stock manufacturers have wide footprints globally for 
example bombardier transportation has offices countries and 
manufacturing facilities the world recent years crrc has accelerated its 
global factory layouts and has started construction purchased factory 
argentina south africa and india the higher level localization already 
improving its chances winning local orders our view 
crrc has significant spending power crrc investing per annum 
which the vast majority expensed crrc has national centres 
and overseas markets given that this degree spend some that 
alstom believe that crrc should able maintain its position leading 
manufacturer high speed trains well make progress terms narrowing 
current technology gaps other areas

leading global production base alstom recognized leader transport markets 
and well established international markets the company commands 
share the americas and position europe and position mea

siemens and bombardier there are employees which 
are europe sites countries alstom strategy has been fully localise 
countries outside its core base south africa brazil and india

market and leading positions each market segment demand moves from 
components and individual solutions towards more fully integrated models alstom 
has the broad range offerings already place adapt that change systems 
signalling and services currently account for sales line with vision 
target versus just the systems market within urban rail alone 
forecast grow from unife forecast and 
believe that alstom portfolio well positioned take advantage this market 
shift 
execution history better than peers alstom has long term and consistent track 
record growth and profitability its transport operations which believe 
distinguishes from peers specifically from the average growth rate 
has been slightly ahead the wider market and average ebit 
margin has been alstom peers such siemens and bombardier have seen 
far more volatile profit history recording major one time charges problem 
contracts over time have been impressed alstom consistency its 
transport divisions though this was not always the case power before 
worth mentioning that alstom management was heavily involved the rescue 
the company and this has driven prudent policies since 
technology alstom recognized world leader alstom has managed stay 
the boundary new tech breakthroughs the rail industry over the past few 
years maintaining edge over peers that regard for example the firm 
signed contract have the world first zero emissions trains its coradia ilint

cash conversion 
strategy overview estimate crrc revenue increase 
and that stage international revenues should close 
absolute terms equivalent revenues separately 
crrc vertically integrated number core components and spending 
sales per annum alstom has set clear targets 
part vision for overall growth also investing 
transformation capex over three years localise business breakdown 
alstom clearly intends shift its mix toward higher margin areas and may 
engage acquisitions also 
introduction 
this section take slightly closer look the two companies both qualitative 
and financial metrics see the companies very different stages their respective 
life cycles crrc entrant the international stage but integral part 
broader state driven strategy especially one belt one road alstom emerging from 
period strategic uncertainty while transport has become leading contributor 
recent years that was not always the case and had been partly responsible for the 
cash problems the broader group which resulted the sale the power 
operations 
general comment while taking balanced view think the comparison does tend 
flatter crrc some degree the company domestic expansion has been 
monopoly supplier into state led high speed rail program and all the advantages 
this confers similarly the growth that crrc now recording outside china coming 
from low base moreover the projects are being sponsored china bank asia 
development bank and similar vehicles think not reasonable suggest that 
crrc has any kind technology leadership within the sector and certainly see 
alstom industry leader here that said our analysis shows the scale effect 
means that crrc position play rapid catch crrc will effectively buy 
market share over the coming years our opinion 
crrc alstom business comparison 
product portfolio 
crrc the company has reasonably complete rolling stock product spectrum 
with products covering high speed trains max speed and 
locomotives electric and diesel urban transit trains low speed multiple unit 
trains both electric and diesel passenger wagons and freight wagons the 
monopoly player the chinese market almost all the products have significant 
domestic sales volume and with the exception high speed trains other products 
are also exported into various markets particular the exposure freight allows 
crrc enjoy the reviving china freight transport demand and demand freight 
wagons 
alstom similarly strong including all products discussed above with the exception 
freight wagons addition rolling stock alstom revenue came 
from railway signaling systems both the train and track installed this compares 
crrc which has not yet generated revenue from signaling products though 
through founding the signaling company under its subsidiary times electric crrc 
prepares enter subway signaling market see alstom portfolio rolling 
stock systems signalling and infrastructure more broad based than that 
crrc arguably alstom has much longer term international history both 
technology and safety 
exhibit product portfolios international rail suppliers crrc all product categories

vertical integration and supply chain 
not only rolling stock manufacture and assembly company crrc also supplies 
itself with key parts and components for example through its subsidiaries times 
electric and yongji crrc manufactures its own train traction systems which are 
the train value and are equipped high speed trains locomotives and 
urban transit vehicles crrc also entering into the markets other key 
components such high speed train wheels and bogies 
alstom puts less focus self supply and more low cost suppliers the 
company buying two thirds what its selling according the ceo 
results and has recently signed number contracts with suppliers india 
around one third purchases are now being sourced from low cost countries and 
the firm aims continue expand its global footprint terms sourcing 
strategic considerations

the revenue would represent china global rolling stock

market share expansion from however crrc has set

expansion global footprint some the key international rolling stocks 
suppliers have wide footprints not only marketing administration centers but also 
local factories that answer for local demand for example bombardier 
transportation has offices countries and manufacturing facilities the 
recent years crrc has accelerated the construction overseas factories since 
crrc has built purchased factory argentina south africa and india 
that higher level local production could help improve its chances winning 
local orders 
managing maintain pricing competitiveness overseas contract bidding crrc 
usually bids lower than its competitors for example september the company 
was awarded metro train cars for boston subway crrc bidding price was 
below the runner bidder hyundai rotem the other chicago metro train 
contract awarded crrc march crrc bidding price was lower than

fcf conversion for rolling stock companies varies and can quite volatile for each 
individual company crrc has managed maintain its fcf conversion positive 
domain since the company largest client china railway corporation 
maintained healthy payment pattern and capex has been becoming less significant 
net profit and operating cash flow increased strongly 
alstom free cash flow has been less transparent the recent fcf 
cash conversion was notable improvement reported fcf for 
the group historically but due the power separation not have 
meaningful history for alstom the transport company today management 
had recently stated that the decline fcf conditions the alstom group overall 
from was actually more related transport than power and this was due 
lower downpayments which interesting however management believes that

why crrc matters key part china transition high end 
manufacturing 
china manufacturing industry experiencing transition period 
climbing from the low end the value chain high value added 
manufacturing think rolling stock manufacturing one the 
industries where china has reached global leading position 
technology and product and expect the export rolling 
stock will accelerate significantly the coming years 
the evolution china high speed train industry can seen typical 
example china manufacturing industry upgrade years china highspeed train industry grew from essentially nothing globally competitive level 
following the path import digest redevelopment proprietary technology 
during these stages china continued develop technologies key parts 
systems and the localisation rate high speed trains continued increase 
railway rolling stock china has reached global leading position and exports 
will accelerate 
morgan stanley bluepaper why are bullish china highlighted that china 
manufacturing industry transitioning from low value added high value added and 
domestic companies such huawei and jinko have become non negligible forces their 
focused areas over the last years addition china government has acknowledged 
the importance upgrading the country manufacturing industry and the made 
china plan has set explicit policies that support and expedite the chinese 
manufacturing sector move the global value chain the plan also highlighted ten 
strategic industries support within the manufacturing sector they are 
aerospace equipment 
robotics 
maritime engineering 
new energy vehicles 
electrical power equipment 
new materials 
railway rolling stocks 
agricultural equipment 
medical devices 
information technology 
this list while china remains nascent developing stage sectors such robotics 
and new energy vehicles believe china has already reached global leading position 
railway rolling stocks terms technology and products especially the most 
advanced products such high speed trains and high power locomotives thanks the 
fast growth china rolling stock market crrc now the largest rolling stock 
manufacturer the world with market share also believe crrc 
export into the global rolling stock market will accelerate the coming years and 
estimate its market share the global china market will increase from

import digest redevelopment proprietary technology the growth 
trajectory the rolling stock industry china 
the development high speed trains typical example the evolution the rolling 
stock industry china before china had developed high speed train that could 
run speeds above but the technology was not mature and thus not 
commercialised china high speed train delivery represented global 
demand all manufactured crrc and the company self developed china standard 
multiple unit trains run speeds years china high speed train 
industry grew from essentially nothing globally competitive level and follows the 
path import digest redevelopment proprietary technology during these stages 
china continued develop technologies key parts systems and the localisation rate 
high speed trains continued increase 
import stage localising the train manufacture from matured prototypes 
and china signed contracts with bombardier kawasaki alstom and siemens 
purchased one prototype train set from each the four companies and the four 
companies transferred their design and assembly technology china 
manufacturers based the four prototype train sets china localised the 
production and successfully launched its first generation high speed trains 
and 
digest redevelopment stage internally developed technology train design 
and key system parts technology the first generation trains lagged behind 
key technologies such train body design and production key system and parts 
but china continued develop these and launched the series 
trains these were internally designed and developed with breakthroughs key 
parts systems technologies such bogies pantograph power traction systems 
and signaling systems etc 
proprietary technology and products china standard multiple units csmu the 
new generation the high speed train was launched late the csmu 
equipped with fully proprietary technology and greater localisation parts and 
systems more importantly the csmus will the train prototype for future 
exports 
exhibit china high speed train localisation continues 
increase thanks technology breakthroughs and localisation key 
parts and systems 
source morgan stanley research estimates 
china high power locomotives have also reached global leading position the 
development high power locomotives followed similar path that high speed 
trains from technology imported from siemens alstom and toshiba the 
development proprietary technology and products 
thriving rolling stock industry benefits the parts suppliers and railway 
constructors 
the rise china rolling stock industry and strong demand for high speed trains and 
high power locomotives has lifted the value train parts system suppliers notably 
times electric crsc and hollysys etc addition rolling stock high value add 
product the railway industry chain and the ability supply trains for railway turnkey project highly attractive for countries that want develop their railways system

accelerating demand and slow capacity expansion will result 
higher utilization and support margin expansion for manufacturers 
expect that while the demand rolling stocks will accelerate the following 
years the production capacity among rolling stock manufacturers will largely stay flat 
therefore the utilization for the rolling stock companies set improve given the 
current capacity utilization the manufacturers remain low think rise utilization 
will help support the manufacturer margins improve thanks the effect 
economy scales 
our studies historical experiences from rolling stock companies support our view 
the case trinity industries find the companies operating margins increased 
notably tandem with rising sales volume and higher production utilization the case 
caf the company operating margins declined together with revenue since and 
find that although the change product mix has significant impact margins some 
more sticky expenses such employee salary depreciation and amortization well 
out services all played important role the margin fluctuations 
production capacity rolling stock manufacturers are mild 
overcapacity 
general global rolling stock production facilities are under mild overcapacity the 
average capacity utilization over the last years according our estimates were 
although the utilization varies different product different region factory was 
rare any companies factories are running designed capacity over the last few years 
with exception china when dramatic growth rolling stock demand 
resulted several factories csr and cnr operating with utilization higher than 
over the past few years global rolling stock capacities increased very slowly 
around per year the growth each year was mainly from new factories opened 
key players new regions usually for better chance winning new contract that 
region and was usually with small capacity the slow expansion capacity also line 
with the fact that globally overall the factories are overcapacity 
going forward expect the global capacity continue moderate expansion mainly 
from the multinational giants who are allured regional market potential and plan 
build local factories compete for new contracts have studied the capacity 
expansion schedules key rolling stock companies including alstom bombarider

rate without significant increase capex costs

view both our studied target trinity and caf are highly concentrated rolling stock

market india provides interesting opportunities the country scales and upgrades 
its transport infrastructure adopting technologically better equipped locomotives 
wagons and coaches 
the demand for rolling stock likely driven capital expenditure program 
indian railways including the dedicated freight corridor program ambitious 
metro roll out program and finally high speed rail program 
however the indian government focussed ake india domestic manufacturing and 
discouraging imports the rolling stock segment the opportunity for foreign players

the locomotives opportunity india fleet locomotives has transitioned from 
steam powered locos diesel powered early and incrementally 
the shift towards electric locos aims achieve electrification 
currently replacement demand for locomotives likely the key driver growth 
our view locos demand largely met railway owned factories varanasi dlw and 
chittaranjan clw however government encouraging foreign player participation 
the with few riders has already signed major contracts with 
manufacture diesel locos marhowrah plant contract worth 
per the contract will import locos and manufacture the rest

freight movement across the country presently two corridors are under

finalizing the contract for procuring electric locomotives capacity for 
the western dedicated freight corridor where least locos would

differences pricing for procurement electric locomotives with the japanese

promoting the proprietary metro signaling system while already strong the metro 
signaling system china thanks the with casco crsc has developed its own 
proprietary technology and has been trying penetrate this market order further 
benefit from the robust growing metro network china after successful operating 
track record beijing line crsc has received more orders its proprietary system 
from shanghai xian and chongqing and likely crsc will continue gain market 
share 
more active participation construction contracting supported strong balance

contractings supported its strong balance sheet net cash crsc can 
lead more construction projects through the ppp public private partnership model 
enhance its profitability not only through construction but also promote the sales its 
own systems 
more recurring revenues from system maintenance the signaling and communication 
systems high speed rails need update regularly and the replacement cycle 
hardwares are usually years short than rolling stocks and railway tracks thanks
