rising disposable income key driver for 
box office growth 
china transition high income highlighted our 
blue paper february why are bullish china 
our economists estimate that china will able attain 
high income status expect per capita income 
reach then from currently 
thereby crossing the world bank high income threshold 
our projections the opportunity 
private consumption will almost double size over the 
next decade rising estimated gdp 
from gdp alongside 
the increase aggregate private consumption more 
importantly the composition the consumption pattern 
will continue shift too the consumer getting richer 
older and more tech savvy which will drive more than 
proportionate increase the segments leisure 
entertainment travel and above all healthcare 
rising disposable income key driver for box office growth 
have done case study korea and box office spending 
percentage disposable income was the 
disposable income per capita level the early both similar 
china level increased the 
disposable income per capita level similar our 
economists forecast for china and 
believe the case korea representative because was one the 
only two large economies with population above have 
broken out the middle income trap over the past years and the 
evolution china services share gdp has followed that 
korea most closely exhibit 
tier cities china have already demonstrated path similar 
korea box office accounted for disposable income 
tier cities and tier cities both are line with 
korea the same income levels and demonstrated similar path 
small cities will drive china consumption boom highlighted 
exhibit annual admissions per urban capita tier cities 
our report china transition high income lower tier cities 
followed korea closely along the income curve reaching 
bigger richer more eager spend our economists believe 
while the strong growth tier cities the past three years led 
lower tier cities will bigger wealthier and more eager spend 
ahead korea along the income curve and reached 
taking the lead driving china private consumption growth toward 
exhibit meanwhile believe domestic content contributed 
trillion market lower tier cities are becoming the 
moviegoing the case korea and china and both governments 
key driver china spending boom the next years 
supported their domestic film industry korea box office increased 
accounting for roughly total incremental growth private 
from disposable income when 
consumption with shift the consumption bundle

wanda enjoys early mover advantage securing prime 
locations lower tier cities wanda commercial 
properties among the very few commercial real estate 
developers focusing lower tier cities this believe 
wanda film holding enjoys early mover advantage 
securing prime locations along with expansion wanda 
commercial plaza 
though rapid expansion into lower tier cities likely put pressure 
margins the near term see significant operating leverage 
from box office growth after typical ramp period years 
with high margin advertisement revenue given larger theatre 
network forecast revenue ebitda and normalized net profit 
cagrs and 
imax china ride wanda expansion currently only 
tier and below cities accounted for screens and 
imax screens china are located tier and below cities 
box office for wanda and for the industry 
tier and tier cities imax penetration 
increase from and result wanda screen and 
percentage theaters also lower tier and below cities 
box office market shares tier and below cities have increased 
tier and tier 
from and and 
however note that wanda theatres tier and below 
wanda psa premium the industry tier and below 
cities have imax screens nationwide and imax 
cities also significantly higher than tier cities which 
screens these cities are located wanda theatres 
supports our view higher presence prime locations lower tier 
nationwide this again reflects wanda higher presence prime 
cities 
locations lower tier cities and suggests that imax china will likely 
ride wanda expansion given higher demand for imax screens 
expect wanda box office market share lower tier cities 
prime locations 
increase from expect rapid 
screen expansion both organic via wanda commercial plaza 
but prefer wanda imax china given uncertainties about 
expansion and inorganic via acquisitions smaller regional theatre 
moviegoers behaviour despite the strong partnership with 
operators thus expect cagr for wanda box office 
wanda believe imax china performance lower tier cities 
tier and below cities for the industry from 
depends moviegoers preference for hollywood films and imax 
total box office total box 
experience brand which could different among different tier 
office its box office market share tier and below cities 
cities 
should increase from 
specifically hollywood films contributed box office 
assuming modest and market share gains tier and 
for imax china for the industry they could 
tier cities this should drive total box office cagr 
less popular relative domestic films lower tier cities 
for the industry from 
view cultural language issues although not have 
with total box office market share increasing from 
such evidence 
management long term target 
moreover imax china commands premium ticket price
