only while margin experienced

petrochemicals together with power electrical machinery 
enjoy chemicals margin improvement and therefore raise our

sinopec aggressively promoting its non fuel business

what high income status means for refinery demand expect 
caltex mix fuel sales has changed considerably over the past 
china auto consumption remain resilient which could further 
years premium petrol represented total petrol sales 
raise the auto population units with cagr 
for caltex while premium diesel sales represented total diesel 
and cagr from the back solid 
sales since regular unleaded sales have gradually declined 
demand growth expect china refinery demand remain 
while premium petrol sales have grown today premium petrol 
resilient until and therefore raise our refining segment target 
represents around total caltex petrol sales australia 
from consequently raise our refining fair value 
think sinopec also has potential capture the premium sales 
estimates accounting for our sotp 
opportunity amid china industry reform 
intrinsic value exhibit 
combining both the growth potential the non fuel and fuel 
marketing reform set capture the high income opportunity 
businesses raise our marketing earnings estimates and lift 
more effectively besides refining believe sinopec marketing 
the intrinsic value estimates net minority 
business will also become key beneficiary china high income 
interest representing our sotp intrinsic value 
thesis thanks the marketing reforms launched believe 
sinopec will aggressively promote its non fuel business which could 
chemicals demand could also surprise the upside with our 
introduce top and bottom line growth 
high income assumptions expect china chemicals demand 
migrate from low end high end after expanding chemicals 
besides this apply caltex benchmark for sinopec fuel 
capacity sinopec has already changed its 
business and believe the market missing sinopec premium sales 
strategy from scale quality and return result believe 
potential most investors are not aware this opportunity our 
the company will invest more upgrade itself from low high end 
view given china product oil market regulated however the 
chemical production our case study basf suggests the low end 
oil gas industry reform guidance issued may more details 
products sales contribution for basf declined from 
the chinese government has put product oil market deregulation 
only while the high end product has margin 
key task the next years which could give sinopec flexibility 
advantages low end products expect sinopec experience 
charge premium its high quality product highlighted 
similar mix upgrade and therefore raise our chemicals intrinsic value

result all sinopec refineries were able supply product

good opportunity learn from basf regarding the best practice 
the chemicals industry our view given sinopec has already

return profit focused believe the market oriented reform will

return and performance this could accelerate margin improvement 
some sinopec commodity chemicals products are selling

issues such gap mainly due operations management rather
