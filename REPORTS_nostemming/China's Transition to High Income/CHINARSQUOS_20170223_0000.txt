luxury segment expected the outperformer are more sanguine than 
most growth prospects for the luxury segment believe long term luxury car 
sales will supported low luxury penetration and growing population wealthy 
customers upgrade and replacement demand also bodes well for luxury brands that 
are introducing economy models that can reach broader addressable market many 
market participants are concerned that restrictive policies including strict limits 
license plate issuance may major headwind luxury car sales however think 
these policies will actually shift purchases towards luxury models 
our china blue paper report published feb china why are bullish china 
feb estimate that china will able attain high income status 
expect per capita incomes reach then from 
currently thereby crossing the high income threshold china will 
therefore have broken out the middle income trap and joined the rarefied ranks 
high income society indeed the attainment high income status will the key 
defining moment china economic development over the next decade

catalysts sales ramp its new series regain market share from mercedes eclass narrowing discounting level retail side due strong demand new 
models stronger than expected bmw sales bmw china gave extra sales

believe the key risks include weaker than expected sales its new models 
launched this year due intense competition from bmw major competitor 
mercedes and audi and lower than expected sales volume mainly due 
transition between old series and new series
