despite low utilization rates these loss making airports current

higher cost cost pressures are evidenced investment mainte 
proper upgrade maintenance and operation the quality both 
nance and operation infrastructure facilities china under strict 
assets and services our view could deteriorate significantly 
pricing regulations profitability and return profiles are falling which 
believe that introducing market mechanism through pricing dereg 
could potentially lead deteriorating overall service quality was

experienced the prior the reform

development china railway industry which has been 
losing competitiveness versus other modes transportation highways airlines while the passenger ticket 
price has remained fixed regulation tariffs for rail freight 
were hiked several times between and exhibit 
which still could hardly offset sustained losses from 
the passenger side given declining market share weak

airports are generally under economic regulation developed countries with different types regulatory action 
reflecting differences market characteristics basically 
there are four types airport regulation price cap revenue cap rate return and cost service exhibit 
addition there option implement light regulation 
involving only price monitoring the purpose airport regulation prevent airports from charging excessive tariffs 
the civil aviation authority caa pricing formula which 
retail price index the value currently fixed the 
formula designed ensure that airports achieve return 
broadly line with their cost capital allowing for reasonable 
amount profit 
the other hand cost service regulation can applied with 
without allowed rate return while allows airports cover 
costs and keep prices low this type regulation provides little 
incentive improve efficiency 
common type airport regulation applied many european countries price cap regulation which incorporates single till approach 
price monitoring based criteria set the monitoring agency 
this involves the regulator setting maximum price per unit usually 
however this may not sufficiently control prices threat regula 
based passenger numbers taking heathrow example the

airport tariff regulation china lack transparency

although airport fee pricing china subject stringent govern 
changed this has remained unchanged since despite

increase costs for airports over the same period 
the country airports under fixed tariff regulation china airport 
operators not have the flexibility raise cut tariffs meet the 
that said think the current regulatory regime governing china 
demands different carriers 
airports still favor equity investors chinese airports are 
allowed keep all the excess return above their cost capital 
moreover the pricing mechanism provides visibility when 
wacc while most publicly traded airport operators other coun 
regulatory reviews will made how pricing might adjusted 
tries are subject stringent returns capital targets looking for 
the future the current tariff guideline was issued the civil avia

strong balance sheet

shanghai international airport leases the land for its runways 
airport has not been permitted apply operate any new extra

charter flights from may march 
the rental fees that siac pays for the land and assets are significant 
paid accounting for revenue and 
budget overruns for both opex and capex 
net profit more importantly the rental fee set annual 
basis fostering low visibility 
although the company confirmed its latest budget for the new
