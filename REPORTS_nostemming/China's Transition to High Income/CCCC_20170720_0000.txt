views 
market view the growth the global economy will remain slow and obor impact will limited the 
overseas contribution still limited for cccc addition receivables and cash flow remain concerns 
our take expect cccc overseas earnings increase cagr and its contribution 
percentage total earnings rise from addition cccc overseas business 
model generates better cash flow than the domestic business and the operating risk much lower than the 
market thinks 
can cccc overseas business 
become major growth driver 
market view cccc operating cash flow will remain weak and capex will remain high given the ppp project 
pipeline therefore leverage will continue increase 
our take yes expect cccc net gearing improve from year end year end and 
the company taking steps revitalize its balance sheet 
can cccc control its capex and 
improve cash flow with lot

market view cccc overseas business could slow and its 
overall chinese companies will maintain fast growth 
earnings contribution the whole company limited high 
overseas markets thanks significant development 
profitability not sustainable and cash flow may deteriorate 
potential developing countries chinese companies clear 
overseas business has much higher uncertainties than domestic 
competitive strengths and rising financial support from the 
business 
chinese government 
cccc will become key beneficiary the expanding 
our take yes overseas business already contributed 
overseas market cccc has built strong franchise and 
cccc new contract value and its net profit 
consolidated platforms for its overseas business 
expect this segment maintain fast growth the next two years 
believe its longer experience and stronger execution capacity 
and its contribution the whole company should continue 
overseas will help cccc maintain higher margin and 
increase our confidence supported 
less risk comparison with peers

constructors usually need provide funding overseas projects 
subsidiaries and the whole company 
never require cccc provide funding directly external funding 
required usually provided banks therefore the higher 
contribution from overseas projects will help improve cccc cash

key debate can cccc control its high 
net gearing despite investments still 
required for bot projects 
market view cccc still needs high amount investment for 
its bot projects and newly signed ppp projects over the next three 
cccc leverage has reached high level 
years cccc capex will remain high weigh cash flow and 
increase debt leverage 
cccc debt asset ratio defined total liability total asset 
reached end close the cap set the 
our take yes expect cccc capex for bot projects begin 
state owned assets supervision and administration commission 
moderate starting the company has been introducing private 
the state council sasac and the company net gearing ratio 
investors its investment projects offset funding pressure and 
end also higher than that its large peers 
has started securitize some its bot projects this will help 
think cccc disadvantage capital structure mainly attributable 
cccc continue win bot ppp new construction without increasing 
two factors

less money raised from equity financing

the projects not being consolidated the balance sheet are 
arising from such projects will not consolidated and will not 
further pressure cccc balance sheet despite this key investor 
into such projects cccc can still win the related construction 
contracts and book revenue and profit the construction process 
expect cccc continue leverage the non controlling share 
model and continue disciplined participating investment

cccc new contracts investment projects will stay

pressure and could lower its net gearing 
those which cccc joined consortiums which others are also

securitization expressway assets could revitalize

according management cccc will continue seek more 
opportunities securitize its expressway assets the company plans 
securitize expressway assets with net asset value more than 
discussed previously cccc concession rights level its 
assuming that cccc can complete its 
balance sheet now high rising rapidly because 
target sell expressway net asset value could lower 
cccc participation bot expressway projects the concession 
debt assuming equity investment the project 
rights continued increase the past and are freezing cccc 
which normal equity asset ratio the bot model this 
balance sheet while also contributing operating losses many 
indicates that cccc total debt could lower and net gearing 
the expressways are still losing money however cccc has started 
could decrease from based financials 
tackle the rising pressure from concession rights its balance 
sheet and think the expressways profitability will not deteriorate 
securitization could mitigate the pressure operating losses 
further noted below 
from newly completed expressways the end cccc had 
consolidated bot expressway assets under operation with total 
cccc revitalizing its assets selling the concession rights 
revenue and estimate that these projects 
expressways november cccc sold its four 
generated operating losses for cccc while cccc has 
expressways social capital investors thereby removing the 
steady flow new bot expressway completions slated for 
concession assets and debts associated with the construction the 
which are likely generate additional operating losses 
four expressways from the balance sheet although the net asset 
think that selectively securitizing some the expressways the 
value the four expressways was only the transaction 
pressure from the additional losses can mitigated for example 
helped remove debt from cccc balance sheet 
the securitization four expressway assets not only was 
total operating loss removed but the transaction 
also generated disposal gain

expressway asset profitability has more upside 
have yet all connected think that for these expressways 
their traffic and toll revenue could increase significantly once the 
cccc has many expressway assets located mid and west china 
entire arterial ways are connected example such expressways 
and the profitability these roads usually low negative 
the yinchuan baise expressway 
suffering from both low traffic and short operational histories while 
many investors are concerned that cccc loss from bot assets 
the yinchuan baise expressway connects ningxia province 
could expand think the profitability has some upside because 
northwest china and guangxi province southwest china 
currently cccc operating some lines chongqing and guizhou 
profitability existing expressways could improve more 
independent lines are connected arterial lines 
further securitization could mitigate the pressure 
operating losses from newly completed expressways 
provinces that are cut off some sections shaanxi chongqing 
and guangxi are not yet completed expect that once these 
sections are completed scheduled for the line from shaanxi 
guangxi will connected and become one the key 
expressways that links north and south china 
profitability existing expressway assets could benefit from 
the connection expressway sections into arterial lines the 
consolidated bot expressways under cccc operation some are 
sections that belong interprovincial arterial expressway lines that
