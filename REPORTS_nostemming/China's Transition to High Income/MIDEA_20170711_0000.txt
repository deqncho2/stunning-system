upside from bigger share the home appliance 
market china and market globally 
see three key thematics discussed our blue paper february why 
are bullish china that will help drive midea mid long term growth 
accelerating trade ups these prompt stronger new demand and shorten 
replacement cycles for home appliances thus they reduce the cyclical elements 
large appliance demand and boost demand for small appliances expect 
home appliance demand grow cagr and the small 
appliance share increase from 
moving down the lower tier markets higher income and faster population 
growth the lower tier cities and expanding online channels will make these 
markets important expect lower tier markets account for total 
annual white goods demand during 
going global and going smart transforming from oem original equipment 
manufacturing odm design and obm brand the key way for chinese 
appliance makers take share overseas automation another global trend and 
china the largest market for robots big driver behind and set grow

accelerating trade cycle home appliances highlighted our blue paper 
february why are bullish china our economists estimate that china will 
able attain high income status the consumer getting richer and demanding 
lifestyle enhancements this becomes increasing driver for home appliances with 
product upgrades the key trend against this backdrop product leadership midea key 
strategy focusing better functionality and higher asps capture the trade trend 
and gain market share the high end market midea has invested 
the last five years equivalent sales focusing core technology with 
consumer oriented and distinctive product features see room for midea price 
for example its white goods rsp still lower than those industry leaders its 
air conditioning rsp gap versus gree per unit the past two 
years the company also introducing new high end brands into the china market such aeg high end kitchen appliance brand europe china high end retail 
market and real estate developers addition like midea large exposure the 
small appliance market which will grow faster than the large appliance market driven 
consumption upgrades and shorter life cycles expect small appliance sales 
grow cagr versus midea home appliance business and its 
gross margin outgrow and reach 
significant opportunities lower tier area china highlighted our report china 
transition high income lower tier cities bigger richer more eager spend 
lower tier cities are set become the key driver china spending boom the next 
decade accounting for total incremental growth private consumption 
with shift the consumption bundle from staple goods services 
including household goods believe penetration increase lower tier areas will 
become the key driver for new demand growth for home appliances our industry 
model predicts over the new demand will from tier and below markets 
total units aggregated estimate sales from lower tier areas 
accounts for over midea sales right now with strong brand positioning midea 
aims open total full category stores with one store each prefecture city 
leveraging its advantage with diversified portfolio and had stores already 
opened the end

short term drivers 
identify two key stock moving factors the near term the impact sales from property 
controlling measures various cities and midea production and channel management and midea 
margin trend given the hit margins from commodity price pressure 
our view expect demand will stay relatively stable level with solid replacement 
demand and new demand estimate new demand units and units from 
the installation for new flats sold versus units the impact from property 
controlling measures from could mute the new demand growth likely but believe this will 
not disrupt demand midea made order business model has resulted temporary shortage some 
channels with strong demand the current peak season but the company has worked improving the 
supply chain estimate the impact the shortage insignificant and expect the new model raise 
operational efficiency the longer term helping the company solidify its market position and market share 
gains and beyond expect margins rise from price hikes and the easing commodity 
costs start have bigger effect 
domestic sales leaner inventory and market consolidation help 
counter potential cyclical impact 
midea benefit from lean channel inventory estimate midea sales grow 
driven growth volume versus industry growth and growth 
asp midea had installation card growth over january april suggesting 
robust retail growth currently midea channel inventory units very 
healthy level compared with historical levels 
industry wise saw decline the level channel inventory about 
units from and expect drop further about driven 
recovery retail demand and efforts leading companies such gree and midea 
reduce channel inventory think the market participants the market have 
become more rational mainly because distributors are more cautious about taking 
inventory now after the record high channel inventory gree the leading 
player the market has also been more prudent managing its channel inventory 
midea has adopted made order business model for since last year 
improve inventory turnover 
the demand side expect total demand around units with 
household demand units growth replacement demand and still solid 
demand from new property sales our analysis showed seven month lag 
retail demand residential floor space sold due property developers pre sales 
practices please refer our foundation report floor space sales grew januarymay expect new demand generated from the installation new 
flats sold early continue grow over yoy property sales growth 
starts slow and replacement demand rolled from the demand years ago 
will also slow down versus expect total demand units with 
household demand units 
however not expect the potential minor decline demand lead exfactory shipment decline for midea with the consideration much leaner industry 
and company channel inventory and market share growth potential 
especially the lower tier markets project unit growth for midea 
versus expect the price hike and mix upgrade drive better 
sales value growth 
some may appear concerned about near term market share loss residential 
caused temporary supply shortages some channels during the current peak season 
due midea made order business model however think any such 
concerns are unjustified for three reasons online sales residential are 
ytd indicating midea fast expansion online channels estimate the 
impact insignificant only part the offline channels are going through the 
model transition and the total offline residential accounts for total 
sales and less than midea total sales the company has improved the 
efficiency its supply chain which good for the long term expect the new model 
benefit operational efficiency the longer term which would help the company 
solidify its market position and market share gains and beyond

total market distribution capability midea has good coverage both 
offline and online channels midea distributors operate over single category

midea can leverage its online channel lift sales and margins 
online accounted for about midea china sales with growth the 
company aims grow online china sales online sales grew 
with higher growth from 
online channel continues gain share avc expects online penetration rise from for white goods sales value small appliances online 
penetration much higher than that for large appliances over 
currently online retail asps are still significant discount offline asps but they are 
upward trend due the mix upgrade for details please refer our foundation 
report midea fast mover the online channel and has higher online sales 
contribution than other major players expect midea achieve online sales growth 
over outpacing market growth about thanks its stronger 
exposure the online channel especially for white goods which have more room for 
penetration 
margins from online sales still higher than offline despite different product mix 
leading lower asp the gross margin midea online sales was higher than 
offline gross margins recent years with similar opex ratio the higher online gross 
margin comes from fewer layers distributors the online channel the company 
directly sells online platforms the weaker bargaining power online platforms 
than offline home appliance retailers given the current smaller scale and different 
product mix online sales are small appliances and the second largest 
category air conditioners which have higher domestic gross margin than washing 
machines and refrigerators think higher growth the online channel will continue 
benefit overall margins the medium term 
however think the margin premium will weaken the long term the online 
platforms are gaining bargaining power they have become the largest channel with 
share about surpassing mega home appliance retail chains like suning 
and gome

global expansion 
going global one the key strategic focuses midea right now excluding kuka 
the overseas market accounts for about midea home appliance revenue 
which the toshiba business accounts for about and the rest mainly midea own 
exports with the consolidation kuka and the toshiba business midea expects the 
overseas business contribute half group sales like midea diversified 
global strategy that covers not only exports home appliances but also branded 
localized operations and expansion into new industries and markets 
expect the export business grow annually midea the 
largest exporter white goods china with the leading market share volume all 
three categories acs washing machines and refrigerators exhibit currently oem 
odm and obm each account for one third midea overseas business with 
oem odm focusing big clients developed markets such north america and 
europe and obm original brand manufacturer focusing developing markets odm 
has higher margins than oem and obm mid low single digits think export 
margins have room trend midea trying expand odm orders and also 
improve margins through product upgrades the oem business for the overall export 
business the operating margin lower than domestic sales due lower opex 
the gross margin about lower far this year domestic sales have outgrown 
exports which will benefit margins 
long term potential from obm and localized overseas operations though currently 
still small for obm midea focuses selling developing markets through local 
distributors with mid end brand positioning although the profit contribution from 
obm small currently the operation helps build brand awareness midea 
overseas which will create long term strategic market position for midea addition 
midea has local operations india latin america and europe although the size still

toshiba has strong brand recognition southeast asia and the 
middle east which valuable for midea expand local

help revenue growth and operational leverage the medium 
term

out for potential opportunities both developing and

twin smart long term driver 
our view smart manufacturing and smart homes twin smart are part midea group long term strategy 
although the visibility twin smart still low this point think midea headed the right strategic 
direction 
smart manufacturing think midea acquisition kuka milestone and significant advance its 
development the automation market china and globally with good track record and business 
integration are positive about midea plan hasten kuka penetration the china market addition 
expect the automation midea production lines bring margin upside the long run 
smart homes think midea strategy focusing smart hardware will give strong foothold the 
smart home ecosystem the long run 
smart manufacturing automation and robotics 
from midea invested anhui efort taking stake set jvs with 
yaskawa and acquired stake kuka improve intelligent manufacturing 
capabilities and fully explore the robotics market china various areas 
china industrial robotics and automation market has vast potential 
the international federation robotics ifr projects annual sales grow cagr 
from units units outpacing the global sales 
cagr estimates that the global supply industrial robots will 
china like kuka advantages terms having more advanced technology 
and market influence well established global brand however kuka has been 
slower than its global peers the china market abb and yaskawa entered china the 
and have more production bases there think kuka will have better 
penetration the china market leveraging midea local resources and expertise 
kuka also well positioned automation for hospitals and logistics warehouses 
through its subsidiary swisslog midea sees potential for the automation its large 
logistics operations and great opportunity the vast addressable china logistics 
market according ifr chinese warehouse automation spending expected reach 
with cagr 
addition midea owns stake the industrial robots and stake the 
service robots with yaskawa the jvs are mainly operated yaskawa and focus 
developing products that are differentiated from kuka 
kuka fast development china business supported midea 
the customer bases china for kuka mainly focus the automotive industry and 
nearly local players compete this area robotics the core business china while 
system and swisslog are ramping the managements midea and kuka have set 
target doubling kuka china sales five years and raising the ebit 
margin the china business currently kuka has over share china 
industrial robotics market expect kuka ramp china more rapidly the

smart homes 
smart homes have vast potential but won immediate boost 
although think the smart home market will not reach point significantly high 
growth the next few years see major trend over the long run haven 
yet seen established smart ecosystem that can achieve home automation currently 
the industry mainly driven single low level smart products with simple and low 
value added functions such smart controls wifi connectivity and touch panels 
believe that the internet things requires open platform that connects 
different participants with one another also requires standardized networking 
protocol for devices communicate with each another however haven seen 
standardized open platform established for smart home ecosystem that integrates all 
parties software and hardware think the central role running platform and 
setting network protocol will influential tech giants such apple google and 
batx baidu alibaba tencent xiaomi 
implications think hardware will the key strength that allows home appliance 
manufacturers participate the smart home trend prefer players with strong 
product lines and quality have not factored upside our current base case given 
the small size the business and midea plan focus smart appliance 
manufacturing and quick changes the market however reckon midea should 
relevant player smart home demand takes off 
midea strength lies hardware 
compared other home appliance players midea advantage its diversified product 
portfolio think midea strength hardware products currently offers over 
smart product categories the current stage the company strategy focus 
product innovation and providing smart products with high quality rather than 
developing integrated smart home system think the strategy will give good 
foothold the smart home market over the long run terms ecosystem midea 
also collaborating with xiaomi baba and tencent apple protocol matching

business and marketing capability midea can rapidly develop products with new 
functions cater customers and also leverage its brand awareness and marketing 
expertise distribution capability midea has good coverage both offline and online 
channels usually launches new products the online channel first gain attention 
and then penetrate offline channel midea distributors operate over singlecategory stores nationwide and midea aims open total full category 
stores the next few years with one store each prefecture city stores the 
end with increasing online penetration offline stores are still critical for 
experience and service well customer education especially for large 
appliances channel checks with midea distributors showed positive feedback 
midea channel policy expect midea leverage its scale and group resources
