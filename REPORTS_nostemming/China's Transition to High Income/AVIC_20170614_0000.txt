strategically focusing large aircraft manufacturing however really catch with the

key investment debates 
debate what makes china new large 
aircraft project realistic 
the large order book reflects strong government support 
the government can mandate major domestic airlines and aircraft 
leasing companies add their future fleet believe full 
government support with abundant financial resources 
market view when assessing china large aircraft plan market 
necessary but not sufficient condition for the success the industry 
participants can quick cite gaps technologies operating scale 
china financial strengths have made dramatic strides over the past 
management capability marketing and after sales support 
years with real gdp adjusted for gdp deflator being 
times that when the china old prototype large 
our view while acknowledge such challenges concrete 
aircraft was first launched with chairman xi clear message about 
order book our view serves solid foundation support the 
promoting china aviation industry the government has committed 
potential for success may when the made its 
full support both financially and politically fact recent successful 
maiden flight received orders for aircraft exhibit 
launches the large military transporter avic aircraft 
reflecting strong support from the chinese government which 
and the seat commercial jet provide solid evidence 
eager see this industry blossom this order level compares with 
china much improved large aircraft manufacturing capability 
only for airbus during its maiden flight and 
which think should help bolster success 
for before its launch 
where could wrong further delays led technological 
our rationale despite large gaps expertise behind that the 
difficulties the test flight was originally scheduled for 
europe and russia china one the few countries with 
but was completed may three years behind the original 
manufacturing capabilities for large aircraft early china 
schedule complicated technological issues limit visibility the 
successfully launched the maiden flight the seat large 
date future mass production 
aircraft exhibit only six years after airbus launched its first 
years after boeing and years after 
challenges obtaining international airworthiness certifications 
boeing launch its the best selling commercial jet aircraft 
besides technological issues not exclude possible 
aviation history although the project was eventually aborted 
protectionism and politically oriented challenges that could lead 
because financial and political issues did demonstrate china 
unfavorable assessments rejections regulatory authorities 
capability designing and producing large aircraft indigenously 
the federal aviation authority faa the 
technological advancement makes possible for latecomers 
difficulty market acceptance while the order size has 
ramp good example airbus launch its 
reached the future success the could jeopardized 
years after boeing launch the end the 
passengers potential psychological concerns about safety given

boeing benefitted from government support well ranked 
among corporations the value wartime production 
small revenue scale with limited product range 
contracts during world war building large number and 
bombers 
consequence small order size and limited production range 
avic aircraft revenues amounted only and 
exposure large home market demand 
boeing and airbus levels respectively believe the key reason 
for the relatively small revenue scale arises from weak exposures 
with strong aviation demand growth china has become the world 
the civilian commercial aircraft market and the export market sales 
second largest aviation market with passengers carried 
civilian commercial planes contributed only avic 
based forecasts airbus boeing and comac china will

need over commercial jets the next years implying 
exhibit furthermore due limited global exposure export 
substantial market opportunities what makes china case more 
sales accounted for only avic aircraft revenues for 
uncommon that the country government controls the majority 
boeing and for airbus exhibit see potential

despite avic aircraft listing status its soe nature with relatively

lack efficiency and low incentives for the management team

result revenues per employee were only

avic aircraft global peers 
globally aircraft manufacturing highly concentrated 
industry because the high entry barriers mainly led 
complex technologies and high capital requirements 
moreover the manufacturing capabilities marketing and 
aftersales support and government regulations are all key 
factors that deter new entrants for fixed wing commercial 
aircraft particular the global market dominated 
boeing and airbus europe despite the existence 
smaller players bombardier canada embraer brazil 
and uac russia 
chinese manufacturers has led much lower asset turnover and 
although china one the few countries capable building large 
for balance sheet avic aircraft net cash position the 
aircraft has not yet been able launch any commercial products 
higher gearing ratios its global peers with average level 
large quantities taking the and examples their total 
exhibit implying less leverage effect therefore avic 
deliveries reached and june and september 
aircraft roe remains lower than that its peers 
respectively implying average annual production and 
average exhibit particular believe that boeing 
units since their launches and for china expect 
abnormally high roe was largely because aggressive share 
future deliveries the could total combined over the 
buybacks and generous dividend payouts that have depressed the 
next years overall avic aircraft revenues were only 
equity line 
operating efficiencies versus that global peers exhibit 
profit margins avic aircraft margin not significantly 
different from the peers excluding boeing which has higher margin 
because its program accounting spread out costs over 
longer period for avic aircraft the lower margin 
should largely attributable the existing cost plus pricing 
mechanism for government military orders that account for over 
the sales
