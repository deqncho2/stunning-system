china anti extravaganza campaign caused sharp contraction cognac 
and scotch volumes and with premium baijiu however recent positive uptick 
sales data for both western style spirits wss and baijiu could mean have 
reached inflection point theory underpinned china rising private 
consumption and increasing gdp per capita highlighted our economists 
recent blue paper our analysis and our alphawise survey suggests cognac and 
scotch appeal remains strong with consumers argue the improvement 
cognac and scotch sales sustainable for reasons 
expect wss share increase from currently low levels supported improving 
gdp per capita after its year decline wss sales growth appears picking 
rising private consumption and increasing gdp per capita should sustain 
shift toward premium products and the wss category small indicating scope 
for share gains from baijiu estimate the wss profit pool and our 
analysis suggests could increase almost cognac accounts 
for more than wss profits smaller than baijiu estimate this 
implies meaningful upside which should benefit china exposed pernod and 
lesser extent diageo 
pricing power reappearing inventory scarcity supportive 
the government anti graft campaign saw particular pressure the higher end 
scotch and cognac the market has now based and premium baijiu prices are 
increasing again expect price mix for wss similarly gain momentum 
considering the limited number competitors all facing the same inventory 
constraints and limited supply are optimistic about positive price mix 
brand perception study indicates strong brand appeal 
our alphawise survey cognac and scotch drinkers had positive indicators 
regarding future consumption hennessy outperformed peers brand 
awareness and perception indicators and most closely associated with 
occasions offering the most upside survey results were also surprisingly bullish 
for scotch which has lagged the recent recovery cognac nearly 
respondents expect increase consumption scotch the coming year with 
more positive skew the higher qualities 
what this means for our stocks believe china offers sustainable and 
profitable growth uplift for our overweight rated names lvmh and diageo 
raise our bull case target for pernod but remain equal weight

key insights 
what new 
have materially changed our view the western style spirits wss market 
china after painful period market rebasing due anti graft measures 
the data starting improve concert with rising private consumption 
china and morgan stanley view that incomes will increase per capita 
believe this signals meaningful inflection point rather than false dawn 
this report add valuable new analysis 
detailed profit pool for wss china which leverages insight from our 
european and asian beverages analysts 
alphawise survey spirits drinkers china the findings which support 
our conclusions about improving trends and strong brand equity driving 
sustainable growth the wss china 
our new analysis wss china integrates our economists out consensus 
view that china will reach high income status published their recent 
blue paper why are bullish china 
where stand versus consensus 
the sell side has not yet adjusted fully reflect sustained improvement 
china spirits our view and consensus remains cautious about whether topline 
growth for wss indeed sustainable however recent data china has turned 
more positive and comments from corporates highlight improving depletion 
trends addition our economists their blue paper why are bullish 
china introduce their out consensus view that china will successfully 
transition high income status process that could extremely supportive 
for spirits producers premiumisation drives consumers into wss leading 
sustained improvement building this introduce new evidence from our 
alphawise survey which indicates the recent recovery sustainable our survey 
shows that consumers appear more willing purchase wss higher price 
point and suggests that brand equity strong this different consensus 
which holds the view that brand equity for wss china has been partially 
eroded the last few years reassuring alphawise survey results conjunction 
with the view from our economists give confidence our out consensus 
view that the recent uptick wss china sustainable 
also highlight the following reports the china alcoholic beverages market 
from our global colleagues chinese spirits there more left this bottle and 
treasury wine estates only getting better with age 
what could this mean for valuation and earnings 
diageo overweight since diageo has less exposure china than pernod the 
overall impact from improving china would slightly more muted for group 
earnings however scotch growth china incremental mix and group 
margin improving momentum china therefore additional driver 
diageo sustainably improving margin expansion which key part our 
overweight thesis diageo also benefits indirectly from mo hennessy 
strong growth china since owns 
pernod equal weight between china accounted for 
organic ebit growth for pernod not expect return the heady growth 
rates but material improvement china increases our top line 
organic growth forecasts and adds our eps higher organic 
ebit growth would also justify rating our opinion our equal weight 
rating reflects concerns absolut vodka the indicated the latest 
nielsen and nabca data 
lvmh overweight the cognac spirits division relatively small within the 
group accounting for ebit however the fastest growth segment 
whilst sales forecasts remain broadly unchanged reflecting supply 
constraints using new alphawise data and benchmarking the local business 
against the beverage peers raise our cognac ebit and 
with more favourable mix benefits from china the context the group 
lvmh has the most favourable exposure the region whilst revenues 
come from asia japan this rises nearer estimate when looking 
total revenue exposure chinese nationals driven louis vuitton see our 
note published today much more overweight 
what the upside potential for cognac scotch from china 
the scale the china spirits market enormous and cognac and scotch still only 
account for very small percentage the total market estimate china total 
spirits profit pool worth per year which more than the four european spirits 
ebit accumulated using proprietary data estimate that wss accounts for 
volume and the total chinese profit pool smaller than baijiu within baijiu the 
majority volumes are mainstream and below but the premiumisation trend strong 
accordingly expect the wss profit pool estimated currently grow 
over reaching driven premiumisation and share gains this 
would equivalent the china spirits profit pool all else being equal 
our economists believe that china will shift towards consumption oriented economy 
accelerated pace over the next decade with private consumption expected rise 
gdp from currently boston consulting group bcg estimates 
suggest that upper middle class chinese consumers aged and younger spend 
more average than the older generations with similar incomes which positive for 
premium spirits please see our economics team february blue paper why are

what the brand perception for cognac and scotch whiskey 
our alphawise survey highlighted some interesting trends brand awareness china 
firstly cognac brands average scored better terms brand awareness than 
scotch whiskey this unsurprising given that cognac has greater volume share 
higher marketing spend and therefore greater mind share within the cognac category 
remy martin and hennessy showed the strongest brand awareness china according 
our alphawise survey surprisingly our survey results also indicated that courvoisier 
has stronger brand awareness than thought even touch higher than martell 
courvoisier was likely helped the launch gala and recent investments 
behind the brand within scotch whiskey chivas regal shows the strongest brand 
awareness

strong brand equity

brand equity strong and demand picks this should significantly benefit 
hennessy the medium long term believe super premium champagne such

benefit from the market picking however pernod performance has not been

exploring the bull case change our bull case assumption pernod assuming china 
could grow low double digit again driven cognac and scotch raise our bull case 
price target from china recovers and pernod maintains its share against 
hennessy and remy would expect pernod group ebit growth reach the

contraction volume and negative price mix this was not phenomenon specific 
wss other luxury goods china were also impacted the most recent data and

what the upside potential for western style spirits 
upside for western style spirits lies with taking volume share from chinese spirits and 
premiumisation strong population growth and increasing per capita consumption drove 
material and consistent growth the volume alcohol consumed china which 
benefited baijiu producers and wss alike however not expect those same 
drivers sustain further volume growth firstly population growth expected slow 
data from the imf shows that the expected population cagr between will 
compared the last years per capita consumption pure 
alcohol has been rising trajectory but expect this plateau china per 
capita consumption now relatively high compared other countries the region 
believe the key drivers for wss china the medium term will therefore share 
gains for wss from national spirits and beer and premiumisation underpinned

survey see alphawise survey underpins our positive view china spirits for more

higher rather than lower price points this suggests positive price mix moving

alphawise survey methodology 
the fieldwork for these surveys was carried out october and november for the 
cross category analysis results were based online responses which were 
conducted with chinese consumers from tier cities the respondents must have 
consumed wine cognac scotch whiskey baijiu least once the last months 
qualify for the survey for the specific categories cognac and scotch whiskey fewer 
respondents qualified take part the survey due not having consumed cognac 
scotch whiskey the last months there were respondents for the cognac 
survey and responses the whisk survey the majority respondents for 
both cognac and scotch whiskey were male and for cognac and 
scotch whiskey respectively

what impact does age have consumption and spending 
the results our alphawise survey highlight couple interesting points regarding 
consumption scotch whiskey and cognac and age the data shows that for both 
categories the frequency consumption falls with age however the average price 
point generally rises with age although the exception this for scotch which 
supports the intuitive conclusion that consumers tend premiumise they get older 
would also point out that whilst the average price point rises with age this partly 
driven switch from cheaper mid price items particularly the age bracket 
relation what this means for the chinese spirits market would highlight china

strong positive skew when asked how they expect their spending cognac change 
next year respondents indicated that they would spend more the coming

about value growing ahead volume the jury still out the outlook for price mix

consumers and the prestige end the business drove growth china the future will

respondents indictate that they expect purchase more cognac higher price points 
than lower price points which suggests positive price mix 
highlight with interest that the positive skew those expect buy more minus less 
cognac next year gets larger higher price points this indicates stronger underlying 
trends for more premium variants which should support price mix growth interestingly 
this observation true for both self use and gifting this evidence higher propensity 
buy cognac higher price point conjunction with our economists view 
growing middle class disposable income supports our view that price mix will 
sustainably improve putting the alphawise results the context inventory 
constraints and limited supply are optimistic about positive price mix

broad based across all tiers city 
overall respondents expect spend more scotch the coming year 
compared just who expect spend less this similar overall positive skew 
cognac however the distribution those expecting spend more more evenly 
spread between tier cities which indicates more broad based recovery
