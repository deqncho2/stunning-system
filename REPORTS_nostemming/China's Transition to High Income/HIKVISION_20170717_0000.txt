conclusion 
estimate adopting related applications china 
china the global leader security industry development

mainly thanks demand from the government security industry 
estimate that addressable market expansion will take place 
development globally typically slower than china where 
mainly within the solution market while keep our estimate for 
government demand high particularly public security for 
distributors constant will need observe how fast the solution 
searching and locating suspects and transportation anti terrorism 
will applied other private sector industries globally hence 
surveillance the government level also drives applications the 
our conservative assumptions before 
surveillance addressable market size could expand 
surveillance industry for transportation monitoring drivers using 
phones pedestrians running red light has also increased the need 
expect most hikvision related revenue come from 
for cameras save human labor and time have not yet seen 
china especially from government related projects 
the private sector aggressively adopt deep learning solutions 
estimate hikvision controls share allocation market 
because some applications are still not mature and high rate 
china solution market hikvision plans increase solutions its 
false alarms decreases end users willingness adopt new 
mix overseas currently and still trying increase local 
applications 
sales personnel for the overseas market hence estimate limited 
contribution from related solutions overseas markets for the 
time being

key assumptions 
the moment assume most hikvision business comes 
from the public sector our private sector growth assumptions are 
conservative however once the algorithm development matures 
government and transportation sector main adopters 
and further enhances accuracy rates for facial recognition object 
cameras china forecast they will generate and 
recognition believe adoption the private sector will also kick 
shipment cagr respectively for the entire market 
off 
which compares with our estimate cagr for total 
surveillance camera shipments believe both segments will take 
believe hikvision will continue take leading market share 
over the total camera market the next three years 
given its superior technology hardware and algorithms and its 
strong sales china public security and transportation industries 
our checks suggest cameras asp around 
estimate hikvision camera revenue will reach 
higher than traditional surveillance asp also 
and for this double and 
assume that front end back end market size china roughly 
stable range and use this generate our 
assumptions for back end market size for the entire industry

hikvision has the following initiatives under way for other machine 
ezviz likely makes the majority has been business for

automation this part the business includes industrial

believe automation represents the highest growth 
began this business the end 
opportunity the coming years estimate robots will 
auto electronics main products include driving recorders 
contribute hikvision revenue from 
rear viewing cameras vehicle monitoring cameras etc 
because the competitive landscape the chinese market for 
hikvision entered the auto electronics business mid 
robots especially agv sorting robots fragmented with 
hikvision also started two other initiatives

hikvision key advantages 
why believe hikvision can ramp these new areas 
demand project project for which hikvision products 
think hikvision will able leverage its core business 
can adopted believe that china the market for 
surveillance where the player terms market share 
robots especially agv and sorting robots will follow 
china these new machine vision products share similar technology 
similar competitive advantage whereby the sales channel 
and similar business model high customization and emphasis 
rather than technology leadership will the key 
sales channel where hikvision has had success the past decade 
capturing market share 
employee incentive program mentioned exhibit 
common machine vision algorithm most mobile robots 
hikvision has established subsidiaries for each the new 
agv drone industrial cameras autopilot vehicle etc use 
businesses which senior management and core technical 
the same key machine vision algorithm which enables the 
staff share the stake holdings think this will encourage 
extraction depth information navigation and obstacle 
success the businesses 
avoidance sensors are the foundation from which 
information collected and then fed into the algorithm 
look each the new areas the sections below 
system integration remains the key hardware only small 
part the whole robot machine vision system 
integration key take industrial robots example 
robots agvs 
programming makes least the total integration 
overview automated guided vehicles agvs are mobile robots 
cost followed robot hardware and feeders 
used move material around manufacturing facility warehouse 
believe this similar hikvision existing business 
amazon was early adopter the technology and acquired kiva 
model surveillance that customization and integration 
systems amazon now uses kiva robots for its house 
the platform the key for customer acquisition rather 
warehouse automation agvs allow fast and efficient processing 
than separate hardware software 
time and can also cheaper alternative which likely appeal 
sales channel and high customization also another key 
china wages are increasing automobiles and power are the two 
competitive advantage the key for hikvision traditional 
largest industries adopting agvs china total share 
surveillance business model lies its sales channel rather 
although see growing demand from the commerce and 
than pure technology leadership the business model 
express delivery industries well 
typically low volume high sku hence customization and 
large sales force important hikvision owns one the 
estimate hikvision agv revenue will reach 
most extensive surveillance sales networks china with 
gauge hikvision market share china 
sales people and over employees 
estimate revenue from agv more than double with 
work each customer requirements the traditional 
cagr the agv market expands china

centers now the adoption rate for sorting robots low below 
however expect this increase the 
robots sorting robots 
express companies raise the usage sorting robots mitigate labor 
costs and improve sorting accuracy 
overview sorting robots are mainly used transfer centers sort 
parcels the express industry hikvision has developed system 
other mobile robots and applications hikvision mobile robots 
that allows the sorting robots transport the sorted parcels the 
system use similar hardware and software across different 
corresponding unloading dock for delivery via the best path 
platforms including automated mobile robots robot controller 
hikvision sorting robots can run and intelligently identify 
systems rcs and integrated workplace management systems 
the code achieve accurate positioning via camera linkage 
iwms these robots can lift goods weighing from 
sorting robots are smaller than agvs can lift small parcels but run 
express parcels goods warehouse and even cars 
faster than agvs sorting robots are suitable for the express industry 
intelligent parking lot exhibit 
given the trend smaller parcels and higher volumes one 
hikvision transfer centers the company uses sorting robots 
competitive landscape sorting robots use the same manufacturing 
cover sqm and sort over pieces per day this 
know how agvs and hikvision competitors are the same the 
helped hikvision cut labor costs hikvision transfer 
company was among the first see its products the express 
center well increasing sorting accuracy 
industry which believe shows the ability its products and its 
sales team break into this new market

more than double china the demand for 
industrial cameras machine vision 
machine vision should continue rise automation processes 
factories also increase machine vision can reduce labor costs china 
machine vision overview machine vision integrated system 
and improve quality and flexibility during operation hikvision 
that allows robots identify and analyze objects requires 
launched its first industrial camera june and can provide area 
hardware such industrial cameras and vision controllers and 
scan cameras line scan cameras industrial smart cameras vision box 
software function machine vision widely used areas such 
vision controller and lenses 
metal processing food and beverage logistics and automotives 
its main applications include surface inspection product defect 
competitive landscape this industry relatively fragmented 
detection product traceability bar code recognition dimension 
machine vision vendors such keyence japan and cognex the 
measurement sorting and screening and robot positioning 
are the top two players but they both have less than market 
share globally and china believe hikvision has advantage 
industrial camera overview industrial cameras are important 
over these leaders given its lower cost structure and customization 
component for machine systems and transfer optical signals into 
these lower costs are not only reflected its manufacturing costs 
electronic signals industrial cameras need highly reliable 
but also lower labor costs for software engineers software the 
they operate for long periods and some need capture fast moving 
primary differentiator this industry and cognex 
objects prices for industrial cameras vary from below 
engineers develop software industrial cameras are hard 
above depending customers requirements 
standardize and are mainly for specific applications per customer 
requirement and think this should give hikvision advantage 
machine vision total addressable market china relatively 
given its close interactions with customers 
small compared surveillance market but forecast over 
cagr for the next four years estimate the machine vision 
market reached more than and expect

appendix machine vision background 
artificial intelligence machine learning and deep 
learning 
cameras and systems are able capture each individual external 
features and compare the features with those already database 
identify people this helpful the public security industry 
artificial intelligence the capability for machines robots 
finding and locating potential criminals and the transportation 
computers see listen and recognize our surroundings 
industry recognize both people and their vehicles model and 
human being does even beyond other words machine with 
license plate number systems can applied both the front end 
artificial intelligence has human intelligence the ability think 
surveillance cameras and the back end servers 
make decision humans 
below example how surveillance cameras can help crime 
machine learning the process which machine can learn from 
prevention 
large amounts data itself make judgment such playing 
chess recognizing stop sign 
cameras are able take pictures with higher quality thus retaining 
more facial features which improves accuracy for the recognition 
deep learning technology algorithm realize machine 
human faces and comparison analysis afterwards this case the 
learning deep learning trained learn huge amounts data via 
beginning the cameras took the picture the suspect the place 
neural networks with discrete layers conclude the most correct 
his her first appearance 
answer and apply this reference other scenarios one successful 
example pick images cats from youtube videos one 
next hikvision system can compare this facial photo people 
successful example alphago beating grandmaster lee sedol 
with criminal records public security systems other facial 
time world champion the board game 
photos captured other locations these two steps help police 
identify who the suspect and where the suspect went after 
machine vision the next frontier for 
committing crime 
compared decision making object recognition more modest 
task among applications the near term through deep learning 
usually takes roughly days and police search among 
approach machine learning able beat the average human 
the hours video from over cameras but systems 
image recognition the current stage this has also led 
need just several minutes complete the two steps above 
commercial investment see important function human 
cameras are able take one step further trigger alarm upon 
and thus can applied functions where human eyes are highly 
recognizing anyone with highly suspicious behaviour big events 
needed such product defect detection and surveillance 
such the summit hangzhou 
monitoring increases the accuracy even faster speed 
compared human labor among machine vision application such 
other than public security and the transportation industry 
surface detection highlight the cases below 
cameras can also applied the retail industry for instance 
cameras can identify each individual mall and gather information 
case study surveillance for crime 
prevention 
how long the person stays the mall and which stores the person 
traditional surveillance focuses two aspects real time 
case study surveillance for traffic 
monitoring video recording both need huge amounts human 
visits this can offer references for mall planning 
labor the level extent surveillance large the length video 
surveillance cameras have been widely applied transportation for 
great artificial intelligence deep learning algorithm for cameras 
traffic monitoring such capturing pictures license plate 
identify recognize objects people humans when 
numbers automobiles exceeding speed limits thanks 
applied surveillance the system the deep learning system can 
hikvision development machine vision the surveillance cameras 
both real time monitoring and video record analysis less time 
can further applied identifying pedestrians persons riding 
and with higher accuracy hence saving both human labor and time 
non motor vehicle violating traffic regulations

after parcel placed sorting robot can through portal 
hikvision cameras can identify persons and their vehicles once 
frame where industrial cameras can read the delivery information 
facial features are analyzed the back end 
and electronic scale can measure the weight the parcel 
intelligent sorting system then able plan the optimal path and 
direct the sorting robot proper slots drop the parcel each slot 
matches one place city all the sorting robots listen one 
central dispatching system the intelligent sorting system and 
they will not crash into each other when running sorting 
robots recognize the way the warehouse through codes the 
floor achieve accurate positioning 
sorting robots are the smallest mobile robots terms load 
bearing they are able carry parcels below other mobile 
robots such warehouse agv parking robots are able carry 
goods these larger mobile robots work way

case study amazon 
one the pilot projects one intersection shanghai these 
cameras working electronic police have captured more than 
this moment hikvision has related solution support this 
pedestrians running the red light since may this year the whole 
retail application list this case study here just show how 
system integrated application including video analysis motion 
machine vision can applied other scenarios 
tracking and facial recognition 
the end amazon announced that would open retail 
the beginning the system will tell pedestrian walks past the 
store where customers can simply walk grab items and walk out 
warning line during red light yes the camera will capture several 
this retail store amazon you can enter store scanning 
pictures this pedestrian running the red light then the back end 
the code your amazon app and start shopping amazon calls 
system can compare the captured pictures with pictures database 
this walk out technology anything you pick automatically 
identify the pedestrian the pictures these pedestrians who 
added into your virtual cart you change your mind about some 
violate the traffic regulations will exhibited big screen the 
items just put them back and the technology will update the cart 
roadside punitive measure 
automatically when you leave just walk out and the technology will 
add your cart and charge your amazon account 
the cameras and systems have also been used jinnan shandong 
province and suqian jiangsu province since may suqian the 
machine vision applied deep level amazon walk out 
accuracy facial recognition over among over people 
technology first the system needs identify this person when 
walking riding non motor vehicles while running red lights 
entering into the store and scanning the code second the system 
needs recognize this person whenever she picks item 
case study mobile robots how sorting 
robots are applied the express industry 
third the system needs recognize which item the customer 
sto one the leading express companies china brought 
the whole technology functions similarly what discussed 
hikvision sorting robots into one its transfer centers linyi 
above hikvision camera example both require accurate 
shandong province the end the sorting robots can 
facial identification upon the person first appearance and ability 
cover sqm warehouse and deal with parcels per 
recognize these faces other locations from different angles
