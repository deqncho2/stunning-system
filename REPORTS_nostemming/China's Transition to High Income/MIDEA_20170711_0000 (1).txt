highlighted our blue paper february why are bullish china 
find that higher incomes emerging lower tier market consumption shifts 
higher end manufacturing and expansion global market are the major 
growth drivers for the home appliance industry the key conclusions our 
china home appliance industry analysis and model are follows 
expect home appliance market value including white goods kitchen 
appliances and small appliances cagr 
from with demand value cagr 
for expect relatively stable demand with replacement 
demand contribute about total demand together with new 
demand from increasing penetration this could help offset the volatility 
brought new demand related property sales which accounts for new demand based our estimates the bigger impact from 
replacement demand will start kick around assuming 
year replacement cycle with the contribution total demand

the same channel driven income growth and technology 
upgrades meanwhile expect the price gap between online and offline 
narrow and such the decline average pricing whole channels

particular our forecasts white goods units are based the following aspects 
demand 
new demand demand from new household properties built mainly for acs 
higher penetration within existing households 
replacement demand for acs assume year replacement cycle for urban 
users and year cycle for rural users apply year and year 
replacement cycle for urban users for washing machines and refrigerators 
respectively and year replacement cycle for rural users for both washing 
machines and refrigerators 
think new demand from increasing penetration and upgrades the key driver for 
kitchen appliances and small appliances given relatively low penetration kitchen

key drivers china home appliance market growth 
china white goods 
short term acs demand could temporarily muted given slower cyclical new 
demand and relatively low replacement demand our year replacement cycle 
assumption but industry inventory much leaner than before 
although property sales not the only driver for white goods sales remains 
important cyclical factor for white goods demand especially which new demand 
still accounts for the majority total demand our analysis showed seven month lag 
retail demand and six month lag exfactory sales residential floor space sold 
due property developers pre sales practices although property sales growth has 
decelerated single digits since april from the high teens grew 
january may expect new demand generated from the installation 
new flats sold early continue grow over yoy accept the 
possibility deceleration new demand for once property sales slow down 
deteriorate under the assumption year replacement cycle for urban households 
and year replacement cycle for rural households replacement demand could also 
dip that will lead household demand about units less than 
the peak level units however think the impact manufacturers 
especially the leading manufacturers would not significant given the fact that 
overall demand still stands healthy level above the average level during 
channel inventory historical low level months after the destocking 
and expect continued industry consolidation with leaders share gains

low tier area consumption upgrade drive increased penetration the average 
ownership per chinese urban households was units versus units

replacement demand kick from for white goods replacement 
demand mainly affected previous cycles from the chinese

industry grow rapidly assuming product lifecycle years for 
refrigerators washing machines and years for expect demand growth from 
replacement accelerate for refrigerators washing machines and

central another opportunity the mid long term 
china central market accounts for about the country total market 
central exfactory domestic sales value maintained high growth yoy 
and currently domestic sales account for over central sales 
chinese manufacturers value 
central includes three categories large chiller vrf variable refrigerant flow and 
household central vrf sales grew yoy midea one the top two 
domestic vrf brands the large chiller segment for industrial commercial use and 
the household central segments china are respectively still led brands 
york carrier trane and mcqua and japanese brands such daikin but midea 
growing rapidly these segments 
expect the central market grow even faster than residental mainly driven 
infrastructure construction and commercial property development china including 
malls office buildings urban subways and well extensive application and 
increasing penetration commercial acs these places domestic brands may outgrow 
international brands the next few years due low base and after sales service 
long they are comparable international brands terms quality and technology 
midea aims become leader heating ventilation and air conditioning 
globally the long term therefore midea has put significant resources into central 
both for commercial and household use according channel checks midea targeting 
annual sales growth household central some regions henan the 
strength midea versus overseas player daikin its strong distributor network 
which sells both unit and central midea midea also aggressively expanding 
into the global commercial central market through cooperation with global partners 
carrier toshiba and and overseas acquisition miraco egypt and clivet

penetration still lower than for large appliances suggesting better growth potential 
penetration small appliance products china much lower than that large 
appliances both rural and urban areas which implies that there plenty room for 
growth for small appliances especially with deepening urbanisation and income growth 
expect new demand for kitchen appliances smoke absorbers stoves ovens and 
and small appliances air purifiers coffee machines juice makers induction cookers 
and increase the next three years while large appliances sales are now 
mainly driven replacement demand 
consumption upgrade and new products drive growth think more innovation 
the space will lead shorter product lifecycle and higher replacement demand small 
appliances prices are still upward trend for both online and offline channels 
despite promotion driven mix upgrade new product launches with higher asp also 
drives demand and growth for example fast blenders upgraded version juice 
maker with higher asp over per unit which can provide better nutrition 
rapidly gained market share the two years after being introduced the market 
online growth will the major driver small appliances online penetration much 
higher than that for large appliances the online channel continues take share from 
the offline channel and online asp upward trend narrowing the gap with 
offline prices think the mix upgrade will also drive faster asp growth the online 
channel 
market concentration continues increase with stricter industry regulation market 
concentration high and continues increase for most categories small appliances 
air and water purifiers have been very fragmented market with the 
entry lot brands due the early stage development however the two 
segments have seen stable growth market concentration since indicating that 
the markets have become maturer with stricter industry regulations and standards 
terms product quality and function expect larger players continue gain 
market share each category

global home appliance market 
global expansion become equally important driver 
exports have always been important sales driver for the home appliance market 
exports contribution dropped total white goods sales from 
the year the global financial crisis and accounted for total sales 
and expect exports sales grow stably major domestic players 
seek opportunities for expansion global markets leveraging their scale and cost 
efficiency expand business and diversify risk for example exports sales grew 
versus decline domestic sales 
another opportunity comes from localized operation developing market for major 
developing markets see ample room for penetration white goods their current 
household possession white goods especially still lower than par with 
china suggesting vast market with growth potential exhibit expect long term 
potential from localized overseas operations though currently these are still small

china automation and robotics market 
china industrial robotics and automation market has vast potential 
our industrial team optimistic about growth factory automation they think 
higher level factory automation critical for china further advancing its 
manufacturing industry and for domestic manufacturers improve their 
competitiveness are particularly optimistic about the market for industrial robots 
which integrates and applies several factory automation technologies our industrial 
team estimates the automation market will accelerate cagr 
versus cagr the international federation robotics ifr projects 
annual sales grow cagr from units units 
outpacing the global sales cagr estimates that the global 
supply industrial robots will china the government published china 
manufacturing may which highlighted target accelerating the 
development intelligent factories some local governments have also published 
detailed plans about subsidies designed encourage local manufacturers use more 
automation equipment and systems their factories the automation level chinese 
manufacturers factories the rise 
demographic changes will cause labor shortage the labor force aged 
currently accounts for the total population but euromonitor expects fall 
with the population this age group decreasing from 
from think this will result inadequate labor supply 
which may turn push salaries industrial sectors incentivising companies 
replace labor with automation 
the need improve productivity will rise with higher labor costs competition 
global manufacturing intensifies and china advantage terms labor costs eroded 
think that increasing productivity and product quality will the only way for 
chinese companies remain competitive and higher level automation factories 
critical for this our view the reduction the labor force from automation will also 
help reduce intangible costs managing labor and improve operational efficiency
