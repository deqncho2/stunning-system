the following areas face more negative impact

should help compensate for drop investment growth 
credit intensive housing investment government driven public 
around cleanup done with more visible impact likely 
behind over tightening and liquidity crunch appear unlikely 
with discount bill rates key watch 
the pboc should manage liquidity more proactively avoid 
temporary liquidity shock and ensure stable rates for proper 
funding channels 
credit growth still not low and should supported 
large banks and proper nonbank financial channels

investment summary 
despite the numerous documents there are five ultimate goals 
interbank funding for smaller banks particularly 
our view 
for banks with interbank funding exceeding one third the 
total funding base 
improving financial market transparency reducing layers 
around aum private funds separate fund 
channels spvs during the credit allocation process for 
accounts and securities asset management plans that invest 
allocation nonstandardized credit nsca 
the secondary bond and equity market 
eliminating regulatory arbitrage particularly arbitrage 
capital market requirements hiding risk weightings related 
some slowdown credit growth and shift credit allocation 
nsca investments 
rather than sharp contraction credit supply with rise 
reducing hidden off balance sheet risks eliminating under 
average interest rates 
the table guarantees hidden repo agreements during asset 
sales via the interbank market financial asset exchanges 
despite the relatively large size credits under examination 
improving credit allocation efficiency and reduce credits that 
believe the process will remain manageable not all credits under 
support capital market leverage liquidity self circulation 
examination have regulatory issues 
the financial capital markets 
reducing generation fake loans and deposits that distort 
slower total bank asset growth around and total 
calculation liquidity ratios for mid sized banks and add 
credit growth around with slower growth wmp 
financing burden for borrowers 
business and lower asset transaction volume the various 
asset exchanges 
the cleanup will cover total credits china the 
process already started 
the bulk the credit growth slowdown will credits 
lower quality lgfvs and real estate developers and 
lesser extent weaker industrial firms

likely contraction private fund aum the current aum 
allocated via just under various asset 
around has meaningful portion built 
management programs that serve multiple layers 
leverage from banks interbank business wmps this will

some bond investments should shift back banks from fund 
expect the following 
companies which will lead some shift funds from 
lower rated bonds higher quality bonds given lower risk 
preference among banks 
gradual rise loan pricing over the next quarters 
following the increases bond rates and interbank rates 
average total interest rates are likely rise around 
following this round regulatory cleanup 
more divergence interest rates between higher quality and 
lower quality firms 
the beginning the nsca cleanup process will drive 
interest rates loans and some alternative financing

some further slowdown total credit growth should take

higher quality firms and retail credits from lower quality 
lgfvs and real estate firms 
the cleanup process around done with future impact 
given likely more stable interbank rates and bond yields 
likely less visible capital markets but there are still some key 
believe the more visible changes the capital market could

liquidity crunch and over tightening are unlikely this time 
the cleanup process has helped reduce leverage the bond and 
commodity markets and slowed growth less transparent 
receivable investments and wmp aggressive smaller banks 
meanwhile has not driven too rapid increase average interest 
rates for the real economy particularly for high quality corporates 
impact 
short term rates will pick but should smoothed out quickly 
foundation 
believe over tightening can avoided this time for these 
key benefits new balance formation with lower long term 
reasons 
risks and better profitability for quality banks 
there still strong pro growth mentality most small 
the cleanup excess capital market leverage remains key focus for 
mid sized banks and stable growth large banks and proper 
regulators which will help reduce frequent and speculative 
nonbank financial channels will prevent sharp slowdown 
trading believe this will lead lower normalized trading 
credit growth below levels 
volumes and velocity resulting less volatility and higher financial 
good cost control many small mid sized banks has 
system transparency also supports the long term goal building 
cushioned profit impact from rising wholesale funding costs 
more stable capital markets with lower long term financial systemic 
and most such banks are still compliance with regulators 
risks and therefore lower discounts for good financial assets 
liquidity requirements 
the pboc should manage liquidity more proactively avoid 
though the financial market cleanup would lead higher market 
temporary liquidity shock and ensure stable rates for proper 
rates believe that higher rates will help prevent too great 
funding channels 
rebound industrial investment which would lead renewed 
close monitoring and coordination the state council 
could ensure better cooperation among regulators 
deployment idle funds will ensure more credit supply 
quality areas 
impact economic growth modest 
concerns about overcapacity higher rates would also help reduce 
further risk asset bubble think rising rates will lead nim 
expansion for higher quality banks with good deposit and funding 
franchises 
believe the industrial and commercial bank china china 
construction bank bank china agricultural bank china china 
there has been renewed wave concern about hard landing 
merchants bank postal savings bank china and chongqing rural 
china recent monetary and financial regulatory policy tightening 
commercial bank continue benefit more from the rising rate 
has led decline credit impulse that said think the overall 
environment china hence they remain our preferred stocks 
impact the real economy manageable expect economic 
activities peak and soften from then onwards but slump 
less likely improved external demand and domestic private 
capex both less credit intensive are likely cushion the slowdown 
credit intensive housing investment government driven public 
investment amid policy tightening 
meanwhile since the worst disinflation past expect real 
corporate borrowing costs remain subdued compared with real 
gdp growth suggesting that the rise actual funding costs the 
corporate sector will modest

what amount credits and investment 
funds does the cleanup cover what will the 
ultimate impact 
specifically believe the following will key focus areas this time 
around nscas will the key focus for 
regulatory cleanup this time 
around nonstandardized credit assets around 
examination outsourced investments and capital 
total credits china allocated via over 
market leverage will lead contraction aum 
various asset management programs that serve multiple 
layers channels 
cleanup impact bank asset growth slow 
average rates increase but more for 
our calculation based match all combined sizes channel 
lower quality lgfvs and real estate firms

nscas banks balance sheets and banks wmps for detail 
the concept and our calculations see our report february 
around nscas the key 
focus for regulatory cleanup this time 
asia insight primer demystifying china financial system 
some banks use multiple layers channels hide the true risk 
weighting and direction credit allocation while nscas are still 
allowed under the current regulatory framework believe 
there lot confusion the market about the exact 
amount credits that will affected the financial 
system cleanup this time this reflects the complicated 
overlap among the various credit allocation channels that 
regulators are targeting 
while the regulators are examining the 
interbank assets and wmp aum china 
banking system 
believe the key focus the cleanup the around 
nscas and around outsourced 
investments with the interbank assets and wmp aum 
addition some irregular practices gathering deposits 
and interbank funding will under scrutiny well 
around funding base out around 
total funding for banks could affected 
believe the regular interbank business and wmp aum 
with underlying assets proper bond investments will 
not affected this time 
regulators will require banks reduce the layer channels and 
properly report the direction credit allocation and risk weighting 
believe banks are likely gradually shift nscas higher quality

some the outsourced investments for performance reasons 
banks outsourced investment business and reduced

this could lead some further bond market 
through addition believe banks will eventually reinvest the 
deleveraging and shift investment preferences bond 
aum retrieved from outsourced investment business but they are

likely invest bonds with higher ratings view regulatory 
lower risk preference although the more stable interbank

believe the average increase funding cost for industrial sectors 
likely have remained well below the past two quarters 
infrastructure and government credit 
potentially mostly higher net interest 
burden but still very manageable levels
