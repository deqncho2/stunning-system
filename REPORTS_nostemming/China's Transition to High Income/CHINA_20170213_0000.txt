china shift from low income middle income status 
has been the largest and most rapid economic transition world economic history yet throughout this 
journey doubts have been raised about its sustainability rising imbalances prior rapid buildup 
debt after the currency regime shift and 
more recently the impact rising protectionism have 
all been cited factors that could constrain china 
economic development 
old redundant industries while fostering the development new 
high value added economic activities sectors such high end manufacturing healthcare education and environmental services consumption and services will come dominate the economic landscape 
china will complete its recent rapid emergence formidable 
competitor traditional leaders the high value added manufacturing spaces sectors such telecom equipment semiconductors railways power supply infrastructure and defense the fur 
take positive view that china will continue able nav 
ther development indigenous automobile and aircraft manufac 
igate these challenges although investors have turned more skep 
turing key area watch meanwhile key structural weakness 
tical and indeed hold decade low underweight position china 
poor soe performance likely addressed though the mecha 
equities are confident that china will avoid financial shock and 
nism chosen china more top down reorientation and consolida 
complete its transition towards high value added manufacturing and 
tion soes into national champions rather than improving effi 
services and hence attain high per capita income status 
ciency via privatization 
this report are taking step back from our usual 
sure the journey towards high income will have its risks 
month view and instead focus the longer term laying down 
the two key anchors that will determine whether our base case 
the macro outlook for china addressing the key debates and identi 
will pan out how policy makers are managing the debt cycle 
fying the key transitions and investment opportunities 
and how the key transitions into higher value economic activities 
are proceeding our view the most recent and arguably the most 
lay out the view that china will able avoid financial 
significant development the policy front that policy makers are 
shock the self funded nature china growth its specific macro 
now signaling willingness accept slower rates growth and 
setup and policy preferences will allow policy makers manage 
place more focus preventing financial risks and asset bubbles indi 
liquidity conditions and prevent the debt cycle from becoming 
cating that they would not protect growth all costs often with the 
adverse under this scenario one off devaluation the currency 
use investment low return nature this gives greater confi 
not our base case that said think the currency will depreciate 
dence that policy makers will able slow the pace rise debt 
moderate but manageable pace over the forecast horizon 
gdp and will focus their efforts setting more stable environment which will allow china vibrant private sector and formidably 
more importantly estimate that china will able attain

high income status expect per capita incomes

crossing the high income threshold china will there 
these transitions materialise china will continue present

debt cycle will mean high income status will likely outcome over the next decade but the economy still 
needs navigate number mega trends and undergo series structural transitions over the next decade and 
these will provide investors with opportunities 
this chapter address the following key questions 
will the current debt buildup lead financial shock 
differ from the consensus view that china will face financial shock believe china macro set own misallocation 
saving into investment strong external position current account surplus positive net international investment position and large 
reserves and lack inflationary pressures will allow policymakers control liquidity conditions avoiding financial shock 
will china attain high income status 
investors are the view that possible financial shock and the intense deflationary pressures could lead sharper slowdown 
real income growth while expect growth slow the coming decade are confident that the transitions the economy 
are taking place reasonable rate progress way that would help ensure that china would able achieve high income 
status believe china can achieve this allowing escape the middle income trap that had been the norm thus far 
what does china need reach the high income level 
obtain status high income economy china will need successful five key transitions its economic model transitioning from high investment high consumption from manufacturing services and from low value high value added manufacturing implementing meaningful soe reforms and reducing excess capacity the economy

high consumption growth 
the shift towards consumption oriented economy will take place accelerated pace over the next decade 
with private consumption rising gdp from currently the next phase consumption growth 
will also driven consumer who will richer older and more tech savvy this context industries that 
could capitalize the rising penetration commerce and changing consumption patterns are likely well 
which our view include autos healthcare and household electronics appliances 
this chapter turn the first key structural transition the shift towards consumption oriented economy specifically address 
the following key questions 
how big will the private consumer market will 
believe china private consumer market will reach trillion gdp from trillion currently 
gdp the increase consumption will primarily driven rising per capita income aging demographics and higher internet penetration 
what would typical consumer look like then 
from micro perspective the future chinese consumer will richer older and more tech savvy expect household disposable income 
reach while the median age will rise and internet penetration will increase 
how would population dynamics and changes lifestyle patterns influence consumption patterns 
rising age dependencies means that the share consumers within the economy will rise lifting the share overall consumption within 
gdp meanwhile higher per capita income and more tech savvy population will likely lead preference towards services related 
consumption relative goods consumption 
how will commerce shape the consumption landscape 
the increasing mobile internet penetration china will drive mobile technology innovation meet the diverse needs chinese consumers while providing monetization opportunities electronic payment shopping and banking services particular expect commerce drive rural consumption growth via increased accessibility consumption 
which industries will gain lose from these shifts consumption patterns 
the changes the consumption landscape will likely benefit sectors which provide high end goods and services well experiencedbased industries including auto leisure travel healthcare household electronic appliances jewelry and luxury goods and sportswear 
the other hand food beverage home and personal care and apparel and footwear industries general will need adapt fastchanging consumption trends and overall lower allocation spending their products

trillion private consumption market 
private consumption share gdp has gradually risen but remains low compared with that other emerging market 
and developed market economies the low share consumption over the past years was driven four key factors 
relatively low wage share gdp low real deposit rates restrictions private ownership property until the late 
and lack social security indeed china growth model had been predicated ensuring high saving rate for investment and 
job creation however with the ageing population there now need shift the growth model more towards one that consumption led 
our model projections suggest that private consumption gdp china will continue rise somewhat accelerated 
pace the coming decade driven rising per capita incomes and age dependencies 
our base case expect private consumption account for gdp absolute terms expect private consumption rise trillion and trillion from trillion implying cagr 
compared with cagr 
our bull case scenario faster pace rebalancing brings about more sustainable productivity growth trend and hence higher 
income and consumption growth this scenario private consumption rises faster pace and reaches trillion 
gdp implying cagr 
alternatively slow pace reforms and rebalancing would mean that transition towards high income status would 
delayed until beyond capital input growth will kept high but the detriment productivity growth however rising 
age dependency will still lead rise the share private consumption gdp however private consumption 
will grow slower cagr trillion and trillion these projections suggest the delicate balance 
between reforms rebalancing and its attendant impact productivity growth will hold the key towards when china will able 
attain high income status

critical expect china make inroads into this segment competing with germany japan and korea 
this chapter address the following key questions 
what does china income transition mean for the manufacturing sector 
globally high income economies have preserved some share manufacturing even service sectors gain prominence this 
because manufacturing sector contributes making disproportionately large contributions productivity growth innovation and 
export trade move higher value added manufacturing will therefore vital for china complete its income transition 
where does china currently stand the global value chain 
china cost competitiveness manufacturing being eroded new entries the lower end the global value chain necessitating 
move upward higher value end china has already begun the transition process and high value added exports share has risen 
more than half total exports china specifically china has made progress some medium high technology goods such 
electronic and circuit components transistors and lcd screens eroding japan and taiwan market shares 
how will china manufacturing develop the future 
expect china continue its transition into high value added manufacturer particular see higher likelihood china

china mean soe reform 
the key purpose driving higher share private sector participation the need for innovation drive the next 
stage development and with improvement returns equity and assets appears the soe reform plan 
announced were put place improve efficiency through the consolidation soes but there clear 
privatization aggressive privatization plan either through strategic asset sales through stock market divestment majority stake believe soe reform will continue progress further but will largely focused creating large national industry champions and reducing corruption risks 
this chapter address the following key questions 
how have chinese soes performed the past decade 
efficiency and returns china soe sector have declined significantly both absolute terms and when compared the private 
sector though this trend also observed across other economies 
china soe reforms imply more privatization and regulation the relevant sectors 
although china remains focused improving soe performance their approach will different from the washington consensus 
approach the the western countries rather china aims strengthen the largest soes through these reforms while 
capital and labor allocation decisions remain largely the hands policymakers hence expect the soe sector remain 
drag china overall growth for some considerable time come 
what the role the private sector driving the growth transition 
china private sector firms have already dominated the listed space the consumer and healthcare sectors while very vibrant 
set large private firms has also congregated the related industries these firms have generated far higher returns with less use 
leverage and would likely primary driver growth the near term

bottom change rapidly reshaping the corporate landscape 
used under the washington consensus the europe and 
china china private firms already dominate the listed space 
emerging markets during the and 
the consumer and health care sectors generating far higher 
returns with less use leverage than their soe peers they are likely 
more importantly show that china approach different 
continue driving the growth transition forward moreover very 
from other countries and regions several important regards 
vibrant set large private firms appearing the advanced tech 
the government does not aim cede control soes targets 
nology consumer and services sectors 
strengthen the largest soes rather than unbundling and dismantling 
them the process for capacity reduction and labour reallocation will 
likely largely government driven from the top down and will not

chapter dealing with excess 
capacity 
the materials sector which includes steel cement and coal now mired significant excess capacity demand 
growth for these sectors has slowed which posing challenges terms returns investment the context 
cost capital while there still skepticism amongst investors our materials team confident that slowly but 
surely there will meaningful reductions excess capacities 
this chapter address the following key questions 
can china phase out excess capacity the materials sector the next few years 
top down supply side reforms and financial support has been facilitating the adjustment relevant sectors and expect china 
eliminate significant amount excess capacities over period years policy makers tolerance for slower growth will lower 
investment growth helping manage the excess capacity problem 
what are the implications for sector profitability 
expect improvement roe across industrial sectors result the capacity cuts however roe levels will remain lower 
than those and than those the new economy sectors 
which sectors will achieve maximum progress cutting excess capacity 
the steel and paper sectors will more successful reducing excess capacity than other sectors 
while the new economy gradually takes center stage china contin 
while believe supply side reforms would help improve mar 
ues undertake structural transition problems arising from 
gins and utilization these industries the coming years there 
resource misallocation the old economy partly the cause for 
are two key debates surrounding the industry outlook the first 
china domestic imbalances would need addressed long the 
debate involves the pace adjustment which expect remain 
primary growth engine under investment intensive economy the 
gradual due considerations social stability the second involves 
heavy industrials sector which includes steel cement and coal now 
the timeline the revival reasonable returns given china ongo 
finds itself mired significant excess supply eroding margins and

deteriorating productivity response expect the government 
the demand outlook for the old economy will likely soften and there

chapter impact china 
transition the global economy 
china growing high income population will bear implications the rest the world this particularly considering the number transitions that china has navigate the coming years 
this chapter address the following key questions 
how may china transition impact the global economy 
see two key impacts arising from the transition primarily via trade the compositional change china domestic demand implies 
corresponding change import mix which has implications for exporters china and china move the manufacturing value chain 
will intensify competition among upstream economies the supply chain 
which countries will most impacted china transition 
the germany japan korea and taiwan will likely most impacted given their current dominant positions higher end manufacturing 
also expect capital exporters and commodity exporters face considerable headwinds china will gradually import larger share 
consumer goods relative capital goods and commodities 
what are the implications the global 
economy 
while the first stage china economic development allowed 
economies tap into china source low income labour and 
indeed allowed other economies move the value chain china 
now encroaching into high value added economic activities partic

the main growth driver china amid environment rising disposable incomes the composition domestic demand will evolve and 
china evolution market place 
the consumption basket will shift significantly well resulting 
changing import end demand economies and companies that are 
china consumption share the economy continues grow 
more geared towards these trends will benefit while economies and 
while per capita income increases consumers wallet share allo 
companies that were supplying investment related goods and servi 
cation should move towards services and preferences lean 
ces and commodities would find their demand remaining weak 
towards products with better quality and higher technology 
content result expect the import share capital goods and 
china rise competitor china attempts move the 
commodities decrease while that consumer goods pick 
global manufacturing chain would also mean increasing competition 
slowly the share capital goods imports china total imports 
for economies the high end the supply chain indeed china has 
peaked prior the asian credit crisis and has been trending 
already been gaining market share some high value added goods 
lower since then moreover reflecting the past developmental path 
markets against upstream economies such korea and taiwan 
china holds comparative edge the capital goods space rather

than the consumer space and the supply side the economy has

been geared more towards the provision capital goods rather than 
capital goods imports make over china imports 
consumption this best reflected continued decline china 
capital goods import intensity over the years while the import inten

china import categories total imports 
the same time given our projections that investment growth 
will slow china global demand for commodities will continue 
fully offset china shortfall china transition will remain head
