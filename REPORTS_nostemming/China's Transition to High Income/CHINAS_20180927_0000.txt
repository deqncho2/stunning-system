the retail sales slowdown secular cyclical 
robin xing jenny zheng zhipeng cai 
retail sales growth has been moderating recent months leading market 
concerns over more persistent slowdown china consumption believe the 
weakness largely due short term cyclical headwinds including tightened 
online consumer credit and reduced monetary compensation shantytown 
redevelopment which may continue weigh consumption growth 
that said expect consumption growth stabilize from with fading 
headwinds personal income tax cut and still resilient job market particularly 
the service sector policymakers could potentially take more pro consumption 
measures trade frictions escalate further 
slower retail sales growth due cyclical headwinds 
retail sales growth has been downward trend over recent months threemonth trailing basis growth has slowed year low yoy nominal terms 
and year low real terms august exhibit this has led market 
concerns about whether china consumption growth has lost steam our study shows 
the slowdown has been mainly due cyclical headwinds 
tightening online consumer loans after the surge tech enabled lending 
such cash loans and some auto financing business the past two years 
policymakers have been tightening online lending since late last year posing 
headwinds some discretionary consumption items our china banks team 
estimates that overall household credit excluding mortgage growth will slow 
yoy versus due regulatory clean and 
some excessive leverage through abs see are chinese households overly 
indebted this has turned into drag auto sales yoy ytd versus 
and sales mobile phones yoy ytd versus 
scaling back property subsidies property sales growth has slowed yoy 
august month trailing basis from and besides

announced july plan reduce the monetary compensation ratio new 
shantytown renovation projects scaling back supportive measures led 
weaker housing related spending the combined retail sales growth home

versus and exhibit 
our view the consumption growth slowdown the above mentioned categories 
more normalization over spending the past two years while policy tightening 
the household leverage buildup and the reduced monetary compensation ratio 
shantytown renovation may continue weigh overall retail sales the near term

resilient job market indeed the labor demand supply ratio has held steady its record 
high which has tended lead real household wage growth two 
quarters exhibit key supports the job market could continue come from the 
resilient service sector which has well absorbed job losses from industrial sectors 
exhibit meanwhile future employment expectations are still elevated 
around the record high despite some slight moderation recent months exhibit 
meanwhile see still manageable impact from china trade tensions the job 
market first the growth impact implemented tariffs still moderate our simulation 
from the global input output model suggests that the tariff 
chinese goods july august and another chinese goods late 
september could drag down china growth just annually second the more 
labor intensive service sectors which are domestic market driven will remain robust and 
absorb some laid off workers the export oriented sectors moreover the aging 
population china will result lower supply new migrant workers and thus labor 
market tightness will likely sustain over the medium term

remain significantly lower than and the biggest drag

second the monetary compensation ratio for the shantytown redevelopment

our view key risk factors china consumption outlook would overly 
aggressive tightening consumer credit and further escalation china trade 
tensions beyond tariff chinese goods see scenario 
global economics trade tensions chipping away growth sep which 
could bring some downside risks china job market and consumer sentiment that 
said expect policymakers provide more support households should these risk 
factors materialize 
potential policy measures boost consumption 
believe pro consumption measures policymakers toolkit include 
cut the mandatory social insurance payment ratio probably end 
which could mitigate the concerns about personal income view potentially 
more stringent social insurance collection see china economics change social 
insurance collection question september 
cut value added tax likely which could partially offset the impact from 
trade tension corporates and the job market 
more generous deduction measures for personal income tax from the start 
possibly with larger tax exemption amount anda more streamlined 
application procedure which could bring more support personal disposable 
income 
pro consumption stimulus such home appliance and auto subsidy program 
should trade tensions further escalate next year 
consumption downgrade broad trend 
not think broad based consumption downgrade taking place closer 
look data suggests some interesting patterns consumer spending including 
the shift from purchasing things purchasing experiences evolving desire 
for health and wellness driven choices continued preference for high end 
brands consumer goods willingness upgrade higher chainscale lodging 
facilities and further upgrades domestic and outbound traveling 
stronger service consumption continued pursuit better 
quality 
robin xing jenny zheng zhipeng cai 
from the macro perspective have continued observe consumption upgrading 
trends two fronts 
stronger consumption growth services than goods the headline growth 
retail sales could overstate the weakness household consumption retail sales 
does not capture service consumption indeed despite weaker retail sales goods 
have seen stronger spending growth various service sectors based 
household survey data including hotel yoy versus 
sports fitness yoy versus and cinema yoy 
versus meanwhile tourism spending growth came 
slightly weaker than but significantly stronger than retail sales 
growth exhibit 
high end spending remains resilient consumers are spending more the higher 
quality products services within the same category spending for instance the

travel should see structural growth believe domestic travel could outperform the 
latter the near term because the environment and also policy support

key investor concern that elevated consumer debt could constrain household 
consumption believe overall china household leverage still manageable 
based the still reasonable household debt gdp ratio healthy household 
assets including financial assets and property and healthy income growth and 
resilient job market however believe the pace the household debt increase 
and the pace credit penetration have been too high trend that could reverse

potential major drag consumption longer term however believe 
consumption credit will turn from support for consumption growth 
modest drag coming years although the biggest near term drag could behind 
overall household leverage remains manageable 
despite rapid growth household debt including mortgage and consumption related 
credit recent years believe the overall household debt level gdp 
remains manageable level and largely the average level compared many 
other major markets

has consumption growth lower tier cities lost steam 
there has been investor concern that the strong consumption growth lower tier 
cities has been mainly boosted shantytown renovation and thus reduction 
the housing compensation will reverse the trend think structural drivers such 
stronger job growth improved connectivity and economic integration via city 
clusters initiatives will remain intact and offset the short term headwinds 
supporting growth penetration driven categories 
china economics structurally supportive factors lower tier 
cities remain intact 
robin xing jenny zheng zhipeng cai 
short term headwinds from reduced efforts shantytown redevelopment many 
people attributed the rise property prices and housing stocking lower tier cities 
since monetary resettlement shantytown redevelopment namely residents 
shantytowns will use cash settlement whose amount line with local housing 
prices purchase new homes less known the fact that monetary resettlement has 
been important driver for consumption only residents who receive 
cash settlement will buy new homes according household surveys such china 
household finance survey however china tightening funding for shantytown 
redevelopment the housing ministry said july that china development bank will 
not offer more loans cities with low housing inventory and high housing prices 
and modest impact lower tier cities consumption estimate that cash 
compensation shantytown dwellers and wage income local workers could 
translate into annual consumption taking into account some multiplier 
impact assume the monetary resettlement ratio would reduced versus 
see china property addressing questions shantytown redevelopment 
june could weigh down lower tier cities consumption 
that said maintain our constructive view the strong consumption potential 
lower tier cities over the medium term indeed exhibit shows that retail sales growth 
lower tier cities has been persistently stronger than tier and tier cities see 
structurally supportive factors smaller city consumption has remained intact 
stronger population growth lower tier cities accounted for newly 
increased urban population compared exhibit

strategic plan this will driven growth city clusters which coordinate the

network will save traveling time and logistic costs turn the improved labor and 
goods mobility could enhance regional integration creating one hour economic

what are the implications for equity market investment the 
near and long term 
laura wang corey 
key message and investment recommendations 
believe the headwind from the consumption momentum slowdown and macro 
growth rollover will lead further downward consensus earnings estimates revisions 
combination with escalated china trade tensions and uncertainties caused 
recent regulatory changes around consumption related sectors such games and 
education sectors more geared towards consumption have demonstrated bigger 
downward revision momentum rapid growth household leverage over the last two 
years could also continue suppressing share market retail sentiment the 
household wealth effect stagnates due lackluster ytd returns from different asset 
classes onshore 
therefore not recommend broad based sector allocation consumption related 
industries the near term instead think stock picking how alpha could 
generated within the space and recommend highest conviction stock ideas based

near term cyclical headwind consumption momentum

headwinds particularly related the sector 
consumer confidence decline and the subsequent consumption growth momentum 
slowdown which already happening discussed the retail sales slowdown

years while are now only months into the last round negative consensus 
earnings estimates revision march september lasted for nearly years 
while this round negative earnings revisions started only months ago the 
previous round earnings estimate cuts were more driven old economy profitability 
deterioration investment driven growth started lose steam believe this time 
the cuts are more related consumption momentum rollover and therefore 
nature should shorter length and more resilient bouncing back that said the 
going china trade dispute could add more uncertainty and drag longer the 
duration comparison shows that could still very early stage

higher returns from higher leverage and higher risks the share market has been down
