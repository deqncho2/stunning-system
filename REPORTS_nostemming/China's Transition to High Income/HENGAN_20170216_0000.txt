power reforms may underappreciated think now good time 
revisit our investment thesis for hengan the stock remains around fiveyear low and forward lower than sigma while the 
company close wrapping its third series reforms that initiated 
suggest that the current valuation and consensus factor low 
probability for significant improvement and after our deep dive into the reforms 
feel convinced that consensus has not yet factored sales and earnings 
upside from the potential market share gain and reduction its ratio 
estimate and sales growth and and earnings growth for and 
respectively higher than consensus mid low single digits sales and 
earnings growth expect sales growth accelerate from early 
two major changes decentralizing commerce replacing the inefficient 
hierarchy the commerce function with amoeba sales structure this small 
team operation highly autonomous and incentivized individual 
performance the set should revitalize business momentum centralizing 
supply chain and back office upgrading information systems and restructuring 
the organization manage flexible sales structure and improve efficiencies 
supply chain back office which and inventories can reduced 
market key concerns may overplay think hengan high margin sustained 
asp mix improvement and stringent cost management also the reforms will 
likely enhance efficiencies its extensive sales network sales growth 
think restructured commerce function will better penetrate emerging 
channels hengan has seen improvement ecommerce since 
limited downside think likelihood business disruption caused reforms 
low the reforms have been rolled out carefully with numerous tests and 
modifications however factor unsuccessful outcome and short term

investment thesis reforms the key driver 
think now good time for investors build positions hengan for the following 
reasons 
hengan will finalizing three years company reforms mid and expect 
management turn more positive for the results fact ceo hui has 
been raising shares since november equivalent tso and 
signifies management approval the progress the reforms 
think consensus estimates are factoring few reform benefits which makes the 
reforms almost free option currently consensus only expects sales growth and earnings growth for fairly close the financial performance that hengan 
delivered the past two years 
think the market looking for turnaround story within the consumer sector and 
hengan candidate with high potential its share price now above its month 
low compared for number large cap china consumer names over the same 
period see exhibit could rather early upgrading the stock think 
shares will move quickly once there clear sign recovery the horizon given 
hengan solid track record 
discovering the value reforms 
have run bottom analysis for the reforms and believe the new business 
architecture will better incentivize sales teams deliver revenue growth 
sustainable manner the flat and modular structure also makes launches new 
products new brands easier than before while have knowledge any deals 
the company pipeline longer term believe acquisitions could more plausible 
the modular structure makes business integration more efficient and effective 
think the potential rewards the reforms are somewhat missed the market due 
the corporate revamp has been proceeding over long time and far the company 
has not delivered financial improvements however think progress has been slow 
because the complications the process management also avoided significant 
disruptions when executing the reforms evidenced the stable financial 
performance during rolling out the new initiatives carefully selected 
regions mainly fujian and guangdong the initial stages followed continuous 
modifications 
high level description the reforms focus the following aspects 
end end supply chain from customer end supplier end along with 
implementation the sap including crm erp and logistics system hengan has 
reorganized the existing departments into operation center procurement production 
logistics etc and service center finance etc now with the flattened and 
modularized organization coupled with all major systems being better connected 
management expects interdepartmental cooperation become more efficient and the 
company inventory turnover days can lowered 
amoeba sales teams hengan changing the previous sales team hierarchy sales 
and operation companies and sales offices with nine reporting levels into 
roughly small sales teams amoebas company names where 
compensation linked individual team previously evaluations were focused 
revenue the provincial level the number amoeba will increase the business 
grows new product category added portfolio manage such decentralized 
sales function hengan needs delicate end end supply chain supervise every 
amoeba 
considering the complexity the reforms and management commitment delivering 
stable financial performance during their implementation feel reasonable for 
the reforms take such long time

market key concerns may not sustained 
think the market key concerns for hengan have been 
its operating margin for sanitary napkins business too high 
will lose market share sanitary napkins given competition from ecommerce and

our view 
market concerns margin downside think the market should focus the 
overall operating margin for hengan and its opm comparable international players 
hengan current opm only slightly higher than those and 
kimberly clark respective segments for hengan sanitary margin recognize some 
cost and expense allocations among segments are not appropriate the previous

ecommerce recently said expected some deceleration online growth that 
eventuates think hengan strong offline distribution channel which evolving with 
the reforms will better appreciated notwithstanding the above hengan has aimed 
positions market share for both sanitary napkins and tissues ecommerce 
the next years understand company overall online sales accounted for mid 
single digits with growth rate accelerating after company started 
operate ecommerce itself instead the distributors 
where could wrong our bear case 
sales long term sales growth trajectory remains unchanged mid single digits the 
short term sales decline the next years owing moderate business disruptions

cost inflation our gross margin assumption our base case reflects mild decline 
tissue wood pulp prices and mild increase nonwoven fabric our bear case 
assume higher costs for these two raw materials which account for more than

intensifies sanitary napkins and tissues weishang brands wechat sold via 
multilayer structure the sanitary napkins category becomes real threat the 
leading players 
execution risks understand all business reforms involve execution risks while 
not factor many them our base case forecast given management has been 
conducting the reform process gradually and carefully consider some short term 
disruption the business owing the reforms into our bear case 
valuation the market focused only short term results and unwilling pay 
for premium valuation despite the solid track record

challenges were

the past hengan commerce system and supply chain were separated and the 
logistics were managed under commerce company grew bigger with more sales 
companies and production bases being established the coordination between commerce 
system and supply chain weakened creating problems like overstocking slow product 
replenishment 
through the reforms management intends build flat modularized and better 
connected organization which can respond timely manner everchanging consumer 
demands customer requirements and competition achieve that the organization 
changed three pillars format connected with the end end supply chain system 
which upgraded information system adopts sap including crm erp and 
logistics modules 
strategy committee comprised senior executives who will more dedicated 
strategic planning being caught administration routines the past 
services sharing center comprised finance legal property management 
and secretarial the goal create cost effective benefits via centralizing backoffice functions 
operation center comprised all the functions under the supply chain sourcing 
production logistics category and brand management marketing etc and 
commerce including the newly formed amoeba sales team 
the amoeba structure designed replace the previous nine layer hierarchy within the 
commerce function principle such structure leads disaggregation traditional 
hierarchical organization into small and autonomous units strong supply chain and 
stringent internal controls are essential amoeba structure otherwise the great 
flexibility that amoeba team has could damage the brand image create overloading 
channel inventories 
key highlights hengan amoeba sales structure are 
better incentivized each amoeba individually evaluated center and the 
compensation team members correlated the profit pool thus contrast 
merely focusing top line growth the commerce function will better 
incentivized create higher returns marketing spending 
lower operating cost each amoeba responsible for business worth multiple 
hundreds millions rmb estimate there will amoebas initially 
this much lighter structure sales companies and sales offices

anecdotes which show some progress the reforms 
higher efficiency previously took two days for hengan fulfill order placed 
walmart store jinjiang which located only few kilometres away from hengan 
warehouse now the replenishing time shortened minutes 
benefits autonomous amoeba sales structure previously one hengan sales 
directors needed sign off approvals regarding the usage marketing budgets 
going forward management expects flat and autonomous sales structure will enable 
frontline sales team make commercial decisions efficiently and effectively the 
change can also make senior executives focus more strategic matters 
channel inventories reduced previously warehouses and supply chain were managed 
sales company which had tendency make excessive orders and push through 
channels now the number warehouses reduced from and the 
supply chain managed operation center management indicates inventory 
through the whole end end supply chain lower than before 
expenses reduced now amoeba compensation correlated the profit pool 
few team leaders have request reduce unnecessary office space and headcounts 
the reforms how create growth opportunities 
think market share gain the key area growth for hengan top the 
consumption upgrade and single digit market growth hengan delivered average 
sales growth during renminbi terms much slower than the 
preceding years think the directional change consumer trends moving from 
volume driven market further segmented consumer demand has been the challenge 
that has weakened hengan distribution capability 
believe restructured business organization and upgraded information system will 
help hengan create incremental growing opportunities fragmented market this 
section discuss how hengan better positioned after the reforms regain market 
share 
winning market share world fragmentation 
tissues 
the distribution channel tissues more fragmented nowadays due not only new 
channels like ecommerce but also diversified consumer lifestyles and activities 
for example consumers now travel more for leisure and business than ever demand 
for pocket tissues growing stronger than box tissues and also consumption occasions 
are partly moved from the homes hotel restaurant appears trend that 
consumption for tissues has been partly moved from traditional stores either minimarts 
hypermarkets non conventional channels such hotels restaurants offices 
schools cosmetics stores hospitals gas stations etc consumer lifestyles urbanize 
and diversify certainly ecommerce and social platforms further complicate the entire 
retail environment 
for hengan total sales channel sales via modern trade steady while 
sales via traditional trade has been down from due emerging new 
channels think this paradigm shift explains why hengan has gradually lost its 
distribution capability which was primarily built upon serving traditional stores 
what changed after the reforms think that via amoeba sales structure hengan 
can better target those non conventional channels due the flexibility and the nature 
being customer centric management indicates for instance amoeba can partner 
with stationery merchant penetrate into office buildings for selling tissues and 
sanitary napkins currently away from home tissue consumption only accounts for

sanitary napkins 
consumers trade and their lifestyles evolve consumers demand different types 
sanitary napkin for instance increasingly consumers prefer both day use and night use 
napkins and increased sporting habits make some consumers ask for better quality 
products 
what changed after the reforms think hengan will more active launching new 
products tackle niche but emerging demands under the amoeba structure 
expect company product innovation will more market centric and value added 
the existing portfolio the innovation can also led frontline sales function and 
external partners different from the past where product innovation was mainly 
driven product management teams 
for example hengan recently launched new product new breath via partnering with 
external party the new product made organic cotton and designed for catering 
premium consumers replacing low end product anle which was launched the 
early days and saw dramatic sales decline think this another case supporting how 
the reforms can enable hengan explore more potential and expect the company 
more for the core brands such space with potentially stronger product 
leadership think hengan brand equity will further upgraded

diapers 
think hengan diaper segment has underperformed the industry for many years 
mainly due suboptimal product quality and under penetration the mom and baby 
channel mbs 
think the quality hengan products has improved after increased expenditure 
total from observe 
consumer comments towards hengan newer products xiao qing xin chao neng 
and pull pants niu niu are quite positive and the mix good comments 
comparable some leading international brands the major ecommerce platform 
however diaper revenue continued decline hengan remains weakly 
positioned the growing channel referencing channel mix infant formula and 
import data estimate the key channel mix for diapers mom and baby 
stores mbs modern trade and ecommerce mbs and ecommerce are 
emerging channels recent years where hengan did not penetrate well 
what changed after the reforms under the amoeba structure expect hengan set 
dedicated teams for the mbs channel for better penetration think channel 
characteristics for mbs quite different terms store traffic profiles end 
consumers margin requirements traditional trade where hengan owns strong 
distribution capability suspect its prior sales organization which was designed 
focus volume growth covering many retail pos possible and that did not 
support the development the mbs channel also with improved product offering 
think the mbs channel will likely new driver for diapers 
hengan product upgrade 
hengan has upgraded product mix the past three years the high end products 
tissues and sanitary napkins accounted for and respectively 
for diapers hengan has launched few new products such xiao qing xin chao 
neng and pull pants niu niu our channel checks show that the growth 
these new products strong especially the pull pants which now account for midteens total diaper sales contrast low end products such nappy pads 
continued decline

industry competition not intensifying 
general think the industries hengan operates not suffer from structural 
oversupply constant demand decline some other fmcg categories for sanitary 
napkins and tissue paper not see overly intense competition pricing likely due 
leading players being mostly quite profit oriented and industry utilization mildly 
improving driven environmental protection 
for diapers products sourced from cross border ecommerce which lots parallel 
imported diapers were shipped from japan china took significant market share during 
however channel inventories became overly built after growth 
imported diapers coupled with weaker consumer demand due fewer subsidies 
being provided online platforms the destocking cross border ecommerce also 
impacted the pricing for offline expect pricing and inventory pressure will unwind 
and gradually the trend sell will catch with the retail sell out longer 
term think diapers will outgrow sanitary napkins and tissues given their relatively 
low penetration addressable market and potential for premiumization 
hengan current capacity utilization quite healthy sanitary napkins 
tissues and diapers think this also indication reasonable 
industry supply and demand 
imported products the whole think imported goods are not big threat 
the paper and hygiene products made china although the situation varies among 
categories for sanitary napkins while the growth imported products remains strong 
estimate currently accounts for less than total demand think offline will 
still the major channel going forward and will not easy task for imported 
sanitary napkins sold offline without established sales network 
for diapers think online penetration will continue increase consumer demand 
for imported products still quite however not expect online growth rate for 
diapers surge again given retail pricing has increased for imported diapers without 
substantial subsidies provided ecommerce platforms

market share stays fragmented market share concentration has not changed much 
the past few years and particular remains highly fragmented for tissues and 
sanitary napkins think with reformed sales structure hengan will able 
better serve customers and prevent sales teams from pushing excessive inventories into 
the channel and also the launches few higher end products can help hengan gain 
new consumers and improve the brand equity therefore expect hengan gain 
market share the next few years after the reforms

and industry size still growing 
recently published blue paper morgan stanley economists forecast chinese per 
capita incomes will increase from the current crossing 
the high income threshold higher income and trend toward trading could have 
implications for hengan 
growing industry size while the market volume for sanitary napkins fairly saturated 
our view think volume per user for diapers and tissue paper will continue grow 
driven increasing incomes comparison taiwan incomes per capita are above 
volume per user per annum tissues and diapers and pieces 
china for tissues and pieces for diapers think hengan will 
benefit leading player the reforms will also likely push better penetration into 
mbs and non conventional channels 
premiumization hengan has successfully upgraded its mix for sanitary napkins and 
tissues the past years and also improved the product quality for diapers the 
past years going forward with revamped commerce system hengan through 
the reforms expect the company product innovation will more market centric 
and value added the existing portfolio
