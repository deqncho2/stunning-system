introduction high end iphone september likely drive accelerating 
upgrades and share gains especially china addition more modest updates current iphone skus expect apple launch higher priced device with amoled display that 
allows for curved form factor and longer battery life wireless charging technology sensors and more advanced software capabilities while see accelerated upgrades for 
apple highest end users all regions our work suggests china users are especially sensitive 
new technology and form factor changes 
larger base aged iphones and accelerating switchers are key drivers our bullish thesis 
china growth our detailed analysis aged iphones loyalty rates and purchase intention 
share for different smartphone brands china leads believe there are two key drivers 
growth first much larger base aged iphones sets for significant upgrades was 
blockbuster year for iphone adoption china was the first year that revolutionary iphone 
was available the china mobile network the largest china result the upgradeable base 
iphone users which measure iphones purchased two years ago more than doubles from 
the last supercycle iphone even after applying apple retention rate measured our 
most recent alphawise smartphone survey expected upgrades double from second counter market belief our analysis suggests apple positioned take net users from local 
chinese smartphone brands fact our survey work suggests one five local chinese branded 
smartphone users will switch iphone upon their next purchase

smartphone form factor changes with the shipments percent 
around rising shipments from chinese branded smartphone vendors 
age upgraders jumping during the iphone cycle 
not just overblown but actually meaningful opportunity for 
trough during more iterative cycles exhibit even 
apple provides base potential switchers the future 
take the most conservative approach and assume our base case 
believe the combination new iphone form factor and limited sup 
that the upgrade cycle only hits trough levels par with 
ply amoled displays can unlock this opportunity order bet 
then china would account for iphone shipments above the 
ter incorporate the switcher opportunity analyzed purchase 
current run rate and accounting for more than the growth con 
intention data across china smartphone users limiting our analysis

importantly more chinese branded smartphone users plan
