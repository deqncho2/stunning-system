three drivers fully loaded for margin recovery expect domestic margin 
double from operating leverage from rising sales 
could become more visible with easing competition allowing marketing cost 
control particular see good upside the merchandising margin which 
sharply fell from rising reseller purchases with

fast rising roe from over two years once the market starts giving

mentioned above the media have reported the enhancement the korea china 
relationship think the change the chinese government tone alone could rekindle 
the interest chinese travelers visit korea always has been top travel 
destination for chinese also think the official resumption broadcasting korean 
media and pop culture content china could accelerate the inbound trend 
since the visa approval ban for group tourists korea has not yet been lifted think 
group tourist inbound recovery could take more time however given the price 
attractiveness these products think demand will ramp rapidly soon the

long term demand looks healthy china outbound more from lower tier

chinese outbound still growing fast pace despite chinese outbound and

slightly higher than the previous peak share price mid from higher 
sales assumption than bigger operating space and higher inbound traffic 
spite similar opm level for its domestic business implied target multiple should

recovery story hence think high premium growth potential should granted 
given that there has not been much sign full recovery chinese inbound traffic

three key determinants for margin recovery operating leverage falling 
competition costs and merchandising margin normalization 
one interesting aspect the business its high operating leverage the top line 
trend due high portion fixed costs especially related rent expenses top 
this competition costs and merchandising margins should determine operating margins 
operators due easing competition competition related costs usually 
represented travel agency commissions have come down substantially the past 
four quarters and expect this trend continue geopolitical issues put all 
operators difficult situation besides shilla other players posted losses 
which saw smaller players start downsizing their spaces and labor inputs hotel lotte 
unlisted had market share and reported severe margin contraction 
last year has also reported rising losses its airport sites due higher rents and 
intensifying competition with shinsegae myeongdong store which close its main 
site therefore think these issues will temper lotte marketing activities especially
