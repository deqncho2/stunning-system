new era for bank asset yield trend

industry view 
see new era for asset yield trends supported 
attractive 
emerging supply and demand dynamics industrial 
sectors and policy shift more rational credit growth these 
trends could support bank asset yield increases and multiyear rebound 
profit growth quality banks 
see new era for improved asset yield trend industrial 
and believe policymakers will remain focused 
profitability growth expected stay healthy levels despite 
financial clean and more rational credit growth thereby 
moderation gdp growth despite the recent nim rebound 
supporting bank asset yields addition believe nominal gdp 
some quality banks the market remains concerned about 
growth will stay well above lows despite some moderation 
sustainability asset yields given expected moderation gdp 
which will again provide support bank asset yields that have 
growth our expectation still healthy industrial profit despite this 
notably lagged the rebound nominal gdp growth 
gdp growth moderation due rational industrial capacity 
see multiyear nim expansion cycle for banks with strong 
expansion that still lags demand growth which will supported 
funding franchises further increases asset yields supported 
synchronized global recovery and pickup private capex amid 
catchup loan yields will likely continue and still rational deposit 
potentially slower infrastructure and property fai our detailed 
competition supports nim for quality banks believe gradual 
analysis the materials machinery and chemical industries which 
rate rise cycle and typical residual impact during the following year 
faced more severe profit pressures the past shows healthy sector 
will likely lead gradual two three year nim expansion cycle 
profit growth over the next two years largely due rational supply 
for banks with strong funding franchises have adjusted our 
expansion and competition 
earnings forecasts and adjusted and share price targets for 
major shift risk reward dynamic also favors more rational 
china banks see report here and average respectivey 
monetary policy and asset growth that should support bank 
largely due revised nim assumptions have lowered our rating 
asset yields with much less need support the industrial sectors 
cmb and have upgraded citic and minsheng 
via overly low rates and more obvious downside cost achieving 
realign our industry coverage think icbc and crcb are 
low rates evidenced financial markets and asset bubble risks

china banks order preference 
emerging supply demand dynamics create 
positive asset yield trends support bank profits 
even gdp growth moderates 
rational risk reward analysis also does not favor 
major monetary loosening 
superior funding mix offers further support 
nim rebound quality banks 
china economics moderating but healthier 
growth 
key themes for cyclical sectors 
investment summary 
alleviation bank asset quality concerns has been key 
driver for china bank stocks over the last months 
which achieved total return average yoy with 
the big four banks namely icbc ccb abc and boc 
achieving total return yoy with improved asset 
quality trends somewhat priced now believe the next 
key debate will banks nim some investors are 
concerned about negative impact from decline asset 
yield when economic growth slows and higher interbank 
rates and deposit rates 
tax benefits are considered addition net interest income 
banks not have pay vat for local government bond 
investments and the yields from these bonds are part interest 
income and expect yoy nim expansion 
ultimately expect increase average loan yield around 
without rate hikes pboc 
our conclusion mainly based our analysis the industrial 
sector profitability which should able sustain continued 
financial clean and rational credit growth expect this should 
able support banks nim for longer than the market expects 
think combination further increase asset yield and 
the long term think china banks nim will trend towards global 
strong funding franchise will likely lead gradual two 
average around 
three year nim expansion cycle for banks with strong funding 
franchises believe the average nim may have already stabilized

why are more confident than the market nim 
trends quality banks 
despite the recent nim rebound some quality banks the market 
detailed analysis both capacity expansion and 
demand outlook point healthy overall industrial 
sector profit growth and key sectors including 
materials chemicals and machinery 
remains concerned about sustainability asset yields given likely 
moderation gdp growth believe the concerns are likely 
growth industrial fai has remained very rational pace 
coming from two areas slower nominal gdp growth will trigger 
yoy recent months despite the rebound from around 
new round financial loosening which will add nim pressure 
this significantly lower than exports growth and retail 
banks and elevated interest rates will eventually hurt the 
sales growth which are indicators end demand our 
economy and lead credit quality issues forcing even more 
view have also seen improved corporate pricing power not only 
broad based loosening 
the commodity related sectors but also the downstream sector 
evident steady non commodity ppi sector two thirds the ppi 
while this logic lower growth equals monetary loosening made 
basket despite slippage commodity ppi over the past three 
sense before believe there have been several major changes 
months expect this trend continue and keep overall ppi 
the risk reward having low rates china that will likely support 
low inflationary territory rather than deflationary territory 
relatively stable market rates with likely further increase loan 
expect industrial profit growth remain resilient and 
yield even gdp growth moderates somewhat the coming 
significantly higher than the even while expect 
quarters 
some moderation gdp growth 
more balanced supply and demand dynamic the industrial 
based more detailed sector bottom analysis expect supply 
sectors following better than expected capacity reduction and still 
side reform continue full speed the materials sector given the 
very rational capacity expansion should support more sustainable 
continued progress achieving the capacity cuts target while near 
profit growth industrial sectors even with some moderation 
term demands will likely remain sound 
gdp growth these emerging dynamics will impact bank asset 
yields healthy industrial sector profits will give policy makers less 
think china construction machinery still the early stage 
incentive support aggressive credit growth and financial 
the profit recovery cycle domestic machinery demand recovery 
innovations 
will sustained into supported the ongoing demand 
upswing from both infrastructure investment growth and 
nominal gdp growth should stay well above lows despite 
replacement demand stimulated improving utilization installed 
some moderation which will support rebound rates that have 
machines and the sector has achieved more rationalized capacity 
actually notably lagged the rebound nominal gdp growth 
and costs with nearly headcount cuts the sector during the 
industry downturn the past five years 
still expect relatively stable macro environment 
despite the tightening starting stronger private capex and 
expect stable healthy profitability for the petrochem industry 
exports are likely help offset the tightening impact this should offer 
the next years thanks stronger than expected demand 
more confidence that china economic growth more resilient than 
driven commerce and auto capacity discipline the past few 
the market has feared 
years with underinvestment petrochemical capacity 
environmental protection that delayed the approval new 
believe the assessment recent years low rate 
environment should have allowed policymakers better 
understand the high cost and risks related achieving and 
maintaining low rate environment 
capacities and closure some existing capacities 
good industrial sector profitability could offer 
support continued financial clean and rational 
credit growth well banks nim 
have adjusted our earnings forecasts and adjusted 
and share price targets for china banks and 
average largely due revised nim assumptions see valuation 
update report here for further details have lowered our rating 
given the likely more sustainable industrial sector profit growth 
cmb and have upgraded citic and minsheng 
believe there less need further reduce market rates particularly 
realign our industry coverage expect psbc abc cmb 
considering the associated high cost and risks hence believe 
and icbc will the best positioned benefit from nim expansion 
policy makers will likely continue focus financial clean and 
continue prefer banks with strong funding franchises namely 
more rational credit growth which should support overall asset 
big four banks psbc cmb and crcb our top picks are ccb icbc 
yields and nim for quality banks 
boc and crcb now given modestly more attractive valuations than 
psbc and cmb and similar benefits from the current environment 
believe could see gradual but multiyear nim expansion cycle 
for banks with strong funding franchises the back 
better than expected growth domestic end demand and 
earlier than expected rebound industrial and private sector

further nim expansion for banks with leading

any further financial loosening could lead nim 
pressure and structural issues 
the upcoming results releases late august banks report 
believe the current well managed liquidity situation bodes well 
sequential nim expansion could lead better than expected 
for continued financial system clean policy makers shift their 
earnings trend and further rating their share prices 
focus further stimulating credit supply lowering interest rates 
could lead imbalance industrial supply and demand inducing 
more resilient macro economic trend and industrial 
sector profitability 
structural problems the financial sector for the longer term 
there any further financial loosening excessively low rates may 
lead rapid rise system leverage and asset bubble risks which 
higher than expected macro indicators especially stronger private 
could undo previous efforts deleveraging this would 
sector fai and industrial profit could boost market confidence 
detrimental banks nim 
china economic growth milder moderation ppi and faster 
rebound core cpi 
weaker than expected export growth 
exports and private capex have increasingly become the key growth 
drivers china gdp growth global demand recovery takes 
longer than expected could induce slower export growth china 
which turn would lead slower gdp growth prolonged sluggish 
global growth could also lead weak demand resulting 
imbalance industrial supply and demand and continued 
adjustment private sector capacity thus potential weaker 
industrial profitability could put pressure banks credit quality and 
loan pricing

leverage and some asset bubbles our view 
risks asset bubbles particularly the housing market 
believe some increase interest rates will lead potentially

lower risk appetite for leveraged financial investment structures and
