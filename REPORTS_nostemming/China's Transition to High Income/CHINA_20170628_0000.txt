executive summary 
china ongoing period regulatory enforcement which encompasses banking 
insurance securities markets and exchange controls has stepped gear again 
recently monday june both bloomberg and reuters cited xinhua report the 
outcome central leading group meeting recently chaired president jinping 
which had been decided improve data monitoring and supervision chinese 
companies overseas entities and their outbound investments 
how does this latest development relate our overall thesis china general 
view the regulatory tightening welcome development the sense that the 
authorities are serious about reining shadow banking controlling overall credit 
growth and maintaining control domestic interest rates via avoiding volatility 
reserves hence these actions are supportive one key element our thesis our 
recent blue paper report namely that china can avoid financial shock 
overseas and investment activity whether private soe firms has already 
slowed meaningfully and seems set slow further the near term this potentially 
negatively impacts another key element our blue paper thesis relation china 
path developing cohort successful global multinationals 
economics rates and believe the recent cbrc inquiry and the statement the 
central leading group meeting are part precautionary policy package control 
capital outflows containing both soes and private firms leverage related 
overseas acquisitions the negative list industries exhibit they are also supportive 
our view that policymakers will maintain hawkish bias rein leverage which 
constructive the longer run despite volatility financial assets the near term 
foresee slower pace capital outflows and yuan depreciation and keep 
our and usdcny forecasts and respectively expect growth 
soften from onwards amid the tightening although slump looks unlikely 
stronger private capex and exports should help offset the impact 
credit despite the weakness china last week still think that risk reward 
favours china over china valuation remains rich for china asia credit 
stranger regulation risk and credit investors recognize that part and parcel the 
asset class that said not think investors are being compensated for the 
regulatory risk based current valuations although china spreads have moved 
the wides early december they are still away from the three year long term 
average addition the onshore credit curve the spread differential between lowquality credit and high quality credit very steep while the offshore credit curve 
remains rather flat hence with the chinese regulator focusing reducing leverage and 
financial system clean see more room for the offshore credit curve steepen 
spread widening for china 
equities surveyed the morgan stanley sector teams covering chinese listed 
companies both offshore and onshore provide information two key dimensions 
regulatory scrutiny significant number foreign acquisitions minority majority 
stake and use foreign domestic borrowing fund rapid asset growth exhibit 
the list companies that have made more than five overseas 
acquisitions investments along with the key metrics from the survey 
our analyst survey found that 
companies morgan stanley total china coverage have made least five 
foreign acquisitions investments the last five years these include mega cap 
companies such alibaba group holdings tencent holdings icbc petrochina ping 
insurance and china life insurance 
private firms have been more active than soes terms number overseas 
acquisitions among the acquirers private firms average have acquired invested 
companies average versus companies for soes the last five years 
most companies have acquired stakes their core competence industry this applies 
particularly china firms although few companies have adopted diversified 
conglomerate approach including what are now deemed negative list industries 
relatively small number companies have been aggressive users leverage 
fund acquisitions only companies with more than five overseas acquisitions have 
morgan stanley net debt ebitda greater than namely fosun international 
private and cimc soe some the companies have net cash namely tencent 
holdings alibaba group holdings baidu inc alpha group and 
most companies used foreign rather than domestic debt for debt funded overseas 
acquisitions average foreign debt was the total debt used for overseas 
acquisitions 
our analysts provide comments the acquisitions investments their coverage 
universe later this report 
the index level remain overweight msci china target upside 
with focus mega cap and new economy stocks ahead our next country model 
update the onshore share market has already rated multiple since early april 
due part think the near term impact regulatory action msci index inclusion 
and national pension fund investment remain positive catalysts but our focus near term 
remains stock picking too soon say what regulatory tightening means longer 
term for the offshore equity risk premium china but attempt provide some 
guide posts for both positive and negative outcomes from here for now msci china 
remains supported ongoing strong earnings growth and revisions southbound 
connect program flows and reduction the position global investors 
however with msci china now trading close our target forward think 
the scope for further rating falling 
banks and insurance remain positive china banks and insurance names 
believe the recent cbrc inquiry part the overall financial system 
examination clean process which could improve overall transparency which key 
improving investor confidence china financial sector believe such credit risk 
reviews are both normal and necessary from risk management perspective despite the 
potential near term confusion might cause the market will prove long term 
positive for containing system financial risks our view addition the comprehensive 
financial system clean has also resulted rebound market interest rates 
more rationalized levels which should also help reduce long term financial system risks 
and lead better profitability quality banks and insurance companies 
china internet the sector has seen increasing overseas recent years china 
internet giants seek expand overseas tencent and alibaba have completed and 
overseas investments respectively the past five years according our research 
however believe these investments form important part the companies 
strategic development and found that most the funding used was likely raised 
overseas which will free the companies from touching the red line were they move 
funds from domestic foreign markets

why regulatory action back focus 
monday june xinhua was cited bloomberg and reuters having reported 
the conclusions meeting the central leading group chaired chinese president 
jinping which had been decided that china needed improve data monitoring 
and supervision chinese companies overseas entities and their outbound 
investments and that china would insist the party leadership over chinese 
companies overseas units and investments and set unified effective system 
protect chinese companies overseas entities and investments 
the previous thursday june social media posts china and then caixin magazine 
began suggest that the cbrc had asked chinese banks provide information 
their overseas loans five internationally acquisitive companies anbang who 
chairman and ceo had previously been detained custody june dalian wanda 
group hna group fosun and zhejiang rossoneri 
thursday afternoon progressed securities issued these companies both onshore 
and offshore came under heavy downward pressure see exhibits and certain 
cases were suspended temporarily from trading late thursday and early friday 
the companies concerned began issue statements denying reports that chinese banks 
had been instructed sell their bonds and stating that they did not face insolvency 
risks friday and monday trading was broadly stable but securities issued these 
firms did not regain their thursday losses the regulatory authorities not appear

the five companies mentioned are all led high profile entrepreneurs and have been 
amongst the leaders the private sector the major wave overseas acquisitions

number acquisitions the insurance and property sectors and owns the waldorf 
astoria hna owns substantial real estate and leisure assets and also recently bought

overall outward activity below 
these developments have led media commentary and investor concern that the 
regulatory action specifically targeting these and potentially other acquisitive private

scrutiny currently but that this receiving less publicity think that investors need 
understand that the ongoing regulatory activity china likely continue with 
potentially both macro consequences and micro impacts wide range firms the

robin xing 
believe cbrc move last week part precautionary policy package control 
capital outflows which consistent with president xi remarks made june 
ensuring the safety outbound investment also supports our view that 
policymakers will maintain hawkish bias rein leverage which while constructive 
the longer run will probably lead volatility financial asset prices the near term 
foresee slower pace capital outflows and yuan depreciation and 
expect growth soften from onwards amid the tightening although slump looks 
unlikely stronger private capex and exports should help offset the impact 
macro objectives containing credit risk and capital outflows 
these moves are indirect controls capital outflows policymakers imposed capital 
control measures late last year including restricting outbound investments 
billion more investments billion more the non core business 
chinese buyer and investments overseas target resulting high debt asset 
ratio low return equity for the chinese buyer addition the following negative 
list has been mentioned authorities areas which will receive greater scrutiny real 
estate hospitality cinemas entertainment and sport clubs aggressive overseas 
acquisitions these overseas sectors are perceived simply taking money out the 
country and contributing nothing strategic value return the homeland 
think the cbrc examination announced last week which largely targeting 
companies with overseas acquisitions the negative list industries part 
precautionary policy package reduce the pressure capital outflows and currency 
depreciation ahead upcoming fed rate hikes there are several other measures also 
worth noting including the pboc change the yuan fixing formula late may 
adding counter cyclical adjustment factor which would increase the central bank 
discretion yuan fixing and the safe request banks report overseas card 
transaction information valued over early june the policy initiative was 
confirmed president xi remarks the central leading group meeting june 
the need improve data monitoring and supervision chinese companies overseas 
entities and their outbound investments which reflected top leadership cautious view 
capital outflows 
reining leverage and financial risk the cbrc move also supports our view that 
policymakers have maintained hawkish bias rein leverage which key element 
our thesis our blue paper report namely that china can avoid financial shock 
the stabilized interbank rates and muted regulatory news since may have been 
perceived some market participants indicating that the tightening cycle 
approaching its end however think only means the pace tightening will 
gradual with improved policy coordination among the various regulators rather than 
end the efforts control the pace leverage evident from the consistent policy 
tone since late last year exhibit particular pboc deputy governor gang his 
address june stated that the first step deleveraging slow down the pace 
leverage buildup and that the slower growth may preliminary result 
leverage controls this suggests that policymakers are content with the current pace 
tightening 
this context believe the broad credit growth will continue slow gradually and 
lending cost will likely rise further year end this will likely lead slower pace

exports and private capex growth exports and private capex are shifting the 
key growth driver synchronized global recovery particularly ems china 
they can partly offset the drag from weaker soe investment amid reduced credit

pboc still tightening course not think the recent downward move 
interbank rates and increased pboc reverse repo volumes imply that the pboc 
looking engineer easier policy over the near medium term rather the recent 
increase liquidity injections related quarter half year end liquidity conditions 
becoming tighter seasonally our view furthermore refrain from reading too much 
into the inversion the government bond yield curve this stage while for example 
the cgb curve trades negative see exhibit the swaps curve still trades 
positive territory the inversion the government curve has coincided with the 
underperformance government bonds with swap spreads tightening some 
since march move believe primarily related the ongoing deleveraging 
effort financial institutions that said potential inversion the swaps curve would 
sign caution looking the lead lag relationship between curve and growth 
indicators see exhibit

priced for the next months the market tighter interbank rates should see swap 
rates move higher and would look pay cny ndirs closer for rmb 
the cny cfets basket has adjusted back close april highs but remains lower than 
the sideways range that has been place since mid that said recent price action 
rmb indicates that the upward adjustment has run its course our view over the 
medium term china interest rate differentials with the remain the driver for capital 
outflows and and such look for slower pace depreciation over the

diminish for china over the near term 
what does this mean for outward 
expect the current regulatory tightening slow but not reverse the trend towards 
increased outward activity chinese firms both private firms and soes 
discussed previous section our view that the authorities have mind currently 
twin overall objectives relation control leverage and flows they also have 
desire target outward away from the negative list industries see exhibit 
identified safe last november and more towards activity which supports china 
national objectives including technology acquisition and support initiatives such one

exhibit shows that total completed global chinese firms rose from

significant proportion these pending transactions whether soe private firms 
fall under regulatory scrutiny they have not already done seems likely based 
the fall activity ytd and this week news enhanced scrutiny overseas

upside versus target uspide ahead the next update our pan 
axj country quant model for shares maintain our view that regulatory 
tightening will keep the multiple depressed below the long run average the near term 
before ultimately normalises higher therefore continue recommend stockpicking approach 
onshore equities 
have previously argued that beginning april the prior rounds regulatory action 
had led directly rise the equity risk premium onshore see exhibit with the 
shanghai composite trailing falling from around trough below 
and currently seems likely that until the true scope and focus the 
authorities actions and their consequences become clearer that the market multiple 
will remain capped around current levels however the recently announced msci

expect earnings growth and our june shanghai

offshore equities 
the offshore equity market msci china hang seng etc has been largely unimpacted 
the regulatory tightening thus far has benefited this year from strong earnings 
reduction the underweight position foreign investors and the southbound connect 
program flows result the forward msci china has been rising steadily rising 
recently premium and within sight our target 
looking ahead from multiple perspective can see both positive and negative 
potential impacts the positive side there clearly now evidence that the authorities 
are serious about reining shadow banking controlling overall credit growth and 
maintaining control domestic interest rates via avoiding volatility reserves 
hence these actions are supportive one key element our thesis our blue paper 
report namely that china can avoid financial shock this supportive the multiple 
however there are elements the recent action which are susceptible more 
negative interpretation particular what some commentators not our view are 
interpreting focus solely high profile private entrepreneur led companies 
certainly the case that overseas and investment activity whether private 
soe firms has already slowed meaningfully and seems set slow further the near 
term this potentially negatively impacts another key element our blue paper thesis 
and hence the multiple relation china path developing cohort successful 
global multinationals 
seems most sensible this juncture adopt wait and see approach however 
would note that however the regulatory path evolves from here not expect 
further significant rating the multiple msci china absolute terms and relative 
has now almost reached our target

guide posts for positive and negative outcomes from here 
over time investors will need judge whether the recent developments signal 
general orientation the relationship between the state and private sector and 
what that means for the future development the equity market here are some guide 
posts 
the best case outcome quite apart from the positive macro dimensions discussed 
this note relation reining credit growth enhanced regulatory action and 
supervision could also over time considered positive investors relative micro 
reform this would most likely the case the audit activities transparent and 
either gives clean bill health the companies concerned leads limited 
regulatory enforcement involving individual company employees but not compromising 
the activities solvency the firms concerned over time confidence would build that 
china putting place level playing field regulatory regime consistent with that 
transitioning being high income country our view 
the worst case outcome would involve regulatory action that perceived nontransparent targeting only private sector firms and favouring the competitive position 
soes signposts watch for this would regulatory fines large enough force 
major asset sales distressed mergers divestitures the firms impacted 
worth noting this regard that the recent detention xiaohui chairman and 
ceo anbang not the first time that high profile business tycoon has come under 
regulatory scrutiny china indeed elsewhere for example huang 
guangyu the founder the prominent electronics retailer gome and one point 
described china richest man was detained the authorities was ultimately 
jailed for years for bribery and insider trading see link the company 
survived its founder legal problems however unlike the broader china equity market

how does impact our thesis the banks and insurers 
banks cbrc inquiry into credits related overseas likely 
part system risk examination process 
richard 
caixin reported june that the cbrc advising banks conduct comprehensive 
review their exposure companies with aggressive overseas acquisitions recent 
years according caixin the cbrc initiated this risk review mid june and may 
conduct further site inspections banks are advised quantify and assess the credit 
exposure overseas covering all types cross border funding arrangements 
such lines credit loans and bonds view this normal practice the cbrc has 
periodically advised banks the past review certain types credit risk such 
mortgages and sectors with overcapacity 
attempt get better overview credit exposure related overseas 
followed more comprehensive assessment risks later following the rapid 
growth overseas chinese firms believe policy makers are trying 
conduct some overall risk assessment the credit that supported this different 
banks report such credit under different categories believe hard get full 
picture based the existing data reported policy makers hence the cbrc 
requesting more data from banks believe the regulators are still the process 
collecting information and are likely study the data submitted banks assess 
potential risks does not appear that either the regulators the banks have reached 
any conclusion this point although according the caixin article the regulators 
request pertains only credits related overseas non soe firms believe 
overseas operations many soes are also being reviewed are under selfexamination 
part the overall financial risk examination that started last year key goal the 
financial system clean process improve overall transparency which key 
improving investors confidence china financial sector and supporting valuation rerating result the regulators have requested that banks report and submit various 
types data give regulators and hoped investors down the road more 
comprehensive data assess individual bank and system risks believe such credit 
risk reviews are both normal and necessary from risk management perspective 
despite the potential near term confusion might cause the market will longterm positive for containing system financial risks our view 
addition the comprehensive financial system clean has also resulted rebound 
market interest rates more rationalized levels which will also help reduce long term 
financial system risks and lead better profitability quality banks and insurance 
companies our view 
insurance examining the insurance sector overseas activities 
jenny jiang 
credit related overseas undergoing regulatory scrutiny have examined the 
insurers involvement while these transactions often made headlines most were lowrisk properties funded offshore credit for listed peers note that private 
enterprises invested overseas insurers 
listed insurers remain prudent and conservative overseas markets our research 
shows that chinese insurers have likely invested overseas since 
fraction their total investment books foreign assets were not 
attractive the past due higher domestic yield and rmb appreciation most 
transactions were financial investments boost falling yields their home market and 
the most popular assets bought were real estate ping an acquisition the 
lloyd building and tower place china life purchase starwood and one harbour 
gate strategic investments have also emerged but mainly focus insurtech start ups 
cpic investment metromile yahoo sept and ping an newly set 
fintech fund expansion traditional insurance operations only seen hong 
kong ctih new life operation with registered capital cpic still 
waiting for potential new launch for operation and singapore china life and china 
opened branches offices the funding side saw uptick large insurers 
offshore borrowing with usd hkd sgd denominated bonds issued since 
which partially helped provide funding for their offshore acquisitions 
private enterprises made more investments the global insurance sector interestingly 
most outbound investment the global insurance sector was chinese private 
enterprises rather than insurers total was spent insurance 
operations with total assets over hong kong was the most popular 
market accounting for total outbound investment don have sufficient 
disclosure regarding the funding structure these transactions

grace chen 
china internet sector has seen increasing overseas recent years china 
internet giants seek expand overseas tencent and alibaba have completed and 
overseas investments respectively the past five years according our research 
however believe these investments form important part the companies 
strategic development and found that most the funding used was likely raised 
overseas which will free the companies from touching the red line were they move 
funds from domestic foreign markets 
global expansion one the key themes for both alibaba and tencent and each 
the overseas investments they have made fit well with the core business long term 
strategy the company our view the largest overseas deal done alibaba 
recent years was the acquisition lazada leading commerce platform the 
southeast asia market completed april for consideration this 
investment allows alibaba penetrate the fast growing southeast asia market 
leveraging lazada large user base and local experience together with its house 
international retail platform aliexpress the investment lazada paved the way for 
alibaba other business initiatives this regional market including ewtp electronic 
world trade platform payment and cloud and this not one single case more than 
the deals done alibaba the past five years were related its core 
business ecommerce and related infrastructure for tencent out the deals 
directly contribute its core segments social game and related infrastructure other 
investments are also expanding the companies ecosystems which turn should benefit 
their long term growth potential 
the financing such investments also more straightforward the majority funds 
can raised overseas most china internet companies are listed the except 
tencent which listed hong kong the funds raised from ipo are ready used 
overseas acquisitions and most the subsequent fund raising via issuing debt 
additional equity also placed through foreign markets alibaba obtained five year 
syndicated loan from the capital market right before the lazada deal 
although the company did not specify the financing method the acquisition likely 
that the loan proceeds were used this purchase our view also worth noting 
that chinese state owned capital providing support for these overseas initiatives 
during tencent takeover supercell october chinese state owned 
investment firms avic capital and citic capital both participated the consortium led 
tencent

china offshore usd bonds came under pressure following caixin news article that 
the cbrc asking banks review their credit risk exposure firms that are active 
overseas acquisitions see china asks banks assess credit risks linked firms 
active overseas deals caixin june the report identified five corporates that 
are under risk assessment out the five three have usd bonds outstanding hna 
group sanyph fosun group fosuni and wanda group dalwan all three 
issuers bonds are viewed high yield with average credit agency rating 
sanyph not rated 
exhibit shows have created notional weighted bond index hsf index 
these three corporates the index was trading spread the day before the 
caixin article came out following its release last thursday the index widened 
but managed tighten back friday and currently trading the 
overall impact china was actually much more contained despite widening the 
past two days china spreads still look tight from historical perspective and have 
only widened the levels late december addition continue see new 
bond issues being printed the asia space such kaiseg bonds and chjmao

facing regulatory risk and clearly not limited china this especially true for the

event that comes mind for most credit investors when chinese regulators 
investigated the china property industry late and saw spreads widen 
much late october see exhibit that said difficult access 
regulatory risk for example kaisa property kaiseg ended defaulting its loan 
payments january see kaisa chairman departure sparks default

risk reward still favours china over china 
regulatory risk for asia credit not easy assess and the outcomes are usually 
divergent can see from the above hence the key question whether investors 
are being compensated for the risk the short answer our view have long 
argued that china looks rich see china credit risk back vogue january 
versus china especially when compare the offshore credit curve versus the 
onshore credit curve see exhibit with china regulators focusing reducing 
leverage and ongoing financial system clean see asia financials time very 
selective june lower quality credit will adversely affected more than highquality credit our view this would explain the current very steep china onshore 
credit curve see exhibit contrast despite the recent widening china spreads 
the spread differential between china and china still tight versus the 
historical five year average therefore believe that risk reward still favours 
china over china 
risk would china growth surprising the downside leading the chinese 
government lessen its focus reducing leverage the system and financial
