why the city cluster initiative important 
for china 
city clusters are key pillar china productivity growth 
productivity holds the key china medium term growth outlook the face aging population city clusters can help 
sustain productivity growth utilizing agglomeration benefits while alleviating issues such congestion and high property 
prices that tend diminish the competitiveness megacities 
productivity holds the key china medium term growth out 
declining labour force not only directly reduces labour inputs 
look the face aging population demographic tides china 
economy but also has attendant effect capital accumulation 
are reversing very quickly with rising age dependency and declining 
through less savings and productivity growth exhibit this 
working age population over the past seven years specifically 
context the ability policymakers mitigate the slowdown pro 
china working age population started decline 
ductivity growth holds the key china medium term growth out 
exhibit shrinking annually over the past three years and 
look

even worse the united nations projects period faster

the initiative city clusters one policy measures boost 
our view city clusters are much more than just infrastructure con 
productivity over the past five years china government has initi 
nectivity instead their success hinges 
ated several supply side reforms lift productivity growth one 
them create city clusters the five year plan 
identified city clusters and the party congress held 
large population base with low population base the benefit 
building large city would much higher 
october listed regional balanced development one six key 
supply chain complementarity the benefit infrastructure con 
long term strategic plans our view this means china urbaniza 
nectivity would much lower the end points are similar each 
tion model shifting toward development city clusters rather 
than megacities 
other 
policy coordination for example order for satellite cities 
reduce congestion hub cities people should given incentives 
according the theory agglomeration benefits the bigger the 
these cities such more even distribution public 
city the more productive likely because easier 
resources 
accomplish these goals 
without these conditions blind development city clusters would 
match workers jobs 
more likely lead debt problems from infrastructure investment 
specialize supply chains gathering companies together 
and wasted resources 
facilitate the spread ideas 
generate more synergies across different sectors 
development city clusters china 
recent oecd studies suggest that for each doubling population 
size the productivity level city increases for china study 
published the journal the asia pacific economy shows 
among the city clusters believe five have higher 
that counties enjoy boost productivity from being included 
growth potential thanks large population tight 
the yangtze river delta 
connectivity relatively competitive industrial system and 
evidence from our proprietary survey 
but why not just build megacities because city clusters could

also alleviate problems traffic congestion and high property 
yangtze river delta 
prices usually found huge cities efficient transportation links 
jing jin area 
within city cluster they function well could significantly reduce 
mid yangtze river area 
commuting time and hence boost productivity meanwhile hub 
chengdu chongqing area 
cities could focus more higher value added activities lower land 
prices smaller satellite cities tend attract lower value added 
activities but the close infrastructure connectivity would mean 
equal access the rest supply chains and end markets for relocating firms 
city clusters always work 
broader context some people have cast doubts whether 
china city cluster strategy will indeed bring about more growth 
potential indeed there are only few successful city clusters the

the greater bay area different from most other city clusters which 
and shipping 
have only one world class hub city such tokyo the greater

moreover the ratio usual residence hukou holders 
guangzhou and shenzhen has been significantly higher than that

therefore policies should aim smooth the process such develbetween higher education and innovation driven start ups the 
risks underlying the conservative scenario 
source government websites morgan stanley research 
insufficient connectivity view the risks slower completion 
what policymakers could achieve 
the optimistic scenario 
suspension planned infrastructure projects low the key 
risk less coordinated policies leading insufficient utilization 
the world class infrastructure connectivity for example fragmented social security system residents satellite cities are not 
eligible for medical benefits hub cities the administrative 
deepen reform and opening the pearl river delta has been 
process highly complicated would create disincentive for people 
the forefront china reform and opening since forty 
move satellite cities firms might unwilling relocate from 
years later the greater bay area initiative has the potential lead 
hub satellite cities for fear insufficient supply skilled workers 
tighter linkages between the mainland and hong kong true 
international city 
the upcoming greater bay area blueprint likely determine 
whether such barriers connectivity could reduced 
therefore expect policymakers launch more pilot programs 
further promote opening including liberalization financial ser 
slower than expected opening our view further opening 
vices relaxation joint venture requirements manufacturing and 
could lead healthier competition better intellectual property 
service sectors lowering barriers trade enhancing intellectual 
rights 
property rights protection etc 
meanwhile would hard maintain the momentum the 
protection 
and 
hence 
higher quality 
development 
region rising export competitiveness stagnant reforms weaken 
faster rollout intercity bullet train network the government 
fdi inflows and push mncs move out china moreover since 
plans build railways including hsr and intercity rails 
hong kong and the mainland belong two systems the spillover 
the greater bay area but faster construction would mean 
benefits hong kong competitiveness finance high end ser 
earlier integration meanwhile efficient intra city transportation 
vices and higher education also likely require the launch more 
system connecting train stations major commercial residential 
pilot programs the mainland portion the greater bay area 
areas equally important which should ensure true reduction 
intercity traveling time 
equal access public services resources more integrated 
hukou policy could help ensure equal access health care and education moreover give people more incentives migrate satellite cities more important ensure more equal distribution 
quality primary and secondary education resources
