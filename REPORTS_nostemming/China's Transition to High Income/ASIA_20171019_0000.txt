executive summary 
will investment growth remain subdued 
the belt and road theme back focus with tighter 
capital controls irrational overseas investment 
sharp slowdown bri related outward direct investment odi 
policymakers have tightened capital controls since late 
has led investors concerns about its outlook growth down 
with the purpose mitigating the impact higher 
and yoy jan sep the previous five 
rates china capital flows the capital restrictions 
years that said believe the growth dip will short lived 
have concentrated outward investment property 
hotels cinema media and sports which are perceived 
first china has ample potential for outbound investment 
means moving wealth offshore policymakers have 
given that its gross outward investment position 
remained supportive overseas investment with 
gdp has remained significantly slower than that 
strategic value particularly investment related bri 
china mega plan launched october 
countries gdp average 
second policymakers have encouraged enterprises allo 
establish close trade and investment links with 
cate more financial resources related investment

odi has rebounded from jan sep

slipped from last year ytd 
this context our base case estimate that growth bri related 
the macro front address four main 
questions about the bri 
does the bri aim utilize excess reserves and 
export overcapacity 
odi can rebound annually average and its 
share odi can increase from currently 
could investment bring significant losses for 
china and erode its sovereign balance sheet 
believe this risk manageable 
bri key purpose increase the strategic value outbound 
investment explore new export markets and enhance rmb 
internationalization our view 
the size bri investment relatively small compared with 
china sovereign balance sheet estimate that the annual 
investment the next decade only 
the investment front expect the growth driver for 
accounts for china gdp china current 
china outward direct investment odi will shift from real 
account surplus suggesting that loss investment

china infrastructure related exports the near term but

box case study china bri funding 
this box conduct case studies how multilateral institutions china policy banks and other financial entities such 
the silk road fund help finance infrastructure investment along the belt road find that 
multilateral institutions are usually more risk averse they tend fund brown field projects such extensions and 
renovations and usually require sovereign backup for loan provision 
china policy banks are generally more proactive funding and taking dominant role large scale green field projects and 
preferential terms and rates are usually extended loan recipients 
direct investment from other financial entities might adopt the called build operate transfer bot model where chinese 
enterprises are charge construction and maintenance for extended period time before transferring the project foreign 
governments entities 
asian infrastructure investment bank 
aiib transparent its funding and tends invest existing projects with lower risks currently approved projects are 
listed aiib website which cost total and cover countries and various types infrastructure the share 
aiib project funding average 
pakistan hydropower extension project the project comprises the installation power house the fifth tunnel tunnel 
the tarbela dam and construction transmission line connect the power the national grid aiib contributed the 
total funding gap and the world bank and pakistani government contributed and the tenure the loan 
was years with rate libor backed sovereign credit 
natural gas pipeline azerbaijan turkey the trans anatolian natural gas pipeline project will transport natural gas extracted 
from the shah deniz field located the caspian sea azerbaijan across turkey and then europe due its commercial 
potential the project attracted significant amount private investment and aiib only extended loan total 
cost with year term and rate estimated libor 
railway system preparation project oman the project aims achieve full readiness for the construction new railway 
system that will support oman transport hub and exporter minerals planned activities include railway system design 
development for sector readiness surveys for land acquisition socio economic and environment and legal services the nature 
the project reflects aiib taste focuses design and planning rather than actual construction this greenfield project 
which means less risk exposure the loan has tenure years with rate libor 
chinese policy banks 
the export and import bank china eibc and the china development bank cdb are the two major policy banks engaged 
belt road funding contrasting with aiib they tend focus greenfield projects but are less transparent terms loan 
disclosures these combined with the absence sovereign guarantees some the projects and dominant share funding 
could mean relatively higher tail risks that said the preferential loan terms such reasonable interest rates most 
cases and long tenors would mean manageable interest burden for borrowers

funded cdb the total funding and china indonesia joint venture enterprise the loan extends for years with 
premium rate fixed which much lower than comparable aiib loan around the indonesian government does not

with financing for estimated the project value connect nairobi mombasa this being built the state owned 
china road and bridge corporation which will operate the project for the first five years eibc will provide financing

box dealing with risks associated with the bri 
despite the substantial potential the initiative and china strong position for overseas investment risks cannot 
ignored considering the variety cultures political and business environments and legal systems the countries 
specifically see three key risk factors which have led project halts defaults the past few years 
political risk political disturbances could lead suspension even the ceasing chinese overseas investment 
projects government reshuffles countries could result less favorable environments for existing projects for instance 
china colombo port city project sri lanka was briefly halted the new government pledged review all 
deals the previous administration 
macroeconomic risk sovereign credit risk key consideration given that almost two thirds countries have 
sovereign debt ratings below investment grade generally speaking country with elevated fiscal deficit high volatility 
inflation unhealthy financial system and poor external balance sheet has higher probability default meanwhile 
china mega investment and exports relative recipient countries economic size can add pressures their external 
balance sheets 
indeed while imf recognized the support the china pakistan economic corridor cpec with planned investment amount 
the next decade pakistan investment and growth highlighted risks that pakistan could face wider current 
account deficit the investment phase due the increase cpec related imports machinery and natural resources 
meanwhile external repayment obligations would rise the medium term cpec related outflows could increase after 
due the concessional terms most these loans 
individual business risk this can arise from investors poor assessment project feasibility and counterparty 
credibility well unexpected legal disputes miscalculation demand for infrastructure could lead disappointing 
operational revenue default delay payment counterparty could disturb the project cash flow and legal disputes could 
prolong the construction period lead failure contract enforcement case point sri lanka mattala rajapaksa 
international airport and hambantota port which were mainly financed china have run loss and faced difficulty 
debt payment due low operational rate 
how has china dealt with project defaults 
the solution the debt default sri lanka hambantota port can provide example china state run conglomerate china 
merchant port holdings cmport signed billion deal with sri lanka july lease the port for years the deal 
also provided debt equity swap partly convert billion debt that sri lanka owed china equity holding bringing 
cmport stake the port while the port loss making for now the port has strategic position china bri which 
justifies china move restructure the debt 
could investment bring significant losses for china and erode its sovereign balance sheet 
failure projects the past has led investor concerns the prospect bri that said believe the overall risk 
manageable considering 
the size bri investment relatively small compared with china sovereign balance sheet our estimated annual investment 
the next decade equivalent china gdp and less than one third china current account 
surplus this means loss investment would not have notable impact china sovereign balance sheet 
morgan stanley research

most investment has been prudent and focused countries with relatively lower sovereign risk and strong ties with 
china exhibit and exhibit show that china investment has concentrated countries with higher sovereign rating and 
better business environment few exemptions are russia pakistan and indonesia where chinese investment disproportionally 
high relatively their respective sovereign and business risks that said these countries have had strong economic and political 
connections with china for instance russia and pakistan have formed strong political alliances with china and indonesia has been 
key commodity exporter china within axj region and thus investment there are more for strategic rather than business 
consideration meanwhile expect china increase cooperation with various multilateral development banks develop 
prudent decision making mechanism 
china has rich experience development finance policy banks provide long term credit support infrastructure projects 
which have generated modest returns and financial sustainability without government subsidy china using what learned from 
its experience extended preferential loans with long time frames years countries with strong growth potential 
favorable demographics and strategic importance for trade connectivity china development bank also emphasized may 
that will not poverty reduction type investment but aims invest areas with very modest return showing prudent

bri demand will help offset domestic demand slowdown the 
longer term 
with the belt road initiative increasing infrastructure 
near term improvement since the start supply side reform 
exports and enhancing trade links with asian middle 
china steel product exports have steadily decreased from their 
eastern european and african counties believe steel 
peak level reached during during china total steel 
companies will benefit both from higher direct steel 
exports even dropped yoy there are two main reasons tight 
exports support their infrastructure buildup and also 
ened domestic supply and improved profitability domestic sales 
from increased domestic steel consumption 
and increased trade friction 
manufacturing capital goods 
supply side reform and strict environmental protection 
requirements have removed oversupply and improved the 
profitability china steel industry for the near term 
domestic demand has peaked the belt road initiative 
has created other demand sources offset the domestic 
decline for the longer term 
china has finished the majority its urbanization and undergoing 
economic growth transition thus expect domestic steel demand 
will gradually decline coming years 
also with industry profitability restored after supply side reform 
made progress and with higher environmental standards applied 
china steel exports become less threatening other countries 
maanshan baosteel and angang all are key beneficiaries 
domestic producers making exports less exposed trade friction 
the additional demand brought belt road 
fact two countries egypt and pakistan just withdrew their anti 
initiative 
dumping investigations against china earlier this month 
china therefore not only needs more demand from export markets 
exhibit 
but also has positioned itself better for stronger trade connections
