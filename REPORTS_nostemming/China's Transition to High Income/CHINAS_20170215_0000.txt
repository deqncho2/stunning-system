chinese spirits there more 
left this bottle 
expect the rating chinese liquor stocks continue fueled 
sustainable and visible earnings growth our conviction reinforced 
alphawise survey showing that baijiu also gaining popularity with 
younger demographic 
there are three key factors 
behind our high conviction 
the chinese spirits industry 
sustainability growth against macro backdrop rising private consumption china transitions high income economy 
highlighted our blue paper why are bullish china feb 
our alphawise survey shows good acceptance chinese spirits younger demographic and increasing tendency toward 
retail consumption with premiumization our analysis market segments also shows that premium liquor has been taking share 
expect annual volume growth the premium segment until 
versus flat growth for the rest the industry which should 
result industry consolidation 
better earnings visibility leading spirits producers are track 
for market share gains with relatively steady factory pricing rising retail pricing leaves room for demand growth support 
future factory price hikes believe that strong demand better 
profitability the channel and clean inventory indicated positive 
feedback from our channel checks will enable premium liquor companies post stronger volume growth 
valuations are not low but haven peaked either moutai the 
benchmark for industry valuations trading six turn premium 
the shcomp index month forward versus historical range 
turns apart from during the financial crisis and the 
anti graft period with the business still upward cycle 
and considering the product defensiveness and potential benefit from inflation think the valuation premium should trend 
toward high single digit turns especially light our earnings 
cagr for moutai versus for shcomp per consensus 
potential catalysts include rising inflation which favors liquor 
retail pricing and channel profitability and quarterly results 
including cash flow growth and distributor prepayment growth 
momentum indicator 
think stock performance will vary with good retail channel demand and strengthened pricing leadership moutai the most
