belt road becoming more 
affordable 
expect china belt road initiative accelerate from 
thanks ongoing policy support higher commodity 
prices appreciating currencies and faster funding 
approvals cmec and cccc are our preferred plays with 
rising overseas business exposure 
belt road investment accelerate with policy support china 
investment countries has rebounded since amid policy support and 
less capital outflow pressure this reinforces our view that total investment 
could accelerate and double asia primer china 
transition high income delving into the belt and road initiative expect 
odi countries increase annually better financing capability and unfolding infrastructure projects 
why now the tide turning implementation the initiative has been 
slower than the market expected with china overseas new contracts 
revenue growing only cagr over the past three years 
chinese epc contractors have signed plenty preliminary agreements with 
countries but execution has been pending this because chinese epc 
companies usually require customers deposit contract value 
prepayment before starting construction but countries financing 
capabilities were negatively impacted strong usd and low commodity prices 
but things are turning around now with rising commodity prices and 
strengthening local currencies therefore countries are strengthening their 
financial capability for infrastructure construction for example the brent crude 
oil price has increased over yoy barrel jan while 
countries local currencies have appreciated malaysian ringgit against 
usd looking forward expect china overseas new contracts 
revenue growth accelerate substantially cagr respectively 
over 
project funding approval accelerate for newly established financing 
channels such asian infrastructure investment bank aiib since jan and 
silk road fund since dec believe progress funding approval will 
accelerate from following the project due diligence and preparation work 
done the past years 
key beneficiaries believe the initiative will benefit chinese 
companies with high exposure the global market such cmec 
and cccc chinese rolling stock companies such crcc 
and times electric will also benefit from accelerating new orders from 
the international market

countries financing capabilities are improving with rising 
commodity prices and strengthening local currencies 
countries are gaining stronger financial capability for infrastructure construction 
with rising commodity prices and appreciating local currencies over the past year the 
brent crude oil price has increased over barrel jan from 
barrel jan our oil strategist martijn rats forecasts that brent oil price 
will continue rising bbl 
the other hand stronger local currency against usd means these countries can 
pay less for the projects especially the prepayment which contract 
value local currency terms for example the malaysian ringgit myr has appreciated 
against the usd since after depreciating myr 
appreciation means the myr denominated cost for malaysia east coast 
railway construction project will reduced also the hungarian forint huf 
has appreciated against the usd since after depreciating 
result believe project new starts will accelerate and thus china overseas 
revenue growth will pick
