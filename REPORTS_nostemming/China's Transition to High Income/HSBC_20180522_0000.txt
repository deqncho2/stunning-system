could hibor converge with libor hkma intervention liquidity conundrum 
liquidity inflow has been very strong over the past months driven global 
flows and also flows from china through stock connect this turn has caused the 
disconnect between hibor and libor given the currency peg don think this 
divergence will persist forever but tough articulate exact time for the 
convergence the factors that would drive convergence would lower hkd liquidity 
which would imply outflow money from faster loan growth rise risk 
aversion towards china 
may approaching conditions for more pronounced hibor libor spread 
compression hkma has been recently intervening keep hkd from depreciating 
beyond the upper level against usd this continues should reduce the quantum 
excess liquidity thereby reducing the hibor libor spread one month hibor 
has been volatile this year line with liquidity flows into averaged jan 
and feb and march currently around but will hkma 
has keep reducing liquidity 
hkd reaching the upper boundary phenomenon the last few weeks with hkd 
staying forcing hkma keep withdrawing liquidity the quantum and impact 
liquidity withdrawals difficult predict this juncture suffice say every additional 
spread compression would add nii driving faster nim expansion 
widening liability spreads large banks are sitting almost half their balance sheets 
interbank bonds and hibor goes this part will reprice quite quickly mths 
implying meaningful nim pickup moreover mentioned recent note see asia 
financials large banks the liquidity advantage apr expect lending 
spreads also improve implying possible surge nims over next few 
quarters 
while hibor continues lagging libor believe that nim upside material 
reflect our numbers there are factors driving this 
large part the deposit base usd not get currency breakup for 
individual banks but for the banking system whole total deposits were 
usd our view hsbc could even larger given the large share trade flows 
which result higher usd operating balances hsbc has not raised usd deposit rates 
over the last year despite the fed rates hikes and libor increases only very recently 
saw hike usd savings deposits and there has been some increase time 
deposit rates will getting meaningful month libor effect 
over the last although much the move ytd which would imply meaningful

even hkd loans while hibor has trailed libor has increased absolute terms 
month hibor bps over the last months and month hibor 
bps this implies higher spreads hkd liquidity 
hsbc our view manifests this leverage more than any other bank given its deposit 
franchise its deposit base was and loan book was 
even assume that there improvement loan spreads will see higher 
returns the excess liquidity 
how big the pressure overall funding cost 
investor focus recently has been the rise deposit rates offer hong kong will 
this take away the nim expansion story our view that higher deposit rates are 
function tighter liquidity which good for the large banks given their strong casa 
balances weaker banks with lower casa will struggle which turn will reduce the 
pressure loan competition another positive for large banks 
hkma released the composite funding cost hkd for the banking system for april this 
was bps mom increase this the number focus headline rates are 
being offered only small portion deposits still moreover system funding cost 
was bps larger banks would have seen even smaller increase weaker 
funded banks are offering higher rates 
funding costs will move but continue expect them trail asset yields 
large banks are sweet spot asset yields are moving across the board even 
deploying money month hibor gives bps spread compared zero 
and bps this should help keep core revenue growth very strong 
how about the prime rate 
question that comes whether prime will move banks not have meaningful 
amounts loans linked prime and hence there incentive raise prime rates 
the negative effect hiking prime would some pressure increase deposit rates 
hkma action reduces liquidity meaningfully causing slowdown deposit growth then 
banks will forced raise deposit rates and they will increase prime along with that 
look the rate hike cycle the early then banks are close start raising 
prime and savings deposit rates fed rate increases going forward history any 
guide may see move prime rate one the next two fed rate hikes 
hibor fixed daily and mortgage pricing tends hibor for year

reason given that the bank focusing organic growth hsbc preferred avenue for 
capital deployment this has reignited debate capital return organic growth 
prospects our view focussing growth that eps and rote accretive seizing 
the growth opportunity hong kong could make most strategic sense 
our analysis run sensitivity measuring the trade off between organic growth and 
capital return from eps tnav and rote accretion perspective find that the 
region which hsbc decides deploy capital the most important differentiator and 
hong kong the optimal region which grow has the highest underlying 
profitability see exhibits 
expect rwa growth over and estimate that the region 
has underlying pre tax rorwa which the highest across the group 
additional growth shift rwa deployment hong kong taking growth 
would imply incremental capital consumption 
hence lower buyback may possible outcome our base case the capital 
deployment strategy followed assuming all else equal arguably somewhat 
conservative assumption which implies that hsbc does not dip into its existing 
excess capital headroom importantly our analysis shows that even this scenario 
despite lower buyback unchanged scrip dividend dilution and higher rwa

dividends hsbc pays dividends quarterly with interim dividend cents and 
final year dividend which varies expect the total dividend per share paid hsbc 
stay flat through cents line with recent history shareholders may elect 
receive portion their dividend scrip historically this has been popular with 
retail shareholder base and the take has averaged dividends paid over 
more recent quarters however this has ticked down going forward have 
conservative expectation scrip take and resultant dilution 
buyback hsbc uses its buyback policy way offsetting scrip related dilution and 
also distributing any excess capital the bank returned net earnings 
cash shareholders going forward expect the buyback more modest 
line with our scrip dividend forecast resulting moderating total cash 
payout ratio given our expectations for strong growth key markets have 
reduced our buyback forecast previously find that organic capital 
deployment better strategy 
excess capital headroom hsbc already above our perceived target hurdle for the 
bank and believe the bank can build excess capital percentage
