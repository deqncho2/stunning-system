what year for the internet things 
have rarely seen much enthusiasm for new technology concept outside the technology sector while 
the idea the internet things not new has emerged key enabler for the world economy from 
precision agriculture connected cars but also few governments labelling the internet things top 
priority for tomorrow world the internet things and its disruptions were key subject for the world 
economic forum davos january 
this global insight report update our internet things now connecting the real economy blue 
paper published april focuses the technology aspect the iot plan follow with series 
global insight reports focusing industry verticals such agriculture autos capital goods insurance 
mining and utilities 
have seen previous industrial revolutions not all companies embrace technological 
evolution disruption the same pace with the same success have heard anecdotally and seen 
various third party surveys that there still much caution among top management about the internet 
things owing lack interoperability security risks high costs and privacy concerns result most 
sectors have observed thought leaders early adopters and doubter late adopters future global insight

there has been some cynicism well along the lines this isn new doesn move the needle for 
tech the internet nothing once company adopts the internet things given sector all the 
others will adopt and the advantage will competed away only the cost will remain just hype this 
the dot bubble all over again will take decade 
true the internet things not new concept started machine machine where vending 
machine sent message text machine saying needed replenished but the concept the internet 
things goes far beyond machine machine this the collection data into the cloud and what big 
data analytics can for connecting and learning from large number for machine the networking 
effect all this was not fully available even just few years ago 
the internet things has started moving the needle for some companies and industries maybe not 
for semiconductors where believe the iot more tailwind thanks the increasingly pervasive use 
semiconductor chips industrial applications the home car but has started show significant numbers

are there and there pull from most sectors more 
than five years after the financial crisis companies have 
rebuilt balance sheets margins have recovered and the 
question for the boardroom what next 
clearly the table reaching new cyclical peak 
but the debate also about finding new ways 
improving productivity business models from capex

industrial and financial sectors but not all companies

year inflection points 
exhibit internet things revenue spotting 
one the main criticisms have heard about the 
internet things the lack actual revenues 
associated there are however enough datapoints 
this year show that iot revenues are significant and 
growing particular for software and services 
the four largest companies generating iot revenues are 
intel embedded from the wind river acquisition 
general electric predix software suite and associated 
hardware ericsson iot services the autos utilities 
and government and verizon telematics mostly 
connected cars revenues

research estimates 
exhibit semiconductors and 
telecommunication modules 
semiconductor revenues are only just starting 
become visible but believe the actual 
revenues are much larger 
not many semis companies report chip revenues 
our view only nordic semiconductors bluetooth 
smart and silicon labs believe that the overall 
market for chips the internet things much larger 
but this really question semantics qualcomm 
does not report sales baseband chips being used 
machine machine modules none the large 
microcontrollers companies reports the revenues 
associated with connected devices micro electromechanical mem companies not split the revenues 
from smartphones and wearables etc hence the 
revenues are not necessarily reported but they exist

major wireless operators are seeing significant traction iot connections

some connected cars about new vehicles sold the for the year the company added 
connected devices including tablets kindles and machine machine bringing the total count 
increase year year believe arpu remains low with connected car revenues running about 
per month although consumer subscription can add per month expects connect 
nearly half new wireless connected passenger vehicles and serve connected cars the end 
see our video connected cars and carriers standard equipment revenue opportunity dated 
february 
verizon iot revenues growing yoy verizon reported iot and telematics revenues 
growing more than year year this remains small part its business however representing just 
wireless service revenues the company recently unveiled verizon vehicle connected car offering 
has also disclosed that postpaid connections are internet devices primarily tablets laptop 
cards etc from year ago 
vodafone considers itself the machine machine leader europe with market share 
estimate that generates per year representing connections the enterprise revenues 
and revenue growth was over the past two years 
there longer debate about the amount growth iot for large operators rather the question today 
how the networks will cope with very different type loading many devices small burst data and low 
latency 
vhs betacam all over again the telecom and telecom equipment sectors believe the main theme 
for the emergence new communications standards for iot such weightless ultra narrowband 
industry specific networks and push change more flexible towards 
there nothing wrong with using network for iot applications the baseband chips and modules can 
found for the pricing sending text very low when bought bulk however not network 
and the spectrum not used efficiently that why some networks particular the want switch off

also terms scalability not clear how large iot network could using all the smart meters 
western country were start sending text messages the same time that would new year eve 
bottleneck every day 
was clearly not designed with the iot mind was intended for streaming video sending large files 
from smartphone and does much better than and given that spectrally more efficient 
however latency and large number devices the tens billions were not part the blueprint are 
not saying that cannot evolve but design there are some limitations 
since will not trialled before and competition emerging from non cellular networks operators are 
discussing the possibility reusing some their spectrum iot flavoured the specification 
would need altered however become more power efficient and less costly weightless and sigfox are 
aiming for year battery life range and cost per module 
exhibit comparing power consumption 
sleep time the lte network 
the sleep mode for iot applications can deeper and 
longer than for smartphone smartphone cannot 
really deeply asleep needs respond quickly 
phone call but iot device does not need such 
performance 
iot device can return sleep mode very quickly 
after transmitting data whereas smartphone has 
remain alert for several seconds after call just case 
more data are sent 
iot network does not need check that all the 
devices are ready send information 
rce ttp ericsso research tern 
hence ericsson and qualcomm are proposing relax 
the time which the device checks with the network 
make sure its present telecom equipment lingo 
the device would increase the drx cycles from 
more drx discontinuous reception 
the standard evolving with and which allow slower bandwidth and enable 
operators manage their networks much more efficiently not allocating excessive resources devices that 
not need high throughput furthermore devices can deployed most today existing lte longterm evolution networks without requiring new network equipment other major network upgrades 
mbps will deployed the next release lte release with simpler and less expensive modems not 
full duplex only one radio frequency antenna chain 
hence lte could become more competitive terms cost gprs and allow better use lower 
frequency spectrum through refarming 
while are already seeing acceleration iot adoption the eventual implementation could 
dramatically speed the growth iot its utility and returns investment because unlikely add any 
new air interface standards and itself instead widely expected more attempt allow 
devices self optimise data traffic over the best available network any location wifi bluetooth 
even traffic over multiple network types simultaneously such conceptually should help future proof 
least the connectivity part the iot implementation enabling persistent use existing network 
technologies while increasing the flexibility future networks and devices optimise around them 
the first trial for set for south korea telecom operators and telecom equipment manufacturers 
seem agree that should not radically different from rather should evolution more 
versatile version that can prioritise throughput bandwidth over latency and number devices this could 
leave scope for non cellular standards take market share

sizing the opportunity between and revenues depending the mix 
what the revenue opportunity for the semiconductor sector iot purpose did not discuss 
this topic last year because believed was too early the main conclusion last year blue paper 
was that the biggest impact would software services and non technology companies 
today not many chip companies report iot revenues see exhibit and believe there significant 
semantic issue here take connected car for instance average car today has worth chips inside 
let assume that this car has connection and thus becomes connected what the correct iot revenue 
measure the baseband chip worth maybe all the chip content the car somewhere the 
middle because the infotainment becomes connected the powertrain chips because the oem collects the 
data from measure the performance its engines real time 
the was the main growth driver for semis the and mobility the past years laptops mobile

automotive represents about semis revenues 
and industrial expect these figures 
reach and cagr respectively over 
for the whole industry hence growing faster than

and industrial applications not new thing but may 
accelerate with the emergence the iot 
another way forecast the size the iot 
compare with the mobile communications 
industry which generated around revenues 
for units which smartphones 
and feature phones according the idc hence 
representing about chip content per 
phone smartphone 
assume the iot will represent many units per year when fully deployed but what about the price 
shall use the smartphone content guide given all the processing power available our pockets not 
far from laptop continue argue that the vast majority iot devices will collect information and thus 
will have priced very cheaply are not saying that there won any high end apps such connected 
helmet but that they are unlikely comprise the majority volumes 
find helpful here use the statistical model have used several times for the pricing arm based 
chips and which has proven quite reliable far it been nearly months now

controller connectivity chip few sensors and energy harvesting chip power management 
chip assuming about units per year extrapolate from the price elasticity charts that the 
microcontroller would worth the connectivity chip about and the other chips about 
each total the chip bill materials would amount about

enabled and can have mesh network topology thus used even the biggest mansion thread new 
standard with the support google nest zigbee has strong installed base 
bluetooth bluetooth becoming finally enabled but zigbee too with thread pushed

why does this matter the concept addresses the fundamental cornerstone the web architecture 
know today with the emergence the iot with potentially tens billions nodes devices need use 
which has enough addresses the has only addresses hence became obsolete 
after more than years existence bluetooth finally becoming enabled with the new bluetooth

have already discussed this the preceding section telecoms and telecom equipment 
the mems micro electro mechanical systems opportunity large sensors but larger still 
actuators and energy harvesting the new buzzword for our view ambient energy 
harvesting and wireless energy 
energy harvesting the process which energy derived from external sources solar power 
electromagnetic energy captured and stored for low energy wireless autonomous devices such wearables 
why does this matter because the proliferation billions iot nodes will require self charging rather than 
just very long battery life for most its nodes otherwise the cost maintaining charged batteries such 
large network will too cumbersome solar already widely available but there are lots other potential new 
technologies that describe here 
this key development for the iot our view unthinkable have batteries and people changing 
batteries for the billions nodes that will scattered around the world hence the debate here less about 
the cost energy the oil price decreases further the technology becomes irrelevant and more about 
having worry about powering iot device however the take those technologies has been very slow 
the yields have remained very low single digit percentage 
see two main categories for energy harvesting 
ambient energy harvesting the system harvests energy from its natural environment including 
thermal gradients light natural artificial pressure vibration 
wireless energy the system emits energy the form radio frequency waves that are 
collected devices tuned the same frequency extension near field communication

there are different ways capture ambient energy 
thermal gradient generator using semiconductor materials connected hot surface one end 
and cold surface the other can create enough energy power iot device using classic 
thermodynamic principle the larger the gradient temperature the higher the energy generated 
pressure vibration generator using either coil and magnet plungers piezo materials pressure

wireless energy transmission does not necessarily imply the end batteries but more the end plugging

the inductive power standard developed the wireless power consortium for inductive 
electrical power transfer the system uses inductive charging technology 
coil powered alternative current will transmit energy over short distance another coil this called

apple auto world most valuable company meets most disruptable industry 
being the car could very important for apple our calculations the automotive tam trillion 
installed base with and annual new vehicle revenues trillion this dwarfs smartphones 
and pcs annual revenue these are high level numbers and not account for the value the 
rest the auto industry aftermarket service etc smartphone industry apps subscription based 
models etc 
apple were corner just the value the car would equivalent the entire 
smartphone industry today the average driver today spends about his her free time the car 
and apple will want target this captive audience especially autonomous the auto industry also 
needs apple argue because after over years status quo the industry needs change agent this 
disruption will bring significant rewards new entrants and existing players willing and able adapt quickly 
how might apple enter the car while not completely rule out apple making its own car one day 
believe apple can start with what knows best infotainment and point out that already cars today 
with carplay very quickly the infotainment starting point can spread the rest the interior especially the 
hmi human machine interface ergonomics controls and even interior design 
would surprised apple stopped there however and over time could grow from the inside 
out bigger part the car apple has the brand and the design talent take the best the 
traditional auto industry and can rely the existing automotive supply chain for non critical components 
note that apple prefers develop and design its products house and outsource the actual production and 
assembly process this could enabled cars going autonomous estimate over the value the 
autonomous car will come from software today 
typical apple proprietary software ownership and innovation could overcome the traditionally low 
returns the auto industry returns for the traditional auto industry mid cycle operating margins the 
mid single digits and similar roic are very poor compared what apple used however believe 
returns could much better for new age automakers note also that returns other businesses that apple 
already smartphones pcs and consumer electronics offer returns almost low traditional auto 
however apple able generate more profits because owns the software opposed other device 
makers also tightly integrates its products and charges what thinks are fair prices read generally higher 
than the rest the market for the best user experience available ultimately the size the auto tam and the 
additional opportunity the car the fourth screen for media consumption are too large for apple ignore 
our opinion and likely will drive look solutions around traditional auto industry bottlenecks 
investment implications looking beyond the next years cars along with wearable devices tvs and new 
services provide opportunities for apple continue drive revenue and earnings growth apple could see 
multiple rating investors buy into the platform thesis our bull case based price 
earnings assumes higher iphone share gains and watch revenue upside but does not take into account 
any new opportunities autos tvs etc

several recent media reports have suggested that apple has stepped its ambitions the auto industry and 
actively pursuing building its own car this includes reports apple running prototype vans downtown san 
francisco fitted with autonomous driving mapping equipment according cbs and apple hiring about 
people for hmi autonomous and battery development including johann jungwirth the former head 
mercedes benz and aiming produce car according the wall street journal reuters bloomberg 
and the new york times company that specializes battery technology for big machines including 
cars recently sued apple for poaching top engineers according reuters and others and bloomberg further 
reported that apple hiring tesla employees apple has not directly addressed these reports 
are convinced that apple will have significant presence the auto industry the coming years 
driven the following factors 
huge tam there are billion cars the road globally today with about sold each year those 
numbers may pale comparison with smartphones and pcs but value terms significantly larger whether 
measured the value all the miles driven trillion miles mile the value all the cars the road 
today billion cars value the total global tam for autos about trillion the annual revenue base 
global new car sales only about trillion this dwarfs smartphones and pcs 
annual revenue these high level numbers not account for the value the rest the auto industry 
aftermarket service etc smartphone industry apps subscription based models etc this also does 
not include the value car content consumption autonomous world which could worth 
additional tens billions dollars per year 
with apple already dominant its existing verticals and given the size the automotive opportunity the 
attraction the auto space seems highly plausible apple were corner just the value the car 
would equal the entire smartphone industry today

addresses today red new opportunity 
the automobile very large and new opportunity for 
apple and its competitors all forms traveling 
aggregate accounts for over hour day the

working most this time spent private cars 
our estimation furthermore believe autonomous 
cars will reach the market which means the 
drivers attention going become available for the 
first time consume create even more content 
hard predict how autonomous cars will change 
behavior long term but possible people will spend 
more time cars they not have drive which 
makes cars even more valuable technology

the car the screen making inroads into the auto industry should not hard for apple the car 
effectively the screen for media content consumption after pcs phones and tvs apple needs transition 
its current smartphone ecosystem into the car infotainment system which already doing with carplay 
get its initial foothold new industry carplay could drive apple ambitions like itunes the motorola 
rokr drove iphone development 
why apple being the car important the auto industry 
argue that the auto industry needs dramatic change the car gets more connected and 
autonomous the world currently richest most valuable technology company apple will meet one the 
world most disruptable businesses autos for moment let just forget about apple making entire car 
that helps sell newspapers but let just dial back bit when the world most valuable auto company even 
thinks about getting involved the auto industry and has its disposal even experiment with any 
number business models learn more about cars the rest the auto industry pays attention 
global insight march 
understand the pooh poohing about how horrible returns and margins are the auto industry and the desire 
for some apple analysts change the subject from autos fast possible lest the mere mention words like 
cars autos vehicles begins detract from the purity the debate apple long term growth and 
profitability that said investors may want think about the potential strategic commercial paths over 
longer term horizon 
silicon valley tesla google apple forcing the traditional industry start over were 
identify three main reasons why auto returns are dreadful this day would cover auto 
companies many whom may not really need here cars are designed manufactured and sold 
way that has not changed significantly over more than years and the things that cars have not 
changed materially over the past years from our conversations with the top management auto oems 
and suppliers clear that the traditional auto industry fearful respectful and very thankful for the role that 
silicon valley playing disruptor within year old industry silicon valley clean slate out the box 
approach making and selling cars allows the traditional industry challenge and shed some their own 
long standing shackles and emerge stronger and better companies 
hypothetically this could drive significant shake out across the traditional industry this 
disruption could bring significant rewards new entrants and existing players willing and able adapt quickly 
and present serious challenges those companies that cannot evolve quickly enough imagine the number 
car companies shrank from say imagine cars were designed silicon valley where the 
content came from software engineers assembled third parties and sold company owned stores rented 
the minute managed megafleet imagine robot driven fleets vehicles were available from your iphone 
less than seconds and less than mile for industry that little five years ago was facing

below list some the key debates for software iot 
need connect the dots given the variety sensors communications protocols and underlying 
software applications software vendors have identified the difficulty pushing data generated from iot sensors 
into traditional analytical data stores result have seen the emergence multiple iot platforms aimed 
simplifying the collection and management sensor data for particular use cases will users look broader 
platforms support multiple iot use cases will near term development take place more vertically 
integrated technology stacks 
what the use case merely collecting data doesn add value using the data information 
gleaned from automate optimise business processes and consumer oriented tasks that 
creates value last april blue paper the internet things now connecting the real economy 
highlighted several companies such splunk palantir and sap with industry leading expertise collecting 
storing and analysing big data see the focus the iot shifting increasingly towards application 
development platforms and apps using such data provide real business and consumer value what will the 
killer iot apps emerging the near future who will build them who will host them 
security endpoint centralised the security iot projects becoming increasing concern given 
recent large scale cyber attacks and research such the recent congressional report the lack security 
this realm there are different ways for hackers gain access iot infrastructure the node level where the 
data collected the transmission level between the node and the cloud and the cloud level look 
understand who will solve the security the different levels for example will the endpoint security 
managed chip design companies such arm which recently acquired iot node security company called 
offspark will this also fall under the remit software security companies 
none these challenges appears insurmountable the contrary believe they represent significant 
revenue opportunities for the software sector however corporates from the industrial siemens and 
telecom such verizon sectors could also try seize the opportunity 
iot operating systems 
iot operating systems are probably not good investment thesis investors may have been overoptimistic the potential for some companies benefit from providing the core operating system iot 
devices suggested the many sum the parts bull cases for blackberry that view likely stems from not 
being aware the huge numbers choices free choices that are available makers iot products given 
that most new iot apps will extensions existing embedded non connected applications the very 
least similar shown exhibit and exhibit not only there wide range choices but also
