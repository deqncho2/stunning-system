building the foundations for the digital factory 
mapping the path the digital factory 
the pursuit increasing efficiency and scope for new revenue streams will lead 
manufacturers towards factory where data assembly line becomes the focal 
point their manufacturing and distribution processes currently the industrial 
internet consortium estimates that typical factory more than data 
discarded without any attempt derive value the digital factory data yielded from 
sensors within and around the machinery and the products themselves will create 
feedback loops that better inform the initial design products optimise the 
manufacturing process and squeeze waste out the supply chain these same sensors 
will enable more efficient distribution products new monitoring and predictive 
maintenance services both factory and once the products are the field and new

quality control specifications metrology improves off line metrology that 
does not require the manufactured product removed from the production line

the digital factory see the industrial internet things generating multiple benefits 
that will increase factory productivity improve product quality and increase 
manufacturing flexibility fundamental this are data feedback loops that enable data 
from the later stages manufacturing fed back into earlier stages the design 
and manufacturing processes enabling optimisation 
predictive analytics involves applying statistical techniques large bank 
historical data make predictions regarding future events for example predictive 
analytics may used generate predictions around the timing for when 
machinery will develop fault and require maintenance replacement the use 
predictive analytics requires domain knowledge while you need software expertise 
order able scrutinise large set data you need knowledge factoryfloor processes able recognise the warning signs for event ahead 
time 
predictive maintenance predictive maintenance promises one the biggest 
use cases for predictive analytics involves using predictive analytics help 
identify the operating condition machinery being able harness predictive 
maintenance would allow for fine tuning the maintenance process this may 
remove the need perform costly and time consuming pre emptive maintenance 
when machine does not require disruptive reactive maintenance machine 
has developed fault instead software can leveraged order optimise 
maintenance schedule according when the machine actually requires 
maintenance rather than predetermined intervals when machine may not 
require adjustment 
extensive real time data flows the digital factory envisage more extensive 
data flows from data collected the factory floor into cloud storage base 
back into the mes extended erp and plm systems this net result create 
comprehensive interconnected modification loop lessons learnt the factory 
floor level can automatically fed back into the design process and enterprise 
systems 
direct feedback link with erp and plm lessons learnt the factory floor 
ideally should fed back into the company logistics and finance system erp 
and also the design software plm this step would fully represent the closing 
the loop between the factory floor and the earliest levels the product sales and 
design processes see crm becoming more entrenched the ideation and 
manufacturing process customers will able modify their orders and then 
real time that will feed back factory floor machinery with plm data output

flows back into the plm software can used modify the design relatively quickly 
and eventually automated fashion 
closer demand matching present manufacturers typically mass produce product 
according few designs based insight from previous market research often the 
end products not precisely match end customer demand which can lead low 
inventory turnover and cash tied unproductive working capital the use big 
data more closely integrated crm systems and reduced time market all enable

systems further extends the ability companies engage adaptive pricing 
expect there better linkage between what happening the factory floor and 
the impact the end market for example utilisation the factory floor very high 
there potentially scope increase product prices moreover the ability offer more 
customised products enables increased ability engage price discrimination where 
you can better charge customers what they are willing pay because the end product

expect the end customer have three primary options choosing digitalization 
solution each these solutions are built underlying iot platform 
solution provided capital goods companies 
solution provided partnerships between software and capital goods 
companies 
mix and match diy approach whereby the end customer selects mix part 
solutions from third party component suppliers 
choosing any particular route has advantages and disadvantages choosing solution 
from capital goods company typically software hardware linked solution provides 
the benefit being linked company with real factory level domain knowledge they understand what happens the factory floor and some cases directly 
manufacture the machinery however some the larger players siemens and 
fanuc have historically been offering more closed systems and most capital goods 
companies are relatively new managing software business models where there 
very different culture and structuring incentives 
think some awareness exists around the challenges combining both world and 
explains several announcements over the last months partnerships between 
capital goods and software companies well the hiring high profile executive 
coming from the software world industrial companies believe the ability work 
well together could significantly beneficial both sides leading enhanced 
solution for customers however the question remains where the value added and 
who captures and could potentially concern for capital goods companies that 
are used dominating the factory floor even machines software level such plcs 
cncs for instance think many capital goods companies are currently evaluating 
how position themselves the best manner possible especially they not offer 
the full ecosystem even those who have full ecosystem such siemens are 
currently moving part their offering into subscription type business model 
more services based approach that could ultimately become efficiency based 
approach and which relatively new for the sector indeed while efficiency 
equipment was always selling argument the payment was made equipment sale 
rather than being based the efficiency the equipment operations this were 
adopted could mark shift sales strategy and the revenue generation model 
across the sector 
finally the third party component supplier approach potentially allows companies 
pick the best breed solutions for their particular needs providing more tailor made 
solution however the final solution less consistent and result there are more 
likely integration updating issues compared full ecosystem offering from 
for example siemens this increases the chances that middleware required 
interface between programs 
while software companies are perhaps best placed provide technical data capabilities 
such pattern analysis historical data big data they may lack the requisite domain 
knowledge put that data insight into action the factory floor 
challenges for suppliers digitalization solutions 
this section frame several the obstacles affecting software companies 
capital goods companies and then both groups from the perspective looking 
who best placed supply third party customers with suite digitalization 
solutions 
challenges from software viewpoint 
making the sale market software companies have traditionally sold into the 
cio department the end customer rather than managers specific engineering 
divisions software companies will have make sure they have the right contacts the 
manufacturing departments companies they can sell solutions effectively and 
fundamentally they need able speak the language the manufacturers 
view companies with existing contacts with manufacturers being better placed sell 
incremental offerings 
capital goods companies going alone software cannot offer the ecosystem without 
hardware siemens has been particularly proactive building out full suite digital 
offering with the acquisition mentor graphics the latest string acquisitions 
aimed filling gaps its offering risk the size the opportunity for software 
companies could more capital goods companies build out their own offerings and 
then seek create ecosystems whereby they offer both the software and hardware 
bundled offering several large players engaged this could create captive 
markets off limits software players that not wish acquire hardware assets and 
hence who cannot offer complete factory floor ecosystem 
challenges from capital goods viewpoint 
lack experience managing software business models the software industry can 
characterised being younger more entrepreneurial environment compared the 
manufacturing industry consequently capital goods companies may not used the 
culture and incentive structures present within the software industry and while their 
software capabilities exist they have been rather limited the control the machine 
and the execution the different steps the manufacturing process rather than 
controlling managing the entire factory ecosystem this turn could inhibit the capital 
goods companies ability attract and retain talent 
abstraction integration the history software and technology has generally been 
for software abstracted away from the hardware layer the software can 
written once and then run multiple environments can see that some the 
greatest software success stories microsoft sap oracle have benefitted from being 
platform hardware agnostic believe this could present challenge 
manufacturing environment given typically the software has been enabler for the 
machine function and tended many but not all cases attached piece 
hardware another example the shop floor comes from looking the installed base 
controllers while there certainly large installed base based systems for 
machine automation hardware agnostic the more dominant solution remains plc 
systems that are tied the hardware but seen more robust notably for the integrity 
the system uptime obviously critical manufacturing environment and 
software companies will have persuade manufacturing operations that software 
platforms can trusted software built into the hardware 
what pricing model employ for external use cases question mark remains over 
how end customers should charged bundled into existing service offering 
value added product charged separately priced one off subscriptionbased model priced outcome linked consumption basis whereby revenue 
share percentage the end customers cost savings 
challenges for both software and capital goods companies 
who owns the data hosted digital day early the topic digital 
manufacturing attended many senior figures from large cap capital goods 
companies while there seemed consensus our digital day that end customer data 
should completely remain the property the end customer the ownership 
aggregated name data issue that was less clear 
lack domain knowledge software companies seeking enter the factory setting 
and capital goods companies seeking move into software both also suffer from 
lack domain knowledge software companies may find that they require deep 
knowledge factory floor processes and how interpret data patterns real 
sense order able provide insight with regard predictive analytics the 
same time while capital goods companies may able interpret output data they 
may lack the software knowledge required able effectively process that data 
into something that interpretable 
how best drive process change discussed the note from our european capital 
goods team digital manufacturing into the light there have been multiple attempts 
merge software and hardware industries engineering some readers may remember 
the acquisition europe second largest software company baan invensys abb 
adoption company wide industrial platform the early general 
comment believe that there can problems alignment software and 
hardware engineers are often trying solve for different things typically the main 
objective plant manager factory minimise downtime the system needs 
run fast and efficiently the most reliable system possible the incentives for trying 
new things are often not that great which why our surveys typically show high 
reluctance production engineers tamper with existing installed base 
while process change may make lot sense paper have often seen that 
much more difficult drive practice the key benefit software automate and 
optimise processes and then ensure those processes are completed identical 
way every time software companies will have ensure they have senior enough buy 
customers drive the process change well the expertise manage the shift 
driving convergence between design and manufacturing departments for the benefits 
the digital factory unlocked for any particular manufacturer there needs 
working relationship not only the software side but terms designers and 
factory floor workers which relationship that has historically been weak although

see mes and plm software being key convergence zones 
the convergence capital goods and software companies trend that has been 
evolving for decade but which has been visibly increasing pace the 
acquisition plm provider ugs siemens marked the first clear sign 
that capital goods companies were looking broadening their software 
capabilities since then there have been numerous partnerships and acquisitions 
many which indicate desire capital goods companies link together 
product design and product manufacturing this section discuss why see 
software and capital goods convergence mes and plm software whether 
see software companies moving down the stack into hardware solutions and the 
trajectory convergence date 
why mes and plm 
the current environment see both software and capital goods companies 
present within the mes market dassault systemes sap aspen tech siemens 
rockwell abb whereas the plm market principally dominated software 
companies dassault systemes sap ptc autodesk though would note that 
siemens has significantly increased its exposure recent years the other hand 
capital goods companies have historically dominated suppliers factory floor 
hardware and scada software where domain knowledge critical 
believe that being able link together and close the loop between product 
conception product manufacturing and the product life cycle has scope drive 
tangible advantages both the end customer and the manufacturer addition 
achieving plant factory level automation could significantly benefit from closer 
connection between the design and the manufacturing process terms 
manufacturing optimisation preferred solution would have ecosystem 
without extensive middleware hence the convergence between engineering design and 
manufacturing operations appears natural step the long run

exhibit mes pure plays have been increasingly consolidated out 
the market 
source gartner data morgan stanley research 
the mes market growing consolidating market according data from gartner 
the mes market grew estimated notably niche pure plays 
the mes market are being increasingly acquired industrial automation firms and 
enterprise software providers the revenue share pure play mes players reduced 
significantly from whilst the share from automation 
firms increased from 
only factories have mes solution data from research and advisory firm lns 
research suggested that factories not have mes system place 
although some factories may not warrant the scale transition digital factory 
given the central role that the mes plays the digital factory think this leaves mes 
vendors with significant potential growth runway 
printing driver consolidation since printing uses templates created 
directly from cad software establishes direct link between plm software and the 
printing hardware the factory floor should printers become staple the 
commercial manufacturing environment expect greater collaboration between plm 
software providers and manufacturers optimise the manufacturing process 
software companies try acquire hardware assets and move down the 
stack 
hardware less attractive business model date software companies have opted 
for limited degree vertical integration not think likely that software 
companies acquire hardware assets for multiple reasons hardware tends more 
easily commoditised over time hardware tends lower margin business also 
with lower recurring revenues versus software hardware more capital intensive 
result not see clear rationale for software companies seeking acquire 
material hardware exposure 
however not moving down the stack into hardware poses challenges for software 
companies when comes the sale digitalization solutions including the inability 
offer full ecosystem solution factory software and hardware customers 
result see two main alternatives strategies that software companies may employ 
creating partnerships with capital goods companies 
the use integration tools apis middleware connect heterogeneous 
technologies into single platform middleware used when programming languages 
not match and require linking tool 
furthermore expect there continued consolidation software companies 
fragmented sub sectors such cad and mes where many niche players exist 
example dassault systemes has been one the more active players the software 
side and has expanded its offering through the value chain dassault has historically 
had strong offering within plm but for example acquired mes exposure 
through the acquisition intercim enabling them link plm and mes software 
together into integrated overall package dassault has since expanded the mes 
side with the acquisition apriso

develop own house software 
partner with software companies and develop working relationship and 
acquire software companies gain direct exposure 
see house development the least attractive option for capital goods companies 
given the long lead time develop sophisticated capability and because they 
typically lack domain knowledge within the software space although would note 
that initially followed this strategy with the predix platform 
based precedent arrangements capital goods companies have appeared prefer 
either partnerships with software companies and direct acquisitions build out 
their software portfolios there have also been significant disparities between capital 
goods companies how far advanced and proactive they have been terms building 
out their digital manufacturing software portfolios the specific angle they have 
followed siemens appear aim towards being more broad based providers

leadership stems from the design side the plm market where its high end catia and 
more mid market focused solidworks design software are both the leaders their 
respective markets has expanded its core plm offering encompass among 
others simulation software simulia digital manufacturing software delmia 
process management software enovia and all this sits one data backbone the 
experience platform competes with autodesk ptc and ansys but believe its 
main competition comes from the capital goods industry siemens according data 
from cambashi had market share the manufacturing plm market 
markedly ahead number siemens with 
growing organically and via into manufacturing execution has already built 
strong offering digital manufacturing with its delmia brand historically delmia 
enabled companies design and optimise production line the virtual world the

software this integration the experience platform enables design and 
manufacturing decisions taken with greater awareness and knowledge for 
example product cannot produced existing production lines does make more 
sense for the product modified the production lines even understanding what 
can built where would very challenging without this software approach 
however while delmia has its heritage the virtual world see the brand 
increasingly extending into actual production planning and logistics dassault first 
move this are think was the acquisition intercim partner pre acquisition 
intercim was the first move into manufacturing execution software mes this 
move was followed larger deal acquire apriso broaden mes 
capabilities finally has also acquired quintiq which brought supply chain and 
logistics planning all three acquisitions are managed under the delmia umbrella and 
believe move out its traditional virtual world software into planning and 
executing manufacturing and logistics the real world this shift brings the company 
into more direct competition with both erp vendors like sap both mes and supply 
chain planning and capital goods companies like siemens mes 
hardware agnostic dassault acknowledges that capital goods companies may have 
advantage integrating software and analytics back into their own hardware 
environments however most manufacturing facilities will very heterogeneous and 
this opens the market independent provider who can integrate across these 
complex landscapes the company also highlighted key technical differentiation its

manufacturing team this means that the design team could create the most optimised 
exhibit from ideation full cycle the 
aftermarket 
product but this product almost worthless cannot manufactured 
result this vision has core data backbone the experience platform 
which all its software applications sit this enables design teams create products 
while ensuring that these products fit with manufacturing plans the simulation 
software means that the products can designed more efficiently designers can test 
whether products meet specifications how much material need this product 
part withstands pressure while they are still being created more complex simulation 
reduces the need for physical prototypes the processes that need followed 
companies drive this collaboration can designed and managed enovia finally 
real world data can collected from both the products themselves iot use case

what are the data capabilities the traditional factory 
exhibit traditional factory data capabilities 
source morgan stanley research 
the traditional factory structured with isolated systems and machines connectivity 
between these machines mainly only harboured within the scada level there 
relatively limited machine machine connectivity and data analytical capabilities 
simple data analytics the factory level data capabilities mainly reside within 
scada with data collection which enables graphical analysis metrology 
equipment also plays role feeding back data into the software data flow the 
enterprise level the mes involved with data analytics but overview the 
entire factory operation rather than more granular level detail there 
limited interfacing between factory instrumentation and software systems which 
makes difficult perform root cause analysis errors 
basic system alerts although the traditional factory capable creating 
system alerts for example piece instrumentation malfunctions these alerts 
are relatively basic and are generally only descriptive diagnostic nature 
the factory floor these alerts are generated the operator level scada software 
human intervention then required rectify the issue 
limited real time data flows result mix homogeneous hardware 
without common interface although some mixture middleware and older 
technology fewer data flows exist the traditional factory data typically stored 
premise rather than the cloud the industrial internet consortium points out 
that typical factory over data generated discarded without 
attempt draw value due high storage and transport costs moreover 
reporting cycles are typically based pooling data within predefined window 
every hours result decision making largely reactive and thus the 
value data produced diluted 
what are the digital manufacturing drivers 
see the ideal position for manufacturers being capable creating low cost 
highly customised and high quality products with short time market enabling them 
flexibly meet changing trends consumer demand achieve this have seen 
manufacturers either partnering with software companies access their 
design manufacturing software capabilities acquiring expertise directly 
courtesy their scale and leading positions international capital goods companies are 
currently most active deploying digitalization solutions within their own factories 
enhance productivity beyond this think some will develop their own suite 
technological solutions bundle with hardware and sell smaller scale 
manufacturers this creates new market with new business model the scope sell 
outcomes uptime think customers ultimately care about the outcome 
hours turbine engine usage rather than product the turbine believe the 
following factors are also driving the trend towards digital manufacturing 
desire for customised products delivering large scale production customised items 
requires change the product creation process from the current industrial setup 
towards integrating product design manufacturing planning with factory floor hardware 
industrial scale roll out printers should aid larger scale product customisation 
exhibit manufacturing one the 
least digitalised industries 
source capgemini consulting mit center for digital business 
manufacturers desire for shorter time market increasing production flexibility 
and higher product quality see the convergence the hardware linked platforms 
scada and software platforms higher the value chain mes plm being integral 
towards achieving these objectives see clear value being able design products 
optimise designs once initial data received from the manufacturing process and then 
optimise the factory floor itself for the manufacturing process 
pressure manufacturers reduce costs and improve production efficiencies 
driven increasing low cost competition abroad particularly china china 
committed manufacturing digitalization and late the ministries industry 
and information technology and finance released year plan transition the 
manufacturing economy into the digital world this builds the made china 
plan which set out upgrade the manufacturing industry from low grade production 
value added production addition whilst chinese companies are increasingly 
encroaching into low medium end hardware automation offerings their software 
offerings are less mature the previous waves cost improvements introductory 
robotisation shift manufacturing low cost offshore locations are expiring the 
digital factory has the potential drive the next new long term wave 
desire from capital goods companies leverage the growth potential the 
industrial internet things where software will undoubtedly play key role the 
data management side capital goods companies could also benefit from owning 
larger proportion the manufacturing ecosystem and being able bundle hardware 
solutions with software solutions integrated within providing them with more 
defensible product offering the long term 
what are the digital manufacturing enablers 
this section outline six factors that think are actively enabling the vision 
digital manufacturing become reality aside from significant improvements 
being made the software level with new functionality and software companies 
expanding cross vertical plm tying mes see the following key 
enablers pricing cuts for cloud storage machine machine connectivity 
big data metrology technologies additive manufacturing 
technologies and sensor technologies 
cloud storage costs prices from major vendors for cloud storage have fallen 
significantly over the past years one the most notable drivers digital 
manufacturing cloud data costs our stylised traditional factory data was typically 
stored premise and data feedback loops were consequently limited the stylised 
digital factory factories run off cloud based data store and connectivity greater 
cloud data pricing charged major vendors such amazon web services aws has 
been rapidly declining over the past years aws pricing the first terabyte 
data has fallen from month late month

enhancing machine machine connectivity and enabling the industrial internet

like telit communications and blox undertake connection handling for 
heterogeneous software and hardware and perform data aggregation doing this they

advancements data analytics harnessing the power big data can provide 
valuable insights big data software seeks data mine large volumes structured 
unstructured data help identify potential insights manufacturing environment 
big data can used large quantities produced data uncover trends and useful 
insights when recalibrate machinery optimise performance that can then 
relayed for use under human intervention the longer term this data may linked 
with artificial intelligence and machine learning able drive towards more 
automated factory floor 
case study ibm spss predictive analytics software was deployed project with 
daimler production cylinder heads totalled per day and different 
variables were collected during the production and quality management processes 
implementing spss helped reduce the scrap rate the process from 
reducing quality management costs and meaning less working 
labour was required for rule creation and error reporting procedures 
implementation carried week return investment 
advancements production measurement technologies shifting from off line 
line metrology the more automated digital factory requires lesser degree 
disruption the production line with metrology solutions shifting from off line where 
the product has removed from the production line prior inspection line 
where the product inspected whilst the production line data collected from 
inspection can then through connectivity fed back into earlier stages the 
production process such that optimised production the real world can simulated

one the most significant challenges the data transfer process revolves 
around bills materials boms boms are lists materials output for different 
parts product lifecycle and include engineering bom ebom 
manufacturing bom mbom and servicing bom sbom currently companies 
have contend with different boms being created and located different 
software platforms whether that plm core erp crm mes software 
see the digital factory providing the structure for more closely knit boms 
manufacturing environment that likely demands rapid increase individually 
customised products will give rise the need for each product have separate 
customisable bom this environment boms will remain crucial element the

supplementary parts such product packaging the ebom originated within the 
heart design software typically cad plm

but altered reflect the actual parts required for manufacturing for example 
computer may require screws per the ebom but due faulty screws 
manufacturing breakages manufacture the product might require screws 
assuming average are unusable the mbom also accounts for specific parts 
that may unavailable and presents substitute parts that are available the 
mbom more detailed list parts compared the ebom originated within 
the erp software and shared with the mes for manufacturing 
sbom servicing bom serviced bom also known the maintenance bom 
this lists out parts required maintain the product through its post manufacturing 
lifecycle

present boms are compartmentalised currently boms are originated different 
software with for example the ebom being created within plm software and the 
mbom being created within erp software this approach can and historically has led 
consistency challenges for manufacturers change has processed for one 
bom there single alteration that can made change other boms they 
reside disparate software this lack consistency can lead product defects 
product revisions and sub optimal manufacturing processes 
the nirvana unify boms towards single bom drive consistency and reduce 
the costs mismatching boms the ideal for manufacturers only have deal with 
single unified bom however compartmentalisation still present because 
practical terms engineering teams work very differently manufacturing teams and 
historically plm software has not been well suited work with the more granular 
detail required mbom over ebom 
the emergence the configurable bom increasingly manufacturers are working with 
boms configurable boms these are boms that detail products required 
materials per customer specified custom product design the likely increase the 
number boms that manufacturer has deal with poses further challenge and 
makes bom consistency essential 
can digital manufacturing help would plm erp hold the single bom digital 
manufacturing likely drive increased data flows between software applications 
enabling better consistency between boms whilst not necessarily the case that 
boms will merge into single version they did combine think there would 
battle between erp providers and plm providers who would both want own the 
data underlying the bom date think plm companies have been reluctant 
move towards single bom retaining the bom your own platform helps lock 
customers your platform whilst there case for the mbom being held within plm 
software plm becoming increasingly capable mbom optimisation and could 
provide full product traceability erp providers such sap would likely want 
retain origination control the mbom keep themselves within the core the
