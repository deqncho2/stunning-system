how much have other storage vendors benefitted from disruption during the 
dell emc integration both netapp and pure storage highlighted favorable 
impact from product roadmap uncertainty and sales changes during the 
integration emc into the dell business during earnings conference calls late 
november following idc storage release took closer look idc 
external storage market share data our view according idc emc lost 
points market share the most recent quarter this from points 
market share lost each quarter since news potential acquisitions 
asset sales heated and the dell deal was announced early 
exhibit the largest share gainers the external storage market over this time 
have been pure storage market share gain each quarter and 
lesser extent netapp continues lose market share however declines 
have moderated roughly half point the two most recent quarters 
down from the prior quarters expect pure and nimble will 
continue benefit enterprise customers adopt all flash arrays for the 
majority primary storage with potential share gains from emc dell

forecast server units decline flow through the impact 
reported shipments down relative our prior forecast for flattish 
growth and lower our forecast forecast slightly below historical 
average seasonality ahead the purley launch turning better than average 
seasonality net expect shipments decline 
improvement from our expectation for decline but lower than our 
prior forecast while expect purley help spur server demand

idc reported preliminary wearables shipments increase 
exhibit but below our estimate units our view coming into 
the third quarter expected above average seasonal strength wearables 
shipments result recent product launches from apple fitbit and garmin 
and vendors shipping units ahead the holiday season however shipments 
basic wearables which primarily consists fitness bands came 
below our estimate units while smart wearable shipments came 
below our unit estimate shipments for the top vendors were 
roughly line with our forecast estimate the shortfall was 
entirely driven smaller vendors many which chose not launch new 
products this holiday season additionally the late the quarter launch new 
products from fitbit and apple limited their ability soak share from 
vendors that appear exiting the market according idc the top 
wearable vendors remained unchanged from with fitbit leading 
shipments with units share down 
followed xiaomi garmin apple and 
samsung looking expect seasonal strength 
shipments due the holiday season and increasing impact from new fitbit and 
apple products however see weaker than three year average seasonality 
due pull forward holiday sell into fitbit where model 
shipments only apple potential positive offset given model 
flat watch shipments but ceo tim cook recently highlighted that sellthrough for the apple watch during the first week holiday shopping was 
greater than any other week the product history and that apple was track 
for the best quarter ever for the apple watch
