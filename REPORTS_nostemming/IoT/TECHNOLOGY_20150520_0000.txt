wearable buyers nearly doubled the price they were willing pay this very significant

raise our base case watch estimates from the first months believe this 
remains conservative estimate demand given implies only definitely buy responses convert 
purchases assumes mix and doesn consider the increasing iphone installed base since the 
beginning the year however believe supply will significantly undershoot demand the first six months 
making our base case the most realistic outcome for shipments near term fact leave our watch unit 
estimates unchanged the june and september quarters and increased december and march quarters 
total units our bull case likely representative the shipment run rate once supply catches with 
strong demand 
see more bullish forecast annual demand assume probably responses also convert 
purchases implies and global demand for apple watch with the increasing conviction 
purchases wearables and increasing demand for watch see demand building this more bullish 
scenario 
top watch use cases expected apple said the watch accurate customizable timepiece intimate 
immediate communication device and health fitness companion their second watch keynote and the 
press release not surprisingly these three functions account for five the top six use cases surprisingly apple 
pay not more popular but think that will change more merchants adopt pay and users get into habit 
paying with their watch third party apps will take some time develop for example iphone launched 
but instagram now ranked third free app downloads did not appear until three years later

apple can tackle many the reasons not purchase apple watch the next iterations 
typically find price the number one inhibitor purchase decision and apple watch exception 
interestingly most the other top reasons for not purchasing watch can addressed with improved 
functionality consumer education and marketing the meantime the compatible iphone installed base 
newer will continue grow fact estimate will pass units the june quarter from late 
last year growing and improving third party ecosystem will also help create demand our view

samsung plans ramp investments smartwatches with focus ready for any 
emerging market trends whether fashion high tech related the company released six smartwatches 
pursuing strategy bringing products out quickly and seeing what sticks with consumers this 
strategy flooding the market with new models which worked very well with galaxy smartphones the past 
might work well with smartwatches since they may require even more customization than smartphones the 
good news that the smartwatch wars have just begun and while apple watch might the first real winner

forecasts from our hardware team also roll over the valuation period from

apple quanta the sole assembler for apple watch far and expect quanta will remain major supplier 
for apple the following generation apple watch even though apple may add new assemblers bigger 
volumes justify multiple assemblers

for lift our sales forecast factor higher than expected apple watch shipments 
forecast quanta will ship units our prior forecast estimate apple watch will make 
total sales the margin side given apple watch highly labor intensive product and 
there are upfront costs for new products expect apple watch generate very thin margins initially for

aac 
positive for aac though limited impact near term earnings due apple watch relatively small 
volumes continue believe aac will try resolve its haptics production issue soon possible meet 
apple watch demand and does not make strategic sense for apple have just one source for haptics view 
the need diversify assuming share allocation for apple watch haptics the incremental volume 
the first months suggests less than upside our current and eps estimates since apple 
watch volume relatively small comparing iphone upside our estimate still mainly come from 
potential better pricing trends from upgraded portfolio and earlier than expected adoption haptics 
solutions other non apple customers 
ase 
positive for ase but near term estimates not change ase currently the sole supplier for the 
assembly work the pcb used the apple watch using its sip technology higher watch volumes helps with 
revenues and estimate that every additional unit the watch equates upside annual sales 
additionally the higher impact might margins estimate that the current run rate ase likely still 
slightly below breakeven its watch production that likely reach breakeven and volume 
continues ramp the business should turn profitable while this all positive are not changing our 
estimates for now the issue with the ramp has been supply driven not demand look raise estimates 
when the supply chain bottlenecks get alleviated 
tpk 
tpk currently the sole supplier for touch module apple watch estimate apple watch will 
contribute tpk total revenue with incremental upside from our positive shipment

traditional watch takeaways 
traditional watches could get surprise boost from the development smartwatches into 
mainstream category the latest survey data purchase wearing intention traditional watches relation 
smartwatches showed that respondents now view purchasing wearing traditional watches 
significantly more likely this increase the survey result march surprising our view this due 
the nature the item the survey results show increase appetite for wearables well traditional 
watches and unlikely the two devices will worn simultaneously however the increase relates general 
interest the watch segment expect there correlation follow several swiss watch executives 
including nicolas hayek ceo swatch group have indicated the expectation that the wearables segment could 
provide halo effect for the traditional watch segment 
highlight this survey taken across consumers relatively small market total swiss 
watch exports key monitor over coming months will appetite for wearables and purchase behaviour 
towards the category from the larger markets europe asia think interesting that the proportion 
respondents who currently own traditional watches and are unsure future appetite wearables has now 
dropped from march 
exhibit surprisingly respondents are more likely purchase and wear traditional watches 
rce alp ise rveys rgan stan ley research 
the apple watch seen offer very good value traditional watches expect that the watch 
benefits from functionality via apple app ecosystem those surveyed march believe 
that the apple watch very good value relative traditional watches the apple watch currently offers 
thousands apps connectivity and fitness tracking which traditional watches not our view the level 
additional functionality poses the potential threat the traditional watch segment particularly within the entryto mid priced segment not the high end luxury collectibles market whilst highlight that swiss 
watchmakers have responded creating watches with greater uses contactless payment remains 
seen they can credible response smartwatches especially they not offer the level connectivity 
similar level functionality continue monitor trends more consumers receive their apple watch
