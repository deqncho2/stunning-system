surveyed key decision makers responsible for the engines the

not accessible through traditional outlets like company conversations and market research the results indicate that designers 
are incorporating connectivity products which given month

mcu companies namely microchip nxp and texas instruments are 
very strong position cross sell other products such connectivity technologies bluetooth low energy and zigbee and 
analog products that designers need develop iot applications 
texas instruments was cited survey respondents their 
preferred vendor for sourcing analog products reinforcing the 
attractive breadth their analog portfolio that includes amplifiers 
convertors power management among number other discrete 
products 
microchip came close second with survey respondents 
indicating they source their analog product needs from the company 
this implies evidence that its strategy building its analog portfolio 
organically and through smsc supertex and micrel acquisitions starting pay off addition microchip offers the full suite 
connectivity products that are essential for iot applications 
result view the company key beneficiary iot led its 
ability cross sell ancillary analog connectivity products its core 
mcu customers 
nxp preferred vendor for mcus respondents use them 
with broad portfolio across bit and importantly leading position the fastest growing segment the market namely bit 
mcus addition the company leading vendor for security for iot 
applications area where expect see increasing traction given 
the trend increasing attach connectivity with mcu applications 
finally nxp portfolio analog and connectivity products positions 
well capitalize cross selling opportunities net net think

firm for softbank group promotion iot terms 
current strategy softbank president masayoshi son has 
indicated that wants put effort into areas beyond 
smartphones where arm has dominant share over 
such networks and iot where there still room 
increase share softbank has made communications services mobile and internet services mainly internet advertising into earnings pillars but has great expectations for 
growth the iot field however expect difficult 
generate earnings from iot services due low arpu 
and thus softbank likely aim secure core technology 
indispensable terminals that could see explosive growth 
the iot era thereby obtaining license revenue construct global earnings base 
evolved currently the mobile communications business the 
core softbank earnings and assets but that due the acquisition vodafone and sprint and has only been the case for the last 
years 
softbank major businesses have undergone dynamic change since 
the company was founded initially softbank distributed packaged software for pcs and published related works the company 
then acquired based yahoo and ramped yahoo japan becoming internet business and then with the acquisition vodafone 
morphed again into mobile internet firm its core softbank not mobile operator but internet company and considering son ambition for softbank expand cloud iot operations 
his decision secure the core technology that arm has easy

position internet company that platform holding down 
overwhelming resources 
softbank stance has been show respect for arm current management team and strategy press conference the time the 
acquisition son indicated that would involved drawing 
arm longer term strategy ahead also stated that wanted 
strengthen arm development organization and accelerate operations stating that wanted double the development organization centering engineering delisting arm create environment where the firm can dedicate itself the business without being 
preoccupied with quarterly earnings should positive 
not expect much the way near term synergies from the 
acquisition that due the boost softbank earnings from newly 
consolidating arm being small and there being only limited synergies between arm and softbank existing operations more than 
evaluating whether there are short term synergies believe what 
most important understand son medium long term 
vision and watch see whether post merger integration successful measures expand operations and retain engineers who are 
especially crucial given that arm development oriented firm
