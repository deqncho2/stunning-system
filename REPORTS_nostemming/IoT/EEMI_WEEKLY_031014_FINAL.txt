the industrial internet things iiot 
what the industrial internet things iiot 
refers the emerging practice connecting 
intelligent physical entities such sensors devices 
machines assets and products each other 
internet services and applications industrial 
companies can use information from these connected 
devices lower costs optimize processes and 
create new applications services business models 
example connecting machines the factory 
floor directly the internet plant operators can

applications among the large industrial automation 
companies arc believes emerson and are two 
the pioneers this point emerson offering 
lower cost wireless pervasive sensing product that 
takes place outside the traditional dcs also 
developing highly pre configured point solution that 
provides ongoing service business 
machines real time basis and identify 
replacement needs ahead time this could not only 
reduce maintenance costs but also maximize uptime 
and thus minimize the equipment life cycle cost 
ownerships 
how does iot work the industrial space 
according arc the industrial internet things 
architecture built upon four sub components 
intelligent assets typically machines with sensors 
processors memory and software defined behavior 
data communication infrastructure network 
connect the intelligent assets cloud based big data 
storage analytics software which converts data 
into meaningful information and enables asset 
system optimization and descriptive predictive and 
prescriptive analytics and finally people need 
have access the information 
what the best way approach this market 
given that the major automation players are likely not 
ready commit large investments this field yet 
arc believes that forming partnerships and 
potentially bolt acquisitions could the best way 
for the majors explore the iiot opportunities this 
stage 
this point craig noted that rok continues 
work closely with cisco the iiot area these 
two companies together with other software and 
hardware providers have developed the ethernet 
platform which open industrial communication 
protocol that allows all participants design their 
industrial control software based the same 
standards leveraging its relationship with cisco 
rok also working solutions connect the 
industrial control systems enterprise level erps 
additionally cisco expertise cyber security could 
also help rok tackle one the key concerns that 
prevent industrial companies adopt iiot security 
cisco believes that the security challenge can 
met iot has potential grow global corporate profits

thoughts schneider acquisition invensys 
source company data morgan stanley research 
what industrial internet things means for 
manufacturers and automation suppliers cisco 
estimates trillion benefits from iiot for the 
manufacturing sector over the next years driven 
the combination increased revenues and lower 
costs 
who are the major players date the most 
aggressive pursuers this market are niche players 
such opto axeda and ils technology which 
are mainly focusing machine machine 
overall arc believes this additive acquisition 
with minimal overlap and substantial scope for 
synergies arc also believes that the acquisition could 
potentially change the competitive landscape for existing 
process players abb emerson honeywell the 
combined company now could bring much more the 
table 
invensys has large installed base through its 
foxboro dcs and triconex safety lines 
the company wonderware product also the 
market leader industrial hmi software while its 
energy control portfolio eurotherm could also 
added schneider home industrial businesses 
morgan 
stanley 
research 
march 
multi industry 
the process market schneider was traditionally 
very focused the metals and mining market while 
invensys strength the heavy process and 
pulp and paper markets will diversify its end market 
exposure 
the other hand the acquisition could also 
bring schneider energy management offerings 
invensys customers and pull through schneider 
drives and controller products additionally 
integrating the wonderware mes platform into 
schneider plc pac offering via struxureware the 
combined company could potentially outside the 
traditional manufacturing disciplines into areas like 
power management and building automation driving 
more connectivity throughout the rest the 
enterprise 
thought emerson plan launch its own 
programmable automation controllers 
arc believes the key driver for emerson offer 
its own pac line customers demand for 
single standalone emerson drive and control 
solution while schneider acquisition invensys 
has also likely accelerated the process 
the pac launch logical extension given that 
emerson current products drives and servos 
already have embedded plc functions the company 
could just scale these techniques and leverage 
the skill set developed from building its dcs 
systems delta the process market 
arc expects emr new plc products mainly 
focus the machinery market and select targeted 
verticals where does not need compete head

controls and safety systems convergence and impact security providers arc senses that it slowly evolving 
process and going incumbent upon all the majors have both standalone and integrated solutions this light 
most the large control companies have their safety solution and they will sell either standalone combined product 
depending customers preference for the companies that continue sell safety stand alone product this market 
not going away fast either because install base the king this marketplace customers are very slow evolve from their 
existing suppliers will not likely see any revolutionary changes other than more companies offering converged 
security control system option 
manufacturing capex likely tilt towards software hardware while the mix hardware revenues total 
automation solution has been declining software and services have become larger components most the automation 
companies got into the software business for additional revenue opportunities but they still need hardware base 
although the supplier software and hardware not have the same however the hardware companies also have 
the opportunities sell software their installed base leveraging open standards customers now can have different 
software and hardware vendors the same time this could benefit companies like given that its proficy platform could 
play non install base the customer convinced that has the best solution having said that for the hardware 
that already exists the install base most hardware suppliers have similar types portfolios 
the aforementioned scenario does schneider now have advantage the plc market given the huge 
wonderware installed base install base the king are not likely see any substantial shift other suppliers the 
near term because schneider now owns wonderware having said that the future when schneider needs upgrade the 
legacy installed base customers will likely evaluate different options however schneider now has the advantage 
single source solution which could make more competitive over the long term schneider could combine the wonderware 
platform with its structureware software for building automation and power mgmt which going drive more connectivity 
throughout the rest the enterprise that really where are going see the difference 
rok and abb solutions backlogs were pretty weak last quarter what trends are you seeing project activity 
jan was broadly flat with bit more growth feb globally however varies end market abb higher exposure 
mining and marine end markets could partly attributed the weakness seen during 
did foxboro underinvest and lose share over the last years might have been impacted due ownership 
uncertainties and whether going migrate another dcs system however arc believes following the acquisition 
announcement those uncertainties have largely gone away and everything has kind been reenergized and recharged 
potential for one two chinese automation player become global competitor the next few years arc does 
not expect major chinese players such hollysys become global player nor offer full portfolio products and 
solutions any time the near future
