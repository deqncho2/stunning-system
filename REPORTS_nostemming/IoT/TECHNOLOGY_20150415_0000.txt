survey analysis 
current wearable landscape 
wearables are becoming mainstream devices our alphawise survey adults said they own 
wearables which today consist mostly fitness trackers and some smartwatches generally consider 
the key inflection point for technology adoption growth for other technologies typically accelerated 
passed this point saw this acceleration adoption the early with notebook penetration pcs and 
around with smartphone penetration handsets sales digital music took over years exceed 
penetration but only four years move from over the adoption rate wearables today 
double our survey just three months ago suggesting fitness trackers were popular purchase and gift this past 
holiday season 
exhibit wearable ownership increased the last months reaching today

penetration all major countries according our global survey august also have continue 
monitor the sustainability usage especially many respondents just started using these devices the last 
three months however this proves sustainable mainstream product category would expect

fitbit the most popular wearable and samsung the biggest share gainer recently fitbit holds 
ownership share today down one point the last three months samsung tripled its share the last three 
months potentially helped the samsung gear launch november among fitness trackers 
garmin and nike gained share while basis and jawbone lost share among smartwatches and motorola 
gained share google ownership share increased slightly though not think glass penetration high 
instead believe some android wear owners may associating their wearable with google instead

months since our december survey believe this due high new user adoption rate evidenced 
point increase wearables with months life the other hand encouraging for the category 
that respondents have worn their current wearables for least two years this speaks the sustainability 
this product category which was surprise our first survey back august

now worn their devices for over years

wearable purchase intention 
one third respondents plan purchase wearables purchase intention tripled the last three months 
again indicating wearables have become mainstream product respondents who chose definitely would not 
buy dropped points and probably would buy gained points suggesting people that once thought 
they would never use these products are now considering them

purchasers are willing spend for high quality products positive for apple and gopro average 
respondents said they will spend their next wearable believe this significant given the cheapest 
popular fitness trackers cost and exceed only the high end apple iphone users were willing 
spend more average this likely reflects the relatively affluent apple user base and bodes well 
for apple watch which starts also take this positive for consumer electronic devices like gopro

apple implications 
apple benefits from stronger wearable demand the percentage respondents planning purchase 
apple watch more than doubled from december more than our march survey 
looking just the compatible iphone base apple watch unit demand increased compared 
our last survey extrapolate watch demand using only survey responses from iphone users since the 
watch only compatible with iphone newer this analysis indicates watch demand over higher 
than three months ago for reference only model watch shipments globally for 
revenue assuming asp which likely conservative given apple announced watch pricing 
average gross margin expect watch add about eps our bull case assumes additional 
watch revenue roughly total units asp over which could more than double 
watch eps contribution given higher margins 
watch supports our platform thesis for apple view the success apple watch one several key 
indicators that will convince investors that apple has the most valuable technology platform with loyal repeat 
users that purchase multiple devices and services and that its total addressable market expanding with 
watch followed healthkit homekit carplay apple etc key new market opportunities recently 
increased our aapl price target believe its multiple can rate line with other 
technology platform companies

apple has the highest purchase intention share among smartwatches our survey which was 
conducted after apple watch keynote march wearable purchasers chose apple down from 
three months ago believe this may reflect the fact that the apple watch only works with iphone newer 
and that pricing higher than some the other smartwatches although apple watch purchase intention share 
fell the latest survey the increased overall desire purchase wearables meant demand increased 
watches and now accounts for much higher portion our total estimate watch shipments 
and the first months compared demand based our december survey

compatibility hurdles

apple halo effect shines through among respondents intending purchase wearables those that 
already own wearables apple devices are more likely purchase apple watch believe users that are 
familiar with wearable use cases and apple products and ios app store ecosystem are more willing invest

and increases among iphone users its share among all wearable purchasers

samsung implications 
wearables could increase brand loyalty for samsung saw the biggest increase purchase intention 
share the survey from six points samsung strategy wearables less about market share and 
profits our view but more about capturing consumer loyalty and brand its distinct brand and design focus 
combined with its engineering prowess allows release wearable devices into the market fast pace while 
keeping margins check 
samsung expanding its wearables portfolio the company entered the smartwatch market early 
september and capitalized the popular health and fitness aspect wearables expanded four 
models including the popular gear which doubles full standalone phone with its built 
technology and the gear most demand came primarily from the korea and western europe samsung 
plans provide upgrades its existing running models this year different price points the 
marketplace well introduce new concept wearables with its own innovative features 
garmin implications 
garmin gains modest share but sees the market becoming more competitive garmin share among 
current wearable owners increased from the latest survey purchase intention decreased however 
from increased advertising the end the year along with new product vivosmart and discounts 
the vivofit likely helped garmin gain share during the holiday season although its investments appear 
have come the expense fitness segment margins mentioned our earnings note 
believe the fitness band market will increasingly competitive something which the decreased

traditional watch implications 
higher purchase intention wearables risk the traditional watch brands believe with onethird respondents planning purchase wearable devices this suggests the level purchase intention 
the last three months caveat our sample across consumers relatively small market for the swiss 
technology brands april 
watch industry accounts for all exports but think the data directionally similar other regions 
given increased awareness the wearables category 
there clear picture from our survey show whether consumers will deterred from buying 
traditional watch although expect are interesting tipping point our survey results show 
that wearable buyers owners are still likely purchase traditional watches however the majority those 
surveyed who already own traditional watch are unsure with regards future appetite this key monitor 
believe far wearables fitness tracking devices have been primarily bands which sit neatly alongside 
traditional watches with larger devices with more functionality this becomes more difficult expect 
exhibit not clear whether consumers will deterred from buying traditional watch not with 
the choice wearables this stage 
rce alp ise rvey rgan stan ley research 
the apple watch ranks well terms value for money this shows strong appetite for additional 
functionality our view given the premium price point the apple watch and the view across our survey 
respondents that this seen good value think this likely provide risk for the traditional watch 
brands particularly the entry level more commoditized segment think the high end collectibles market 
largely immune given different purchase criteria viewed product that holds its value long term
