consumer engagement remains surprisingly high for existing users users that wear their wearable all the 
time actually increased from however other users are wearing their devices slightly less 
frequently while not all the people that try these devices will sustain their initial enthusiasm think the fact

apple took share from smaller players surprisingly fibit the historical leader wearables maintained 
ownership share despite apple share gains fact the top five vendors all maintained gained share and 
apple growing user base came the expense less established players the market 
while the survey results are constructive for the leading vendors the results are likely surprising some 
investors fitbit reported shipments which higher than sell and buy side estimates apple 
watch shipments yet apple has higher ownership share see exhibit below see combination factors 
driving this dynamic apple sales the june quarter was effectively all sell out since they mostly distributed 
the watch through their own stores contrast fitbit reported mostly sell figure which included channel 
restocking the street likely underestimated watch sales now believe gaap revenue was north 
and there additional revenue that was deferred similar other apple products this suggests watch 
unit demand may have been north though still lower than fit sales apple watch sales may have 
maintained its demand run rate through the month july when this survey was the field fitbit may have

traditional watch takeaways 
the data for how wearables change the user likelihood using traditional watches remains mixed 
the number respondents who already own wearable and are significantly more likely purchase wear 
traditional watch has increased july from may and march whilst initially surprising 
note that this continues echo sentiments some swiss watch industry leaders that the popularity wristworn wearables would provide halo effect for the watch category 
for the first time look the purchasing wearing intent traditional watches respondents 
who not currently own wearable device respondents who fall that category are significantly 
more likely purchase wear traditional watches from may march this could further 
support the possibility that the popularity wrist worn wearables adds general interest the watch 
category 
the number non wearable owners who are significantly less likely purchase wear traditional 
watches increasing this could suggest that more people who currently not wear watches might 
more interested smartwatches whilst note that the data continues mixed and too early draw 
conclusions think there risk that non watch wearers could postpone purchase low mid priced 
luxury watch purchase smartwatch that traditional watches could lose share 
the number respondents who view the apple watch very good value broadly flat july 
survey those surveyed may but those who view the apple having good value has 
increased back from may march expect that wearers value the technological 
capabilities and connectivity the apple watch swatch payment capable smartwatch will released soon
