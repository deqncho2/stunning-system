the residential sector often overlooked climate change 
discussions despite contributing global emissions 
this report examine four primary levers for reducing consumer 
energy use home with corresponding investment implications 
analyzed four key available and evolving levers for consumers 
improve energy efficiency and reduce overall energy use home 
these levers will likely see more rapid growth driven increasing consumer 
awareness improved economics and technological advancement 
use less energy more with less reducing energy use through 
more efficient appliances and led lighting 
conserve energy through improving insulation and fenestration 
reduce needs for heating cooling and lighting 
iii monitor automate rely demand response connected smart 
home appliances gadgets and systems optimize energy use 
use renewable energy install solar panels home simply make 
choice buy electricity from sources with higher renewable integration 
there are signs that consumers are increasingly aware the impact 
climate change and are willing take actions both for economic and 
philosophical reasons consumers have demonstrated willingness 
consider the long term benefits and total cost ownership their purchase 
decisions over half the consumers countries agree that climate 
change will worsen their way life within their lifetime and close are 
willing pay more for more energy efficient products greendex 
consumers likely derive value from increased convenience and control 
provided tech innovations and internet things aside from potential 
energy savings for example led lighting adding functionality beyond that 
the incandescent bulbs replacing connected devices and demand 
response are increasing transparency and opening new possibilities with 
such emergent technologies consumers are willing consume less 
electricity during peak hours return for discount and are willing 
change the way they manage their appliances via smart home systems 
believe that consumer actions addressing energy use and thus 
climate change have strong investment implications sectors involving 
household electronics renewables and building materials may materially 
impacted identify nearly stocks total that are positively exposed

consumer actions may potentially motivate businesses better incorporate climate sustainability into their 
products and operations this report examine the energy efficiency improvement and emission 
reduction opportunities within the physical structure the home the drivers for consumer behaviors shift 
and the investment implications our primary focus will the and will reference international 
comparisons where available 
there are both compelling economic and environmental reasons for consumers change their 
behavior and reduce their energy consumption home consumers have demonstrated willingness 
consider the long term benefits and total cost ownership tco their purchase decisions for instance over 
surveyed consumers globally were willing pay more for energy saving products exhibit 
recent morgan stanley alphawise survey consumers expressed interest adopting smart home

this further supported government policies around the world putting priority energy 
efficiency investment end use energy efficiency sometimes considered source negawatts 
freeing system wide power generation and transmission capacity for other productive uses and potentially 
contributing greater energy independence relevant policies can range from minimum energy performance 
standards building codes mandatory product labeling energy savings obligations economic 
incentives over half the world nations have national energy efficiency laws some kind the the 
energy efficiency directive lays out the goal for energy distributors and retail energy sales companies 
reach energy savings per year which they can achieve taking measures such improving heating 
systems installing double glazed windows insulating roofs the more than states have set 
mandatory energy efficiency targets for utilities and efficiency program administrators china the energy 
efficiency pioneering program identifies leading products manufacturers and infrastructure help inform 
national standards best practices and financial rewards further the energy saving and emission reduction 
fund provincial municipal levels supports initiatives such building energy efficiency monitoring 
the economic context 
the our economists expects record levels liquidity funded income versus debt along with 
further strengthening driven the improved buying power the dollar and additional energy savings 
continue drive consumer spending the recovery over the next few years while much the 
domestic momentum driven the consumer growth real disposable income expected 
slow alongside slowing pace jobs gains that only partially mitigated improved wage trends 
still these dynamics are enough support moderate pace spending finally while the early 
recovery from the financial crisis predominantly benefitted wealthy households are seeing some 
improvement the broader base economic autumn outlook sobering supply side 
consumers increasing disposable income tends correspond spending durable goods 
over the past year low gasoline prices freed disposable income that allowed consumers 
significantly increase spending durable goods according our economists annual what 
consumers want durable goods typically show high elasticity demand relative disposable income 
consumers also rapidly reduced spending repairs appliances and instead increased their 
spending new appliances this trend held the first half but has slightly reversed 
recent months consumers doubt continue reap the rewards sustained depressed gasoline 
prices our economists expect real disposable personal income increase even more than 
yoy 
consumers are most likely make appliance purchases and invest home systems when 
moving into new home according our economics team this spring was the best home selling 
season since the homebuilders survey has also been running year highs and mortgage 
applications are the rise while september new home sales were reported this week lower than 
expected this contrasts with the stronger housing starts and existing home sales reported the previous 
week existing home sales particular were stronger than expected september and were just shy 
the eight year high july 
europe consumer spending supported sharp fall energy bills and improving labor 
market conditions has been the key driver the euro area recovery far with particularly 
strong gains the start the year and during the summer amidst falling inflation growing disposable 
income has been quickly spent boosting demand for fuel and car sales but also for other durable goods 
such households equipment and appliances whose gains have exceeded the average retail sales 
increase looking ahead uncertainties exist about how consumers will react likely acceleration 
inflation next year indeed real disposable income probably will slow from likely this 
year however this still decent gain and should remain underpinned likely further drop 
unemployment and moderate fiscal easing following years restraint the latest consumer plans for 
major purchases months ahead are reassuring least for now and broadly line with the average

conserve energy 
improving insulation and fenestration are the two main methods for consumers conserve energy home 
through making their homes more weatherproof 
insulation helps conserve energy the home and also makes the inside occupied space 
less exposed weather changes and thus decreases the need for heating and cooling there 
are many types insulation methods available the market such blanket batts and 
rolls concrete block insulation insulating concrete blocks foam loose fill and blown 
reflective systems and vast variety materials can used for insulation such 
fiberglass minerals foam boards polystyrene cementitious etc most materials are 
commonly used construction 
similarly energy efficient windows doors and skylights known fenestration can also 
lower home heating cooling and lighting expenses retrofitting inefficient windows 
adding storm windows caulking weatherstripping even blinds and draperies can help 
buildings resist the impact from weather 
remodeling will gradually take more share the overall weatherization market new constructions 
especially multi family buildings usually need follow building codes with minimum insulation requirements 
existing houses and multi family buildings especially older ones that have more potential for efficiency 
improvement believe that major insulation improvement for existing buildings usually takes place during 
remodeling which presumably occurs when the home changes hands the long run increased consumer 
awareness government subsidies and increased energy costs may also drive consumers remodel their 
current home for energy conservation more frequently 
for existing homes fact sealing and insulation improvement may not difficult timeconsuming most consumers may expect the epa has published the estimates shown exhibit 
which states that basic sealing and insulation projects for typical household may take only days with 
growing consumer awareness and economic drivers including government utility sponsored rebate 
programs more remodeling for efficiency improvement can expected according huntsman insulation 
company residential insulation typically features payback period years 
exhibit only days required for typical sealing and insulation home improvement projects

smart appliances connected home 
emerging connected home technology may also help reduce energy consumption home while 
people can make conscious decisions make more efficient use energy growing category innovations 
namely smart connected home systems and products may better suited for the job while there are 
many different definitions for what qualifies connected home product this report focus those that 
are capable data monitoring and collection environment sensing two way communications and some 
extent automated actions 
believe there material opportunity sell connected home products that offer consumers the 
ability conserve energy manage their energy use different ways and provide more information 
for consumers while from the consumer perspective the idea smart connected home primarily making 
people lives easier through automation there are obvious energy efficiency benefits 
automated scheduling could reduce the unnecessary energy consumption when human 
user cannot access the device the time when its functions are completed

appliances run unnecessarily 
combined with demand response connected home systems can effectively schedule

use renewable energy 
the final lever for consumers reduce their household carbon footprint source their electricity from lowcarbon fuels though not available everywhere consumers certain regions can opt buy power from 
energy supplier who uses renewable power generation invest solar panels for their own private use 
both options rely heavily local policy infrastructure and consumer affordability 
buying renewable electricity 
consumers increasingly have choice which electricity supplier purchase power from with 
utility deregulation taking place many countries the for example states have deregulated the 
electric utility industry july alongside the emergence intermediates such choose energy well 
more disclosure from suppliers consumers are equipped decide whether their power supplied from 
renewable sources 
one common question consumers have bear higher costs they decide use greener 
electricity the answer for now least the result falling costs and higher efficiencies 
due rapid technology improvements renewables have become increasingly economic certain markets 
our utilities team has developed its own levelized cost energy lcoe estimates for different generation types 
the based current commodity forwards and cost trends exhibit the results show that wind and 
solar costs will likely able remain competitive even following step down government subsidies our 
view 
exhibit the the levelized cost renewables attractive with without incentives 
rce rgan stan ley research 
worth pointing out that increase demand for green retail electricity does not immediately 
translate into changes the supply side the source electron not traceable and the grid neutral 
the source electricity generation the for example when consumers choose buy green electricity 
the actual transaction paying for the cost the utility either purchase electricity from renewable generation 
plants purchase recs renewable energy certificates summary the near term consumers shifting 
more renewable electricity does not change the electricity production but over time the increase demand for 
renewables could have impact the power supply landscape that said policy and regulation requirements 
will likely more important 
sustainable and responsible november 
further renewable generation usually enjoys fiscal subsidies production tax credits ptc 
lifted then the economics may change the negative impact may limited and differ region costs 
renewable technology are rapidly declining due turbine technology improvements believe wind 
economics the midwest and portions the southwest can remain superior gas and solar plants

distributed solar generation 
with distributed rooftop solar panel installation consumers various regions now have choice 
directly generate renewable electricity for home use while cutting energy bills driven technology 
advancement scale increase and upstream supply increase the installation and operation maintenance costs 
have been drastically going down recent years certain areas the such california hawaii new 
jersey and massachusetts distributed solar already cost competitive with the traditional power grid even 
without any subsidies 
there cause for optimism considering the fact that current penetration still very low coupled with 
strong policy support and compelling economics california where most rooftop solar panels are 
installed the penetration has reached only residential rooftops northeastern states such new 
york new jersey and connecticut are also deploying solar while not expect regulated utilities 
participate directly distributed solar deployments see the potential for some benefit from increased 
distribution investment opportunities required integrate distributed solar into the grid 
expect potentially rapid growth for residential solar the morgan stanley blue paper solar 
power energy storage policy factors improving economics analysts identified potential residential solar market for the the wide range mainly driven the uncertainties 
investment tax credit itc subsidies and possible utility fixed charges for net metering solar penetration

over the past few years deployment residential solar has also been strong europe but has 
experienced recent slowdown recent subsidy cuts the both large and small solar projects may 
negatively impact solar builds the renewable obligation scheme was closed new solar installations

remained healthy renewable legislation reforms that took effect last august introduced new self consumption

energy storage could play important role distributed solar deployment the key issue solar 
energy its intermittency and temporal mismatch between energy demand and the availability sunlight 
currently most consumers with rooftop solar power are using the grid battery selling oversupplied solar 
the grid during the day and buying electricity back from the grid evening peak times for example 
distributed energy storage solution achieve self sufficient power generation home tesla has 
unveiled its home energy storage product the powerwall the powerwall home storage product will sold for 
including installation which the company believes cost decline over prior generations 
storage tesla ceo elon musk who also sits the scty board has said that every solarcity solar installation 
will come with battery within years however the cost install energy storage single homes still 
rather high exhibit believe the more likely scenario would for utilities third parties operate 
scaled energy storage facilities serving the entire electric grid rather than single households the probability 
consumers going off grid relatively small unless catalysts take place such net metering policy being 
retracted utilities charging high fixed rate fee for solar users remain the grid

wind unlikely have residential application apart from solar consumers wind resource rich regions 
can also consider installing small wind farms however without scale installation and operation are still 
prohibitively costly and are less likely materialize any time soon 
net metering policy plays significant role residential renewable deployment the states 
change net metering policies such that grid fees are charged solar customers distributed solar economics 
could less attractive excluding hawaii states customers who install distributed solar power are 
able eliminate all nearly all their entire utility bill this regulatory treatment more favorable than that 
received large centralized power plants there have been active regulatory proceedings many these 
states which utilities often seek put place significant fixed fees for solar customers arguing that those 
customers should pay share the cost maintaining the grid generally speaking these efforts utilities 
have either been wholly unsuccessful have resulted fixed fees that represent small portion the grid 
cost typically borne utility customer however greater levels fixed charges levied solar customers 
could significantly impact the margins solar solutions providers and some cases such charges could result 
state becoming wholly uneconomic for residential solar see such outcome unlikely given strong 
state level policy support for solar 
investment implications 
most exposed sectors 
utilities limited participation distributed renewable development but can have higher 
capex through distribution grid upgrades penetration increases 
residential solar developers directly participate development distributed solar and 
industrials manufacturers solar panels inverters and energy storage 
long term value drivers 
policy support residential solar continued governmental financial incentives and policy 
support for household solar installment would major positive for solar installment 
significant reduction battery costs increase energy density and reduction battery 
costs will make distributed energy more viable and support further growth 
increase retail electricity prices and net metering fixed charge consumers will 
motivated move off grid the cost staying grid becomes sufficiently high this 
probably multi decade trend rather than near term

initial price capital expense the average consumer typically price sensitive purchase 
prices more efficient appliances better insulation for example are still evidently higher 
than other options consumers may not make the more energy efficient choice price 
reductions driven technology improvement scale and policy support for example should 
lead greater consumer adoption electricity rates will also influence payback periods there 
are also special financing mechanisms being developed such bill financing which 
form loan help utility customers overcome this potential obstacle 
product availability increased convenience and availability products should encourage 
more consumers choose more energy efficient solutions 
product information clearer product information about environmental impact will enable 
consumers make more informed decisions and more certain about the benefits their 
actions

events will potentially teach consumers about the impact climate change and encourage 
them take action home upgrades may fact become necessary maintain comfort and 
control energy costs

consumers will more inclined take measures curtail energy spending 
total cost ownership attractive total cost ownership one the benefits energyefficient solutions when making purchase decisions many consumers may not well 
informed fully equipped make cost benefit analysis increased availability such 
information product packaging advertising should drive consumer behavioral changes
