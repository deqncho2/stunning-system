also worked with alphawise help provide greater insights corporate 
strategies straight from the source summarize our key findings below 
productivity improvement was the second most cited strategic focus for both 
large enterprises and smes 
large enterprises and smes highlight productivity improvement one 
their top three priorities terms key strategic focus for the next two three 
years addition business restructuring was the third most cited strategic focus for 
smes believe that business restructuring would also materially improve 
productivity hence these survey results suggest that productivity 
improvement likely accelerate further japan for both large enterprises and 
smes 
the case large enterprises the most cited strategic focus was expansion into 
international markets however for smes this was the lowest strategic focus and 
hence this area showed the largest divergence between large and smaller 
enterprises this not surprising given the high overseas revenue exposure large 
japanese companies compared with smes for smes customer acquisition and 
retention was the most cited strategic focus for large enterprises employee 
retention was the least cited strategic focus just whereas was cited 
focus smes this suggests that the labour market pressures associated 
with the low unemployment rate are impacting smes more than larger firms
