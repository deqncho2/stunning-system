trade policy under abenomics 
japan government views free trade agreements positive for productivity gains and has been proactively pursuing economic 
cooperation with other countries under abenomics the ministry economy trade and industry identifies four 
channels which free trade agreements lead rising productivity market expansion the removal trade and investment 
barriers enlarges the market and results economies scale promotion competition inflows cheaper goods 
services and the entry foreign firms encourage competition the domestic market diffusion technology the entry 
overseas managers and technicians allows valuable business expertise and technology spill over into the host country 
systemic innovation the process negotiating free trade agreements allows member countries share and transplant 
knowhow for more efficient policy and regulatory architecture

foreign visitors japan set the goal raising the ratio trade conducted with free trade agreement fta signatories from 
august japan has already implemented signed epas economic partnership 
agreements addition the abolition reduction tariffs provided ftas these include intellectual property protection 
and investment rules with countries and regions the exit from the trans pacific partnership tpp has made harder

implications higher productivity growth for monetary policy 
our view the relationship between productivity growth and inflation similar the boj with other things equal higher 
productivity growth exerts downward pressure prices the short term but this not the case the long run demand 
will react positively exert upward pressure inflation the higher potential growth will also raise the natural rate 
interest which would enhance monetary stimulus this view summarized the latest july outlook report 
meanwhile the increase labour participation women and seniors that has become clear recently well firms 
strengthening efforts absorb upward pressure costs prices raising productivity are likely weaken upward 
pressure wages and prices the short term noted earlier from longer term perspective however the two 
aforementioned factors are expected increase upward pressure wages and prices specifically such moves may 
alleviate structural problems including decline the labour force and raise the productivity japan economy 
whole thereby strengthening its growth potential quite few corporate managers have relatively low growth 
expectations due part the population decline firms spending behaviour can expected become active the 
economy growth potential rises addition the natural rate interest increases together with the rise the growth 
potential japan economy the effects the bank monetary easing are likely enhanced 
our scenario exhibit realized would expect the boj start normalize the current policy over the medium term 
some point during gradually raising short term policy rates and allowing wider fluctuations long term yields 
the boj has already started slow the pace expanding its balance sheet but over the medium term the boj may consider 
lifting the current overshooting commitment once the japan style core cpi touches even for short period time also 
expect the boj start taper its equity etf purchases over the medium term although not expect sell etfs for 
the foreseeable future

moved substantially lower 
second think there measurement issue purchasing power parity ppp rates that use usd conversions local currency gdp

sufficiently reflect differences service quality japan service quality per price unit high and the cost the same quality service 
therefore cheaper japan other countries particularly emerging ones often necessary pay more than the displayed price

growth thereby driving and hence nominal long term rates 
but there less focus macroeconomic factors the jgb 
rates what does higher productivity 
mean for jgb yields 
market currently however our discussions with investors 
house traders sales staff and other real world practitioners over 
the past several years indicate that attention has been focused 
mostly the boj investor supply demand trends and overseas 
the net upshot likely lower for longer scenario for jgb 
developments with domestic macroeconomic considerations seem 
yields the term premium priced into interest rates remains 
ingly only secondary interest any 
minimal due support from tight supply demand 
the quick monthly market survey bonds has since shown 
what our view the jgbs over the longer term from long 
sharp decline the percentage investors citing economic trends 
term perspective our economists expect the boj lift its overshoot 
the factor which they intend pay greatest attention over 
commitment once the japan style core cpi touches even for 
six month horizon with the dominant themes instead being boj mon 
short period time meaning that will conduct balance sheet nor 
etary policy overseas interest rate movements and bond market 
malization the long term future however our economists also 
supply demand see exhibit 
expect conducted only gradually moreover expect 
domestic investors resume their accumulation jgb exposure 
this might seem puzzling overseas investors accustomed 
yields rise gradually such don expect sharp repricing the 
viewing bond markets terms fundamentals but fact 
term premium component even from long term perspective 
perfectly understandable given the massive scale the boj 
intervention exhibit and exhibit show the results 
however our economists expect the boj start raise the short 
regression explaining the jgb yield terms the expected 
term policy rate gradual pace and allow wider fluctuations 
growth rate the expected inflation rate and boj driven supply 
long term yields during the boj starts raise short term 
demand factor while the expected growth rate has clear explanatory 
policy rates even gradual pace that will likely lead higher rate 
power over long term periods the regression which only uses recent 
expectations particularly for short medium term parts the 
data suggests that the supply demand factor has had far the 
yield curve 
greatest explanatory power with the expected growth rate seeming 
have little explanatory power with respect year yield levels 
our economists are correct the upshot would gradual rise 
long term yields they believe would possible for the boj raise 
given the remaining large residuals both regression results more 
short term yields most during given our econo 
over the other factors should have meaningful explanatory power 
mists long term macro expectations and their boj policy outlook our

what does higher productivity mean for jgb yields the near

they attempt predict what the central bank might next but 
observed cpi all items less fresh food exceeds percent and stays 
japan current situation course somewhat out the ordinary 
above the target stable manner there appears very little 
given that current underlying inflation remains far from the boj

factors such productivity growth the near term 
should also noted that the boj cited labour productivity 
improvements factor behind the recent sluggishness inflation 
improving productivity might only start viewed relevant 
its july outlook for economic activity and prices report saying that 
jpy rates after the boj begins take clear steps towards exit 
firms have been making efforts absorb upward pressure costs 
from ultra accommodative monetary policy the boj can eventually 
prices raising productivity through labour saving and efficien 
embark upon fed like rate hike process due further improve 
improving investment this should course expected 
ments the economy output gap generating upward pressure 
translate into higher potential growth rate the longer run but

framework the extent that prevents inflation from quickening 
envisaged equilibrium natural level for the long run rate 
summarize even higher productivity growth does exert cereven under such scenario however the boj will likely remain bound

key conclusions 
the roe msci japan has increased from narrowing the gap versus msci 
world from show that msci japan industry groups are already characterized 
improvement roe versus peers the last five years 
rising operating margins via higher sales and improved cost discipline lower corporate tax impact and 
falling interest and other non operating expenses have been the key drivers japan roe improvement 
our base case forecast that japan roe reaches and parity with msci world 
japan equities are not priced for this scenario which think will associated with rating from 
currently over the cycle 
believe that net margins will improve from currently not least due 
continued acceleration productivity enhancing private sector capex however our forecast reer 
appreciation will act somewhat headwind for the export facing sectors the index 
asset turnover will likely improve from currently driven reduction excess 
cash the balance sheet higher payout ratio reduction cross shareholdings and the sale 
unrelated businesses 
think that the banks tech hardware pharma cap goods and materials industry groups have the 
potential show the largest improvement absolute roe the next seven years undertake 
deep dive analysis the potential for improvement the banks sector 
contrast expect that autos and telecoms will see some downward pressure roe 
importantly our quantopix framework shows that the japanese equity market has systematically 
rewarded firms with high quality characteristics the last five years among quality factors the risk 
reward profitability factors roe margins asset turnover and payout ratio are more significant 
this chapter focuses the trend roe for japan listed equities 
our view the macro drivers this improvement roe have been 
important metric crucial for driving long run market returns here 
the exit from deflation ongoing increase productive capex

the japanese banks explore potential strategies improve roe 
what our productivity based roe outlook for japan banks and what does this mean for valuations project that the 
roe japan megabanks can rise about from currently costs can lowered about resulting cost 
capital falling from currently single digits under this scenario would expect japan banks rise from 
currently almost reaching double digit roes will not easy though and will require quite favourable macro 
conditions however believe the megabanks are keenly aware the need cut costs raise roe 
how can japan banks raise roe japan banks are less efficient than banks due low rates and high headcounts 
japan harder than the dramatically reduce overheads short period time but the megabanks particular 
are starting propose initiatives part restructuring aimed optimizing branch and personnel resources expect 
they can achieve net reductions about branches atms and headcount think 
initiatives such the replacement passbooks utilizing rpa and will drive efficiency not easy for japan banks 
raise roe but think there are new pressures including the emerging demand provide customer driven services 
the back mobile internet penetration reshaping japan banking industry 
japan plan for cashless society reducing the cost cash processing key element productivity reforms the 
government aims raise the cashless settlement rate from now forecast that the rate will expand 
think the government target will tough hit but there upside our forecast include

about through their own efforts the roe megabanks 
high headcounts headcount and branch reductions are needed

the main reason japan banks have not been able reduce fixed

greater than the margin recovery roe roe were reach 
and therefore services would allow other banks keep high head

case study unwinding cross shareholdings germany 
cross shareholdings germany can traced back the period industrialization the when many financial institutions 
started their operations some examples are deutsche bank allianz insurance and commerzbank many the founders these 
financial institutions had strong links with the managements industrial companies further they themselves incorporated and 
financed many industrial companies this relationship led system extensive cross shareholdings where several companies 
and banks held equity stakes each other this large cross shareholding network was particularly led deutsche bank and 
allianz both financial institutions held significant ownership almost every major company germany including each other 
also the and bank borrowing was significant source corporate finance this further led increase crossshareholdings financial institutions these financial institutions also acted depositor for their clients enabling them 
exercise voting their behalf the large ownership the company coupled with the voting rights their clients equity stakes 
allowed them exert considerable influence over many industrial conglomerates which turn were active array 
unrelated businesses they even placed their own management the supervisory boards numerous companies this deep 
network large companies and financial institutions has been labeled some deutschland 
germany cross shareholdings become issue 
cross shareholdings between corporates and financial institutions led lot inefficiencies which ultimately became drag 
the nation competitiveness tackle the issue number corporate and tax reforms were set motion the german 
government the early corporate reforms included the prohibition insider trading the establishment the 
federal securities supervisory office the mandatory disclosure stakes corporates which resulted substantial 
voting rights the antitrust act and the acceptance international accounting standards generally 
accepted accounting principles gaap the parent companies the german government december made 
surprise announcement that would lower the corporate capital gains tax rate from percent zero sales the german 
equity investments crossholdings effective from this repeal the capital gains tax was revolutionary step that 
provided incentive corporates unwind this extensive web crossholdings 
the lock effect from the large corporate capital gains tax was said act barrier efficient acquisitions and divestitures 
german firms and divisions 
shareholding data shows that banks and insurers crossholdings increased from through the late non financial 
companies crossholdings remained high from and then came down meaningfully the the banks and 
insurers crossholdings came down only after the tax reform and shareholding data shows that fell meaningfully 
important note that the extensive cross shareholding network germany had started weaken even before the tax 
announcement the process took place three phases 
first phase early there was increased competition among the financial companies during the early this led 
decline the common benefits that the cross shareholder network participants were enjoying 
second phase and the german banks were being challenged increased international competition there 
was also reduction benefits earned the banks from crossheld shares both the above developments led material 
increase the opportunity cost for the banks forcing them start unwinding crossholdings remain relevant and 
competitive 
third phase late the german government initiated several corporate reform measures particularly the taxation 
reforms which further provided momentum the unwinding process 
result tax reform and various other corporate reforms contrast with the worldwide trend there was increased activity 
the merger acquisition space germany and many companies were merged acquired after the year has noted 
that the german company network has not vanished yet there are still cross shareholding ties between companies however 
their numbers are decreasing and have been more than halved the past decade further the function cross shareholding ties 
between financial companies and industrial companies has now changed dramatically compared what was seen before the

result loss access
