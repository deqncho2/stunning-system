stagnation loans gdp significantly below the rest the region and the levels before the banking crisis credit penetration 
low for both consumer and commercial segments 
the new government continues implement orthodox and market friendly policies lending should accelerate 
growth should benefit from argentina large educated middle class roughly the population middle and high income much higher than 
the regional average adjusting for this credit growth potential looks even more attractive given consumer wealth argentina credit 
penetration should closer the level chile brazil 
increasing credit penetration should easy and fast given the large proportion middle and high income individuals this segment the

brazil are asset sensitive falling rates will put pressure nim 
underperformance was closely related the magnitude the selic contraction 
this time could tougher there have been interest rate easing cycles the last years all those credit was growing healthy 
pace hence offsetting some the negative effects revenues from nim repricing but even nim and revenues did poorly and bank stocks 
underperformed this time around the combination falling rates amid the backdrop rising npls and sluggish credit growth could make the

rates rise small amounts staggered manner this will help nims improve without any material concerns 
asset quality however rates increase significantly and quickly asset quality capital concerns will dominate any 
revenue pickup 
large banks are the big beneficiaries these banks carry significant amounts excess liquidity and hence 
rates they will likely see almost immediate pass through this part the book steepening curve should help 
improve spreads corporate loans too hsbc has greater rate leverage than bochk but bochk has stronger loan 
growth outlook 
taiwan financials should also benefit singapore less among the banks mega should benefit given large 
usd denominated assets insurers will the big beneficiaries yield curve steepening for singapore banks the 
move less clear cut rates would also have move line with rates and the linked basket 
currencies rather than just the there more scope for currency moves relative the rates have

credit costs mixed bag but mostly stable credit cycle has
