evidence our thesis 
since originally publishing the rationalization tool our banking the speed light 
bluepaper january seen banks give guidance confirming that our 
estimates are the right path tax reform was cited driver increased capex 
tech which should accelerate our branch rationalization thesis 
january wfc announced plans cut its footprint this 
consistent with our default output the rationalization tool which predicts 
footprint reduction wfc 
january bbt unveiled plans allocate invest and acquire 
fintechs this move supports our upgrade equal weight based bbt 
aggressive digital transformation and high branch rationalization potential 
january usb announced they will invest tax reform benefit business 
growth initiatives including technology and business automation expect their 
peers follow similar reinvestment strategies which should yield significant 
efficiency improvement the consumer segment over the coming years 
january stated they will increase capex this year due tax 
reform with focus digitization mobile app currently lags behind other 
banks but our interactive tool shows having high opportunity cut 
branches the investment should help position them execute branch 
reductions 
january cof gave guidance continued efficiency improvement citing 
accelerating digital productivity gains driver cof expects the digital 
revolution transform the banking industry and most bullish the benefits 
consumer facing technology their goal thin physical distribution backed 
great digital experience built modernized integrated infrastructure 
january dfs although branchless stated that digitization will help create 
efficiencies their call centers via machine learning and artificial intelligence 
our bluepaper recognized dfs having the highest potential among our card 
names capitalize this theme they have highly rated app see exhibit and 
proven ability execute 
january ally stated that they are building the leading digital bank while 
ally app ranks out the bank apps that reviewed their deposit 
growth has been among the highest more products services features could help 
them drive functionality and app ranking potentially enabling them lower 
their relatively high deposit rates their goal appears align with this need the 
ceo stated their earnings call also important the strategic path align 
ourselves with trends digital banking the leader that space expand our 
brand and get more out this great franchise 
summary outputs

bull bear base framework 
base case default scenario our tool developed collaboration with alphawise 
defaults the following assumptions all criteria must met order for the branch 
closed 
branch deposit threshold remain open set this each bank median 
deposits per branch rounded down the nearest and capped max 
all branches under this threshold are eligible for closure why branches 
with above median deposit size are likely their most profitable the branches under 
the median deposit levels are the starting point for assessing whether remain 
open consolidate some banks have median deposits more than 
reflecting their significant large corporate and large institutional businesses for 
these banks set the threshold below their average deposit median ensure 
that don penalize branches for large corporate deposit balances addition 
the vast majority branches closed over the past years have been below 
deposits 
competitors between branches assume branches consolidated 
markets are more easily closed there are fewer competitors between 
bank branches assume that the branch with less deposits eligible for 
closure more consolidated markets means there less risk rationalizing your 
branch network 
distance miles between adjacent branches branch must less than miles 
from the nearest branch network order closed while this may appear 
long distance drive branch think reasonable limit for rural 
areas where consumers are used driving longer distances shop run errands 
and potentially visit their bank urban areas this threshold less relevant our 
tool since high concentration competitors criteria significantly limits 
branch eligibility for rationalization 
bull case scenario this represents the following more aggressive scenario 
branch deposit threshold remain open less 
competitors between branches fewer competitors more lenient 
tolerance than our default base case 
distance miles between adjacent branches miles less the same our base 
case 
bear case scenario this represents the following more conservative scenario 
branch deposit threshold remain open this set below our default base 
case scenario with maximum cap and minimum cap 
assumes each bank will only consider cutting branches below its median 
deposits per branch rounded down the nearest 
competitors between branches fewer competitors management 
more cautious closing branches surrounded competitors 
distance miles between adjacent branches miles less this assumes 
management less willing close branches far away from the closest branch 
within their network

methodology the alphawise branch rationalization model 
high level our approach examine bank branch network relative the 
market following the assumption that banks have too many branches look the 
competitive positioning each branch and decide whether could candidate for 
closure without damaging the bank presence the immediate vicinity use current 
branch density measure demand local area assuming banks have acted 
rationally placing more branches the most valuable locations 
morgan stanley alphawise team sourced and verified bank locations from 
combination sources including fdic and snl the largest banks assets were 
used the analysis totaling around locations 
the team employed proprietary algorithm previously developed for branch network 
analysis european countries germany italy turkey france and spain 
the team also created interactive model allow users visualize the outcomes 
the algorithm under different parameters competitors between branches 
distance between adjacent branches and branch deposit threshold remain open 
allowing for wide array permutations displayed 
use three parameters inputs the model which can illustrated with the 
following example customer wants open account with bank they find that 
the local branch has closed down and decide walk the nearest branch but see that 
there are many other banks the area how many competitors they have see 
before switching banks and how far are they prepared travel similarly looking 
how much deposits are held the branch adds insight from the bank perspective the 
answers these questions form the basis the parameters that use 
competitors between branches this the degree competition that bank 
prepared tolerate measure this looking the number competitor banks 
that are closer the branch than its nearest neighbor the same chain taking 
extreme case there are competitor branches closer than its nearest neighbor then 
will consider one could closed and its customers would remain with the bank and 
would mildly inconvenienced traveling further its nearest neighbor model 
scenarios where banks might allow increasing number competitors within range 
each time increasing the risk that their customers might change more convenient 
branch 
exhibit competition intensive the branch will not closed 
exhibit competition weak one the branches will closed 
source alphawise morgan stanley research 
source alphawise morgan stanley research 
exhibit what the threshold beyond which the customer decides 
switch bank 
distance miles between adjacent branches this the greatest 
distance bank will allow between two adjacent branches acts 
limit the first input assume that bank wouldn 
remove branch that leaves customers with long journey 
their nearest branch this prevents bank with local monopoly 
reducing local network single branch the middle that 
area 
source alphawise morgan stanley research 
branch deposit threshold remain open the amount deposits branch has allows 
prioritization between two adjacent branches once pair has been identified 
assume that bank will consolidate branches into those that have higher existing 
deposits the threshold also prevents branch with deposits above the threshold from 
being closed all which will mean that fewer branches highly banked wealthy 
locations such new york city will closed 
have modeled branch network rationalization for individual banks our base case 
inputs are banks for competitor insertion the bank median branch deposits and 
miles for the maximum distance between branches for bancorp assumed 
below median deposit size distance between branches miles and number 
competitors reflect the bank large instore site branch network unique 
size peers for bank hawaii assumed miles for the maximum distance 
between branches due the unique geography the hawaiian islands 
the output the algorithm branch rationalization the number branches that 
could considered for closure expressed percentage the total starting 
branches 
deposits affected our base case scenario affects more than deposits meaning 
customer base holding less deposits would relocated the next closest 
branch our bull case more aggressive with max deposits relocated our 
bear case has max deposits affected

caveats and where could wrong 
branch overlap and deposits alone will not drive closures our model has been 
designed look primarily branch network rationalization 
the model simplification and based third party data the model considers 
primarily four parameters the density competitor banks area the straightline distance between branches the same bank the deposits held the 
branches and the population area these contain simplifications travel time 
might better measure separation than straight line distance population 
not evenly distributed within area one the primary inputs the location
