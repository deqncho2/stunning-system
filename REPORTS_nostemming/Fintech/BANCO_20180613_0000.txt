banco inter the early stages significant digital transformation that 
could result much faster growth and higher profitability for the last years 
banco inter ran small offline banking operation that was mostly focused 
mortgages and payroll loans over the last two years the bank decided 
move its operations online setting fully digital bank the bank 
technology was updated and migrated the cloud earlier this year and the 
product offering being expanded include additional lending and saving 
products well insurance payments and other services 
early adoption rates have been very encouraging with the company reaching 
digital clients march from march product 
penetration the new client base has been picking but remains relatively 
low credit cards deposit accounts investment accounts and 
insurance policies for example 
while the company strategy move all its banking activities onto digital 
platform makes sense think execution risk high and too soon 
tell management can pull off ultimately execution all that matters 
see number challenges including 
going forward banco inter will start distributing and originating financial 
products that are new the operation including unsecured consumer 
credit given the relatively weak institutional framework around lending

the bank plans double the size the loan portfolio over the next two 
years far surpassing historical growth levels not uncommon for banks 
that meaningfully accelerate credit growth run into delinquency and 
cost overruns problems and note that the legacy bank has operated 
with high npl ratios over the last years not sync with the low risk 
nature mortgages and payroll loans brazil 
the legacy bank has generated low levels profitability over the last four 
years roe was and 
excluding one time payment from liberty mutual considering that 
average risk free rates brazil fluctuated the range over this 
period the legacy bank roes look especially weak arguably raising 
questions about execution ability 
banco inter runs large balance sheet mismatch with much longer 
duration the asset side given focus mortgages and payroll loans 
than the liability side rapid and large changes benchmark 
interest rates not uncommon brazil could make difficult for 
management protect net interest margins and profitability the fixed 
income market indicating rising rates brazil over the next months 
which will likely put pressure bidi margins 
are also concerned that the macroeconomic and political backdrop could 
limit the bank ability deliver its expansion plan brazil economic growth 
has failed materialize this year unemployment remains stubbornly high the 
currency has devalued significantly uncertainty around the presidential 
election has risen and corporate and consumer confidence have softened given 
the large weight residential loans banco inter loan portfolio the 
bank growth prospects are particularly sensitive macro and political 
difficulties brazil mortgages more than any other banking product require 
very solid backdrop growth rates employment and confidence thrive 
given the above mentioned concerns believe there relatively low earnings 
visibility banco inter think looks manageable mostly because the 
nii improvement driven the cash infusion from the ipo for which investors 
arguably should not pay big multiple but visibility for seems 
particularly challenging this point expect net income growth for 
but eps growth given new ipo shares and for this implies 
eps cagr roe should reach and 
this point see more downside than upside risk our eps and roe estimates 
current valuation multiples are already discounting much banco inter 
growth potential our view trading and 
this implies peg ratio which does not look attractive relative the brazil 
peers trading average based the shares trade 
and which look expensive relative roe only most 
banks the region delivering similarly low roe trade below our 
fundamental valuation based residual income yields fair value per 
share roughly below current market value the shares would 
trading and which are certainly not conservative 
multiples relative the latam peers our view 
not for everyone important highlight that banco inter has small market 
capitalization only million and trading liquidity only million per 
day over the last weeks the risk here that bidi trading volumes may not 
sufficient attract large number institutional investors and result 
its valuation may not adequately reflect underlying fundamentals 
where could wrong see this show story and await evidence 
that management can deliver its ambitious expansion plan our underweight 
rating could risk with early indications that client ramp cross selling
