recently had the opportunity catch with senior 
the conversation was centered two hot topics fintech and 
payments and other initiatives the bank undertaking 
still top class walked away from our meeting feeling that the bank 
strategic foresight and operational capabilities still represent meaningful 
competitive advantage the marketplace technology challenging the banking 
working hard keep its leadership position brazil 
management started saying that the strategy over the last years has 
worked well management adopted strategy increase value creation mainly 
focusing activities that use less capital reducing the relevance credit 
while the same time increasing that fees and credit the emphasis was 
reducing the riskier lines that demand more capital and increasing lines with 
better capital risk profile such mortgages and payroll loans this strategy paid 
off and the bank was able keep roe the level notwithstanding the 
down cycle has ended and the strategy must adapt they see credit demand 
picking the bank needs move that direction and this all happening 
fintech companies have emerged new competitors the market 
far there meaningful impact the business coming from fintech 
always been under pressure from technology this not new technological 
challenges have been place since the middle last century when computers 
were first introduced banking this was major transformation because 
allowed banks operate more like retail business after that came atms the 
internet and many other technological advances that have created challenges 
management said there will some winners among fintech companies but not 
lot and many the surviving ones will probably end being acquired 
few products have better probability success than those that are trying 
multi product operations and compete head head with the large 
conglomerate banks the digital banks from their perspective better 
specific niches where there less regulation where capital less 
important and where margins can high

them the important thing react very fast understand what happening the 
market and bring solutions that provide value the client this means the bank ought 
become more open flexible agile and client centric and this where fintech 
companies are having impact the market they are pushing banks more 
client centric opposed the traditional model that has historically been focused 
culture the organization and make sure everyone working for the client other 
words the bank sees three key challenges that are intertwined and interdependent 
customer centricity technology and people order for the bank become more 
client centric has able produce technology faster and more adequately for 
the client and this requires change the organizational mindset 
another challenge for client centricity the legacy systems that were not designed 
serve the current client demands the bank has transform its more modern 
and agile this key priority and lot resources have been allocated make sure 
happens management thinks far along creating technological layer between the 
legacy systems the apis and the new digital system that will significantly increase the 
time market new products and the productivity the department also the 
bank migrating operate under working communities which technology and 
product employees are sitting together and the results far have been positive 
management thinks there still plenty time get this done they don see any 
major challenges coming from fintech companies over the next couple for years they 
know there pressure they need move forward and lot needs done but this 
issue about upgrading technology has been the table for few years already 
offers clients the option this but not forcing them this direction the best 
way provide incentives create appealing digital products that clients will want 
digital the bank evolving this direction april they opened accounts 
digitally twice much versus the year ago period and this number should grow 
significantly over the next year 
management also highlighted the value data the bank believes has significant 
competitive advantage the marketplace given the consumer and corporate data has 
collected over the last many decades there dedicated credit bureau brazil 
using data optimize credit scoring modeling sales predict demand and improve riskbased pricing client client basis the bank hiring lot data scientists and 
their influence the business palpable the retail area using data run predictive 
risk models can approve more credit and with more confidence this change 
the way they think about risk 
while mostly agree with management that the bank can play catch and create 
the products and customer experience the fintech companies are developing what they 
can replicate their nimble cost base this means fintech firms can price much 
lower while keeping healthy margins and take market share away from the incumbent 
banks suspect that the velocity which lending rates will fall brazil over the 
next couple years may surprise many market participants 
parcelados interest free installment purchases are key reason credit card interest 
rates are high brazil think the following the bank has billion credit card 
portfolio but the portion that generates interest only billion the remaining 
billion billion are installments with interest and billion are 
balances that will repaid within the day grace period the billion that 
generates interest has provide all the income needed cover the cost capital 
the loan loss provisions and the operating expenses the entire billion credit 
card portfolio the only way the math adds through the very high interest rates 
that are charged the revolving portion that said there way correct this 
stimulating the use installments with interest but merchants need incentive 
this for example offering them the ability charge different prices based the means 
payment and early credit card settlement period 
management also shared its views potential regulatory changes the current 
day settlement period and the prepayment business the credit card market big 
picture they feel any changes are complex many the new entrants participate 
only one two products the value chain any changes could cause imbalances 
chain issuing acquiring and prepayment for them potential regulatory changes are 
less issue because loses one side can likely offset gains the other side 
money one pocket versus money the other case point the recent cap debit 
card interchange the issuing business will see fewer revenues but will mostly 
compensated fewer costs acquiring this not the case for many the new 
entrants they just see one side the coin above all the newcomers are very reliant 
the prepayment business they are vocal with the central bank leave things 
unchanged and this seems the base case scenario for now 
open platform distribute third party products the bank believes there are 
significant gains made better exploring its distribution capability the insurance 
penetration among its clients key for this build larger sales force especially 
integrated multi product sales force and the bank the process doing
