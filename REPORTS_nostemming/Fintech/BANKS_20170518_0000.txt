market small and the pace development has been slow exhibits and the main 
reasons are probably the nation high savings rate cash deposits and the 
high proportion personal spending accounted for cash payments

attitude japanese consumers toward cash under the current legal framework there 
little chance the scale expanding the points that japanese fintech companies

employed reference banking account information related services such 
pfm personal financial management and cloud accounting however 
the joint usage data through open api promoted this could create new 
profit making opportunities this because will become possible build 
platforms through which banks can link with various fintech services new 
channels will established for the provision existing services combined 
with fintech services moreover accounting and settlement information 
accumulated fintech services will monitored real time and this will 
create opportunities provide loans line and stimulate latent demand for 
funds 
over the medium long term there may major change channel and 
atm concepts increase transactions using open api would partly 
replace branch channel and atm functions which could change existing 
channel and atm models bank teaming with fintech companies provide 
the most convenient services could also increasingly favored 
laws regarding open api into effect apr the earliest this 
summer banks could start select registered ventures work with

using bank branches but what becomes possible going forward using financial 
services via smartphone apps provided electronic settlement and other agents 
fintech firms addition once apis are opened the internet and the services other 
firms can also tied together 
previously electronic settlement agents fintech companies read the webpages the 
online banking services financial institutions scraping the necessary data obtain 
information but personal and password confirmation data had registered with 
the venture firm beforehand and problems surfaced including how banks could 
guarantee security how losses would allocated between banks and venture firms

difficult for traditional financial institutions obtain major earnings via open api the

desirable create environment which connections can made based common

need determined some electronic specification standards will put together 
determine guidelines for the following developmental principles recommended 
standards used the development basic specifications standard items 
used electronic messages and definitions those standard items 
security measures and protection users because some highly sensitive information 
will stored and held the fintech companies that access data through the api 
sufficient security measures will need taken and users will have protected
