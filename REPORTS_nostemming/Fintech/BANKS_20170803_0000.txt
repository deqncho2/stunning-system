categorizing fintech strategies global banks over the next months 
concrete fintech strategies are likely materialize japan particularly among 
the megabank groups mizuho host business strategy briefing titled 
mizuho select fintech aug and mufg has planned seminar 
tentatively titled mufg digital strategy tentative for sep the consensus 
view present seems that moves toward unbundling the japanese 
financial industry centered around fintech ventures are not enough mark 
paradigm shift however global trend believe incumbents backed with 
rich capital will continue expand and take the lead fintech investment 
which financial institutions are best positioned benefit from fintech 
japan fintech only being introduced now and the focus cost reduction 
many cases investment fintech japanese financial institutions has also not 
advanced extent that would impact value but mizuho and smfg 
aim roll out new financial services pursue earnings addition cost cuts 
and this will bear close watching other potential beneficiaries are aozora bank 
and shinsei bank overseas where the application novel technologies far 
more advanced than japan think the advantageously positioned banks are 
kbc ing and dnb europe and bank america jpm and wells fargo the 
points watch mizuho aug fintech seminar mizuho has established 
new digital innovation division directly under the ceo the company aims 
promote strategies set itself apart developing new financial services that 
leverage big data and and plans launch new business applying related 
technologies the fields lending and settlement confirmed progress this 
direction would positive for the shares 
what needed for differentiated financial services emerge japan changes 
the japanese bank culture and way thinking would needed namely 
believe differences the following aspects would lead gaps

categorizing fintech strategies among global banks challenges for 
japanese banks revealed 
expect non financial information business model measure mid long 
term growth become important factor along with the utilization new 
technologies evaluating japanese banks 
cooperation with our global banks team group the fintech strategies global 
banks the leaders fintech into categories and summarize the issues faced 
japanese banks key points are follows 
fintech already becoming normal part operations for global banks for banks 
europe and the fintech has become normal part business and the scale 
investments not comparable with those japanese banks the greatest 
advances efficiency improvement through digitalization have been achieved 
northern europe terms using these new technologies there going back 
now 
europe and accelerating shift digital banking tandem basic requirements 
omni channel real time responses tandem initiatives europe and america has 
included efforts improve digital banking interfaces via banks own mobile apps 
expand functions digitalizing services and products such loan assessment 
and integrate multifunctional platforms provide seamless experience for the 
user regardless what device used for access japanese banks are now working 
develop new services working with open api developers and other fintech 
companies and introducing apps made such developers but they lag global 
peers terms shifting existing services digital channels 
tailoring strategies specific regions europe banks work across number 
different regions and many cases they are directing particular digital strategies 
specific markets based the particular characteristics each market and the 
expertise each bank examples include the northern european strategies kbc 
and ing efforts the german market kbc pursuing digital first strategies 
countries such ireland where its physical presence limited and developing 
services tailored digital channels this end respective digital strategies for 
metropolitan and regional areas megabank groups with nationwide branch 
networks bear watching and regional banks may also create new services 
new digital platforms emerging from cooperation among the banks themselves 
one typical example the settlement service zelle zelle payment 
network that was started bank america wells fargo and jpm over 
the next several years pnc capital one and usb joined owners this 
joint venture and now more than other banks are expected join the goal 
ubiquity among consumers the owners zelle expect expand zelle use case 
into business consumer and business business over the next five years while 
there are several settlement services the market including venmo paypal 
and square none offer real time settlement only zelle which directly links bank 
account bank account will offering real time least intra day settlement 
european examples are swish created swedish banks and danske and also 
danske bank mobilepay which has expanded market coverage from denmark into 
norway and finland with several banks board including nordea jyske bank 
and bokis small mid sized danish bank consortium will watching 
trends toward the development similar model japan over the medium term 
levering external resources the nordic banks within the european space remain 
very much the sharper end the digital revolution given the stronger system 
bias towards mobile technology and cashless transactions according recent 
global mobile consumer survey deloitte nordic citizens use 
mobile banking average across europe amongst all our coverage the 
focus continues investment for building out their platform especially 
move towards and beyond nordic banks are spinning this 
structural industry change opportunity rather than threat the banks don 
therefore see the fintechs meaningful threats given the balance sheet scale and 
client ownership that they already have however they concede that they need 
operate much possible with the fintechs there are number fintech 
hubs across the region stockholm oslo helsinki and copenhagen all which 
the banks are collaborating with far the japanese banks have mainly pursued 
initiatives independently but ahead expect them increasingly look toward 
leveraging external resources effective means moving forward

frame incumbent positioning fintech with our fintech gauntlet framework 
number factors influence the pace change and alter firm likelihood success

foundation report the fintech space fintech gauntlet riches assessed the 
circumstances that enable fintech disruption while there wide variation 
environment constraints and competition distilled what think are the most 
important environmental considerations into our gauntlet framework below exhibit 
and concluded that the likelihood for success fintech disruptors depends heavily 
the application but for the most part challenged positioning incumbents relatively 
well specifically the use blockchain technology area fintech investment that 
think will ultimately won out incumbents whereas digital mortgage origination 
and api use among japanese financial firms could either way

expect incumbents drive fintech investment going forward vcs less 
highlighted our global fintech foundation report fintech gauntlet 
riches think expectations for fintech investments have probably been too lofty 
and see falling backed fintech investment over the past year indicative 
realization the challenges disrupting financials including the slow pace 
change behavior financials compared curve type changes possible other 
sectors and relatively intense capital requirements for financial products and 
associated regulatory compliance infrastructure also think the market still needs 
through further rationalization and our expectation that investors will 
continue scale back investing 
financials and payments incumbents meanwhile are emboldened and increasingly wellcapitalized and are therefore likely step and take the investment lead 
the spike investment has now catalyzed response from incumbents while the 
same time incumbents are benefiting from the anticipation lighter regulation and 
allocation towards growth investment consumer behavior change while slow 
adjusting expectations new product service offerings and banks are still focused 
lowering costs including through fintech this combination incumbent behavior 
represents paradigm shift that should benefit incumbents roi exhibit
