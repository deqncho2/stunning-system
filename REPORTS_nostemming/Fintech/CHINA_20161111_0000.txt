investment summary 
key points 
china banks can achieve smooth high risk loan digestion with stable moderating credit costs the coming years 
this should happen even debt gdp rises nearly 
see reasonable asset growth and support for net interest margins from the current mix economic drivers 
dividends should sustainable for the quality banks driving valuation rating 
the industry current valuation our book value despite mid teen returns equity reflects understandable but 
incorrect concerns over credit quality risks and the sustainability roe and dividend payments 
raise our price targets and average for the and shares upgrade our industry view attractive 
despite mid teen roes and dividend yields more than china 
why buy now 
banks are trading our book value estimate our view 
this level effectively prices scenarios under which the banks either 
see several catalysts that make chinese banks attractive invest 
need digest non performing loans npls more than the 
ments now lower credit cost pressure npl digestion for the 
loan book month period which would effectively point 
higher risk sectors nearly halfway through more rational indus 
crisis scenario face severe roe deterioration soon from both net 
trial investment growth recent quarters versus gdp growth which 
interest margin nim and credit cost pressures 
could support further improvement industrial profitability and 
modest rebound private investment growth key factor that 
our detailed credit flow analysis and bottom credit risk assess 
investors use gauge macro and financial risks and stabilizing 
ment point smooth decline high risk credit from around 
nims supported continued credit demand from infrastructure 
prior the pick npl digestion china banks 
projects and households and more neutralized monetary policy 
around via proactive npl recognition and digestion 
addition attractive dividends which expect sustainable 
manufacturing and trade finance loans well shift credit 
the coming years are likely support further upside for the banks 
growth infrastructure and household loans while believe the 
towards the next dividend season june lastly the continued 
transparency and repayment predictability infrastructure credits 
clean irrational high yield assets including those local gov 
remain poor our analysis indicates that china ability service infra 
ernment financing vehicles lgfvs likely make the banks divi 
structure debts healthy and the country can afford mid teen 
dend yields increasingly attractive believe now good time 
growth infrastructure investments addition have 
buy china banks before these positive catalysts fully materialize 
seen efforts improve the transparency infrastructure debt 
recent quarters lastly believe the recent roll out intensive 
policies target capital market leverage and overheating property 
markets certain cities could help contain related risks the aforementioned trends continue they should lead more rational credit

five pillar framework for smooth high risk 
loan digestion 
forecast that total credit gdp will rise but 
pillar notable credit mix shift recent 
years government and infrastructure 
credits with muted growth industrial 
loans 
that high risk credit will moderate around total credit from 
government and infrastructure credits have been the biggest 
around the end which was before the acceleration 
drivers credit growth recent years contributing more 
npl recognition and digestion started china banks think this 
will achieved through credit mix shift official government 
credits and infrastructure related credits manageable risks related infrastructure credit better risk management for 
new credit high risk sectors such manufacturing and trade 
than new credit since 
credit growth the higher risk manufacturing mining and 
trade finance sectors has essentially stalled 
loans households have been the third largest contributor 
china leverage increase 
finance evidenced muted growth recently and cautious stance 
expect infrastructure and household credits remain 
banks steady high risk credit digestion the financial system 
the key drivers credit growth the coming years while 
and tighter control over new risks such capital market leverage 
credit growth the industrial sectors likely remain 
and potential housing market bubbles 
morgan stanley research 
rational expect infrastructure related credit which 
accounts for total credit china now reach 
ble industrial investment growth and hence more 
rational capacity expansion 
given our view that china can support around growth 
infrastructure fai fixed asset investment believe the 
pillar believe credit risks related 
infrastructure will remain manageable 
country should able maintain fai growth annually even real estate fai growth stays muted combined 
with more balanced economic growth drivers evidenced 
the economic benefits infrastructure investment 
higher consumption growth and strong ser 
shown the stable growth services and household 
vice pmi growth around this likely support profit 
incomes during the industrial slowdown have supported the 
ability industrial firms and reduce credit risk concerns giv 
value government owned assets providing more room 
their much slower pace new capacity expansion relative 
service government and infrastructure debt 
other parts the economy 
estimate that the government current low net interest 
burden gdp which less than that and japan 
levels will rise still manageable infrastructure investment and credit continue grow mid teen 
levels 
the government has ample assets such deposit balances 
and land that can used for interest and principal repayment 
although they are less predictable lgfv local government 
pillar real estate household credit and 
capital market leverage risks are not yet 
systemic and recent policy tightening 
should help contain risks 
capital market leverage and household credit were the sec 
ond and third largest contributors the total leverage 
increase china over the past three years 
financing vehicle debt swaps well asset injections into 
our base case scenario assumes notably slower increase 
lgfvs are evidence that the government can and does shift 
capital market leverage and modestly slower increase 
resources among entities and across regions coordinate 
household credit given intense regulatory action the past 
debt and interest repayments 
two quarters 
our calculations capital market leverage was equivalent 
pillars chinese banks have 
demonstrated ability digest highrisk credit the manufacturing trade 
finance and mining sectors orderly 
pace and expect this continue over 
the next couple years 
the manufacturing trade finance and mining sectors account 
the year growth accelerates further from this rate would 
more concern our view 
despite the recent housing price rally around cities 
housing affordability all but three cities still below the 
historical peak household income growth notably outpaced property price increases most cities between 
and early 
for around credit china the banks had 
combined with improved cash flows major developers 
classified around loans these sectors 
this leads believe that credit risks related mortgages 
overall loans non performing around which have 
and property loans will still manageable particularly given 
been digested via sales write offs and cash recoveries since 
relatively low loan value ltv ratios recent policies can 
the start 
help contain further rapid increases housing prices 
based the current pace npl classification and digestion 
also believe that the introduction close new rules 
believe china banks can remove the remaining high risk 
and regulations covering capital markets and related lever 
credits those sectors over the next two years without further increase credit costs and therefore further negative 
impact bank profitability 
also expect that fewer new loans the manufacturing 
trade finance and mining sectors will ultimately become nonperforming tighter credit growth has led more reasona 
total gdp and increased during 
age will help contain risks enforced well 
housing affordability reaches exceeds historical peak lev 
els notably larger percentage cities 
would view property risks more concern 
see reasonable asset growth and 
support for nims from the current mix 
economic drivers china 
continued reasonable asset growth banks and lead lower nim 
pressure this our view will also support industrial profitability and trigger modest rebound private sector investment 
which tends concentrated the industrial sector since private sector investment key simple metric that many inves 
credit demand and nims banks are closely linked the pace and 
tors track evaluate the quality credit and capital allocation 
structure economic growth which has direct impact inflation 
and therefore the banking sector outlook this could serve 
trends and capital and credit demand believe the pace and struc 
catalyst for rating the banks 
ture china economic growth have changed level that will still 
generate reasonable credit and capital demand with less deflation 
addition rising capital leverage and housing prices can better 
ary pressure this evidenced the rebound both the producer 
controlled following recent policy tightening expect more ration 
price index ppi and consumer price index cpi the past three 
total credit growth despite credit demand from infrastructure and 
months supporting asset growth and cushioning mid long term 
households this would also reduce the need for further loosening 
nim pressure 
helping support nims the medium term 
improving household credit risk management banks and fintech 
while larger portion new credit demand namely government 
firms should help support the growth consumption and services 
infrastructure and mortgages could the lower end asset 
combined with our expectation for still reasonable pace fai 
yields would also carry lower risk weightings which would limit 
growth aided infrastructure investment and more rational 
the impact roes the banks believe large banks with good 
industrial investment growth this will help curb any potential down 
funding franchises and lower funding costs will have smaller nega 
ward pressure ppi believe this economic growth mix will drive 
tive impact roe from the shift asset demand 
catalyst dividends are sustainable for 
quality chinese banks given continued 
credit demand and more stable credit 
cost outlook 
exhibit 
believe stable moderating credit costs along with continued 
credit demand from infrastructure projects and households will support earnings stability quality chinese banks and enable them

should government entities fail repay 
debt large scale despite having the

policymakers could fail contain capital

regulatory actions which could lead 
greater capital market volatility principal

according our calculations capital market leverage was equiva 
tractual obligations for some the debts could relatively weak 
lent total gdp increasing during the 
and governments are not obligated devote additional resources 
year nevertheless there has been series regulatory 
bail out the debts lgfvs this particularly given that any 
measures effectively controlling various financing channels and 
delinquency debt repayment local governments tends 
results have already started show regulators have also become 
widely reported news channels nevertheless believe the gov 
more coordinated under the macroprudential asset mpa system 
ernment unlikely allow widespread debt defaults such could 
hence believe sharp spiral capital market leverage unlikely 
suggest significant problems the economy and could lead social 
unrest 
the poor transparency and predictability 
some infrastructure financing could 
have worse than expected impact 
confidence china economy and 
capital markets particularly given the 
rising share infrastructure financing 
total capital allocation 
further notable increase housing

governments could lead boom and 
bust housing cycle 
housing affordability still manageable most cities china with 
only three cities experiencing housing prices beyond historical 
peaks nevertheless larger number cities see prices beyond 
historically affordable levels could lead such risks expen 
many infrastructure projects are effectively designed sub 
sive land and housing could squeeze out businesses and talent and 
sidy for the economy with fee rates set low levels the 
profits from speculative property investing could divert capital and

due poor transparency 
morgan stanley research 
large amount idle funds the system 
could increase systemic uncertainty while 
reducing transparency 
stricter budgeting process local governments well higher 
standards for local project selection have been slowing approval and 
banks risk management fails catch 
with more aggressive growth targets 
however their risk management 
processes have shown improvement 
recent years and the loan growth 
higher risk areas has slowed notably 
planning processes this has led longer time gap between credit 
extension and project inception which has resulted more idle cash 
manufacturing credit gdp has moderated from peak 
local governments and somewhat reduced credit efficiency 
recently while trade finance credit gdp fell from peak 
addition while banks posted notable slowdown credit growth 
recently and mining related credit gdp 
industrial sectors the system pushed more liquidity and lev 
declined from peak recently however unlike 
erage into the financial and capital markets well local govern 
banks more developed markets which may reluctant lend 
ment projects via many less transparent credit channels which also 
during economic slowdowns despite central bank stimulus banks 
reduced the transparency the financial system particularly 
china tend remain pro growth and are aggressive balance sheet 
terms the direction fund flows and related risks the excessive 
growth the banks are more intent achieving unrealistic loan and 
liquidity and idle funds china could result aggressive risk taking 
asset growth targets and lend higher risk less commercial areas 
and regulatory arbitrage banks tend pro growth and are like 
relaxing their credit risk restrictions could lead higher credit 
expand their investments irrationally with available funds 
risks and systemic problems the future

major capital outflows that lead 
tighter liquidity conditions and higher 
interest rates could cause rapid increase 
the government net interest burden 
and sharp slowdown economic 
growth 
believe that current growth and growth over 
indicates that system liquidity more than sufficient but 
liquidity becomes much tighter than expected system interest rates 
would increase leading higher interest burden governments 
such heavy interest burden would harm governments efficiency 
investment and fewer new infrastructure projects could included 
their budgets with slower infrastructure credit growth china 
economic activity would likely weaker than expect 
our base case scenario for more 
leverage but less bad debt 
the conventional view 
china soaring debt levels will create more high risk credit the banks support inefficient soes and continuing overcapacity 
leads defaults and bankruptcies 
our view 
this was true several years ago but overlooks current realities our analysis shows that bank lending these old economy 
industries has stalled and being replaced debt that either lower risk mortgages carries stronger implicit government 
backing infrastructure 
result our base case that high risk credit can fall around total credit even national debt gdp 
reaches nearly 
analyzing credit flows from the bottom 
the key findings our analysis are 
the main driver rising credit gdp the past three years 
has been credit infrastructure government capital margiven that more than leverage china domestic debt 
kets and households see exhibit 
believe the most important first step analyze debt sector and 
while transparency and repayment predictability will remain 
type borrower rather than look total system leverage this will 
key issues believe true credit risks for infrastructure 
allow more accurately assess credit risks the near and long 
lated credits will remain manageable even with growth 
term economic impact and potential solutions our analysis where 
mid teen level until see how will china service 
the leverage has been building shows less concerning picture 
infrastructure related debt for detailed analysis 
than the market seems have 
credit growth high risk sectors such manufacturing 
trade finance and mining has stalled with deleveraging 
have updated our system credit allocation analysis from 
those sectors under way and good pace npl recognition 
the analysis indicates both improvements and new risks credit 
and digestion the past two years see how are bad debt 
trends our base case also provides more detailed forecasts for credit 
issues being addressed for detailed analysis 
growth which are reflected the long term nim and credit cost cal 
while risks related households particularly mortgages 
culation for each bank more accurately analyze china credit 
and real estate developers have increased somewhat 
risks break down credit flows recent years using our extensive 
not believe the problem systemic based our housing 
discussions with participants alternative financing channels well 
market affordability analysis and the potential for recent gov 
examining bond issuance trust loan and policy bank loan data 
ernment policies reduce future risks see are real estate 
cross check these calculations with debt and liabilities growth 
risks manageable and need watch mortgage risks 
data for many key industries and infrastructure related sectors such 
few cities and overall household credit risks could rise 
manufacturing railways and highways improve the accuracy 
gradually for detailed analysis 
the analysis also conduct credit risk analysis using different 
capital market leverage has increased from essentially 
frameworks for each type credit based their cash flows repay

the chinese government interest burden gdp currently lower than the and japan 
the role infrastructure spending china economy poorly understood the market 
the return infrastructure investments higher than the immediate return from usage fees would suggest include spin off

the infrastructure and local government 
financing model also reduces the

gdp growth 
both our data and channel checks indicated that many local infrastructure investment firms tend overborrow and then keep large 
amounts cash their balance sheets this clearly evidenced 
the rapid acceleration and corporate deposit growth recent 
quarters 
this partly due uncertain policies from the central government 
previously which tended make local governments overborrow 
during periods relatively loose monetary policy also partly 
due stricter requirements for infrastructure project selection 
which delayed some investments even though funding was already 
place 
while these credits may not lead immediate risks large amount 
idle funds the system increases system uncertainty reduces system transparency and makes more difficult for policymakers set 
the timing policy adjustments 
higher idle funds could give businesses and households the impression that there oversupply money leading 
greater concerns potential rmb depreciation and capital
