incumbents are beginning respond they are

saved when refinancing through its platform and that 
investors earned net credit losses far more than the 
current risk free return three year while 
lendingclub cost advantage traditional lenders and 
proprietary credit decision making risk pricing models are 
important drivers think least part the reason this 
disintermediation opportunity exists that credit losses and 
underlying interest rates are historic lows while credit card 
rates charged borrowers have not decreased 
commensurately other words there more fat cut 
today than typical environment 
evaluating the potential impact volume growth think 
terms the spread opportunity between what borrowers 
are charged banks and what investor bare 
minimum would charge that borrower see exhibit 
this spread that marketplace lenders can capture and divide 
among borrowers lower rates investors positive lossadjusted returns and itself origination and servicing fees 
the current environment clear that the average credit 
card rate far excess the minimum required return

interest rates might prove drive demand cyclicality 
banks often price credit card rates prime plus spread but 
historically the prime rate had only been partially predictive 
average credit card rates regression semiannual data 
suggests coefficient and based this 
pattern one could infer that rise the yield curve might 
hypothetically drive credit card rates only and 
therefore the spread marketplace lenders capture might 
compressed however note that changes from 
the card act may drive closer correlation between 
credit card rates and underlying interest rates going forward 
bank rate changes are now more restricted more rates 
may more directly tied prime rates than the past the 
net result that expect some compression the spread 
but not the full extent illustrated 
also note that borrower demand could decline higher 
rate environment higher nominal rates could the margin 
discourage some borrowers from taking loan 
undertake major expense home improvement vacation 
otherwise reduce the amount borrowed 
but rising ncos will likely prove bigger cyclical 
driver marketplace lending growth investors 
marketplace platforms will demand minimum rate 
equivalent the risk free rate plus expected ncos and 
course some profit compensate for taking risk therefore 
ncos rise platforms need offer them higher returns 
and would therefore need charge borrowers more the 
headwind anticipate that banks will not raise their rates 
much when this happens due competition for 
example platforms may raise rates borrowers 
compensate investors for rising ncos but banks only raise 
rates then the value proposition borrowers 
diminished the card act the key culprit 
banks generally charge borrowers spread above the prime 
rate and would adjust this spread based the credit 
environment thus credit deteriorated banks would widen 
this spread and raise their rates borrowers even the 
prime rate was unchanged however following the 
card act banks can longer easily adjust that spread 
ncos move the reasonable alternative for banks 
charge more stable rate spread accommodate both good 
times and bad the ramification that this spread may 
appear too wide and ripe for disintermediation when 
ncos are low and too narrow when ncos are high 
expect this pattern will drive some cyclicality marketplace 
lending growth going forward headwind while ncos are 
rising and tailwind while ncos fall 
combining the impact interest rates and ncos see 
substantial historical variability this total spread 
disintermediation opportunity over the past years see 
exhibit suggesting that the platform value 
proposition might exhibit some cyclicality going forward 
underlying investor demand for unsecured loans could also 
prove cyclical basic level investor demand for 
unsecured consumer credit loans may fall macro and credit 
conditions start turn further exacerbating this impact 
that some hedge fund investors have reportedly been levering 
investments marketplace loans amplifying their exposure 
and also increasing platforms funding concentration these 
investors the risk platforms that levered lenders may 
quick withdraw funding ncos trend higher and that the 
impact would outsized given their leveraged positions 
note that platforms that have more diversified funding are 
likely more resilient through such scenario

the marketplace lending industry not without risks the two 
most meaningful risks our view are the possibility 
increased competition and the indirect impact rising credit 
losses there also risk that supply demand fall 
interest rates begin rise and that increased regulation 
legal scrutiny the business models harm growth and 
margins 
potential for increased competition

and become catalyst for growth could benefit the ratings 
agencies banks that are able win share this

threat marketplace lending industry growth our view 
the banks have clearly taken notice and some have even 
started purchasing pools these loans for their own 
portfolios but far the overlap between the platforms and

generating new source fee income and leveraging 
technology improve lending process 
space currently banks generate roughly their total 
revenues from fee sources and with increasing regulatory 
scrutiny their lending practices and capital levels fee 
income becoming ever more attractive source 
revenue growth 
banks can adapt their lending process one the 
driving factors behind the growth online lenders better 
customer satisfaction due faster response times quicker 
loan approval times and faster funding prevent significant 
share loss banks will eventually forced provide similar 
level service they hope compete and stay relevant 
their customers however think the banks are less likely 
aggressively compete the unsecured consumer space 
given high loss rates but more likely aggressively defend 
their position the lower loss content secured consumer 
commercial space banks are already pushing toward greater

with their depositors smaller branches online and mobile 
platforms video atms etc but they have not yet made 
meaningful progress addressing the technological needs 
the asset side the balance sheet 
banks also have meaningful expertise loan originations 
credit underwriting ability absorb losses and 
securitizations which should also give them leg they 
choose pursue more technology focused origination 
approach their existing low cost funding sources also 
provide meaningful advantage providing warehouse lines 
for securitization either their own loans those others 
however banks will unlikely reproduce the 
entrepreneurial spirit that small motivated and highly 
innovative startups like lendingclub among others have 
leveraged build out their platforms many the 
marketplace lenders highlight their agility and flexibility when 
comes making decisions and building out their platforms 
better accommodate customer needs and fully agree with 
this thesis banks will either need purchase their way into 
the marketplace lending space will need completely 
rethink how they approach the technology needs their

banks willingness aggressively enter the marketplace

the most recent financial crisis were early stages 
developing their credit models thus even though platforms 
often mention that their models are improvement 
traditional predictive models the lack detail around how 
their processes work means will likely show me story 
the next cycle further the much stronger credit quality

these rates are more attractive than comparable rates under 
their existing credit card debt for example but rates rise 
will consumers particularly those higher quality borrowers

when rates were unusually low the risk that they are 
not because they are higher quality implies that they may 
have better alternative funding sources the ability 
delever and might less likely refinance their existing

are less concerned about the lower quality borrowers 
leaving the platform given fewer financing alternatives but 
note that loans used for vacations home upgrades and other 
discretionary items would likely see some decline 
decline the supply funding institutional investors are 
becoming increasingly large percentage the buyers 
online lending debt the debate whether not institutional 
buyers will still consider online lending having attractive 
risk adjusted return when rates begin rise right now with 
limited alternatives for earning reasonable yield marketplace 
lending provides very attractive risk adjusted return 
institutional investors but does this risk reward trade off still 
make sense when higher quality corporate debt yielding 
and the loss content that corporate debt both welldefined and meaningfully lower than unsecured consumer

highlight several the more important risks below including greater scrutiny 
around the selling securities and the securitization process risk retention 
and stricter oversight lending practices 
morgan stanley research 
may 
global marketplace lending 
greater scrutiny around existing securities laws 
couple scenarios consider are interpretations 
existing securities laws were changed way that would 
require compliance from the marketplace lending industry 
the expansion product offerings and services for the 
marketplace lending industry were come with prohibitive 
costs operational restrictions given current securities laws 
first let look the issue shifting legal interpretations 
because this relatively new industry federal and state 
securities laws that exist today were not designed with 
marketplace lending mind such not entirely clear 
which laws will will not apply marketplace lenders 
more specifically which laws are not currently interpreted 
apply marketplace lenders today but could the future 
some examples include coverage under broker dealer laws 
qualifications for state law exemptions given compliance with 
federal laws coverage under securitization laws 
marketplace lenders are subject many laws already but 
both company disclosures and legal experts have indicated 
possible that the industry could subject more existing 
laws given broader interpretations 
risk retention could redefine the marketplace model 
addition existing financial regulation marketplace lenders 
also face the risk being affected evolving regulatory 
requirements specifically risk retention requirements the 
wake the financial crisis regulators have developed rules 
requiring institutions who sell securitized products investors 
retain some the risk order curb irresponsible 
originate distribute models the rules which would 
require less than risk retention non qualifying loans 
for the selling institution have been finalized and are 
expected fully implemented the end but 
remains seen whether these rules will apply the 
marketplace lending industry where securitizations are 
emerging growing component the industry 
with other laws not entirely clear whether the risk 
retention rules being put place should apply marketplace 
lenders one argument that because marketplace lenders 
aren creating the same kinds securitizations traditional 
lenders marketplace lenders sell pieces individual loans 
investors and whole loans institutional investors their 
securitizations shouldn qualify traditional asset backed 
securities the other hand since the securities that 
marketplace lenders are selling are backed the cash flows 
the loan there argument made that these are 
just new class abs products that should qualify for risk 
retention requirements the risk that marketplace lenders 
would need take balance sheet risk they indeed 
need comply with new risk retention rules and would cease 
pure marketplace operators also means they would 
need take the incremental and necessary expenses 
comply with the new requirements 
increased oversight lending practices 
another major component the post crisis regulatory 
overhaul has been the crackdown lending practices given 
the inevitability greater oversight for the marketplace 
lending industry couple areas regulators could look into 
are the marketplace lending industry innovative underwriting 
practices including the use social media making 
underwriting decisions another regulator concern could 
the industry use rent charter relationships with banks 
means lowering operating costs associated with 
lending both lendingclub and prosper generate most their 
originations through webbank which manages the bank 
requirements the lending process yet rent charter 
relationships were viewed regulators method for 
circumventing direct regulatory oversight possible that 
they could challenge the legality these relationships seek 
expand their authority more directly oversee the 
marketplace lending industry 
how banks other financial institutions 
may compete with marketplace lenders 
build buy online marketplace lender 
lend directly borrowers their own marketplaces 
are beginning see banks form online interfaces similar 
those lendingclub prosper etc notably through 
suntrust lightstream offering these platforms would not 
necessarily need marketplace fact think banks 
will likely want retain the loans given the relatively higher 
risk adjusted margins consumer lending what critical 
however having the online flexibility the technology 
speed application through funding and competitive rate 
offer bank run online marketplace investment 
course banks particularly smaller banks with less 
consumer lending exposure could also replicate the 
marketplace platforms and create their own online 
marketplaces funded via retail and institutional investors 
generate strong fee income streams this could also 
opportunity for specific players who focus wealth 
management providing alternative investment for clients 
the risk that individual investors are unlikely 
disciplined credit underwriting banks and this model has

not yet undergone true credit cycle significant rise 
charge offs due change the credit cycle could 
detrimental the reputation and brand banking

consumer lending remains rather muted post financial crisis 
however there are recent signs acceleration and 
expect consumers will continue lever the macro 
backdrop improves and financial balance sheets strengthen 
result expect banks and consumer finance 
companies devote increasing resources unsecured 
lending with increased marketing around unsecured

implications for incumbents 
think marketplace lending currently poses limited

competing mortgage lending which makes the majority 
bank lending and the key driver profitability 
however believe banks will need their game 
avoid seeing skim the cream off consumer unsecured

expand the availability credit smaller businesses 
and not necessarily compete directly with the major banks 
which can price loans based profitability the overall 
relationship rather than just the loan facility the partnerships 
announced rbs and santander refer potential 
borrowers the platforms give sense how lenders 
and banks could prove complementary rather than 
competitive however the consumer space expect 
banks need invest improving customer experience and

there already evidence incumbents increased focus 
harnessing technology improve customer experience 
and retention reduce conduct risk and improve underwriting 
barclays existing bank customers can now obtain 
personal loan with just six taps the bank mobile app and

improves speed and convenience for the customer thereby 
increasing the likelihood retaining customer loyalty but also

credit reference database can still greatly enhance their credit

reduce interest rates borrowers and improve their 
competitiveness against other traditional financial channels

structure most lenders lower than for the traditional 
financial channels 
less mature risk management for sme and corporate credits 
high lender and borrower acquisition costs and potential 
rising competition from bank and nonbank financial channels 
are key risks 
high effective cost for borrowers make them vulnerable 
competition due high lender and borrower acquisition 
costs and high charge off ratios the effective interest rates 
borrowers are very high while the reported interest rates 
borrowers have fallen low teen levels platforms 
typically charge very high fees borrowers believe 
effective interest rates borrowers tend above 
the lenders are break even this notably higher than 
interest rates offered banks and even higher than most 
alternative financing channels 
credit risks remain the biggest challenge for the industry 
the lack access the centralized credit system used 
banks has made risk control challenge for lenders and 
led meaningful divergence among various platforms credit 
performance even leading lenders have charge off 
ratios currently with much higher loss ratio startups 
the number newly troubled platforms reached 
average there were new platforms 
risk failing every month that number increased 
december fraud and cash flow difficulties remain 
the top reasons that platforms fail think cash flow 
problems may relieved early with fund flows back 
market after year end but expect the number 
new problem platforms remain high due the 
credit cycle china going through 
banks and other financial channels are shifting their focus 
consumer loans and new lending opportunities during the 
economic structural shift china and this could lead more 
competition lenders particularly many banks and 
nonbank financial institutions are adapting new technologies 
improve their operating and credit approval efficiencies

more pressure lenders that cannot quickly reduce 
their operating costs

lenders could more vulnerable reputational risks

high acquisition costs for both borrowers and lenders

response from the banks 
morgan stanley blue paper 
the retail and business banking franchises the major 
banks aren responding yet 
the major banks have yet outline how they will respond 
the emergence lending australia this stage 
doubt that the response will particularly quick 
aggressive and note the following 
the market still very small doubt that the 
market has had any impact yet the growth rates 
the major banks personal loan and credit card portfolio 
fact societyone the only lender that has been 
operating for more than year and seems have 
deliberately constrained its growth ambitions 
retail bankers are primarily focused the mortgage 
and deposit markets the major banks have australian 
home loan and deposit portfolios billion and 
billion respectively this compares with total 
market just billion consumer unsecured 
lending cba retail banking services division generates 
million revenue from mortgages and 
million from deposits compared with 
million from consumer finance furthermore mortgages 
and deposits are seen central the customer 
relationship contrast consumer finance particularly 
credit cards viewed more additional product 
offering and incremental revenue opportunity our 
view this will slow the response the major banks the 
growth lenders australia 
the major banks downplay the competitive advantage 
players particularly relation credit 
assessment senior executives from the major banks 
have tended downplay the threat from lending 
when they have commented publicly particular they 
have questioned whether lenders are better able 
assess credit quality given the amount data available 
the major banks for example both wbc and cba have 
some form relationship with million customers 
which equates the adult population australia 
believe the banks are focused maximizing the 
revenue potential including credit cards and consumer 
lending from their existing customers 
doubt the major banks will adopt risk based pricing 
approach for different customers given the risk 
cannibalizing back book profitability our view the major 
banks will tolerate some loss share lenders 
rather than adopt risk based pricing for personal loans and 
credit cards the high returns and profitability their inforce portfolio mean that they are more prepared 
sacrifice volume than price furthermore expect them 
rely customer inertia broader customer relationships 
product features credit cards limit customer 
loss 
the major banks could look partner with 
lenders provide alternative offering their 
customers our view the major banks are increasingly 
open partnership agreements investments the best 
examples are investments mortgage brokers cba 
and aussie home loans investment fund managers 
nabinvest the sale white labelled general 
insurance products wbc and nab with allianz 
there have also been cases where they build online 
offering compete with disruptors nab ubank 
offering deposits and then home loans such 
think they may ultimately the same with lending 
fact wbc investment societyone see below gives 
some insight into its approach however the experience 
other industries suggests that online players are more 
likely succeed they are pure plays carsales 
seek rather than owned incumbent 
drive mycareer 
the major banks are aggressively developing their 
digital offerings and improving loan approval speeds 
while the major banks appear downplaying the 
threat lenders and look unlikely adopt riskbased pricing for consumer unsecured loans the near 
term they are focused developing their online and 
digital offerings this suggests that that they want match 
the service proposition and ease application provided 
the platforms even they won compete price 
for example cba believes leader digital and 
online product and service innovation see exhibit 
and improving loan fulfillment the number personal 
loans funded the same day has increased the 
past months and asset finance credit approval times 
have fallen also one wbc strategic 
priorities digital transformation see exhibit and 
notes that has lowered credit card complaints and 
personal loan complaints and

overview marketplace lending 
marketplace lenders originators directly connect borrowers 
lenders without going through traditional financial intermediary 
marketplace lending started out with consumers lending consumers 
sometimes referred peer peer lending but more 
the funding for loans coming from institutions believe may 
misnomer marketplace lenders are also referred online lenders 
technology enabled lenders specialty originators and next generation 
lenders 
marketplace lenders key advantages traditional lenders 
they typically have lower operating costs than banks due 
lack physical infrastructure and use technology drive 
process efficiency 
they can offer lenders consumers institutions who 
provide funding lend money borrowers higher net yield 
than what they can currently earn from banks government 
bonds 
iii 
lack capital requirement they typically not hold any 
residual interest loans that they originate 
they typically utilize more data points their credit scoring 
algorithm which may allow them approve loans that 
traditional lenders not have the ability underwrite 
simpler and more efficient application process relative 
traditional financial institutions the whole process takes 
place online with minimal human interaction and credit 
decisioning minutes the sme side marketplace 
lenders can save borrowers significant time the loan 
application process the the average sme spends 
hours applying for loan while the application process from 
marketplace lender can short minutes 
they can pass along the lower overhead costs borrowers 
the form lower interest rates although should noted 
that most marketplace lenders are currently not profitable due 
lack scale 
how marketplace lending works 
marketplace lenders originators operate platforms that match borrowers 
who are looking for capital consumers and businesses sources 
capital individual and institutions pure marketplace originators not 
take any credit risk they are only intermediary between borrowers 
and lenders although several lenders that discuss this report fund 
portion the loans they originate with their own balance sheets thus 
taking varying degrees credit risk 
several drivers have aligned over the past several years and led 
the explosive growth marketplace lending globally 
the global financial crisis led banks many countries pull back 
their consumer and small business lending activities after 
having suffered heavy losses 
increased regulatory oversight along with capital requirements 
has led certain types loans becoming relatively unattractive 
for banks 
iii the increased availability data sources along with 
improvement data analytics technology helping marketplace 
lenders develop underwriting models that they believe have 
better predictive capability than fico scores 
consumers especially millennials and small businesses are 
increasingly comfortable performing transactions online their 
mobile devices and are demanding fast and convenient solutions 
the general credit environment has been benign with low default 
rates which may have helped marketplace platforms establish 
credibility with potential investors loans 
record low interest rates across multiple asset classes which has 
led increased interest assets such marketplace loans 
that can deliver attractive yields 
marketplace lenders key disadvantages traditional 
lenders 
lack long term track record for investors most platforms 
have been around for less than years and haven been 
through credit cycle those that were around during the last 
financial crisis were too small draw any meaningful 
conclusions 
unclear regulatory framework many regions given that 
marketplace lending relatively new phenomenon 
iii 
pure marketplace lenders not have deposit base 
committed sources funding loan losses spike during 
credit cycle could deter investors from lending the 
platform and revenues could plummet overnight given the 
heavy reliance transaction fees
