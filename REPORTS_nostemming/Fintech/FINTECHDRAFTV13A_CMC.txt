customer oriented products and services the fact that 
customers have make with the products and channels 
that are offer 
however with technology becoming integral part 
people lives customer needs are changing and with more 
information available individuals customers are becoming 
not only more sophisticated but also price sensitive offline 
transactions are moving online while the internet moving 
mobile even the and where fintech more 
developed but still the early stages incumbent players have 
taken notice the impending fintech movement

below are factors that have been hindering factors fintech 
development korea believe many the elements can 
resolved through regulatory reform 
regulatory structure related financial services 
telecommunications electronic payments settlements and 
other related areas are not only complex but mostly based 
offline transactions the regulatory approval process 
also complicated and generally requires pre approval 
the payment settlement system remains closed the 
market and structured way that banks and card 
companies continue dominate hence all the 
advancement shown the payments settlements space 
has yet disruptive 
due continued customer data leakage incidents and 
financial scams people have deep concerns 
transaction security addition new mediums are 
generally less convenient and hence the utilization new 
channels such mobile payments banking have been 
rudimentary 
the retail lending spectrum quite well covered with 
prime sub prime borrowers having relatively easy 
access consumer loans except for lending banks 
most other consumer lending based convenience 
and speed 
difficult create profitable fintech business models 
niche markets due the limited pool users volume that 
can generated within the size the korean market 
exhibit

source company reports morgan stanley research 
financial products services innovation has been mainly 
driven traditional players for the purposes gaining 
operational efficiencies rather than being driven 
non financials endeavoring improve customer 
facilitation hence there has been minimal business

currently there are three methods for online card 
payments safe click easy pay and app 
card safe click most cumbersome but the most 
widely used method was the first one 
launch and the name does give customers comfort 
easy pay and app card are simpler use but they 
have not gained traction for easy pay both card 
companies and payment gateways provide this service 
but the case pgs they not have wide network 
relationships with card companies which limits usage 
allowing pgs also 
collect customer 
information 
august the standard merchant contract 
regulation was amended allow pgs collect and 
store card customer information 
change the safe click name change the public 
perception being the safest method 
currently there are not many collaborative relationships 
between payment gateways and credit card companies 
and hence this needs increased boost easy pay 
usage 
only pgs with the size and technical prowess 
effectively manage security will allowed collect and

for offline mobile payment proliferate there are various elements that need resolved 
including pos terminal conversion and ease use 
the key factor that needs 
addressed that pos terminals 
korea are mostly not geared for 
offline mobile payment for ones 
that are mobile ready the process 
more cumbersome than using 
credit card and hence utilization rate 
mobile cards for offline usage 
remains quite low 
based our channel checks with 
van companies the conversion 
rate for merchant pos terminals 
from existing magnetic swipe device 
new technology based pos 
terminals such nfc magnetic 
platforms account for around 
total offline merchant pos 
terminals million effective card

feasibility and also adoption 
continue obstacles for pos

ease use also another key 
issue resolve current offline

many more steps use compared

are the same whether mobile card

theme internet banking not expected game changer selective few could 
launch specialized online banks 
what should expect limited regulatory loosening means participation level will low 
unlike expect legal regulatory changes passed the national assembly but the participation level 
could somewhat limited ownership and regulatory stipulations are not fully liberalized addition the 
questionable profitability internet banking business also factor our view forecast market size this case 
there should least select few participants and could financial entities namely non chaebol non bank 
companies savings banks and possibly even icts banks could consider setting internet bank but there would 
limited benefit for large cap banks but foreign banks could have interest doing our view 
not fully discount the possibility ict such daumkakao being allowed get internet bank license 
but there would little need for daumkakao set full service internet bank would only need deposittaking and money transfer functions support its payment platform 
how could different although it unlikely meaningful regulatory loosening could change things 
ownership rules were changed and larger non financial players were allowed establish internet banks then 
there could possibility large corporates and financials affiliated large corporate groups entering into the 
market this were the case incumbent players would experience disintermediation deposits move from 
incumbents the new players the market could large with meaningful participation 
who benefits major beneficiaries unless strong platform players enter 
with limited participation the companies that were able establish the internet banks should benefit assuming that 
they are successful implementing their strategy 
participation levels are higher the beneficiaries would the large internet banks but peripheral service providers 
such credit rating agencies and risk solution providers should also benefit our view

what should expect faster rollout fintech initiatives through strategic alliance with existing financial 
intermediaries 
unlike developed markets expect the roll out fintech pushed out more established icts rather than 
start ups due the capital burden and questionable business economics due structurally different environment 
ict companies are likely pave the way 
our base case the fintech movement should enable ict companies introduce innovative services peer topeer lending crowd funding etc through strategic relationships with existing financial institutions fintech policies are 
likely enhance functionality financial services higher daily transfer amount 
the success fintech initiatives does not hinge regulations rather the success mobile payments peer topeer lending and crowd funding initiatives will depend unique advantages each ict platform messaging 
platform features user reach frequency social graph provide enough value added differentiation 
how could different internet bank license attained fintech operators not require strategic 
tie with financial services intermediaries 
leads higher monetization revenue share interest margin can maximized cutting out intermediaries 
time market fintech services could expedited even faster negotiation agreement longer required 
with intermediaries 
small chance exists where rollout fintech services independently without internet bank license regulators 
provide regulatory loopholes function internet bank without the license 
what the risk competition and cost services 
fintech vertical market opportunity and thus roi questionable scale cost service outweigh benefits

irrespective whether our base case bull case plays out mobile service providers such daumkakao and samsung should 
continue important players the payment market but discernible earnings accretion will need time 
daumkakao the first mover mobile messenger based payments and settlements and should have better prospects for growth 
pushing new initiatives and collaborating with financial players which would enable differentiate its services from peers 
fintech policies are likely enhance functionalities financial services higher daily transfer amount 
samsung business background both finance and provides significant competitive advantage fintech for samsung 
electronics while near term earnings contribution from fintech may limited think consolidation the mobile offline payment 
market will provide samsung with positive long term earnings driver 
incumbent financial players 
card issuers should benefit from increased commerce volume that would depend how they are aligned with the mobile 
solution providers believe samsung card with linkage samsung group should have advantage 
while disintermediation risk seems low the near term advancement fintech has inherently negative implications the key 
factor should what level regulators open internet banking and also sizable development other online financial 
intermediaries banks bhcs need ensure that they are not left behind and believe strategic tie ups and melding with local 
and foreign players will needed there minimal disparity between banks the fintech front currently but would more 
supportive banks with larger card operations big data usage 
the non banking side insurers are expect less active the fintech front seems there are fewer disintermediation 
risks and also minimal benefits gain from fintech for brokers there news flow that some players such kiwoom 
moneytoday april are considering the set internet bank but regulatory approval remains uncertain this time second 
tier financial institutions would more risk than banks insurers and brokers our view 
other players 
online shopping expected show increased growth but the benefits may the consumers rather than the online shopping 
companies due low margins and severe competition 
intermediaries and peripheral service providers such payment gateways security solution providers and credit bureaus could 
benefit from the fintech movement but believe benefits would more discernible under our bull case
