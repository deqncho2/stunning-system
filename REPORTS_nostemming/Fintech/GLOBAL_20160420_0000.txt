banking the business case well some the key roadblocks and her thoughts how 
challenging and surmountable they are the end this note give summary our

subdivided this note into 
investor roadmap which businesses are most prone disruption when 
misconceptions how disruptive blockchain adoption could 
box why should care about blockchain 
key hurdles surmount make blockchain implementation reality 
just how disruptive for financial institutions our tentative conclusions 
conversation with blythe masters 
global financials fintech april 
investor roadmap which businesses are most prone disruption when 
there isn really major financial institution either bank infrastructure provider that isn deeply 
involved exploring and some cases beginning commercialise this technology today 
blythe masters 
which businesses are most prone disruption 
the challenge for has been boiling down the ocean opportunity the number applications this 
technology wholesale financial services merely limited ourselves wholesale financial services the 
challenge trying figure out what are the projects that have legs that are viable that can scalable and 
have interest multiple parties blythe masters 
financial institutions are expected spend over blockchain projects making one the 
fastest developing enterprise software markets all time according report magister advisors 
emerging use cases 
proposed use cases are mostly ones with costly and complex processes for post trade settlement and 
change title santander innoventures identified use cases including international money transfers 
trade finance syndicated lending and collateral management business insider june interestingly 
some these use cases could solved with existing technology but took the threat new entrants funded 
vcs growth tech multiples not bank multiples get the incumbents together discuss how deliver 
more speed and efficiency lower cost expect the financial institutions and their customers will adopt 
blockchain technologies asset class asset class for validated proof concepts poc efforts over the next 
years iterative process that will likely last decades similar uber there are likely many potential use 
cases can imagine today below are those that come most frequently when engaging with the industry 
post trade settlement corporate loans cds repo derivatives equities and post trade settlement 
costly each transacting party has team controllers internal auditors external auditors and regulators 
reviewing transactions distributed ledger could enhance the audit function specific securities are more 
easily tracked this would most helpful dks don knows which are the most costly part post trade 
settlement more people are required involved and delays mean capital and liquidity are tied 
transacting parties using the same distributed ledger could have more visibility help speed resolution 
management which should lower staff costs associated with post trade settlement 
corporate whole loans trades are well known for long settlement periods with weeks not unusual there are 
wide range reasons including lengthy review process long review periods are costly they can expose 
traders market risk and limiting liquidity the product blockchain technology could enable all participants 
the chain see where the documents are the sequenced approval process highlighting who reviewing 
how long they have had the documents pushing intermediaries speed the review process 
additionally there are opportunities shorten the settlement window while settlement windows are function 
regulatory and legal requirements technology pushing people expect increasingly quick response times 
regulators are already moving shorten the settlement window equities moving join europe from 
days over the next months and while today technology can adapt deliver shorter 
settlement times blockchain technology can useful particularly assets that have the least efficient netting 
clearing collateral management and longer clearing periods 
global financials fintech april 
additionally faster settlement window lowers cost trade less capital tied the settlement process 
improving liquidity that capital recycled back into the market the challenge establishing who will create 
the standard for all market participants link into this simpler smaller vertically integrated market 
like australia which has one regulator responsible for all the participants the post trade food chain the 
exchanges clearers banks investment banks and asset managers asx leading the charge migrating its 
chess infrastructure more efficient blockchain infrastructure over the next few years pulling the rest the 
industry that ties into them along for the investment spend today for better efficiencies tomorrow will 
address the implications for local and global industry structure more thoroughly future notes 
there been arms race pre trade infrastructure for more than decade now should ironic all 
you that trading infrastructure has evolved the point that competitive advantages measured fractions 
nanoseconds and yet still dealing with plus two three worse depending your asset class eight 
years after the financial crisis that pretty shocking statement and you know one the reasons why 
post trade infrastructure monolithic there hasn been incentive really speed very expensive 
replace because clunky and processing enormous volumes activity and taking the wheels anything 
that moving fast always challenge heavily regulated blythe masters 
trade finance trade finance can pose some challenges specifically you need ensure the goods transfer 
before the payment made with blockchain all parties financiers trading houses and any other trusted 
intermediaries are able see when the goods have shipped and can release funding appropriately this 
should reduce time confirm assets confirm transaction release payment and received confirmations 
international payments international payments have friction them with multi day settlement times and 
relatively slow bank settlement system moving blockchain should shorten settlement periods speed 
transactions and reduce the risk fraud this would become even more important intra country payments 
systems increasingly move real time including the october swift and ripple are both leading 
interesting suggestions for international payments 
reference data blockchain technology could offer significant efficiencies transactors holding reference 
data for individual securities providing rules based standard data could enhance quality and auditability 
transactions occur the history could enhance resolution management well 
regulatory the banking system has numerous capital and liquidity charges blockchain holding the data 
for regulators could more efficient for banks assessing the data intra firm well for regulators wanting 
compare their regulated entities 
simply put the opportunity cut out layers and layers non value added post trade reconciliation activity 
whereby parties who keep their own records the same information have ensure consistent with other 
parties the same information where course because kept separately and different infrastructures 
there are discrepancies blythe masters 
misconceptions how disruptive blockchain adoption could 
think there are few misconceptions that may overstate quite how disruptive distributed ledgers could 
blockchain adoption does not mean unpermissioned networks 
not one bank nor policymaker that have met with blockchain gives even second thought 
unpermissioned public network kyc aml and other considerations means has permissioned network 
this reduces the risk that new start will able disintermediate entire value chains how many tech 
companies want vertically integrate into regulated financial institution seems more likely that they will 
want retain their tech oriented multiple supplier software and consultants the financial services 
industry rather than regulated financial more likely expect that financial industry blockchains will 
built around industry consortia which agree common standards with close regulatory support this 
global financials fintech april 
environment believe the market may underestimate the opening advantages for banks and custodians yes 
they will need invest deliver faster less expensive financial services while ensuring viability and 
security but they have the client relationships they can deliver more streamlined process with lower costs 
they will formidable competitor 
blockchain adoption does not mean 
there are quite few blockchain firms whose business model centres settlement timeframe the 
pitch that more efficient than today days settlement their business case misses few key 
points first the primary reason for multi day settlement periods regulatory and legal rules and market 
practice which enables broader participation retail investors second current technology could deliver 
settlement today broad range asset classes regulatory and legal rules allow for you don need 
blockchain deliver third markets with today appear have less liquidity and more volatility than 
markets with settlement window several reasons chief among them that settlement window there 
shorting which reduces liquidity expect settlement windows shrink due regulatory and legal 
changes but not they shrink lenders lose some revenues but also free capital blockchain 
technology can drive down costs too competition could migrate settlements digital asset holdings 
building what you want into its blockchain solution which should also enable users more explicitly 
price for the liquidity they want 
find that there are some vested interests custodians potentially banks where actually plus two 
three quite helpful because they get the carry the benefit case resilience and cost cutting offset the 
nuisance the carry generally the reason why there are vested interests who need for example earn the 
carry because they operating massively expensive infrastructure without which the business would 
completely unsupportable 
the carry has there order justify the cost associated with inefficient process and there isn really 
custodian the world that when you get the right level seniority doesn understand that problem 
they will give the carry nanosecond they give more than proportionate amount the costs and 
simple that blythe masters 
venture capitalists don like projects that require industry consortia but banks need partners 
share the expense given profitability challenges 
you came and said are you interested tech that can solve back office problems and requires 
consortium approach not interested that investor matt harris managing director bain capital 
ventures dtcc blockchain symposium april 
argued january many western banks are focused lights on issues responding regulatory 
issues simplying trying put off the heavy costs involved simply put the payback many technology 
investments beyond years whilst given the poor profitability western banking banks have been rationing 
spend not increasing keep themselves the black argued before perhaps this more than any 
other factor explains why many banks particular have been slow respond see financials what 
learned davos result this and some the other constraints discuss below banks will form 
partnerships address see also the fintech challenge adapt partner 
global financials fintech april 
one blockchain expect plurality blockchains 
when you hear blockchain think software lot experts are probably bristling right now but financial 
sector analyst that what blockchain delivers new software architecture that provides shared immutable 
records making processing transactions less error prone seems like logical upgrade the point that there 
one size fits all blockchain application are likely see different blockchains for different use cases 
developers will able leverage consulting and analytics from some blockchain solutions others may able 
hit their goals through owning large global use case expect most will integrate with existing 
infrastructure but some may require totally new core interface although those better large opportunities 
with lots cost mutualisation one similarity for all successful blockchains they need not only enable 
process efficiency but also organisational efficiency financial service companies will only adopting 
blockchains the investment spend retool delivers hard dollar cost savings within years 
blockchains not have entail complete transformation and early trials especially may 
use some workarounds 
rather blockchains will need plug existing technology financials cannot afford reinvent their financial 
technology nor take massive punt new technology until proven clearly blockchain technology will 
simplest markets that are already fully dematerialised with clear title why australia stock exchange asx 
focus but even larger win will dematerialising complex western markets too 
one industry expert recent event held under chatham house rules said that distributed management 
digital signatures offered blockchain technology might separated from its indelible record keeping 
mechanisms near term capital markets implementations this would form cheating whereby new 
transactions would added from distributed set nodes but where the golden copy these data would 
maintained centralised repository example workaround for desired use case reference data 
blockchain technology not centred payments 
bitcoin may the most widely recognised instance the blockchain but global financials are likely put lot 
daylight between themselves and bitcoin financial institutions are required allow regulators review 
transactions financial institutions have ensure that all the customers their platform are reviewed under 
the know your customer kyc and anti money laundering aml guidelines which permissionless blockchain 
like bitcoin would not allow that said there could some payments mechanisms between trusted 
authenticated parties particular cross border which seems inefficient today 
the blockchain 
what blockchain software that enables data sharing across network individual computers 
blockchain describes computers transferring blocks records chronological chain blockchain 
technology also known distributed ledger the term distributed ledger refers the concept that 
each user shares the same ledger set accounts defined the software blockchain and 
distributed ledger are used interchangeably 
how does work through shared software infrastructure and trust users agree software 
protocol describing the rules for the type quality and transferability data addition the rules for 
authorisation verification and permutation users trust that information entered into and transactions 
conducted over the blockchain software are valid blockchain technology financial service best initial 
use cases think are solve cluttered processes the post trade settlement period where there 
change title 
global financials fintech april 
why blockchain 
blockchains can enhance security cryptography used ensure that records can not changed 
altered tokenisation can also enable security for each block data whether resting 
transacting private keys for each user and product coupled with encryption for data transfer improves 
data security and resiliency bad guys self select out users data and transactions are all encrypted 
transactions permissioned via security keys financial services not expect blockchain security 
ride off fully distributed permissionless ledgers which can help police fully decentralised 
blockchain system 
blockchains can enable lower costs shared encrypted transparent database can reduce the 
teams people across the firms responsible for authenticating and approving each specific 
transaction the data are irrevocable and auditable additional benefits users can share costs 
building and maintaining infrastructure more efficient than managing individual systems the potential 
for material reduction costs from current utility like structures potentially one the most 
compelling reasons investigate think and echoed the suite meet 
why that relevant this context well one way out that box there need several solutions 
but one way radically restructure your cost base and not talking five ten cuts costs 
talking and there only one way that and that share mutualised common 
infrastructure that previously was kept separately and run independently every market participant 
blythe masters 
blockchains increase speed transactions are more streamlined buyer and seller account 
update simultaneously when transaction authorised fewer mistakes buyers authorisations are 
transparent not only the transacting parties but also any related parties including lawyers controllers 
accountants etc fewer mistakes means less capital tied disputed trades and more capital for new 
trades improving velocity capital 
blockchains enable greater visibility transactions can monitored real time users can see 
transactions completed important sequencing matters trade finance this could valuable 
for regulators banks 
you get some cyber security benefits and improved regulatory transparency because one the benefits 
this technology one those credentialed parties that can get access this information can include 
regulators blythe masters 
dispute resolution management each step the transaction approved there dispute both 
parties have digital record showing who authorised approval for transaction should enable swifter 
dispute resolution 
potential for fraud reduction permissioned blockchains valid users onboard the multi node 
architecture makes harder for corruption unnoticed assume the financial institutions use 
permissioned blockchains not the anarchic plurality peer invigilation the like one clear difference 
between some vcs and tech folk meet and the use case financial services have yet meet

key hurdles surmount make blockchain implementation reality 
let clear whenever meet suite financial institutions see the hurdles and limitation blockchain 
technology that not say they are insurmountable but take view quite how disruptive blockchain 
technology could and how long could take realised you need understand the hurdles and 
roadblocks this not say any the below are not solvable but none trivial and suggests are not

use case cost benefit does the benefit given use case justify the investment 
regularly see banks that could move real time systems but have put this off given expense and risk many 
also cite that took cba commonwealth bank australia well run bank five years install new system 
are these use cases large enough support the incremental spend would they better serviced 
current platforms rather than using distributed ledger 
global financials fintech april 
cost mutualisation who funds the cost building new infrastructure 
banks will need share infrastructure build out costs equitably new systems are truly inter operable 
industry utilities this potentially subject organisational disputes users assess how much invest which 
can enable free freer riders customise which degrades interoperability speed and which measure 
allocate costs among participants revenues market share the alternative third party building out 
industry infrastructure standard specifications major users via industry consortiums such 
details grey box below many banks are dedicating the most their spend upgrading and overhauling 
legacy systems and with profitability already under pressure finding budget for blockchain projects may prove 
challenging although some parts the world these pressures are less australia 
disparate incentives companies the financial value chain 
inevitably there are winners and losers far much the action has been from backed companies but 
within the larger financials the custodians that have been most active for offensive and defensive reasons 
for example the banks involved the linux hyperledger project see grey box below are predominantly 
custodians 
many financial institutions are experimenting private with technology that uses consensus protocols

how best 
managing network effects maintain scalability 
scalability has limits including across network bandwidth storage and even processing power some 
implementations blockchain including bitcoin scalability challenges have already become evident least 
well anticipated for blockchain move forward needs offer more efficient scalable solution over current 
infrastructure 
scale limits tend emerge variety circumstances including 
when the full blockchain ledger intended fully distributed all participant nodes 
multiple nodes must agree order for transaction executed 
all nodes are required have coincident access the ledger and transactions and 
the blocks are too small allow for high velocity frequent transactions causing transaction 
recording overflow the block size 
not controlling the above elements among others creates network effect that can cause the compute storage 
and network requirements approach hyperbolic geometric growth the implications for just power 
consumption have been studied with startling results one study suggests that encrypt all permutations for 
the million individuals germany and the spectrum bank products used that country would cost 
more energy annually than that produced the country whole separately the government office for 
global financials fintech april 
science report distributed ledger technology beyond block chain estimated that the energy requirements 
run bitcoin are excess and may comparable the electricity usage ireland 
while moore law and specialised silicon development may help reduce power consumption marginally 
are seeing various iterations the blockchain concept emerging that better limit network effect and its impact 
hardware requirements generally speaking most new blockchain proposals are looking range 
mitigating characteristics including 
limiting participant nodes permissioned networks 
centralising all part the blockchain ledger 
paring the blockchain ledger under certain circumstances 
making block sizes and their analysis more variable and 
incorporating data analytics and probabilities into the verification process etc 
governance 
many the issues raised banks and market infrastructure are not technology but process and governance 
related for example who would charge maintaining and managing the blockchain who admits new 
participants the blockchain with the corresponding duty run kyc aml checks permissioned system 
who validates any given transaction and who determines who sees which transactions 
the other hand the ability process transactions directly between parties without the need for the trusted 
central utilities that currently serve the function reducing counterparty risk poses risk traditional

regulation 
there are numerous policy issues that crop when meet banks and policy digital identity cross border 
standards and integrity systems are nearly always head the lists regulation also critical driving fully 
dematerialised environment for securities trading arcane physical certificates need digitised fully 
benefit from the speed and fraud control offered fully digitised system 
can you use this technology mutualise the infrastructure for identity management and kyc for financial 
services purposes boils down very simple question and that will the regulators let you because 
essence what you need confident that you going rely shared service and the shared 
service gets wrong are you all collectively going held individually responsible for having got wrong 
and therefore safer more responsible for you have independently gone and gathered the same 
information prove that you were trying extra especially hard instead irresponsibly relying this shared 
service blythe masters 
legal risks especially kyc and aml 
particular not one bank have met wishes disaggregated open source model for identity banks and 
policymakers need close control for kyc and aml issues finding single digital identity passport authoriser 
will key that why see most progress those markets with relatively small number players work

absolutely the case that the initial regulatory reaction anonymous making payments over the internet 
was extremely negative for reasons the obvious risk anti money laundering controls sanctions avoidance

just how disruptive for financial institutions our tentative conclusions 
the heart our interest this will distributed ledger help hinder financial institutions 
the bullish case that sharing and decluttering infrastructure could radically reduce costs and 
provide much needed boost roes let clear for many banks especially investment banks 
radical reduction and simplification processing costs would blessing showed 
our recent blue paper with oliver wyman that banks will need not just prune but also change 
their model sweeten their roes hit hurdle rates according santander more efficient 
digital ledgers could cut costs the banking industry billion year 
the bearish case that dramatic reduction margins the same time higher spend 
destabilising and disruptive also risks profit pools leaking other players 
our tentative conclusions 
with any early stage highly complex technology that demonstrates the ability change conduct 
business think too early stage make any profound comments about winners and losers 
breadth adoption 
think years off for widespread adoption and not material earnings any 
financial cover rather show our roadmap expect proof concept tests 
rather shared utilities for kyc securities processing and the like are likely have bigger impact 
bank earnings than blockchain implementation 
buy into the concept that distributed ledger has the potential help reduce the costs posttrade activities dramatically studies range from bcg santander infoventures june 
this stage 
best use cases financial services strike post trade especially for loans cds and securities 
more broadly payments much further off although keep close watch ripple and its crossborder payment offerings which look bridge faster domestic payment systems between countries 
watch two experiments closely first the dematerialised and simpler markets such australia and 
singapore first for broad market initiatives second cumbersome process where cost savings could 
large such bank loan settlement for signs progress 
for custodians such bny mellon state street northern trust citi jpm which generate profits from 
ensuring securities are accurately measured and moved and which benefit from the carry from 
blockchain technology threatens their value add and shorter settlement periods could cut into 
revenues more than they could free capital for buybacks but that why the custodians are 
the leading edge distributed ledger work ensure that they can deliver the most efficient

blythe masters left morgan natural point having sold business for them and was planning 
minding own business for least year doing few things that hadn done for the preceding awfully 
long time and became during the course that what turned out four months the year exposed the 
concept blockchain through this little company called digital asset every now and again long career 
you come across idea that real kind idea where couple things fall into place and you think 
wow actually that has real implications 
and thought things through with the benefit having the better part three decades experience 
financial services having worked and around market infrastructures having run global trading businesses 
was cfo the investment bank for while operated the risk organisation and had the joy helping 
morgan and others navigate the post financial crisis regulation process dodd frank and the corresponding 
changes europe and the rest the world good sense financial regulation and here was this idea that 
had implications for the core the way that industry operated largely for the better and opinion arriving 
time where the need was great 
global financials fintech april 
and you don come across ideas that magnitude very often even once career especially not time 
where you really have nothing better that got off the horse and back onto the desk and decided 
join this little start was employee number four for full disclosure wasn idea the company 
didn create existed and was hired run and that was almost exactly year ago the day and can 
talk about what happened since but been lot 
huw van steenis before dig into that why you think distributed ledger such breakthrough 
technology 
blythe masters okay answer the question going have explain what distributed ledger 
brace yourselves and let see can this without causing consternation think the best thing 
first all ask all you suspend everything you heard read about bitcoin crypto currencies and 
all the associated noise connection with criminal activity and other undesirable aspects and just put those 
thoughts away for minute and come back why there connection and why interesting but 
instead focus the fact that underlying the invention alternative currencies crypto currencies was the 
creation technology and that technology actually enables all sorts things which just one use case 
crypto currencies 
and that technology which known universally blockchain technology perhaps more generically 
distributed ledger technology where all the interest and the focus least wholesale regulated financial 
institutions actually really pretty simple concept and you know what database then you the 
right sort territory and you all know what database because fact blockchain technology although 
when you get into the technology itself there some complexity there and some ingeniousness nothing 
more than new form database approach database architecture that fundamentally improvement 
over the way that traditionally databases have been designed and used the past 
what database you know place where store important information that want refer back 
for various purposes some point the future visually you can imagine cylindrical thing owned 
someone administered someone typically exists physical location the administrator the 
database very interested investing and ensuring that the perimeter security that cylinder that protects the 
contents strong impenetrable the lucky ones are the ones that know that turned out that penetration 
happened and then there the rest who just don know yet 
and typically the information that kept databases raw information not encrypted not further protected 
other than the perimeter security which increasingly proves penetrable when someone gets there 
that isn authorised that the consequences can dire whether the theft someone identity for 
theft funds what have you you read about this every day that traditional database architecture and 
pretty much everybody keeps databases because they have important information about their activity their 
client activity that they need keep record and matter fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities 
they need keep that record 
interaction between entities who keep their own separate databases requires process taking information 
from that database sending off another party for whatever the relevant purpose independently 
validating verifying and then course when the two sets information aren consistent reconciling the 
reasons for the differences and simply put that reconciliation process between different renditions the same 
data that needs communicated between parties accounts for tens billions dollars cost every year 
the financial manufacturing process 
that the way things have traditionally worked financial database architecture for years and along comes 
new technology this blockchain technology distributed ledger technology which makes few 
fundamental changes what just described the first thing that instead this cylinder one place you 
have network with multiple nodes and you have technology which enables the multiple nodes that 
network accessed those with need and right know and for ensuring that the data the important 
information that all referring back can kept sync and replicated continuously real time 
near need real time basis between parties 
global financials fintech april 
and protecting all this the fact that the data itself encrypted and the identity the users those who 
have the right need and right access that information subject sophisticated identity management 
regime involving again cryptographic tools that very possible independently verify whether not 
actor who they say they are and has the right access that information and simply put what that allows you 
for the first time responsibly share mutualise common infrastructure and use this database 
environment place keep record important transactional information that one record golden 
prime record that can shared multiple independent entities that protected through cryptography 
that only those with need and right know only the piece information that environment that they have 
the need and right know can that 
and this creates the opportunity cut out layers and layers non value added post trade reconciliation 
activity whereby parties who keep their own records the same information have ensure consistent with 
other parties the same information where course because kept separately and different 
infrastructures there are discrepancies and simple that shared database infrastructure 
cryptographically secure environment which means different entities independent competing entities can now 
share the same infrastructure with enormous implications for efficiency and actually cyber security and other 
things because the cryptographic security that introduced 
not lot sex appeal that amazing hot and the reason why the fact that this technology 
was first used invent crypto currencies which were designed facilitate essentially anonymous payments 
money value between unknown actors over the internet which immediately raises flags about who are they 
why are they doing and how stop perfectly legitimate concerns the part regulators and 
regulated entities 
fact that just one subset how you can use this technology others involve post trade processing much 
more mundane things like securities other financial assets and this coming time where you all know 
the industry little challenged challenged from performance point view you want boil down 
one metric roe problem roe you know has sort three inputs depending how you want 
express but its revenue minus expenses divided capital 
and revenue down and has been compressed for while more proprietary trading more principal 
investing low interest rates low credit spreads costs are high and rising compliance with new regulation etc 
and regulatory capital has gone one direction more than proportionately since with the result that roe 
challenge and you consistently making returns your capital that below your long run cost 
capital that becomes existential problem for financial services providers 
why that relevant this context well one way out that box there need several solutions but one 
way radically restructure your cost base and not talking five ten cuts costs talking 
and there only one way that and that share mutualised common infrastructure that 
previously was kept separately and run independently every market participant 
there great need right now added that you get some cyber security benefits and improved regulatory 
transparency because one the benefits this technology one those credentialed parties that can get 
access this information can include regulators post trade transaction reporting becomes thing the 
past because they get look directly into the transactions record and interconnectedness between parties 
reduced because one those points your network nodes fails guess what all the other points the 
network nodes still there and has the same information single point failure due operational 
cyber attack significantly mitigated 
there lot benefit associated with this technology that are interest time great need and 
interest both regulators and regulated parties and short woke one morning bed like that was the 
moment that had when finally came realise what the potential implications the technology were 
once managed get over scepticism what bitcoin was all about and realised that there was lot more 
global financials fintech april 
huw van steenis you make very powerful case for the benefits and was chatting the ceo ubs this 
morning this stage and was saying the same that blockchain and fundamentally rethinking the model 
the heart how financials will have reinvent themselves let start with how are going make 
happen entrepreneur now you actually making happen what are the problems you need solve 
what are the issues you are already biting into 
blythe masters there good list them and wouldn really entrepreneurial was easy 
particular order but obviously major one certainly the stage where took this job year ago was 
widespread scepticism spent the first two months doing this job persuading friends and otherwise who all 
thought that lost the plot again and had gone off start trading bitcoin for living that took bit 
explanation and there really was issue where for the first several years after the invention this technology 
was being promoted group advocates and some cases inventors who took pretty dim view the 
financial services sector 
fact you were thought best inefficient profit hungry but worst evil intermediaries exploiting the 
rest the world who had proven their collective unworthiness result the effects the financial crisis 
which mean not belittle the effects the financial crisis but the notion that the entire financial services 
industry adds social economic value obviously probably not the conclusion draw from the lessons 
those events but there was this community that felt very much that that was the case let invent 
infrastructure that allows bypass all forms financial intermediary 
and while bypass the government central banks and any form adult supervision and that 
better way run financial services that was the story behind bitcoin the application this technology 
alternative currencies that didn really play too well either financial regulators the regulated community 
they focused that and didn initially understand appreciate the potential application the technology 
distinct from that particular use case 
the first challenge was just that education and think getting few people like myself who speak the 
language financial services who been there done that and understand that there actually some value 
added going and understand that why not just that the regulation exists but why exists and what purpose 
serves who can translate the positive attributes this technology into financial speak and that was pretty 
big body work certainly wouldn ascribe all that having been down myself but myself and number 
others other companies other individuals ubs and oliver bussmann who their cio has been great 
advocate and there have been many others 
that was number one and think honest this stage past that point there isn really major 
financial institution either bank infrastructure provider that isn deeply involved exploring some cases 
beginning commercialise this technology today the second issue that comes inevitably regulation now 
all you know because you the industry there not just one regulatory framework that you need 
worry about this context there are many many them there the regulation payments and consumer 
protection prudential regulation financial institutions regulation markets and market infrastructure and 
their resiliency and the rules the game many many dimensions this 
absolutely the case that the initial regulatory reaction anonymous making payments over the internet 
was extremely negative for reasons the obvious risk anti money laundering controls sanctions avoidance 
promoting criminal activity long long list concerns and not mention consumer protection concerns 
that remains valid set concerns but small subset the concerns and the deploying this technology 
wholesale financial infrastructure provision much more nuanced topic 
and much like the market participants the initially deeply sceptical regulators themselves have come long way 
over the past year and see some the potential benefits and the potential benefits here actually regulators 
have high degree existing authority ensure are delivered and prevent they are not delivered 
you know you have the pleasure operating sensitive market infrastructure today you are subject 
considerable degree regulation and you have demonstrate things like resiliency and privacy and 
compliance with law and kyc and auditability and reversibility and one could for hours 
global financials fintech april 
turns out that you want introduce new technology new database infrastructure that has some 
benefits you have able answer all those questions satisfactorily and you don back 
square one and hopefully don pass jail along the way having said that all those questions can and with 
the right design choices are answerable you just have tweak some the original assumptions about 
blockchain for example the public bitcoin blockchain was invented facilitate activity between anyone and 
everyone and you had ability know who therefore you were dealing with nor who was actually providing 
the resiliency the networks processing the transactions 
okay that clearly not going work for financial regulated assumptions change that assumption set 
private permission network using the same technology but where the access participants 
permissioned you can play you aren previously credentialed board and identified and where the 
incentives for maintaining the resiliency the network are not the pursuit financial gain mining bitcoins 
but rather the incentive participate network that resilient and works and you use run your 
business which the way all you already many you operate data centres and benefit from 
networks that have work run your business 
this not new just new technology implementation for old fashioned concept when you have 
that kind conversation with regulator and you tweaked these concerning features the original 
implementation blockchain becomes much less scary conversation and there has been tremendous 
progress made with regulators all over the world there are number them who are now actively speaking 
the public domain about their enthusiasm for this approach done right including australia the asic who 
are the securities regulator there who regulate the australian stock exchange asx with whom working 
one the earliest deployments this technology the wild you will regulation always comes 
issue but actually speaking someone who knows deeply the regulatory requirements and the biases and 
preferences and objectives regulators don see that fundamental impediment series challenges 
and questions that you have answer appropriately but not showstopper 
the last thing that always comes the network effect many you operate big companies with many 
departments different geographical locations that keep their own records things separately and tackling that 
internally the organisation using this infrastructure one benefit but the big benefits come when you 
talking about facilitating goldman and morgan and ubs and others interacting with stock market call the 
asx and settlement and clearing system the csd the case the asx having multiple parties leverage 
the same common infrastructure and that obviously requires mutual decision making coalition 
agreement direction 
the good news referring back earlier comments the need and the incentives this are enormous 
and fundamentally different than they were five ten years ago when people used treat this space either 
irrelevant because was just the back office stuff and banks were making enough money cover the cost 
some cases was felt proprietary not many people have that view any longer most people would love 
see the back all but any case the incentive collaborate has changed 
and where you can find central point decision making where there existing central market 
infrastructure there happens australia and many other places around the world let talk about 
australia for minute very interesting market fully dematerialised stock market none this nonsense 
with physical stock certificates that have kept vaults and boxes anywhere mentally the leap has 
already been taken towards having purely electronic records ownership some competition the exchange 
space but government mandated essentially monopoly the provision the csd essential securities 
depository which the ledger record and the settlement and clearing system for the whole market and one 
provider infrastructure all that even though multiple entities all the banks brokers custodians etc plug 
into that administrative essentially 
also happens years old and nearing the end its useful life got one way the other 
not about break the way don want create alarm the australian markets here but has 
upgraded going changed and therein lies the ingredients for adoption early very interesting 
space sizeable market but not gigantic not nearly fragmented many the other markets around the 
world multiple interested parties with the line interest the need replace anyway and conditions the 
global financials fintech april 
ground where economies scale can maintained and extracted here because you replacing completely 
one infrastructure with the new infrastructure instead having the old infrastructure hang around whole 
part you see that the early adoptions happen where you find those ingredients you will and they exist 
huw van steenis let pursue that bit and come back some the obstacles moment what 
digital asset hoping achieve and why australia 
blythe masters focused reforming post trade you know there been arms race pre trade 
infrastructure for more than decade now and you think about should ironic all you that trading 
infrastructure has evolved the point that competitive advantages measured fractions nanoseconds and 
yet still dealing with plus two three worse depending your asset class eight years after the 
financial crisis that pretty shocking statement and you know one the reasons why post trade 
infrastructure monolithic there hasn been incentive really speed very expensive replace 
because clunky and processing enormous volumes activity and taking the wheels anything that 
moving fast always always challenge heavily regulated etc etc etc 
the opportunity terms the enormous inefficiencies the slowness the potential lack resiliency lies 
more the post trades base than the pre trades base and when you think about post trade let give you 
example simple transaction involving you and finding each other stock market and trading stock 
now you and individuals have idea who the other probably each have broker and they may 
small broker our friend probably aggregates larger broker there clearing member somewhere 
there that provides clearing services there may affiliated even unaffiliated bank providing leverage 
into your account not mine and much more prudent that don use leverage 
there the clearing house itself that cares because our transaction that agreed has admitted for 
clearing and then way the top the hierarchy there probably custodian somewhere one these 
brokers using third party custodian and then there the csd the ultimate ledger keeper record and 
that just you and doing one trade that assuming will get right that lot parties whose 
agreements are needed essentially credentialise authorise transaction that what you and agree via 
the stock market price discovery venue can ultimately flow through final settlement legal final settlement the 
exchange the stock from your account account and the way along the way very interesting netting 
algorithms are going adding what you and are doing along with other people activity hopefully 
minimise some the operational consequences all this now think about that for minute you back 
original description how databases are used every one the parties that simple cash equity 
transaction that just listed off essentially party with need and right know about our deal and who has 
role authenticating before can completed 
the process the gathering those acknowledgements authorisations necessary and keeping them all 
together and all referring the original record the transaction that there only one record the 
transaction broker and your broker and the broker broker and the clearing broker and the agent and 
the custodial entity and the bank and the clearing entity and the csd don all keep their own separate record 
this ridiculous little trade that did they all share the same record 
and that inherently post trade benefit because found each other with impediments efficient 
market probably got good price and there wasn really any need change that process but all the 
stuff that comes afterwards that really low hanging fruit essence that what building for asx tool 
allow those related parties authentications gathered the point transaction not one two days 
after the fact 
huw van steenis just out curiosity australia finding that there are some vested interests 
custodians potentially banks where actually plus two three quite helpful because they get the carry 
actually the benefit case resilience and cost cutting offsetting the nuisance the carry 
blythe masters well helps have been one those organisations understand that but generally the 
reason why there are vested interests who need for example earn the carry because they operating 
massively expensive infrastructure without which the business would completely unsupportable the 
global financials fintech april 
carry has there order justify the cost associated with inefficient process and there isn really 
custodian the world that when you get the right level seniority doesn understand that problem 
they will give the carry nanosecond they give more than proportionate amount the costs and 
simple that 
huw van steenis yes that makes sense when was panel recently with the wef were talking 
about some central bankers entrepreneurs and banks about the use case and the one issue which they 
stumbled around having single authentication agent because the banks that betsy and cover have had 
quarter trillion fines six years and not even just french bank one bank one bank one 
have different kyc rules even bank have got different rules how you solve that problem 
actually they feel there single passporting authority which can trusted and mutual recognition 
blythe masters there are two parts the answer number one you just assume you don solve the problem 
and build systems that have comply with the existing sm rg sbord highly differentiated and yourself 
kyc requirements for example where any entity brings itself its customer into the network the 
permission network they have the same exact kyc that they would today one way the other and 
technologically the way evidence that you refer the kyc database check that authorisation present 
and otherwise the transaction invalid and and forth obviously that perpetuation the messy 
status quo 
but that the bare minimum requirement the first question you ever get out regulator you weren 
thinking about not doing kyc anything silly like that were you okay definitely weren use 
the existing kyc infrastructure now you can also use theory this exact same technology for the purpose 
amongst other things identity management the technology described the use cases described 
have been about keeping records asset ownership and transferring asset ownership and gathering the 
signatures the authentications needed that but there are other important things that need keep 
track life like proof that you are who you say you are either individually corporately 
and you find that you read about distributed ledger blockchain technology there are plenty 
applications that are being pursued inside and outside financial services relating identity management 
particular favourite healthcare records how absurd that you cannot walk into point service venue 
doctor hospital stick your fingerprint biometric reader and have your history right there for you well this 
technology that eventually could enable that few other changes need happen too and you closer 
the than america ever will 
but coming back your question the issue can you use this technology mutualise the infrastructure for 
identity management and kyc for financial services purposes boils down very simple question and that 
will the regulators let you because essence what you need confident that you going rely 
shared service and the shared service gets wrong are you all collectively going held individually 
responsible for having got wrong and therefore safer more responsible for you have 
independently gone and gathered the same information prove that you were trying extra especially hard 
instead irresponsibly relying this shared service 
and that over simplifies the question because there are some jurisdictions where there some ongoing 
discussion about the government playing role managing centrally central identity management venues 
which course the government administrating and you rely seems little bit more reasonable for 
you rely than otherwise technology matter there absolutely the opportunity improve the 
kyc process because inherently there much duplication that with people doing the same thing 
not just morgan doing the same thing ubs has but even within morgan different departments 
morgan doing the same thing multiple times typically for different product applications there really are 
benefits there but boils down what does the law impose you institution and what would 
deemed acceptable meeting your obligations that respect and there are different regulators around 
different stages with different degrees opportunity around the world who have different orientation 
towards that 
global financials fintech april 
singapore there government funded project from one the development agencies that explicitly 
looking use this technology for precisely this purpose for the singapore markets the government 
actually working with the banks and potentially non banks run poc just this proof concept 
exactly this found that incredibly encouraging 
huw van steenis fantastic had jeff gooch cfo markit here yesterday markit reuters and ttcc are all 
trying kyc utilities they are making progress but the proving the toughest market and that 
sadly the biggest market 
blythe masters yes principally for regulatory reasons 
huw van steenis yes exactly the other hand when meet central bankers sometimes the moment 
for them the resilience because the resilience this much stronger and the point you made earlier 
the introduction about you think you haven been hacked you even bigger loser than you think because 
you don know happening talk little bit about the resilience 
blythe masters yes this bit complicated topic there are different aspects number one 
remember what said about data itself being encrypted remember described this transaction that you and 
and don know how many entities that listed out but call nine something that are involved not every 
one those entities although perhaps you wanted add tenth entity that regulator that has god 
eye view everything who has need and right know what everybody did with everybody other than that 
regulatory view you certainly don need know what did with broker and broker doesn need 
know what you did with yours etc 
the way that transaction information protected this environment each transaction becomes decompounded into those nine different bilateral relationships that described effectively and each one those 
pieces information separately encrypted and subject separate authentication and identity management 
you have prove who you are and that proving who you are gets you access only the relevant sub part 
the transaction that important not like there one key and that gives you access everything 
unless necessarily you regulator and one would have careful about that too 
the actual data itself encrypted someone hacked into this network what they would see gibberish 
unless they managed separately and individually steal everybody codes which practically infeasible the 
second point the point having the distribution the technology instead having data one database 
one point with the older fashioned back fall back mechanism where you have data recovery centre and 
and contingency plan here one node goes down the other nodes are there and you instinctively all know 
what that looks like because that the way the internet works the reason why the internet generally there 
well nowadays assuming you have whatever the access mechanism the thing behind there 
because there are multiple nodes keeping the internet running independently when one goes down there 
plenty others there the same exact concept there that element resiliency 
the issue can this whole thing hacked well number one bear mind the encryption tools that are 
being used here are not specific this industry this application there entire science cryptography the 
tools that are being used here are cutting edge but they are being developed that field and being used this 
field and that field the same field that works government security comment but you get the point and 
the case the public bitcoin blockchain scenario was set whereby was assumed that were building 
network for anyone everyone anyone could play censorship all because that assumption you 
had assume that you going encounter bad actors course and design had come with 
make the framework resilient that and the ingenious design was this thing called proof work 
the mechanism whereby the world arrives consensus what the true state the bitcoin blockchain 
database involves use computing resources essentially those computers are solving complicated algorithms 
that can only solved brute force and the only way you can that throwing lot computing power 
lot chips and lot electricity and the ones that are quickest essentially win lottery essence 
and when you win you get reward and your reward bit bitcoin and that has some independent value 
global financials fintech april 
that leads all sorts interesting questions what happens the majority the bitcoin miners are sitting 
china who knows where because you can actually tell priori basis who the winners will and what 
happens one day wake and them have colluded and clubbed together and they essentially wipe 
out the entire history everything then what are going because the idea behind the bitcoin 
blockchain was that was computationally infeasible overwhelm the computing resources the 
network which fair enough assumption because the way you need far more computers than 
google has today any individual private any individual government entity bar few china the 
debatably but more than google but they all located similar jurisdiction and the government that 
way inclined what does that mean 
that question about resiliency that one the reasons why there are concerns about the use the public 
bitcoin blockchain for these purposes you can convince yourself would expensive you can 
convince yourself that nation state acting with intent couldn overwhelm that the case private 
permissioned networks relax some these assumptions don assume that anyone and everyone can 
access assume only trusted entities that have been pre established and identified are permissioned play 
that allows you reduce the need for proof work threshold for commitment the database that 
based computing resources but requires you trust those entities not running and devoid 
bad actors all but that the majority them are free compromise but you define that group being 
regulated institutions you know and around the city london for example sydney that not such tall 
order fact the way that financial services work today the basis some element trust because you 
know you operating common jurisdiction there regulator who assesses competency and you 
misbehave there will consequences and you know who for order for there consequences 
the security resiliency concepts are very complex here they multifaceted absolutely depends what 
you designing and how and for whom and what assumptions you making the one thing almost 
unambiguously easy prove that you compare any existing infrastructure today with what being proposed 
here what being proposed here strictly stronger security environment that your benchmark which 
realistically should unless there another better alternative you pretty good shape because right now 
you don have anything like that degree sophistication the way that existing infrastructures work 
huw van steenis let maybe come back digital asset you achieved huge amount the last 
months you active sydney you active singapore mean one the challenges you gone job 
where almost every time zone the digital asset talk bit about how you prioritise the bets the 
business the prospects that you pursuing and where you want take over the next couple years 
blythe masters have offices new york well people new york san francisco tel aviv budapest 
somewhere announced western europe but that not london and london and sydney and think 
that you know one year old company and somewhere between and souls speak 
pretty steep trajectory some those are offices where just have developer resources just technical 
personnel why did some those places well there because the talent pools those 
particular markets are very interesting and talent scarce commodity this space especially talent that has 
combination cryptography skills and financial services skills and that essence that what our company 
all about not finding those and then building those 
obviously big challenge running organisation that dispersed that but then still only ish 
person ish person org you know let get real some you manage tens thousands people 
and certainly hundreds people can done and turns out that when what you development 
you technology company which what are actually technologists are rather used remote working 
and using slack boards and gyro tools and other things coordinate and when you working the context 
doing sequential sprints which are just defined sub projects the path the holy grail with defined goals 
being able programme hours day because you have programmers different geographical time zones 
actually incredibly powerful like that model and evolve things and try keep simple 
possible but also need close our clients and our clients are without exception big global firms 
most whom have operations all over the world connectivity with partners and others all over the world 
global financials fintech april 
the challenge for has been boiling down the ocean opportunity the number applications this 
technology wholesale financial services merely limited ourselves wholesale financial services you 
know not doing healthcare not doing identity management for other purposes the challenge 
trying figure out what are the projects that have legs that are viable that can scalable and have interest 
multiple parties described the australian situation for reason because does check lot those boxes 
there are other similar projects like that and what building for australia has direct relevance for the 
deutsche rses the lsegs the dtccs the tmxs the hong kong exchange the singapore exchange 
indisputably and there great alignment interest the part those organisations that this technology 
develops develops fashion that has foundation that open source and the public domain and that 
subject all the rigor that goes into that and avoids them being proprietarily captive proprietary 
platform that then proceeds extract super normal rents out them for the use 
what found collaboration amongst both banks and central infrastructure providers where there 
lot incentive share work and essentially positioning ourselves able deliver similar product 
foundational product and then build top that the things that each individual customer needs 
customise the tools their particular marketplace again just reiterate software vendor are not 
seeking put dtcc out business replace otherwise become infrastructure provider ourselves 
sell software solutions people that that which itself very very scalable business model and 
doesn require capitalised doesn require actually this stage anywhere the world 
regulated although principle wouldn object that but don take care anyone asset don 
act principal can don look after your keys tokens there nothing yours that can 
lose don receive customer data from clients makes sense that purely software provider 
don aren regulated almost every single one our customers are very involved the process 
helping them with the regulatory dialogue 
huw van steenis conscious time got two questions one really about making this happen 
the extent not commercially confidential when will all get to were trading australia when 
would get see this action and what are the milestones should watch for 
blythe masters well the first milestone will decision sometime this summer technically this winter 
sometime between june and august australia where asx conjunction with its board regulator and 
customers will making decision proceed with the replacement chess using this technology not 
the case may the process that evaluative phase and the point which they make that decision 
will not the point which you see the technology being rolled out for commercial deployment because 
again you recognise this gigantic piece infrastructure with millions transactions flowing through and 
multiple parties involved this will multi year project replace chess won multi month project 
but this serious project with real resources and commitment behind 
have whole floor asx building where work jointly with the corresponding team asx shared 
space they the process syndicating what they with their regulators their clients the 
government there because one the other interesting features the australian market is the mandate that 
they enjoy for settlement and clearing for review periodically and one the rationales for investing 
this technology that achieves the benefit competition eradicating cost without fragmenting the 
settlement and clearing infrastructure which the other way theory impose competition the australian 
market but given the economies scale that business that pretty heated argument 
huw van steenis penultimate question obviously been seeing many bank insurance exchange ceos 
here yesterday today and tomorrow what advice would you give the ceo major financial institution get 
ahead the curve changing the operating model getting the cost down and taking advantage your 
technology 
global financials fintech april 
blythe masters usually when you talk anyone the suite firm like that they have pretty acutely 
defined sense what their top strategic priorities are and nowadays what mentioned earlier about concern 
about the operating environment compressed revenues rising cost whether directly pressure from their 
customers reduce cost and they capitalised entity rising capital requirements they not 
rising capital requirements the part their clients all amounts the same thing 
this roe thing that talked about plus concern about cybersecurity which sort existential threat that 
everybody very focused but one comfortable about then you lucky and you got long enough 
you might get few other agenda items like growth new markets customer experience nobody has really 
got the time focus that much they perhaps should but that what you hear which what you 
hear when you speak then that the way which introduce this that the point which introduce this 
technology concept 
not simple here buy this solution now and you solved your problem the next calendar year 
just that dialogue which says well the trajectories here are either radical surgery yourself including the 
possibility considering exit certain lines business fundamentally new approach the 
manufacturing process your business you amazed how many people don want surgery 
themselves exit businesses that they been into and that how these conversations and that how you 
end with receptive audience and there understanding that investing now order achieve benefits 
the long run kind the nature the beast and that the need great enough justify doing that 
huw van steenis few words digital asset five ten years time what should expecting what 
defines success for you 
blythe masters well will have operating products the real world deployed major financial services 
banks and infrastructure providers multiple continents and bigger than are now and how 
financed who owns whether public not cross those bridges when come them 
goal build client centric company that understands the needs its customers deliver high quality 
solutions those needs opposed peddling product that interesting but otherwise not necessarily 
meeting need and the process build very profitable company because will very handsomely paid 
meet those two first criteria which client centric understand the needs our customers and 
deliver solutions that solve them that how you build profitable company that the strategy 
huw van steenis blythe has been huge honour host you here the conference and think you can 
improve the roes all the banks and insurers seeing the next few days all immensely 
grateful you thank you very much indeed for coming and flying 
blythe masters thank you very much
