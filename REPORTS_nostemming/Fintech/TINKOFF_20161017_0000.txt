valuation methodology and risks 
tcsq 
valuation methodology for our tcs group holding value tcs using 
three stage residual income model deriving the bank value the sum the current 
equity and the present value its residual income that the return the bank 
achieves over its cost equity use this approach where banks are undergoing 
high level growth that has yet normalize the first stage forecast residual 
income calculated over our explicit forecast period the second 
transition assume constant growth rate net profit from 
and payout the third terminal fade the return over year horizon 
equal the cost equity our forecast period cost equity initial and 
transition phase and the terminal period flex these assumptions our 
bear and bull scenarios and apply the following weightings each scenario base 
bear bull 
key risks our price target 
downside macro risks further impacting growth cost risk and funding view 
these risks earnings rather than capital issues 
upside escalation driving cost equity down quicker consumer rebound 
resulting shallower cycle 
overweight rating price target implied upside 
though not factor optimistic earnings trajectory recent management 
aspirations are more constructive than consensus each the next three years 
believe the street will continue move our way better growth lower funding 
costs more contained provisioning and new business lines continue drive earnings 
upgrades roes should stabilize far cry from when the peak the 
consumer cycle hit and given the extent excess return this implies over russian 
bank cost equity think valuation tbv and eps too low
