what you need know about robo advice aum growth yoy suggests 
that robo advice here stay and likely gain more relevance for the future 
wealth management cyborg combination human and technology 
remains the most successful model with most robos offering call center and live 
chat support while robo gaining traction for the mass affluent part the 
market more human touch remains vital for the premium side the 
equation uhnwi hnwi with top tier private banks seeing disruption 
their market share healthy nnm trends aum growth trends the with 
vanguard leading the way and the recent acquisition scalable capital 
blackrock still point towards incumbents being better placed win yet new 
start ups keep popping especially continental europe 
start ups grow fast yet customer acquisition cost the key hurdle while startups aum growing fast most start ups independent robo advisors are below 
scale and nutmeg and moneyfarm financials suggest that customer acquisition 
remains the weak link understand however that reaching aum 
critical mass for start europe break even and some are getting closer 
that 
stick our estimate for aum years for robo advisors including 
incumbents given the recent pace growth cagr since the 
our aum estimate implied cagr seems conservative 
however also saw extremely benign trends for traditional private banks 
the synchronous global macro growth and the continued bull market 
encouraged investors take more risk looking forward market correction 
could test the model robo advisors highlighting weakness especially for 
those with the least robust onboarding risk profiling place hence believe 
cagr implied our estimate may more realistic pace growth 
what next api open banking the fully integrated model looking ahead 
think the future robo advice lies with deep interconnection with retail 
banking facilitated aggregators open banking could the key piece 
regulation that facilitates this current aggregators have tried are still 
rudimentary offering basic analysis transaction patterns with little advice 
broader holistic view individual finances aggregators become 
more popular expect robo advice evolve and become part broader 
customer relationship recommending the best investment allocation taking into 
account pension insurance spending trends employment and family situation 
which stocks appear best positioned today while still early days structurally 
the incumbents think could compete aggressively and successfully this

executive summary 
one year after our deep dive into the robo advisory market see note here robo advice 
fintechs enabling incumbent win take look how the market has evolved and 
where heading alongside potential stock implications focus the europe 
australia japan south korea and hong kong 
exhibit global financials industry robo advice mentions 
across companies transcripts over time 
our thesis 
incumbents over start ups had argued that robo advice 
would become more relevant for mass market financial advice 
going forward with incumbents better positioned win market 
share given the broader captive audience and hence the lower 
acquisition costs this view has been supported vanguard 
hitting aum betterment and wealthfront 
the players like abn amro launching their digital wealth 
proposition and bnp acquiring majority stake gambit 
european provider digital investment advisory solutions 
blackrock acquisition scalable capital also goes this 
source alpha sense morgan stanley research 
direction 
mass market game hnw uhnw segment not impacted still think unlikely 
that robo advisors would prove disruptive for the higher end the market given the 
more tailored needs sophisticated investors point ubs credit suisse and julius 
baer recording strong business growth and talking about robo only way lower 
costs see for example credit suisse broaden the client base for example ubs with 
sigfig and ubs smartwealth 
where from here and which might the winners europe mifid driven 
transparency fees could provide further boost cheaper solutions however most 
importantly regulation that took effect january open banking could 
game changer having full knowledge client finances along with harnessing 
data around transaction patterns means banks should able offer more tailored 
solutions clients when comes investments given the new regulation has only 
recently come into play still very early days draw line between winners and 
losers but will watching this space and look rank aggregators apps especially 
technology evolves this could potentially benefit players like ing which recently 
launched yolt and hargreaves lansdown see increased chances for banks 
disrupted they cannot adapt quickly providing compelling aggregator app

the value proposition robo advisors offer simplified type advice limited predefined amount money that doesn take into account more holistic view 
client finances for example family employment situation pension savings insurance 
etc robo advisors typically invest etfs and very liquid instruments their interface 
with clients much more cost effective digital call center chats the onboarding 
process much faster than for traditional advisors and fees are usually half those 
traditional financial advisor for more detailed discussion what robo advice and 
our outlook the sector please see our note here robo advice fintech enabling 
incumbents win 
cyborg the winning model the most effective platforms have offered 
human computer interface the most successful robo platforms have been able 
leverage low touch human component offering option for chats call centers 
facetime calls with human advisors help customers complete applications and answer 
questions scalable capital for example has recently introduced access full advice 
service after first free consultation over the phone 
mass market the target market their current format robo advisors aim assess 
client goal with respect the specific amount assets invested the platform 
regardless his her overall financial situation therefore see the most simplified 
versions robo advice limited high net worth and ultra high net worth clients are 
still likely need human advisor given their sophisticated needs and appetite for 
illiquid investments use leverage 
start ups incumbents 
overall view robo advice enabler rather than disruptor the economics 
start ups remain challenged high acquisition costs the blackrock acquisition 
scalable capital partly highlights this with blackrock managing director emea retail 
michael gruener saying believe that the robo advice space ultimately going 
business the vision for technology enabling existing intermediary that 
what the winning business model yet the flourishing new start ups and the 
increase funding rounds suggests strong demand for better customer service when 
comes mass market wealth management

marketing costs are the key issue for start ups reaching critical 
mass quickly key financial statements disclosed moneyfarm 
and nutmeg the provide useful insights into the economics 
robo advisor 
marketing costs moneyfarm marketing costs make 
the total cost basis had argued our roboadvice fintechs enabling incumbent win note cost acquisition 
can material for start ups this sphere estimated 
the and around the costs could lowered 
engaging partnerships for example moneyfarm partnering with uber revolut 
and allianz 
what aum level would the stand alone robo advice model make sense although 
still loss making with loss for the year nutmeg grew revenues 
while costs grew only although this means that costs grew 
while revenues increased only the slower path cost growth revenues 
our view encouraging estimating what critical mass for robo advisor difficult 
looking the financials companies that are young yet thought interesting 
that moneyfarm ceo commented that aum could close the break even 
point that stage fees over aum cover all the operational costs this the 
case then the economics robo advisors can quite appealing least the 
understand that the fees are much lower hence would expect 
critical mass much higher 
the incumbents perspective reducing costs expanding the customers base 
most banks cover now have robo advice offering reducing costs and expanding key 
drivers the customer base 
reducing costs one key advantage for incumbents lower cost service for 
example credit suisse aims free time that its financial advisors spend with 
clients via automation more repetitive tasks for example client boarding 
maintenance communication etc robo advice tools can also handy for businesses 
traditionally focused the higher end the hnwi uhnwi spectrum that still have 
long tail smaller customers service see for example ubs the overall 
estimate that there cost savings potential for incumbents that apply roboadvice technology see our estimates here 
expanding the customer base another key reason for launching robo advice offering 
has been address younger generations provide customer experience more line 
with what clients experience when they use services like amazon for example for 
example this what ubs plans with their core affluent offering

europe what next open banking potential key catalysts 
open banking the new catalysts believe the evolution robo advice and 
thus the next leg growth could come from leveraging aggregated data customers 
transactions this was already possible the past although required customers 
sharing their username and passwords log bank account credit card websites 
with aggregators for example mint the the game changer here that open 
banking the europe allows customers receive the same service but 
without sharing their passwords requires banks release customer account data 
any party that authorised the relevant regulatory authority and has 
permission from the account holder this data expected released via apis 
application programming interfaces created the banks and which parties can 
connect this should theory reduce cyber security risk and unauthorized use 
personal data for more detail see our notes here data privacy gdpr 
the evolution retail banking and holding the networks account 
potential win win for customers open banking means will easier for the customer 
see all their transactions one place and analyse spending patterns providing the 
customer agrees the aggregator tpp can propose new products that could 
mutually beneficial for the customer and the tpp some examples below 
aggregating spending patterns the tpp gets broader picture credit quality 
spending habits changes trends this can potentially improve the interest rate client 
might offered overdrafts mortgages etc 
the sheer amount data available the aggregator could lead more tailored 
investment recommendations while currently most robos focus providing fairly 
simple and standardised asset allocation tool for pre defined pot money 
couple years envisage situation where most robo advisors will part 
broader path which recommends the best investment allocation taking into spending 
patterns account pension insurance spending trends employment and family situation 
early days but something watch open banking was introduced the 
january hence are still very early stage and although the technology 
safer than handing over username and password would expect fair amount 
skepticism from the public the aggregators have tried far for example yolt are 
still quite rudimentary yet will watch this space closely offers potential for 
those players that get the aggregator offering right significantly broaden their 
customer basis cross sell products that today are sylo for example mortgages 
wealth management thanks comprehensive holistic view customer finances 
example the lloyds has been the first large bank outline its vision for 
open banking unveiling new year digital strategic programme open banking and 
its implications are very much the heart banks strategic planning over the medium 
term with the european commission now putting the regulatory technical standards 
place banks have month lead time before codified into national law 
across the getting ahead the game now will important especially for the 
incumbents which one hand benefit from the vast scale client ownership but 
the other need invest infrastructure upgrade often cumbersome systems one 
such example lloyds which has alongside the recent results unveiled 
digital transformation programme with the aim harnessing open banking alongside 
its balance sheet scale drive profitability via greater efficiency 
exhibit open banking there are main milestones think about with the end game the 
implementation into national law into this point expect see greater roll 
out aggregation and mobile innovation products 
source lloyds banking group strategic update presentation morgan stanley research 
extracting efficiency and freeing capacity the core the programme which 
being rolled out across all segments the bank including insurance wealth lloyds 
believes that can create one third employee capacity via the use 
automated voice and chatbots which ultimately enables time spent more 
complex customer needs for the insurance and wealth division particular seeking 
leverage its one customer view approach offer retail clients range financial 
planning and insurance products and alongside other initiatives they believe that they 
can deliver double digit growth this area 
exhibit technology innovation across range bank processes the heart lloyds new

still the most advanced market for robo advisory but incumbents are catching 
robo advisors such betterment wealthfront and personal capital were innovators 
the asset management space but noted last year incumbents such 
vanguard and charles schwab moved quickly build their own internal solutions 
compete with new entrants why robo platforms enable delivery mass 
customization essentially separately managed account that historically was only 
available high net worth clients thereby expanding the universe consumers that 
can served the industry while there are certainly risks robo advisory has the 
potential disintermediate active managers cannibalize existing business and provide 
new distribution channel for etfs also necessary response incumbents 
maintain market share 
vanguard charles schwab and ameritrade have amassed excess roboadvisory aum today the top robo advisors latter which account for 
the vast majority independent robo advisors aum vanguard particular saw 
growth robo advisory aum accelerate while 
disclosures most incumbents are light particularly the banks wirehouses 
would not surprised learn that robo advisory aum among most incumbents 
accelerated especially light the robo advisory launches the banks 
brokers initially led the charge among incumbents but banks are catching with 
combination internal builds and acquisitions banks appeared accelerate 
launches robo offerings who opted partner with the stand alone robo 
advisors wells fargo launched its intuitive investor platform partnership with 
sigfig and bancorp partnered with blackrock futureadvisor goldman sachs 
looking build its own robo advisor according press reports the company also 
launched smart beta portfolio available for betterment clients 
who chose build house bank america launched merrill edge guided investing 
early while jpm launched pilot jpmorgan digital investing with full roll out 
expected the near future ally financial acquired tradeking which has 
primarily been self directed brokerage but the process scaling the rebranded 
managed robo offering ally invest advisors would also note that capital one 
previously launched its advisor connect platform 
growth pure play robo advisors maturing space potentially getting crowded 
the independent robo advisors are still growing robust pace however 
estimate that aum growth for these players has slowed from 
part this inevitable the largest robo advisory players are longer growing 
off very small base slowing growth likely speaks crowded robo advisory 
market per business insider there are now more than robo advisors the and 
efforts incumbents capture more the robo advisory market the same time 
the larger robo advisors are growing and have likely focused attention towards 
driving profitability instead growth for growth sake yes incumbents are likely 
see lower margins robo advisory business traditional offerings but are less likely 
face the same profitability issues startups given large more efficient customer 
acquisition channels already place the offering also helps incumbents tap into 
customer base they wouldn have traditionally served for example young millennials 
with lower investible assets order build long term profitable relationships robo 
advisors look drive profitability potentially raising prices this could also steer 
more business towards the incumbents number these players could also struggle 
survive further benefitting incumbents 
leveraging aggregate customer data the end goal but less clear cut regulatory 
catalyst the unlike europe where regulators have pushed for open banking 
sharing data with third party aggregators the approach thus far the has been 
very much hoc banking regulators have not announced any wide ranging data 
sharing intuitive such europe instead regulators have chosen focus 
efforts same day payments cybersecurity etc that said certain banks are 
choosing which aggregators they want work with enable seamless apis and sharing 
customer data case point jpm announced jan api sharing initiative with 
intuit owner mint cof followed with similar agreement with intuit nov 
and wfc partnered with xero aggregator for small businesses june the 
endgame for banks would access customer entire financial picture enabling

ageing population mandated doubling the australian super system source 
deloitte super model rising complexity tax pension status estate planning and 
numerous other investment needs outside super education house etc are structurally 
positive for the outlook for advice 
incumbents leading the way advice much more complicated than risk profile and 
low cost balanced index fund option such aspiring start ups have struggled gain 
meaningful traction and most likely seek partnership opportunities with incumbents

still the early stages change needed for proliferation 
where robo advisory services stand korea 
robo advisor business initiatives are being pro actively pushed financial companies 
but there still lot more before the market enters into major growth cycle 
total aum currently robo advisory products estimated around 
end january and the robo advisory business still the early stages better 
understanding robo advisor services improving customer perception and 
various rule changes should needed for robo advisor services show rapid growth 
our view 
development algorithms are being carried out actively financial institutions 
and also non financial robo advisory specific start companies robo advisor 
algorithm development has become more the domain for robo advisory 
developers and expect this trend continue 
rounds testbed evaluation process has been carried out through koscom and 
the launched the performance algorithms have improved 
the round round and continued improvements are being pushed forth 
developers 
what needed for robo advisory services proliferate 
changing customer attitudes toward financial products more longer term 
investment horizon and focus stable returns 
services are still recognized something for affluent customers and mass affluent 
customers are not active using bank products services compared 
customers hence robo advisory services are being targeted for the mass affluent but 
public understanding robo advisory services still quite low although has improved 
other investment products are preferred over robo advisors more sophisticated 
investors are trying out robo advisory services but aum still quite small investors 
require more confidence think there would need overall shift customer 
attitudes more realistic returns with focus stable returns based long term 
investment horizon 
the movement money passive funds over active funds continues trend

banks the lead robo advisory time needed for revenue 
generation 
why banks should come out ahead the robo advisory business korea 
korean banks are focusing more fintech initiatives with robo advisory services one 
the many initiatives the banks are working actively banks are ahead the curve 
robo advisory services rather than brokerage companies unlike the the case 
the has been the brokers and also investment banks that have been pro active 
but for korea bank holding companies are the lead this due banks still 
controlling the majority customer financial holdings more and development 
resources possessed bhcs and also robo advisory targeting more mass affluent 
customers which are better managed the banks 
while the banks expect the robo advisory business show growth the long term 
there need number regulatory adjustments changes customer attitude 
towards financial products and good performance track record for robo advisory 
products well convenient online mobile access these services believe 
considerable time would needed for the robo advisory business become revenue 
generating business but there should inflection point when growth suddenly 
spikes that point seems around years away and banks are better positioned than 
other competitors this service 
banks have been the most pro active the space with shinhan bank launching its 
robo advisory service october folio but the service limited 
capabilities being used recommend portfolio allocation and fund products with 
the folio product scope 
brokers are becoming more active now with kium securities having been the early 
adoption within the industry however similar the banks the servicing capacity 
limited portfolio allocation and recommendation fund products 
should there differentiation between the banks 
the first mover sfg seems ahead the pack and should remain but 
competitors including hfg and kfg are quickly making room there should 
differentiation between the bank holding companies bhc and banks that possess 
strong asset gathering and asset management capabilities which means kfg and sfg 
have relative advantage over competitors but the situation could change through 
and even partnerships 
mobile banking capabilities could also one the factors determine which 
banks should come out ahead likely that robo advisory services will become 
mobile based business going forward refer our note for our evaluation

japanese financial institutions have started moving into robo advisor services 
large financial institutions including banks and brokers started moving into roboadvisor services japan japanese financial institutions have only just begun 
delving into fintech whole and not think robo advisor services have yet

reach wider range customer groups new services are rolled out via 
collaboration with start companies and major companies sparking acceleration 
aum growth over the last one year have seen slightly more efforts roboadvisor companies grow their aum and more disclosures aum for instance

open api japanese banks stepping investments fintech given the consecutive 
revisions the banking law and 
expect that japanese banks will step investments fintech companies move 
into new types settlement businesses using big data particular note the 
banking law revisions that require banks pursue efforts enable open api 
functions japan and apxj collaboration banks mobile banking diffusion jan 
japan already seeing its major banks including the megabanks some regional banks 
and internet banks progress making apis available and collaborating with fintech 
companies this stage too early tell which banks are making the greatest 
progress opening apis but before the revised banking law comes into effect 
view april the earliest timing expect see some indications follows 
which areas the banks are looking what kind features they are planning and 
how they will approach marketing the type apis they make available how they 
engage with influential fintech companies and whether they can leverage external 
resources strategically will key avoiding the risk that open apis could turn the 
banks into nothing more than providers basic functions 
commission based model one way potentially monetizing open apis but the 
near term think that transaction growth supported apis likely have greater 
impact than the increase the number new types fees and commissions
