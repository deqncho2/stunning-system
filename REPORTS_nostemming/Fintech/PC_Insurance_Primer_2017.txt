paid loss development factors can help 
note that when grew from grew factor 
also note that month development factors are materially different than the factors 
all other columns and are somewhat consistent the coefficient variation 
thus can select some average development factor for each age development 
can use these selections predict future paid losses and complete the paid loss triangle
