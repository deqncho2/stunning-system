consortium investors symphony communication 
services holdings llc 
have further conviction our financial terminals industry disruption thesis 
following symphony innovate conference new york symphony secure 
communications provider funded consortium buy side and sell side 
financial institutions venture capital and technology firms expect symphony 
could the gateway for financial market participants move away from 
premium bundled workstations lower cost products addressing specific 
business needs which could lead deflation and potential for disruption 
unbundling but integrating poses long term questions for the industry the 
trend towards integrating disparate providers products within applications 
symphony thomson reuters has seemingly begun gain traction this point 
customers still need subscription the underlying vendor products use the 
functionality unclear what future subscriptions will look like more data 
feeds but fewer terminals how many seats would lost the industry 
from those that not utilize the more complex functionality existing 
premium products 
key takeaways from the symphony innovate conference 
symphony update symphony has users across 
firms including the buy side since the launch external 
capabilities within the last few weeks users are interacting across 
firms the platform several large customers the conference alluded 
broader roll out the product their firms the coming months 
which symphony expects result significant increase the number 
users 
customer feedback 
one global asset manager with over aum has rolled out symphony 
selected areas and will soon move external communications the head 
technology for the firm specifically stated that symphony could displace some 
his firm bloomberg terminals given that upon analysis many users are using 
bloomberg for just messaging 
morgan stanley does and seeks business with 
companies covered morgan stanley research 
result investors should aware that the firm may have 
conflict interest that could affect the objectivity 
morgan stanley research investors should consider 
morgan stanley research only single factor making 
their investment decision

report 
cto another large buy side institution aum shared that 
symphony currently beta but expects roll out all employee 
desktops before year end currently employees are using largely for group 
chat 
one the world largest asset managers aum has witnessed tripling 
internal chat message volumes since introducting symphony across the 
company from per week messages 
new products ceo david gurle commented that the product has grown 
from messaging tool into full fledged desktop workflow product 
illustrated two new products announced the conference symphony 
meetings secure video conferencing and symphony platform 
applications from and integrations with initial partners including spgi 
fds info and money net 
factset factset has built bots within symphony chat conversations that 
query the company databases for answers questions for instance 
factset subscribers typing into their symphony chat window net debt 
ibm generates chart showing the history the company net debt over 
the last number years see exhibit section 
info representatives from info demonstrated symphony markitserv 
integration where the symphony chat window used multi party 
conversation between buy side client with dealer counterparty where 
the parties could affirm dispute and resolve trades this links back 
markitserv trade manager and parties can see transcripts the 
conversation 
others terminal startup money net users will able access 
symphony within its application ultimately providing the advantage 
single sign contextual content recommendation startup selerity has 
become the first partner generate revenue symphony platform 
implications outlined framework for the potential downside the 
terminals industry our april notes would you give your terminal and 
for chat feedback our terminals note the existence credible 
alternative bloomberg chat regulatory compliant used across 
counterparties creates scenario for deflation terminal pricing and 
trade downs cheaper products deflationary changes would negatively impact 
the large terminal providers tri fds spgi while less clear which providers 
would benefit from trade downs and for how long pricing would have low 
enough for providers make change customer would likely not switch 
the premium priced version competitive product the near term given the 
desire for vendor consolidation the terminal providers our coverage could 
benefit from trade downs from bloomberg but ultimately could end worse 
off customers continue squeezed cost pressures unbundling 
products occurs
