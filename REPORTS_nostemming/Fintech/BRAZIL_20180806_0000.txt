unfortunately merchant acquiring companies public and private not 
disclose enough information prices volumes and other operating figures 
regular basis the only available information comes from the central bank 
statistical compendium the payments and processing industry published once 
year this report normally comes out late july early august with numbers 
for the previous year the central bank published the version this past 
friday today report take close look the data and provide some 
key takeaways 
caveat the central bank numbers are relatively stale when they come out and 
also not entirely comparable our channel checks suggest that the acquirers 
themselves not fully rely these data for comparisons given their low 
transparency and reliability top that the figures for pagseguro and other 
new merchant acquirers are not included the central bank report 
regrettably not mandatory for companies contribute their data the 
annual compendium 
that said below please find the key highlights observed full details inside

credit card mdr 
overall credit card mdr prices have fallen modestly over the last years despite 
the increased competition and still find hard say that competition 
behind the modest decline prices the mix transactions also impacts the 
mdr installments non installments local international transactions 
small versus large merchants etc 
the decline prices cielo has been just tad higher than for the overall 
industry and its peers over the last years cielo credit card mdr fell from 
just slightly more than the figure for the overall 
system and average mdr for full year was just below the average for 
note acceleration price compression versus the previous 
years which could the result increased competition less profitable mix 
given the recession transactions with less installments normally lower mdr 
also note that cielo mdr looks more competitive than for the peers with 
mdr lower than for industry rede getnet

necessarily apples apples comparisons the mix merchants and products

its share merchants said before the alignment market share 
banking business the owners cielo and the latter market share acquiring 
makes its business more defensible this not the case rede and itau hence 
here where most the new entrants have picked share from 
terms pos terminals cielo has lost market share but has also performed 
much better than rede cielo pos base was down million from 
its peak million over the same period rede lost its pos base 
interestingly when looking the drop active merchants versus the drop pos 
terminals evident that rede lost pos result client attrition whereas 
cielo this does not seem the case rede active merchants fell over the 
last three years roughly line with the drop pos terminals the same 
figures for cielo are drop active merchants versus drop pos 
cielo the decline pos had probably more with the elimination with the elo

slow economic growth over the last years has hurt the proliferation credit 
cards brazil total credit cards were million down from the peak 
roughly three years ago the number active credit cards has performed better 
basically flat over the last three years 
the penetration issued cards looks fair the total population that said 
the penetration active cards looks low only this suggests the banks 
have done good job plastifying the consumer base but need provide 
stronger incentives for people use their cards also the still very high 
unemployment rate brazil probably behind the low usage the outstanding 
card base because cards are already the hands consumers the good news 
that card volumes can rise quickly once macro conditions improve
