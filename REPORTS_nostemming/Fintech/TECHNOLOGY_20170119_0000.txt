outlook spotting value 
from post crisis peaks 
capgemini our top pick for while also like nets and 
paysafe the payments space see fewer anomalies 
software but highlight amadeus long term core holding 
and the product cycle sap opportunity 
remain more cautious sage atos and indra 
identifying opportunities our top pick for capgemini weak 
revenues and revenue outlook hit the shares expectations had been for meet 
beat raise think the caution now overdone and that expectations have 
fallen the most our coverage universe see attractive valuation peers 
fcff yield sector think cap can rebuild from lower 
expectations also like the payments universe think this was 
also excessively impacted from the late sector rotation see the clearest 
opportunity this area nets our top pick payments for also like 
paysafe but acknowledge this higher risk profile software see fewer 
clear discrepancies investor expectations are already higher our top pick 
would amadeus given the large available market and visible business model 
after this like sap given the potential strong product cycle around hana 
cio poll data calls for slightly weaker growth but risks the upside 
our latest cio poll calls for budget growth after 
the slowdown was mainly europe but with risks 
the upside with many more cios expecting revise budgets upwards during 
the year and fewer expecting cut than previous surveys sub sector 
software again remains the highest growth sub sector 
with services seeing bigger slowdown stick 
with capgemini despite this slowdown the most global our european 
services names and see the biggest mis match expectations 
how does reflation really impact the sector significant debate the end 
was the effect the reflation trade sector rotation believe the 
software services payments sector was broadly treated bond proxy and 
suffered consequence with payments further impacted financials 
investors switched from payments into banks believe the truth more 
nuanced while expect high growth long duration stocks impacted 
reflation also see companies that should benefit and even some anomalous 
valuations think capgemini and sap could benefit temenos and aveva look 
more exposed also see very attractive valuations for paysafe and sophos 
introducing broader esg framework for the sector had incorporated esg 
data for small number our companies previously but now extend this all 
companies with market cap above

addition being seen more bond proxies also believed these companies 
suffered more than average financials investors moved their sector weighting from 
fintech investments which usually means payments companies back banks our 
conversations with investors suggest financials funds had significant overweight 
payments and this would help explain the more significant share price reactions

with most sectors demand driven growth and inflation should positive for 
revenue growth across the whole our coverage but varying degrees would 
generally see services companies more cyclically exposed and software 
payments only partially cyclical licences and new subscriptions but benefitting from 
largely inflation hedged revenues maintenance revenues generally have inflation links 
this would suggest fears around continued low growth but higher inflation should 
more positive for the software payments space whilst expectations for significant pickup gdp growth should see services names relatively outperform 
however this cursory analysis fails address the relative sensitivity the companies 
our coverage order get sense this would split the issue into three parts 
discount rates think key consideration how sensitive the valuation each 
company reflation driven rise discount rates this will largely depend the 
relationship between the expected future path each companies cash flows and its 
current valuation with high growth highly rated companies likely the most 
sensitive evaluate this estimate cash flows out over the next years and then 
back out the terminal growth rate implied the current market valuation clearly how 
reasonable the implied terminal growth looks also good check whether our cash 
flow assumptions are line with what the market currently expecting from this 
long term dcf can estimate equivalent measure duration for bonds 
calculating the weighted average life cash flows required justify the current share 
price companies with longer weighted average life cash flows duration should 
the most sensitive rise discount rates and vice versa 
this analysis suggests aveva years weighted average life temenos years 
hexagon years amadeus years and sage years should particularly 
sensitive rising real discount rates whilst paysafe payback within forecast period 
software years and sophos years should the least sensitive according 
this analysis alone 
related this how inflation linked our companies revenues are those that track 
very closely are likely less sensitive inflationary driven discount rate increases 
rather than rising real interest rates revenues across software services and 
payments are all directly linked inflation some degree however worldpay nets

key esg issues 
environment investing and operating responsibly gathered data from our esg 
software coverage range metrics including tangible capital expenditure carbon 
emissions energy intensity paper usage and water consumption ascertain how 
deeply our companies focus pro environmental investment trends these metrics 
and their overall willingness disclose environmental data 
human capital plays key role for software companies personnel costs represent 
the majority operating costs and intense competition for key personnel particular 
top level salespeople and software engineers makes human capital even more 
important 
for software companies need for highly skilled developers and continuous innovation 
means employees are one the primary value drivers however can also increase 
costs due intense competition for the most talented employees therefore attracting 
and retaining key staff reasonable cost crucial for the continued success our 
software names 
for services companies such capgemini and atos there need balance 
retention skilled staff with keeping personnel costs low and efficiently staffing 
projects this has led double digit and rising staff attrition rates 
key issue technology has been the increasing female participation both broaden 
the talent pool companies can draw from and increase diversity female representation 
remains relatively low our coverage and has only improved marginally 
percentage points whilst this line with technology sector averages 
remains stubbornly below other sectors the wider economy and europe and central 
asia whole which has female labour force participation rate world bank 
data 
however board level female representation has risen significantly across our esg 
software spectrum female representation the board level rose over between 
and driven partly french legislation requiring french companies 
dassault atos capgemini have female directorship further quotas

should amadeus adopt poor environmental practices the future may exposed legal 
reputational and regulatory risks which turn could lead diversion management time and 
liabilities arising the future 
amadeus was recognised for its environmental efforts being entered into the dow jones sustainability index 
with score which was the highest score the sector remains the index scoring for 
environmental policy 
should new legislation enacted make air travel more expensive curb more completely 
amadeus top line and pricing power could adversely impacted 
percentage employees that are women averages which puts amadeus only behind sage the gender diversity 
rankings our esg covered companies

retention rates could impact the ability the company retain key clients hinder the development 
new software which could negatively impact the top line
