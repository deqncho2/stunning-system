our thesis for being underweight hinged our expectation that 
net interest income would fall more than consensus expects due 
declining rub volatility which would precipitate fall 
client balances held moex given these are typically used 
collateral and margin for clearing settlement these 
balances that moex earns nii and particular those held rub 
and the yield that can attained the portfolio balances 
plus moexs own funds would decline chiefly due rub rate 
cuts but also lower for longer rates 
source bloomberg morgan stanley research 
looking forward arguably the fundamentals have changed 
firstly international investor participation russian financial markets could increase 
following the change administration and secondly the debate around ecb 
tapering and market expectations for faster rate increases places upwards pressure 
our yield nii expectations put together whilst continue believe that rub usd 
volatility will moderate further and reduce client balances expect this 
outweighed the above yield impacts 
such increase our earnings net interest income driven for and 
with our estimates now only modestly below consensus and limited downside 
our price target upgrade equal weight our base case apply multiple

one the main drivers our equity flow improvement our expectation that 
management will remove the initial charge the gem equity strategy 
where performance strong ahead benchmark across year 
metrics this charge was introduced february bid protect performance 
given capacity constraints although management recently indicated there are plans 
remove the charge with aum the gem category having fallen 
from peak sep think capacity concerns are abating assuming this charge not 
removed and equity flows remain lacklustre nnm would lower our

well lower valuation multiple where now apply multiple our base case 
previously discount the sector given growth challenges concentration 
equities and less cost flexibility peers absent more significant operating decisions 
amundi marking market

model given captive distribution and already low revenue margins equally regulatory 
risks appear lower than for example listed peers from the fca sector review and 
brexit 
ashmore equal weight robust relative position though changing policy 
unknown 
since listing ashmore share price has correlation with the major emerging 
market bond index our fixed income colleagues argue that fixed income will remain 
highly sensitive the change core usd rates and that historically the direction 
real yields particular importance determining the extent which fixed 
income absorbs higher nominal yields real yields are flat fall performs better 
than real yields rise conjunction with nominal yields 
addition the new administration could more protectionist which could have 
negative implications for exporters and their macro outlook whilst concede this 
may prove more conducive environment generate alpha with greater country 
differentiation the impact this could have institutional investor allocations 
remains unclear our forecasts which assume recovery flows growth 
such given the limited confidence have this trajectory remain equal weight 
lower earnings mark market for recent results where aum 
came lower than forecast and reduce our absolute growth forecasts though 
similar net new money terms mainly due lower net flow expectations and
