leading fintech players 
banking brazil not competitive and efficient most places around 
the world hence the opportunity and the pool profits for grabs for the 
fintech disruptors outsized brazil highly concentrated banking market has 
resulted limited competition very high prices arguably the very top

technology and regulation are challenging the three key pillars that have 
contributed the banking oligopoly unprecedented pace through 
account scraping and better data mining fintech companies are effectively going 
around the lack credit bureau brazil and offering attractive risk based 
pricing consumers technology and mobile communications have effectively 
eliminated the barrier entry that bricks and mortar presence represented

incumbents need get digital right could lose significant market share 
generic products which are the bulk what banks offer today will have 
evolve into very specific client tailored and risk based priced banks also need 
graduate from their current clicks and bricks model some cases the 
incumbents must plan the destruction their current business model 
progress the next wave value creation the ongoing move toward open 
platform for asset management and insurance also traditional banks must use 
technology not only improve pricing and the interface with the consumer but 
also drive down costs another challenge for established banks and maybe 
the hardest all develop unique digital identity 
but the highly concentrated nature brazilian banking may mean that 
fintech disruption will more prices than market share are 
cognizant that absolute disruption highly concentrated industry 
challenging because incumbents have very deep pockets and can respond

from zero disruption seconds 
the fintech boom has arrived brazil and far the most advanced latin 
america think the number users ramping the number companies across 
different verticals skyrocketing and the investment rush under way via private 
equity and public offerings technology challenging the traditional banking model 
unprecedented pace the most forward thinking incumbent banks are tuning their 
business models compete with fintech players 
the goal this report provide overview the trends see developing and 
our vision the future brazil fintech discuss the key advantages and 
disadvantages fintech versus traditional banks how fintech companies are disrupting 
the pillars the banking oligopoly brazil the product verticals where see the 
biggest opportunities fintech and how the incumbent banks are responding the 
evolving competitive landscape addition this report includes snapshots fintech 
companies operating brazil today our selection not intended exhaustive 
there are literally hundreds start ups already our focus companies that are 
either much larger than their peers have more readily available information and 
where gotten more inquiry from institutional investors 
fintech disrupting the establishment brazil arguably more 
than other places around the world 
santander brasil control loans and deposits well dominant shares 
other products such asset management insurance brokerage and merchant 
acquiring this highly concentrated market structure has resulted banking system 
that has limited competition very high prices arguably the very top global 
banking and generic and non client centric products and services this favorable 
setup for the banks has meant that they been able sit back charge high and make 
attractive returns capital without necessarily having leaders efficiency 
innovation risk based pricing customer service all said think banking brazil 
not competitive and efficient most places around the world hence the 
opportunity and the pool profits for grabs for fintech disruptors outsized 
fintech companies are effectively challenging two key pillars that have protected and 
perpetuated the banking oligopoly brazil think the lack proper credit bureau 
and the vast physical banking distribution network including non shared atms 
addition the government effort reduce financial prices has recently eliminated 
the lock payrolls which our view represented the third key pillar the banking 
oligopoly brazil specifically 
pillar credit bureau the lack proper credit bureau and the efforts the large 
incumbent banks keep the status quo has impeded the transfer information the 
system information extremely important financial services companies 
effectively price for risk and their customers negotiate better prices products and 
services the large banks have had significant competitive advantage given the 
consumer and corporate data they have collected over the last many decades smaller 
banks and new entrants without access credit data have way properly price for 
risk this has resulted banking system that has limited competition given adverse 
selection elevated prices across the board and generic and non client centric products 
and services because consumers and companies can not use their credit data seek 
better prices most bank clients consolidate all most their business with one bank 
exhibit the super high consumer lending spreads brazil suggest 
that the pool profits for grabs for fintech disruptors outsized 
that said fintech now challenging the banks ownership 
customer data through account scraping this process allows 
fintech companies access bank accounts customer behalf 
weighted average consumer 
using the customer access credentials account number login 
lending spreads mortgages 
name password etc hence systematically sweeping out millions 
historical banking records from the incumbent banks 
addition using customers social security numbers fintech 
companies are scraping data that the government collects 
individuals tax returns employment history travel logs 
benefits court records etc taking advantage the open 
government initiative the most sophisticated fintech lenders are 
also using mobile phone geolocation generate some the 
richest consumer data available brazil where you work 
eat sleep and shop order tailor their offerings the 
specific customer needs and assess individual risk better all said 
note weighted average consumer lending spreads excluding mortgages source morgan stanley 
research 
the lack proper credit bureau longer hurdle assess 
the creditworthiness individuals and companies and 
compete and price accordingly the banking system 
technology indeed pushing consumer empowerment the traditional banking model 
brazil undergoing sea change technology shifting the balance power from 
the incumbent banks toward the end user consumer owning their data thanks 
technology will finally have the ability price compare and choose from large 
offering unbundled products that fintech companies are making available indeed the 
unbundling the existing one stop shop banking model brazil seems inevitable 
pillar physical presence over the last decades brazilian banks have built massive 
and far reaching distribution networks including branches mini branches agents and 
economica federal and santander brasil combined have almost thousand 
branches the thousand total brazil addition they all operate proprietary 
non shared atm networks that add the total the country these vast 
networks have historically represented significant barrier entry the marketplace 
per central bank data there are multiple banks brazil 
not state the obvious but technology and mobile communications have effectively 
eliminated the barrier entry that bricks and mortar presence represented branches 
are longer needed onboard clients gather assets originate loans and distribute 
advice the most effective brazilian fintech companies provide fully virtual experience 
for the clients with need ever visit physical location importantly without the 
overhead bricks and mortar retail network fintech companies operating costs are 
greatly reduced allowing them offer better pricing banking products 
the ongoing proliferation electronic payments has also reduced the value 
traditional bank branches and non shared atms access points for cash further the 
brazilian fintech association fintech recently partnered with saque pague 
atm network company offer cash withdrawal and deposit services its 
members saque pague currently has atms throughout the country and the 
network growing very rapidly

pillar lock payrolls the long standing lock ins payrolls allowed the banks 
buy thousands individual clients negotiating payroll agreement with their 
employers rather than offering attractive products and services that were appealing 
consumers this combination with the lack proper credit bureau brazil 
limited the consumer ability freely choose banking relationships 
well the lock ins are now gone mostly due the regulator desire see more 
competition and lower prices the banking system july new rules came 
effect that make payroll deposits fully transferable through simple frictionless 
process finally brazilian workers can freely choose which bank gets their payroll 
payment addition the regulator has allowed fintech companies receive payroll 
deposits even those that don hold full banking licenses 
eliminating the lock ins payrolls the new central bank rules have effectively 
altered the way banks acquire clients gaining clients will now based one one 
contact not corporate relationships this means that the benefits that corporates 
received from banks exchange for the payroll exclusivity will now have 
transferred individual clients the form better and more attractively priced 
products and allowing fintech companies participate payroll payments can 
potentially accelerate the unbundling process the banking system 
fintech adoption has the potential unbundle brazilian retail 
banking and move competition onto price and customer 
centricity 
price competition course will likely put pressure the abnormally high profits 
banks earn today and returns newly invested capital will fall compared with current 
roe negative for earnings growth and valuation thereafter however the cost 
financial products should decline and help increase the level bancarization brazil 
meaning higher lending volumes while this very positive for the long term banking 
story think there could difficult transition period for the incumbents 
envision unbundled and customer centric industry fintech proliferation 
effectively empowering customers get better prices products and services and 
banks need respond this generic products which are the bulk what banks offer 
today will have evolve into very specific client tailored and risk based priced 
offerings the basis competition the banking system will shift toward more 
customer centric industry opposed the prevailing product centric model 
empowered consumers will dictate how when and where they choose interact with 
financial provider this think will finally unbundle the prevailing one stop shop 
banking model mentioned before 
incumbents need get digital right could lose significant 
market share 
over the next five years expect that large part consumer and wholesale 
financial services brazil will mostly digital the investment implication that firms 
that don get digital right could lose significant market share today most incumbents 
are putting traditional bank products online bradesco next for example and not 
necessarily developing innovative products and services that better leverage technology 
drive customer traffic and loyalty more profound change needs happen 
among other changes the incumbents need improve their current clicks andbricks model where customer onboarding and product underwriting can done 
mostly online but still requires branch visit also fix the back end introduce risk based 
pricing leverage data better and improve overall customer experience remain important 
for the incumbents think especially risk based pricing should the top 
the agenda none the large banks effectively use this 
innovative thinking will take new importance technology allows fintech companies 
significantly accelerate the time market new products and services 
competition from these new entrants that are unburdened legacy systems total 
innovation reingennering becomes necessity for the incumbent players some cases 
the incumbents must plan the destruction their current business model progress 
saw the writing the wall effectively changed the way the asset management 
industry operates adopting open platform model with lower fees faced with 
migrate from closed open platform hence cannibalizing their long standing asset 
recoup some the lost value 
fintech companies have significant cost and convenience differential from traditional 
banking the best class have created better consumer interface and efficient end toend solution that shortens the clearing time and drives major inefficiencies out the 
system this means that the traditional banks must use technology not only improve 
pricing and the interface with the consumer but also drive down costs and increase 
throughput with total end end processing 
morgan stanley global banks team recently ran survey call arms better 
understand how incumbent banks are investing run the bank and prevent being 
disrupted the results for latam are not encouraging and suggest banks the region 
are behind global peers digitalization below some key observations 
latam banks are spending less that their global peers particularly large 
banks assets billion spending represents only revenues and 
costs compared with and respectively large banks globally 
latam banks allocate less spending change the bank initiatives than their 
global peers the large latam banks costs change the bank 
versus for peers elsewhere 
legacy systems represent key challenge latam similar what see for

another challenge for established banks and maybe the hardest all develop 
unique digital identity let explain this better with example credit cards digital 
does not fundamentally change the card lending business even before the rise 
fintech most established banks were already running their card businesses mostly 
online nonetheless less than five years nubank digital credit card lender and 
arguably one the most successful fintech companies brazil has gained million 
card holders and outpacing growth most the incumbent card issuers nubank 
strong digital identity has allowed the company become lifestyle brand brazil 
but the highly concentrated nature brazilian banking may 
mean that fintech disruption will more prices than 
market share 
are cognizant that absolute disruption highly concentrated industry 
challenging because incumbents have very deep pockets and can respond opting 
many the most successful parts the fintech offering outright acquiring them 
hence limiting the market share grab but what the incumbent banks can replicate 
fintech nimble cost base this means fintech firms can price much lower while 
keeping healthy margins order not lose market share incumbent banks will have 
accept lower prices and because consumers can now use their credit data 
negotiate better explained before more pressure banking prices likely all 
said suspect that the velocity which lending spreads and overall banking fees will 
fall brazil over the next couple years will surprise many market participants 
both and pagseguro are good examples how fintech companies are altering the 
pricing structure their respective industries while remaining relatively small terms 
market share mentioned before most incumbent banks have moved their asset 
management business into open platform model that first introduced today 
has around market share retail assets under management custody brazil the 
payments industry pagseguro having gained roughly market share rapidly 
changing mdr and pos prices throughout the entire industry and forcing cielo and 
rede the two large incumbents with share rethink their product offering

source morgan stanley research fintech gauntlet riches 
see advantages and disadvantages fintech versus 
traditional banks 
fintech companies should have significant advantage low operating costs and 
operational flexibility mostly from superior technology while incumbents can held 
back their legacy systems key disadvantages are higher funding costs dependency 
capital market access limited client base high client acquisition cost and unknown 
brand names the flip side the traditional banks enjoy advantages name 
recognition but not necessarily transferable digital identity huge customer base 
trust lower funding cost and demonstrated asset origination capacity disadvantages 
are higher operating costs branch centric thinking and legacy systems 
like specialized fintech companies that are very good one 
few products over those that are trying financial 
supermarkets 
think better specific niches where there less regulation where capital 
less important and where margins can high also expect the new empowered 
consumer described earlier seek best class unbundled services 
product basis think mortgages will see the slowest conversion fully digital 
mortgages have long origination process which paper intensive difficult scale 
and requires lot handholding throughout the process many consumers want live 
interaction and advice throughout the process 
the flip side investments insurance especially car insurance credit cards 
payroll loans and most other personal loans are likely see significant migration 
fully electronic and fintech firms could potentially take meaningful share most these 
products are relatively simple with limited onboarding requirements making them easily 
transferable digital 
are also seeing the rise digital portals and aggregators both lending and 
insurance taking power away from the distributors and intermediates 
alternative payment systems that seek disintermediate credit cards face significant 
obstacles think several brazilian fintech companies are working establish 
codes mainstream payment solutions many the buy side frequently ask new 
technologies such codes are likely displace card payments while would 
never write off the risk created new payment solutions think that the 
established ubiquitous plastic infrastructure brazil and the rewards programs 
embedded cards represent almost insurmountable challenge for codes 
ways play 
their business models compete with fintech players bradesco banco brasil and 
ceo digitalization can found here view from the top the disruptor side 
the available publicly traded vehicles are limited pagseguro champion 
inclusion and banco inter execution risk and valuation make this show story 
that said flurry public equity offerings expected over the next year this 
note provide detailed profiles fintech companies that think stand out 
among peers are aware potential offerings only the extent they have been 
announced companies reported the financial media our inclusion any
