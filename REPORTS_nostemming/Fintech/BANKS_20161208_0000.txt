september prompted gradual change the market evaluation banks 
stocks which had been universally negative prior that the wake donald 
trump election victory bank stocks recently have made strong gains however 
think the potential negative catalysts for the megabanks heading towards 
fiscal year end from the macro and financial regulation perspectives are also 
limited external factor yen depreciation positive for megabank 
earnings megabank plans assume stronger yen than the current level and 
the finalization basel rules end early that the stock market 
watching seems unlikely least negative for the megabanks indeed this 
leads enhancement shareholder returns the implications would positive 
three factors support our view that the business environment for megabanks 
likely turn namely upturn the treasury yield expectations 
fiscal expansion possible pullback concerns over further deepening 
the negative interest rate owing yen depreciation tied wider japan 
interest rate gaps and heightened expectations for easing financial 
regulations including potential clarity the future the dodd frank act 
why are bullish megabanks what focus the medium term with 
negative factors such negative interest rates largely priced expect

can japanese banks consistently achieve digit roe under the 
current financial regulatory regime 
market view 
unrealistic expect reach double digit roe the short term 
years given the structure the japanese banking business difficult 
expect unambiguous roe growth drivers for example smfg expected 
roe discounting for the impact disposal gains from policy holdings plus and gap with not easy close 
development business models the midst catching with global 
peers compared with european and financial institutions development 
business models japanese banks repricing penetration lack buildup 
custodial assets that are the basis fee income small pool wholesale 
commissions etc still catch mode addition with regulations 
participation the financial industry being eased measures deal with 
new market entry from other industries look unclear 
our view 
estimate digit roe would possible the base case expenses 
fell from current levels and the bull case assuming 
rise the policy rate expenses came down would indeed 
quite difficult for japanese banks attain digit roe according our 
base case macro assumptions topix policy rate forex 
order for both mizuho financial group and smfg reach double digit 
roe further cost reductions from current levels 
necessary our bull case macro assumptions topix policy rate 
rising smfg can reach double digit roe 
the time our forecasts and mizuho financial group can reach doubledigit roe growth with cost reductions realistically cannot 
build even cost reductions into our main scenario but nevertheless 
the current valuations megabanks look too low and there also the 
potential for upside consensus roe the banks indicate cost reduction 
plans that beyond what the market expecting 
banks are becoming more conscious roe and more motivated reduce 
absolute cost levels sense strong awareness the part japanese 
bank management the importance measures boost non interest 
income and cut costs roadmap raising roe well uncertainty 
the outlook for domestic net interest income nii believe expectations 
changing growth pattern overseas nii which far has helped fill 
the gap domestic income are leading banks consider broadening noninterest income sources overseas and revising cost structures means 
improving their future earnings prospects business model reforms are just

two megabanks for mizuho and for smfg below the global average

testing via dupont analysis low asset turnover banks stands out global 
comparison 
turned dupont analysis for more detailed examination roa leading banks 
currently about half the global average roe shows 
similar trend global comparison 
banks declining roe largely due financial leverage banks balance sheet 
leverage was the peak but has currently dropped think this 
chiefly because with outstanding deposits far exceeding outstanding loan balances and 
low interest rates discouraging investment elsewhere banks are confined the option 
investing surplus funds safe assets such jgbs and are holding rich stores 
outstanding deposits balance sheet leverage ratios have come down compared for 
example some ten years ago when bank roa was and roe 
higher 
conceivable reasons for banks low roe include declining earnings capability 
terms net interest income nii banks core business income and reduction 
leverage ratios tighter basel regulations following the lehman shock call for 
more shareholders equity 
reasons for the lack improvement profitability banks core business may 
include earnings structures that are highly geared nii nii accounts for gross 
profit major banks and regional banks and though loan balances are 
growing spreads have narrowed sharply too well low profit margins japanese 
companies general china banks arguably face positive conditions where high demand 
for funds economies grow makes possible lend relatively high rates 
interest 
clearly not easy for japanese megabanks reach double digit roe however

based our forecasts have carried out scenario analysis for the potential 
for roe improvement from cost cutting factors alone our base case macro 
assumptions topix policy rate forex for both mizuho financial 
group and smfg attain double digit roe calculate that further 
cost reductions are necessary from current levels our bull case macro assumptions 
topix policy rate rising smfg can reach 
double digit roe the time our forecasts and mizuho financial group can reach 
double digit roe growth with cost reductions 
for japanese banks reaching double digit roe way easy and requires quite 
favorable macro conditions however get the impression that japanese bank 
management teams the megabanks including smfg and mizuho financial group are 
keenly aware the need for cost reductions and measures reinforce non interest

emerging risk not holding bank stocks 
market view 
dilemma over bank stocks interest income and non interest income the 
main sources income japanese banks both exhibit high sensitivity 
economic activity and investors lack strong reason for needing own 
bank stocks yet see also risk not owning bank stocks for efforts 
beat the market average because the prospect rapid return bank 
stocks which account for about tse market cap given large 
change rates versus forex and topix trends when the macro environment 
improves and depending the boj monetary policy 
japanese banks japanese economy japanese banks face difficult 
income environment light the current situation for the population 
trend and lack growth industries capable driving japan per capita 
gdp japanese banks mirror the economy and have limited growth 
potential 
our view 
emerging risk not owning bank stocks expect support from the 
following factors the wake the choice donald trump the 
presidential election upturn the treasury yield 
expectations fiscal expansion possible pullback concerns about 
broadening the negative interest rate thanks yen depreciation linked 
wider japan interest rate disparity and heightened expectations 
easing financial regulations such indications the future the doddfrank act 
expecting share price movements response headline news the short 
term though the long term trend important expect japan 
megabank stocks follow trends but also react headline news such 
expectations for policy rate hikes and boj monetary policy trends from 
long term trends meanwhile anticipate changes from business 
model reforms such income structure reforms targeting realization 
double digit roe growth and spending cutbacks also think bank 
executives have strong sense crisis and awareness the situation 
believe that the long term macro trend moves favorably and line with 
our bull case the risk not holding bank stocks would even greater 
japanese banks should not oversimplified with singular definition 
banks think understanding the strategic initiatives japanese banks 
helps understanding their unique features each bank refines core 
competencies and executes individual strategies for example mizuho 
draws company system organized into units and the strength its 
network human relationships with global companies means

also think changes occurring japanese megabanks will materialize gradually even 
considering trend related newsflow 
reform the earnings structure japanese banks still has long way and the 
current environment makes difficult find powerful profit growth driver the 
short run that said believe the risk not holding japanese bank stocks 
increasing following the boj comprehensive assessment september views 
japanese bank stocks which used universally negative have started change 
somewhat and expect more support ahead from rise treasury yield 
expectations for fiscal expansion concerns over further deepening negative 
interest rates possibly receding for the time being given yen depreciation based the 
widening japan interest rate gap and heightened expectations for easing 
financial regulations including indications the future the dodd frank act all 
light the outcome the presidential election 
meanwhile with the boj pegging year jgb yields the majority lending rates 
japanese banks being linked market rates tibor etc the short term prime rate 
and jgbs also durations years think that the benefits increased longterm interest rates will actually limited such while actually doubt that 
steepening the long end the yield curve will cause massive swing expected 
profits for japanese banks expect market interest pick for the short term 
bank stocks that have high exposure overseas operations and higher sensitivity 
also should note two potential catalysts unique financials stocks the basel 
committee banking supervision end early could take more 
accommodative stance than the market expects thereby allowing the banks become

glass steagall act 
legislation that clearly divides commercial banking from 
securities operations parts glass steagall were 
repealed with the glba gramm leach bliley act which 
allowed banks brokers and insurance companies

while the the republican party platform suggested

meaningfully viewed the context global finance 
the global financial crisis was initially triggered subprime mortgage issues the 
was amid emerging concerns over the business western financial organizations that 
were heavily invested subprime related assets that lehman brothers filed for chapter 
bankruptcy protection september destabilize the entire financial system 
following the global financial crisis and series bankruptcies financial 
organizations governments injected capital and implemented fiscal stimuli and fell into 
deeper fiscal deficits then surfaced the fiscal problems greece and wariness over 
default risks european government bonds which led heightened concerns over the 
business european financial organizations invested heavily the region government 
bonds 
the aftermath the lehman brothers collapse governments western countries 
engaged the injection public funding into financial organizations purchase bad 
debt and other measures achieve financial stability the same time the the 
frb and fdic led moves reorganize the financial industry light the market

nationalization banks were seen europe too regulations were also tightened 
both regions given the damage the global financial crisis had caused the real 
economy examples here include the dodd frank act and basel iii agreements which 
have been successful lowering the leverage ratios developed market banks 
following the series events above banks the particular have managed 
recover their earnings thanks part the mild upturn the economy review 
management structures and accelerated structural reforms note however that the 
direction change the business structure differs each case bank america for 
example broadened its business portfolio via restructuring while wells fargo 
focused solely the commercial banking business and citibank universal bank 
the process converting back the more traditional banking operations after 
downsizing its investment banking unit 
meanwhile japanese banks while posting large losses given worsening 
economy rising credit costs and the booking stock related losses share price falls 
experienced only relatively limited direct impact from the american subprime 
mortgage issue earnings this meant that japan the post lehman falls share 
prices also stabilized quickly compared the europe with the falls also less steep 
instead when came recovery the uptrend japan lacked the strength seen the 
market cap recovery from bottom the and market caps have yet return prelehman levels amid ongoing contraction domestic margins japanese banks have 
been focusing expanding their overseas and non net interest income operations yet 
possible that the market has not recognized that their regional and business 
structures have been reformed

market view 
varied expectations for the yield curve concerns over potential 
deepening negative interest rates have receded for now but not been 
completely dispelled the boj stance that will shuffle the cards 
deepening negative interest rates deflationary pressure builds the 
other hand also hear the opinion that against background 
interest rate hikes there could also higher interest rates not only 
japanese government bonds but the intermediate zone well 
our view 
bank stocks already factoring broadening the negative interest rate 
some extent curve the short term jgb sector and products 
shows signs anticipating certain amount negative interest rate 
expansion two main investor concerns for banks are broadening 
negative interest rates and further decline profitability due stricter 
regulations for the first point conducted simulation three

implications from nirp looking the case swedbank 
sweden for insight how quickly banks can adapt 
external changes 
case study look the example europe where negative interest rates were 
introduced ahead japan interesting observation from regional comparison 
share price performances post the start nirp that the financial industry relative 
stock index escaped underperformance after nirp only sweden where swedbank has 
maintained firm outperformance all other regions just like japan financial stocks 
have been underperforming significant margins under nirp 
understand that banks europe have been repricing deposits and lending and 
charging commissions from large accounts since the introduction nirp order 
offset the decline net interest income while usually difficult offset the 
negative impact fully swedish banks have managed grow net interest income 
efforts including those the retail focused swedbank outweighed the negative 
impact nirp net interest income can attribute this mainly three factors 
banks dominating the mortgage market strong mortgage related funding demand 
most mortgages being based month variable interest rates banks hold strong 
pricing power under oligopolistic market climate and this has allowed for repricing 
that not fully affected the decline stibor result mortgage margins 
increased yoy 
for details see the following report banks economics rates strategy negative rates 
dangerous experiment with diminishing positive impact feb 
try apply the above scenario japanese megabanks course there 
direct impact nirp the form tibor decline given that the japanese mortgage 
market primarily linked short term prime loans however competition the 
mortgage market among banks including regional and online banks tight and also 
given megabanks policy not taking risks increase balance their pricing power far 
from strong with regards repricing deposits the interest rate for personal deposits 
has already been low just few basis points even prior nirp and leaves little room 
for adjustment all all believe would difficult for japanese banks fully 
offset the negative impact net interest income the case sweden given limited 
room for repricing personal loans deposits and also that growth the lending balance 
unlikely accelerate ahead 
should also note that believe one contributor revenue growth has been the 
speed with which bank managements have responded external conditions though 
estimate there have been some differences not only earnings structures but also 
loan deposit ratios depending the country bond market scales and the degree

final basel proposals important event for bank valuations and share prices 
the final basel proposals called asel are expected close year end early 
the basel committee meets end november confirm final proposals with the 
governors due ratify january the proposals could have material impact 
the capital requirements for many the banks cover globally the basel oversight 
body chaired ecb president mario draghi said january that the committee 
will focus not significantly increasing overall capital requirements and 
ministers speaking hangzhou china september said they would 
support basel efforts without further significantly increasing overall capital 
requirements across the banking sector however our bottom scenario analysis 
suggests potential for material risk weighted asset rwa inflation the basel 
proposals are implemented their current form the report above assess the 
difference between the rhetoric and the numbers implied our scenario analysis and 
identify which banks our analysis suggests would have the largest gap steady state 
capital requirements the proposals are implemented their current form also 
consider potential options available the basel committee local jurisdictions that 
could soften the effects 
rhetoric points pragmatism 
since last year have argued europe that concerns over the new regulations could 
overstated particularly jurisdictions where existing macroprudential and prudential 
measures reduce the need for more significant increase capital requirements against 
mortgage and other lending see global banks implications higher capital 
requirements for mortgages september and outlook november 
news flow over recent months and our conversations with management teams 
and other industry experts had pointed increasing optimism this scenario with 
hopes for increases risk weighted assets rwa limited less most 
recently though picked concerns among management teams the heavy fog 
uncertainty bnp coo october analyst conference call with final 
proposals only weeks away 
our bottom scenario analysis current proposals suggests very different 
outcome 
our bottom scenario analysis considers bear case scenario where the existing basel 
proposals are not softened and would imply output floor output 
floor rwa inflation for credit risk alone average for global banks 
europe singapore hong kong japan and australia this would imply additional 
capital need similarly the calculations the european 
banking federation reported agefi september suggest additional 
capital need much for the european sector including for 
credit risk for operational risk and for fundamental review the

offset the negative factors entirely and expect parent ppop decrease yoy 
for credit costs the bank has successfully tightened pre emptive controls

expenses are likely rise result next generation systems and growth 
investment parent from with regard the reduction

buildup non interest earnings tax effects for mizuho securities corporate tax 
adjustment and credit costs below plan 
parent banks combined nii decreased yoy due 
narrowing domestic and overseas gross profit spreads and the effect yen 
appreciation fee commission income was yoy with the slump
