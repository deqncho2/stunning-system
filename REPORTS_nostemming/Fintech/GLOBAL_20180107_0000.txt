lower risk for both the bank and the customer 
payments affecting consumer banking two important 
for the bank real time payments mean that the receiving 
ways

increased customer satisfaction with the amazon 
funds are made available the customer only after they 
ification the world consumers are demanding more 
have been received reducing the risk fraud 
speed and convenience banks have been behind the curve 
for the customer real time payments allow access funds 
offering new ways conduct day day transactions 
instantaneously without the need share bank account 
ceding share fintech players with real time payments 
passwords with third party again reducing the risk 
banks can enable customers get the convenience 
fraud 
instant access their funds with less risk than when they 
use non bank fintech apps 
the next leg instantaneous international funds transfer 
blockchain technology potentially provides avenue with 
real time banking benefits banks both attracting new 
banks joining the utility settlement coin project 
customers particularly millennials and retaining existing 
explore the idea think some form real time cross 
customers which turn increases deposit stickiness 
border payment bank account bank account will exist 
especially critical time when deposit betas are rising 
within the next years leveraging real time payments 
think this also tilts the balance back favor the

groups separately because firms underbanked countries naturally have lower expense ratios ranging from average philippines impressive china comparatively banks highly banked countries 
naturally have higher expense ratios ranging from italy singapore reasons why firms underbanked countries naturally have lower expense ratios include services more concentrated wealthy urban 
areas cheaper labor and higher loan yields resulting from higher cost risk 
the expense curve for countries with their population unbanked steeper these geographies have lower operating costs with younger populations new banking customers are more likely mobile users

key drivers cost reduction 
bluepaper 
overview 
pulled together our global banking and technology teams think through the drivers that would 
enable consumers adopt mobile banking faster and enable banks realize the benefits more efficient branch footprint developed four primary drivers each with several sub components these four 
drivers are infrastructure population propensity adopt mobile regulations and ease 
cost takeout rank the countries relative each other these metrics the purpose assess 
which countries banks will able improve their efficiencies faster slower than the curve show 
exhibit 
the first three drivers influence consumer willingness adopt mobile banking better infrastructure younger population with less financial inclusion and regulations that support banks the primary 
payments pathway drive likelihood consumers banking their mobile phones with infrastructure 
are assessing the internet bandwidth electricity and telephone infrastructure mobile internet speed 
and status real time payments population propensity adopt mobile are looking how young 
the population the percentage the population that not serviced banks today and the percentage 
the population that owns smartphone for regulations look recent proposed and enacted regulations assess which countries are supporting banks the primary payment pathway and which are 
supporting fintechs 
the last driver ease cost takeout influence the ability banks reduce expenses consumers 
migrate their banking needs the mobile phone here are looking labor laws urban population 
customers per branch and consolidation the deposit base labor laws gives indication bank 
ability shrink its headcount important part efficiency gains urban population and customers per 
branch help assess the opportunity set for branch optimization fragmented deposit base provides
