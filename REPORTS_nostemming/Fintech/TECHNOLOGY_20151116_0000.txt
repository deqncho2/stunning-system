dominant position payments could take long time but these changes 
could potentially disruptive companies that have taken more risk build 
mobile real time payments like industry leader paypal 
security key area focus for mobile payments the advent 
tokenization which replaces the actual digit payment credential with 
dummy number has provided big boost enhancing the security 
architecture mobile payment solutions apple pay uses tokenization 
embedded secure element ese model while android pay combines 
tokenization along with host card emulation hce the other hand 
samsung pay has adopted hybrid approach storing tokens ese trust 
zone well potentially using hce for authentication depending the 
region and device 
the debate between secure element hce don expect one approach 
dominate the other but rather that both exist depending the service 
provider smartphone oem banks internet companies well the 
level security desired addition after the demise softcard the 
sim based secure elements are mostly seen operator wallet launches 
europe and china finally see both near field communication nfc and 
quick response codes being utilized for mobile payment solutions given 
that service providers are limited not controlling the entire ecosystem 
networks and play key role mobile payments given that 
the majority mobile wallets coming into the market are using nfc hce and 
tokenization expect the networks continue play central role the 
industry moves towards mobile form factor for payments moreover visa 
and mastercard digital enablement services are helping accelerate the rollout mobile wallet solutions eliminating the need for bilateral agreements 
between issuers and the digital wallet providers 
merchant support for mobile payments picking although merchant 
acceptance for mobile payment options still limited expect that the 
europay mastercard and visa emv upgrade cycle will help fix the problem 
majority emv terminals being shipped are also nfc capable also 
believe that longer processing times associated with emv cards checkout 
could incentivize merchants encourage usage contactless nfc payment 
methods the pos finally expect the second iteration mobile wallets 
incorporate loyalty rewards integration with merchants driving motivation

latest developments mobile payments 
expect see step new mobile payments offerings 
the mobile payment landscape likely remain fragmented for the next years but eventually should 
consolidate around business models that offer incremental value consumers our view consumers are 
likely inundated with mobile wallet options over the next months different entities smartphone 
oems banks mobile operaters well internet software companies such google microsoft and paypal 
that are involved the payment ecosystem launch their own wallet offerings ensure branding and control 
update apple pay 
apple pay far the most popular mobile payment offering today though still accounts for very small 
portion transactions even for merchants with relatively high pay penetration apple has expanded pay 
availability since launching year ago adding more merchant locations issuers and pay enabled devices 
more than merchant locations offer pay today growing from year ago and apple said will 
million the end the year with more come next year including starbucks stores pay also available 
many more apps including popular ones such airbnb priceline starbucks target and uber now has 
banks credit card issuers supporting pay from six year ago apple starting add more loyalty and 
rewards cards which many retailers and users have asked for since launch the wall street journal and others 
report that the company planning add payments pay and ceo tim cook said expect more 
features the future pay now available the and and apple will add canada china singapore hong 
kong and spain possibly the next year think pay has gotten off good start but takes time change 
consumer behavior and build large ecosystem particularly when multiple parties have buy issuers 
processors merchants and users with enabled devices with visa and mastercard new digital enablement 
initiatives apple less likely directly monetize pay any significant way but still believe this will enhance 
the value apple ecosystem and make device revenue more annuity like and less transactional apple 
covered katy huberty 
samsung pay coming the heels apple pay 
samsung electronics announced its new mobile payment service samsung pay along with the launch the 
galaxy march samsung pay incorporates the magnetic secure transmission mst technology from its 
looppay acquisition well the tried and tested nfc technology mst enables smartphones emulate the 
magnetic field generated the magnetic stripe traditional payment cards transfer payment data the 
terminal the biggest advantage incorporating both technologies nfc and mst that the service will 
work most existing payment terminals unlike apple and android pay that currently work only terminals 
supporting contactless transactions for newer terminals that support nfc technology samsung pay defaults 
nfc mode and for the rest seamlessly transition mst samsung collaborating with visa mastercard and 
american express leverage existing tokenization infrastructure for issuing tokens the phone samsung pay 
currently works with galaxy edge edge plus and note devices 
samsung pay success korea and robust partnership the korea was big success with over 
million subscribers october spread across million purchases the market both apple pay and 
android pay are early but samsung partnership has widened considerably its coverage among banks the 
around with the announcement that cards issued new banks will supported chase 
bank with discover cards early well existing support from bank america citi bank 
synchrony financial first data corp blackhawk network and american express the top carriers support 
samsung pay including verizon and samsung indicated that three out four samsung pay transactions 
the were made via mst since the launch september rather than nfc showing the advantage 
provided mst and repeat usage with average transactions per user the over the past month

samsung pay date accepted more places than any other mobile payment service samsung 
estimates more than merchants worldwide accepted samsung pay contrast apple pay google 
wallet which requires select merchants where nfc accepted secure does not store share payment 
information and easy set and use with the latest samsung galaxy device samsung pay will become

google joining hands with carriers well launching android pay enable 
faster adoption mobile payments 
google rated covered brian nowak launched its latest mobile payments initiative android pay 
september similar apple pay the service can utilized for making store transactions and google 
expects add support for making line payments well soon android pay will available for android 
phones with nfc capability running android kitkat above addition payments the service also 
expected provide users with easy reference recent transactions with details about the respective merchants 
importantly consumers lose their smartphones they can use android device manager reset passwords 
remotely wipe out their devices android pay supports credit debit cards payment networks visa 
mastercard american express and discover and supported most the leading banks including citi wells 
fargo and capital one 
similar apple pay android pay utilizes tokenization replace the actual digit credit card personal 
account number pan with dummy number relies hce for transferring the payment credential the 
payment terminal complete the transaction unlike apple pay which uses secure element chip store 
tokens and generate dynamic cryptograms hce enables storage payment credentials the cloud rather than 
secure location the phone such the embedded cecure element sim based system thus removing the 
dependency the carriers after the launch hce with much fanfare had yet see any major 
mobile payment product launches from the smartphones oems based the technology until android and 
samsung pay the other hand banks and retailers that control neither the sim the embedded secure 
element have expressed greater interest hce for their mobile payment initiatives 
after having its initial foray mobile payments google wallet blocked the carriers google recently 
joined with verizon wireless and mobile buying out their mobile payment initiative softcard the 
deal provides the company with some intellectual property related mobile payments but more importantly 
will ensure that its android pay application will come pre installed smartphones sold verizon and 
mobile running android lollipop and above this our opinion major advantage for google for 
consumer adoption compared other mobile payment services the android platform including those from 
samsung and possibly from paypal the future where consumers will have download separate application 
google has also launched google wallet separate application that will focus peer peer payments 
similar venmo and square cash users the old google wallet will need transition android pay for 
making mobile transactions merchants and their previously stored payment credentials google wallet will 
automatically transfer over 
microsoft also signaling its intent join the mobile payments race 
recent interview microsoft executive had commented that the company looking get involved 
mobile payments with windows although didn provide much details the actual implementation 
the payment solution the company mobile payment system expected support not only credit cards but 
also loyalty cards coupons for making both store and online payments addition think the company 
use nfc the communication technology similar mobile payments solutions from apple google and 
samsung supports microsoft well the company had used for its windows wallet windows phone 
for authentication the company could look use either windows hello which can unlock devices with 
fingerprint iris facial recognition software that was introduced with windows 
technology payments banking and retail november 
morgan stanley research 
microsoft during the company winhec event china had demonstrated mobile payments system running 
windows addition the company has embraced host card emulation hce its windows 
similar google support the technology with android kitkat furthermore the company has also filed for 
money transmitter license all states and has received some approvals signaling its strong intention 
contender the space microsoft covered keith weiss 
our opinion the company will face two major challenges with its mobile payment endeavor will 
playing catch apple pay which has already been adopted the initial mobile payments enthusiasts 
well google and samsung pay android and insignificant number windows smartphone users 
compared iphone ios and android smartphones this limits the user base that microsoft could target with 
its mobile payments service windows smartphones 
paypal partnering with retailers 
paypal agreed acquire paydiant for earlier this year paydiant licenses its technology retailers 
enabling them launch their own branded mobile wallet applications the company customer roster includes 
mcx led walmart the retail consortium representing retail spending which expected launch its 
mobile wallet currentc the acquisition enables paypal until this point generally left out the recent high 
profile launches apple samsung pay participate the mobile payments space partnering with retailers 
that don achieve the same level brand awareness through third party services they would their own 
emv launched the tipping point for mobile payments 
october from this day forward retailers own fraud risk they don have emv compliant point sale 
pos systems this means you will wait line longer check out why emv cards take seconds process 
that from seconds for mag stripe swipe what about applepay readers that micro seconds watch

jpm launches chase pay positive for share gain 
jpm giving its clients million cards strong mobile wallet jpm now needs merchants sign jpm 
already has strong dialogue with merchants and its merchant acquirer paymentech has market share 
total spend mcx partnering with chase pay suggesting some large scale retailers will likely signing 
what does jpm bring the table 
first clean single discount rate for each merchant which includes the network merchant acquiring and 
card issuer fees extra fees 
second volume discounting the more business merchant pushes over chase pay the lower the fee 
third fraud protection chase pay approves the payment jpm eats any fraud costs while some this 
because codes aren emv compliant they have this competitive one less thing for 
retailer worry about did that fraud happen emv compliant machine not 
fourth aggregated merchant loyalty rewards consumers will able see all their loyalty rewards from 
the various merchants their chase pay app 
over time would not surprised chase integrated real time and payments into the chase pay 
mobile wallet which should allow convenient direct debit functionality something that non bank cannot offer 
over time think chase pay may able integrate real time pay into this app member 
clearxchange which runs over ach not debit rails this could positive for jpm fees the limiting factor 
this app currently chase pay limited jpm cards but with million cards that consumer 
spend see the empire strikes back section for more details

clearxchange merges with early warning banks bringing back the band 
the bank consortium owned clearxchange and early warning announced their merger october for 
close december this big our view will integrate early warning authentication and 
verification with clearxchange mobile payment capabilities banks are gearing offer robust real 
time payments additionally the national automated clearing house association nacha will enable 
same day ach settlement for push payments fall that will enable banks offer real time push 
payments over ach with this clearxchange system this will directly compete with paypal real time offering 
potentially disrupting the advantage they created taking more risk than banks offering clients real time 
payments many years ago and also their venmo acquisition already clearxchange has financial 
institutions using and early warning has financials using expect for fee 
apple reported the wall street journal talking clearxchange about how add functionality 
its devices moving beyond over time the joint company might able offer authentication and 
verification the point sale this could potentially take share from visa and mastercard network leaders 
clearxchange bank owners are bank america jpm usb and wells fargo early warning bank 
owners are bank america capital one jpm and wells fargo pnc will join owner upon merger 
bbt shows banks are fintechs too

element chips its iphones watch and ipads for mobile payments 
wearables 
apple pay even better the apple watch accentuates pay two biggest selling points ease use 
and security with the apple watch users not have reach into their pockets bags for their iphones 
which makes using pay faster and easier once user enters his her passcode after putting the watch the 
user stays authenticated and can use pay anytime without entering the passcode again verifying with 
fingerprint like done iphone this further improves ease use and security the watch uses the 
biometric sensors its back constantly verify that the user still wearing 
similar features should coming the android ecosystem with android wear and android pay 
google has laid the foundation for contactless payments through wearable devices for its platform should 
only matter time until oems take advantage these features especially they compete with apple 
recall that took just over two years after the iphone launched june for android take off 
wearables should help contactless payments gain traction though smartphones are still the main 
driver given the additional ease use and security wearables can provide contactless payments are even 
more compelling however think only subset smartphone users will adopt wearable devices the 
foreseeable future payment enabled smartphone shipments and installed base still the main driver

which security architecture sims eses hce 
believe the proliferation nfc handsets the latest count positive for adoption 
secure elements ses these may not deployed across all handsets but the use embedded secure 
elements high end models iphone samsung galaxy and edge suggests there could trickle 
down security technology over time just like what has happened with other features first introduced 
high end smartphones there some risk around ese from android hce our view however not 
think these options mutually exclusive google acquisition softcard illustrates that the company may 
looking keep number options open for secure authentication further down the line 
broadly speaking nxp remains the dominant silicon player embedded secure elements though has split 
some share with infineon recently the samsung galaxy being case point among tsms trusted service 
manager gemalto focused initially mobile operator led payment schemes has not gained much 
traction oem schemes some peers infineon tends have stronger position sim cards segment 
where nxp does not have presence 
latest developments security architecture 
since our last update mobile payments there have been several major developments around secure element 
architecture which could influence how nfc payment solutions develop 
samsung launched the galaxy with embedded 
samsung galaxy launched mobile world congress mwc included embedded supplied 
oberthur the silicon supplied nxp china and infineon the rest the world the handset launch 
coincided with the launch samsung pay samsung equivalent apple pay the launch illustrates our point 
about the two options not being mutually exclusive samsung pay the galaxy can use tokens stored the 
secure element samsung pay other devices can use hce for authentication long they are running 
android kitkat later 
hce gets boost from android pay 
google launched android pay its developer conference may and part that announcement 
become the first announced partner for visa new tokenization service this the tokenization service 
used apple pay and appears likely use hce for authentication all devices running android kitkat 
later the reliance hce could negative for embedded secure elements visa and mastercard 
specifications longer require hardware based authentication for payment acceptance however with other 
areas smartphone specification screen resolutions claimed data speeds would expect security 
area likely see arms race between handset manufacturers have seen the high end think 
this should lead increased deployment secure elements smartphones over time 
one major factor android pay that google has negotiated the for the service google service 
mandatory gsm this means will come pre installed all android handsets with the new default 
this puts the service the same category google maps the chrome browser and likely have 
substantial positive impact adoption 
technology payments banking and retail november

google acquires softcard 
google acquired the assets pertaining softcard previously isis march this could read one 
two ways either google was seeking add some flexibility and expertise around the deployment sim based 
secure elements the company was looking remove roadblock the deployment ese android 
partners and its own payment solutions 
softcard had previously prevented the sale devices primarily the samsung galaxy with ese the 
united states google acquisition the company removes that issue given that softcard was joint venture 
carriers suspect this deal paved the way for google able include android pay mandatory 
handsets 
what are the latest developments hce 
visa and mastercard announced their support for hce ahead mobile world congress mwc early 
this meant that any app android device can emulate nfc smartcard letting users tap initiate 
transactions the handset can also act contactless card reader december less than months after 
visa and mastercard announced their support for hce the royal bank canada rbc became the first north 
american financial institution launch commercial implementation mobile payments using the hce 
technology 
several banks have launched products based hce software companies involved tokenization such 
bellid sequent carta worldwide have moved capture the early deals this market think the launch 
android pay creating explicit link with visa for provisioning activity will lead larger number 
banks launching 
now see standards and ecosystem around hce becoming better established visa latest tokenization 
protocol being made available cost card issuers compared per provisioning event for the 
previous version and per month maintenance fee furthermore there percentage fee 
transactions compared apple pay therefore expect android pay very attractive 
option for banks exhibit shows the announcements banks launching contactless payment services using 
hce that have come across anticipate many more emerge over the next year

what are the implications for embedded ses 
apple and samsung are the two highest profile oems launch services the back embedded ses apple 
pay and samsung pay respectively secure elements have become more widely deployed the smartphone 
industry more than manufacturers over models manufacturers include embedded ses 
handsets include apple samsung huawei xiaomi sony blackberry nokia 
expect secure elements continue deployed handsets they remain the most secure option for 
authenticating transactions are cheap and are becoming increasingly configurable and familiar service 
providers looking launch mobile services that rely secure authentication given that high end handsets 
have established the ese differentiator security would expect there trickle down effect 
lower priced handsets over time 
one other factor supporting growth embedded ses the current move create standards for embedded 
sim cards esim euicc which may used the future handset manufacturers looking give consumers 
additional choices between network operators services while managing handset churn more actively standards 
around this are likely set during conjunction with the gsma and mnos worldwide expect this 
lead increased deployment secure chips smartphones these can multi purpose containing sim 
functionality well authentication for mobile payments and other services this market early stage but 
view opportunity for secure element players 
recognize tokenization could threat eses but means view these two options mutually 
exclusive there could service launches the future from other players using mobile authentication that 
might prefer use more secure options samsung pay allows for this possibility opening the secure 
element architecture third parties the iphone ese not accessible third parties currently however with 
other differentiated software and hardware features touchid being the most recent example would expect 
this change over time

what are the implications for sim based ses 
continue see deployment sim based secure elements spite the limited traction that operator 
mobile wallets have gained most markets where they have been launched apart from china 
nfcworld details over handsets currently available with nfc nfc functionality becoming standard for 
high and mid end smartphones not all these have secure elements which may create opportunity for 
operators launch authentication services sim assuming some the barriers around complex ecosystems 
can overcome 
the sim alliance states that nfc sims sims including secure element were shipped this 
represented modest all sims shipped though clearly higher percentage postpaid and lte sims 
were mobile payment services are likely targeted volume growth nfc sims was compared 
when they were total sim shipments exhibit 
exhibit illustrates how nfc shipments broke down region the spread across regions has become 
relatively broad although growth could moderate the was the largest market volume 
believe demand could stagnate even decline given the acquisition softcard google view 
supported the recent profit warning gemalto major supplier the the incentive for carriers 
buy nfc sims limited given that the nationwide roll out the softcard wallet presumably postponed 
indefinitely 
would expect europe and china continue grow given ongoing operator wallet launches those 
markets vodafone orange china mobile and china telecom have all been active buyers nfc sims recent 
quarters and expect wallet roll outs continue believe wallet offerings from mnos need 
improve these are gain any traction the market particularly terms enrolment process but also 
believe mnos will continue support their attempts over

what are the implications for the tsm model 
principle believe some the barriers that have existed around deployment the tsm model are coming 
down the samsung pay architecture involving tsm highlights the opportunity that exists for silicon players 
oem payment schemes believe the size this opportunity increases with the number services that 
can take advantage secure element based authentication with visa and mastercard offering digital 
provisioning services these services are more widely available and increasingly standardized growth the 
penetration nfc sims positive and believe tokenization also positive that multiple services 
could use single token for authentication 
however believe the economics being involved this part the value chain continue 
deteriorate the original proposition tsm players such gemalto was that the company would generate 
ongoing royalties from each different sets credentials provisioned onto sim based secure 
element events recent months have illustrated two ways which these economics look extremely 
challenged 
single token authentication the increasingly prevalent use tokens for authentication 
negative for tsm economics our view while tsm players such gemalto have capabilities 
tokenization have also seen rise models such that recently adopted vodafone 
conjunction with carta worldwide here secure credentials are stored the cloud with 
credential provisioned the handset sim based ese practice this token can used 
authenticate multiple sets credentials the cloud there therefore only single set 
information that needs provisioned rather than the envisaged the tsm similar 
still needs provide secure cloud platform for storing credentials though view this 
smaller outlay for service providers 
visa mastercard causing deflation the latest iteration visa digital enablement platform 
vdep service provided free charge card issuers least subsidized other 
revenue share arrangements with visa this makes sense all parties not least because 
likely encourage banks and other service providers launch wallets etc using visa 
authentication services which should channel higher volumes visa away from say digital 
wallets clearly visa competition with gemalto and others for provisioning business here and 
partnering with android pay has another high profile partnership place beside apple pay 
agree that recent developments tokenization hce and the deployment sim based and embedded 
secure elements positive for mobile payment infrastructure and should encourage wider roll out out 
contactless payments however believe economics continue appear challenged for players such 
gemalto who have the past asserted that the sim card created kind walled garden for them provide 
these services believe the entry visa and the like into the market have also added significant deflationary 
aspects

update from the payments side 
apple pay update 
apple pay availability has expanded significantly since launching the october over 
card issuing banks the and now support pay from six large issuers when the digital wallet 
was first launched apple said october that over million merchant locations now accept pay more 
than quadrupling locations launch and available locations will rapidly expand over million the end 
this year apart from the apple pay currently the and expected rolled out canada later 
this year and china likely next year for american express card holders specifically apple recently confirmed 
apple pay will available canada and australia this year and singapore hong kong and spain next year 
apple pay now available iphone plus and plus and apple watch for store use well 
ipad air ipad pro and ipad mini and for app purchases compared just iphone and plus year 
ago 
merchants are coming around pay think going forward merchant locations major limiting factor 
pay adoption and apple should focus adding locations where users shop frequently think the 
company the right track has added taxis vending machines and quick service restaurants the last 
year notably apple announced will add starbucks the end another merchant note best buy 
the company agreed accept apple pay after having shunned first since best buy part the 
merchant customer exchange mcx consortium merchants developing their own mobile payments app 
believe that this change may have been triggered the expiration best buy initial contract with mcx 
that bound member merchants exclusivity and think that more mcx merchants could follow suit 
additionally target ceo another mcx sponsor retailer confirmed well that the company will open 
supporting apple pay store once their payment system transition emv complete 
apple should add features encourage users use pay more addition acceptance believe that 
lack strong value proposition for the consumer another factor limiting apple pay and other mobile 
wallets from gaining widespread adoption believe that integration loyalty rewards and offers will 
key driving consumer adoption and expect the next iteration mobile wallets including apple pay 
incorporate that into their wallet offerings this consistent with apple statement that will support loyalty 
and rewards its developer conference this past june just the last few weeks seen kohl and 
walgreens announce pay integration with their loyalty programs while most shoppers carry their most 
frequently used credit debit cards with them they may not carry all their loyalty cards this feature could 
encourage shoppers get into the habit using pay more 
the wall street journal and others recently reported that apple will add payments this 
consistent with our expectation that pay will add new features over time popular feature many services 
have including paypal facebook and many banks own apps while will likely not generate revenue 
especially since free most platforms transfer money between friends and family using debit cards 
this feature should increase usage apple pay since apple controls its operating system the company could 
better integrate this feature into its messages app similar facebook messenger enable users transfer 
money with those physically near them similar what airdrop can with documents 
while are bullish pay adoption see less opportunity directly generate profits through 
this service since apple pay launch just over year ago visa launched its digital enablement program 
vdep and mastercard launched its digital enablement service mdes see below essence these programs 
allow issuers work with the networks enable tokenized mobile payments instead signing deals 
individually with each service such apple pay potentially android pay and samsung pay the networks 
far have postponed any new merchant charges for these services and may not charge the future opposed 
apple which has successfully negotiated fee for each transaction that goes through pay right now 
think the issuers will choose work with the networks rather than negotiate directly with apple the future 
technology payments banking and retail november 
morgan stanley research 
and android pay already partner for both services while this may speed apple pay deployments 
internationally means apple will not able monetize pay directly the future like they have this past 
year apple may able come with additional features pay that can monetize however for now 
assume the value enhancing the ios platform and improving ease use throughout the ecosystem 
apple should expand pay reach within apps and into browsers apple available many popular apps 
such airbnb priceline starbucks target and uber however not yet available browsers adding pay 
more apps and websites could drive more usage our view iphones and ipads could simplify the 
payment process shoppers can tap with their fingerprint touch instead filling out their credit card and 
shipping information think the same can done pcs with shoppers itunes login similar paypal 
industry trends should help accelerate pay adoption beyond apple efforts expand pay availability 
discussed above and visa and mastercard new programs and the launch other nfc driven mobile wallets 
such android pay should also help apple merchants need the same equipment accept both the larger 
android user base roughly the ios base could motivate more merchants upgrade their point sales 
the specifically the transition emv should also help many merchants are likely upgrade their 
systems for emv and contactless payments the same time moreover given longer processing times for 
emv transaction the point sale seconds merchants may have incentive encourage use the 
contactless functionality their payments devices 
visa and mastercard digital enablement program service help accelerate launch 
new mobile solutions 
the networks continue believe that adoption tokenization will critical safe and secure proliferation 
digital payments both android pay and samsung pay that were launched the this past summer 
implemented tokenization 
facilitate the quick and easy roll out digital wallet services using tokenization technology visa has 
launched commercial framework program called visa digital enablement program vdep mastercard has 
similar program called mastercard digital enablement services express program mdes express these turnkey 
program will eliminate the requirement for bilateral agreements between financial institutions and 
technology wallet providers leveraging the networks relationships with fis through these 
programs financial institutions all sizes will able gain access the latest digital payment services and 
vice versa through simple onboarding process anticipated that part these programs there will 
revenue share pass through fees between the fis and technology partners note that this construct 
different from apple pay wherein fis and merchants signed bilateral agreements with apple google android 
pay was the first client enroll for vdep and mdes express samsung pay also enrolled issuer participation via 
vdep and mdes express 
tokenization standards should continue evolve 
think that tokenization standards may evolve they adapt for mode widespread adoption beyond apple 
pay for example expect emv which issues manages the tokenization specifications introduce new 
element called payor the transaction data this static non sensitive data field that will transmitted 
along with the transaction data and will help merchants identify consumers that switch between swiping credit 
card using apple pay tied the same card make transaction store app 
note that both and continue waive any tokenization related fees through end besides and 
which are likely the primary token service providers our view think there potential for bank 
consortiums such the clearing house large processors such first data develop their own token 
services well although such announcements have been made thus far believe that issuing banks also 
have the option managing their tokens house although thus far all have chosen outsource and 
for apple pay

what does jpm bring the table 
first clean single discount rate for each merchant which includes the network merchant acquiring and 
card issuer fees extra fees 
second volume discounting the more business merchant pushes over chase pay the lower the fee 
third fraud protection chase pay approves the payment jpm eats any fraud costs while some this

mobile wallet which should allow convenient direct debit functionality something that non bank cannot offer 
over time think chase pay may able integrate real time pay into this app run over ach instead

payments product for store app and online purchases the product will progressively rolled out mcx 
merchants starting mid jpm works individually with merchants bring them board 
think chase relatively better positioned amass customer and merchant adoption given its 
large issuing portfolio credit debit and prepaid card accounts and partnership with mcx whose 
member retailers account for retail payment volumes the jpm closing the loop reversing 
actions they and other banks took the outsource parts the payment chain paymentech already 
the largest acquirer line market share and this offering should help drive its off line share 
what for merchants 
fixed fee structure with declining fees volumes rise with zero fraud liability and additional 
acquirer network fees tokenization likely allows for single card present rate

tokenization provides security for all purchases store inapp and online

perspectives from merchants 
specialty retail and department stores 
while there minimal data around retailers mobile payment initiatives anecdotal evidence suggests consumer 
adoption remains low american eagle outfitters chief digital officer early apple pay supporter recently 
stated the money conference that less than sales are currently transacted through apple pay 
however increasing number partnerships between retailers and mobile payment platforms such apple 
and android pay should drive increased consumer adoption over time shoppers become more comfortable 
with mobile payments more merchants likely sign creating virtuous cycle increased security could also 
provide additional incentive for retailer adoption given recent high profile data breaches target michael 
home depot additionally the upgrade cycle emv compliant terminals required payment networks 
october expedites the roll out store nfc capabilities removing obstacle for retailers not 
previously equipped with nfc despite lackluster consumer adoption and only moderate retailer adoption 
within our coverage thus far exhibit expect mobile payments grow importance from both shopper 
and retailer perspective over time 
the recently announced partnership between apple pay and kohl has two key implications the first for 
merchant owned mobile commerce network merchants customer exchange mcx members represent 
retail sales when retailers signed with mcx they signed three year exclusivity deals these 
exclusive deals expire kohl and other retailers have announced acceptance other mobile payment platforms 
such apple pay while this creates more uncertain future for mcx believe this signals the end the 
one the other mentality and helps endorse mobile payments general acceptance store branded credit 
cards another important development the kohl apple pay deal the integration private label credit 
cards into the apple pay ecosystem should remove another barrier retailer adoption many large retailers
