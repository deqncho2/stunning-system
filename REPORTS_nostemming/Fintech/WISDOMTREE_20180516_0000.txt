key take aways post management meetings 
fintech evolution underway the future asset 
management distribution moving toward technology platforms 
management wetf sees that the world selling etfs has changed over the past 
few years the old days was easier break through the clutter but today there 
much product and noise around retail asset management the still largely 
intermediated with financial advisors who are overwhelmed product choice 
regulation fee compression technology changes etc that challenges them 
our view wetf has come the realization that they need create more than just 
products but rather they need become partners financial intermediaries including 
registered independent advisors rias independent broker dealers ibds and 
wirehouses these intermediaries represent the buyer base wetf products 
wetf can become closer partner financial intermediaries then they could increase 
client touchpoints and deepen relationships sell more wetf products 
wetf racing become fintech solutions firm via its ownership advisorengine 
company that provides cloud based software solutions for financial advisors wetf 
seeking expand its access advisors through technology offerings and then crosssell etf products making easy for advisors purchase model portfolios that 
include allocation wetf products these model portfolios are pre loaded the 
software package which can then customized 
while the digital advice space becoming crowded wetf seeks differentiate with 
advisorengine end end digital wealth management platform that helps advisors 
manage and grow their practice advisorengine modular clouded based technology 
platform that offers crm tools client prospecting and onboarding tools analytics 
trading performance reporting billing well asset allocation model portfolios 
wetf quickly evolving become solutions firm that helps advisors their 
journey and adding value and deepening its relationship with advisors through 
software solutions wetf targets selling more etfs 
today wetf has ownership stake with options acquire majority through jan 
wetf made initial investment advisorengine for minority 
stake late and subsequently contributed additional amounts help 
advisorengine grow including providing capital for transactions wetf helped 
advisorengine brand enhanced their marketing integrated their sales process with 
wetf and professionalized the sales process 
advisorengine today has about firms with assets clients ria ibds 
which assets are the platform economics advisorengine are bps 
aum depending the module that the advisor selects additional economics for wetf 
are earned the advisor puts their clients model portfolios that have wetf products 
among other third party products wetf products typically represent the model 
portfolio 
wetf focused taking advisorengine profitability over time they seek 
operate the advisorengine business profitable standalone basis over time peak 
losses advisorengine are likely which could may suggest wetf exercises their 
option acquire majority stake seek push out the time frame 
meaningful losses persist into 
new account wins poised accelerate wetf has been working with advisorengine for 
about months now given that sales lead times are about months this suggests 
could see some new account wins the coming quarters 
wetf creating ecosystem around the enterprise platform provider with key 
acquisitions through advisorengine that expand capabilities including 
junxure leading crm company for financial intermediaries they have firms 
clients that have advisors assets see significant cross sell 
opportunity advisorengine can convert junxure users onto advisorengine services 
junxure users convert that potentially revenue opportunity for 
advisorengine also see cross sell opportunity for junxure crm tool enhance 
advisorengine overall offering and value proposition wetf lent

distribution expansion underway and key focus area 
expect more distribution agreements come 
wetf recently locked largely exclusive distribution arrangement with 
ameritrade amtd sell commission free smart beta rules based active etfs their 
trillion platform this follows other distribution agreements that wetf has 
arranged such canada with questtrade expect more partnership arrangements 
come and view them unlocking gateway accelerate net inflows across wetf 
products our view wetf has come realization that performance not 
everything while wetf delivered better investment returns its original etf products 
launched compared vanguard comparable etfs outperformance was not 
enough drive flows distribution extremely important and these arrangements 
signal willingness wetf pay for preferred distribution access and data via 
economics sharing 
underlying business momentum accelerating with broad 
based strength flows across etfs 
currency hedged etfs have been headwind for the past few years but digging past the 
headline flow numbers see funds that generated inflows during are 
inflowing the most recent quarter and year ago average they 
have funds per day that are inflowing and funds day historically over 
the past few years distribution initiatives are key reason for the improvement broad 
based strength inflows helps diversify the aum and reduces concentration risk 
currency hedged etfs including dxj and hedj which today represent about aum 
post closure the etf securities acquisition down from aum march 
and peak over late diversification efforts have resulted wetf having 
etfs with over aum size funds and funds year ago 
european etf securities acquisition bolsters presence

access and team people that are brought over etf securities already
