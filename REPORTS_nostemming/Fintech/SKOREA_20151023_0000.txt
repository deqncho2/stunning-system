our bull case valuation and base case only 
but license value exists for kakao minority shareholders 
this really positive offering from the korean government our base case 
assume depositors borrowers including mobile cards within 
five years for the bull case however depositors could reach beyond 
and borrowers could reach capital constraints could limit growth not 
demand kakao pay mobile payment achieved user base year but 
kakao wallet money transfer achieved users downloads

key beneficiary internet banking korea expects own the bank 
when ownership regulation eases expect synergies among the partners 
within the consortium kakao could become channel financial hub for kih

investment background 
internet only banks start operations 
the korean government plans grant one two internet only bank licenses the end this year thus 
paving the way for the first new internet only banks korea since regulators are aiming for pilot 
services begin early the first half internet only banks also known direct digital banks would 
conduct all banking activities digitally via the internet mobile devices without any brick mortar branch 
offices the idea allow internet only banks started early however restrictions bank ownership 
laws within the banking act caused inevitable delays regulators debated the potential social risks korean 
conglomerates chaebols owning bank the same time traditional banks offered seamless internet and 
mobile banking experiences for korean consumers making the need for such internet only banks seem less 
pertinent 
the government newly announced decision early this year establish internet only banks centers around 
president park policy promote creative economy overcome the lackluster export driven economy 
our view korea has fallen well behind the global fintech movement and think the government using 
internet only banks jump start innovations within the financial ict convergence segment although the 
business scope internet banks has not yet been defined think the focus will consumers 
corporations underserved overserved and innovations traditional financial offerings under such 
paradigms think generally the new korean internet banks will allowed engage the three main 
banking activities deposits lending and investments

well each participant stake the consortium were not disclosed understand that each consortium 
expected make presentation before the fss and evaluation committee some time november these 
presentations are expected take place behind closed doors remains seen whether any part the 
presentation will made available the public 
the evaluation criteria were set with business strategy feasibility being the key element accounting for

companies from the current for internet only banks some time next year the start kih kakao

this report explore the following four key questions 
which consortium likely win the license 
korea internet financials october 
can internet bank viral 
what could the value kakao bank 
how would internet bank affect kakao kih and consortium participants 
assess the probability that the kakao led consortium will win the license fairly high particularly given 
the high profile participants including tencent and ebay not only will this the first bank since will 
the first internet only bank ever korea 
even more unprecedented that kakao the most dominant messaging platform korea with virtually real 
experience finance could operating bank that from the government perspective cannot fail from the 
standpoint traditional banks can invite disruptions 
rely heavily japan where internet only banks started and there are few successful case studies 
namely rakuten bank importantly detail the challenges and obstacles that any new internet bank might 
face also provide insight how kakao bank can successful offer both base and bull case values 
modeled after japan 
also important that provide matrix assumptions card holders deposit accounts loan balances 
order derive general sense how much this bank could worth 
korea internet financials october 
key question who will win the coveted banking license korea 
think the kakao consortium likely win internet banking license the end this year 
think kakao can propose very innovative banking ideas such social savings 
accounts friends providing overdraft protection etc 
believe participants the kakao consortium have greater influence their respective 
categories ecommerce payments etc 
think the korean government likely support messaging platforms extending 
their capabilities

september the fss disclosed evaluation criteria guide candidates how apply for the license and 
the same time maintain transparency and fairness the evaluation criteria will scored with substantial 
allocated based the consortium business strategy feasibility meanwhile the scoring will each 
allocated shareholding constitution participant structure capital structure and infrastructure 
are not privy the consortia business proposals think kakao social platform enables its 
consortium devise innovative business strategies all three banking areas incorporating social interactivity 
amongst deposit holders borrowers and investors for example kakao could propose linking deposit accounts 
among friends receive higher deposit rates based virtual combined deposit balances taxi drivers who set 
deposit accounts could get automated payment transfers from kakao taxi passengers who possess kakao 
bank accounts similarly merchants under yellow could get virtual payment from kakao users without users 
ever having take their wallet out and pay credit cards friends can also engage transactions with 
spread costs taken commercial banks fact friends and convenience stores can mirror atm

believe participant constitution likely play vital role which consortium ultimately receives the 
banking license particularly all three consortia present innovative banking strategies assessing key business 
metrics consortium participants can tally how many users customers subscribers each consortium 
wields can also tally ecommerce transactions well the number offline channels they wield 
our view the kakao consortium wields higher maus subscribers including kakaotalk user base

our scorecard for internet bank consortia

scorecard for internet bank consortia think kakao bank will outrank the other two consortia all 
evaluation criteria and get points followed bank points and bank points

bank and bank are investing equity bank likely start with equity this far above the 
government minimum requirement which will lowered after the banking law

major shareholders than considering that the government favors ict companies over traditional financial

kakao remains the only consortium that can leverage korea most utilized mobile messaging app kakaotalk 
the other consortia however innovative their standalone business proposals may will still lack the capability 
integrate kakao social and mobile connectivity well its real time communication feature which could

lastly the korean government does not award internet banking license kakao would limiting the 
potential messaging innovations homegrown internet properties the korean government committed 
fostering innovation and creativity kakao successful banking foray could affect the shape comparable

key question can internet bank viral 
korea will getting its first digital bank the first new bank any kind the country since 
leading the kakao consortium dominant social network with strong communication features list 
below key challenges that digital banks face and how kakao can augment digital bank 
stated our previous report fintech diffusion not disruption april internet only bank 
likely diffuse korea rather than disrupt this because the banking world spite digitalization still 
moves snail pace versus the internet given high hurdles regulations and security perhaps more 
importantly traditional banks korea have embraced comprehensive internet and mobile banking experience 
personal banking now done through pcs mobile phones 
however think internet only banks korea can still innovate and capitalize various niche opportunities 
which are too costly for traditional banks serve leveraging unique ict technologies some internet only 
banks should able deliver innovative yet cost effective financial products and solutions 
pros and cons internet banks 
digital banks have their pros and cons versus traditional brick mortar banks one the pros that internetonly banks should theoretically able offer higher deposit rates and lower lending rates thanks lower 
infrastructure costs internet only banks also offer hour access service physical banks are incapable 
offering 
meanwhile the biggest negative internet only banks lack face face customer service although virtual 
tellers through online video chats are now able ease some these negatives probably the biggest 
challenge for digital banks has been customer acquisition with the brick mortar banks branches offer 
physical destination which conduct banking services plus brand awareness customers choose bank 
they select based location family affiliation corporate affiliation

kakao bank has differentiating factors that point success 
our conclusion that regular internet only banks will face too many obstacles but bank operated 
dominant messaging platform has higher chance success because this platform thrives discovery 
korea internet financials october 
good examples are mobile games kakao taxi even kakao music emphasize the differentiation how 
kakao bank can utilize its social features add deposit accounts also emphasize how social data can 
utilized offer better targeted personal loans lastly there need for kakao bank the underserved 
segments and internet only banks offer pricing advantage yields thanks the lower costs not having 
bricks mortar 
starting from point strength possesses brand power and channel strength 
brand power kakaotalk was ranked the brand terms value korea according brandstock 
october kakaotalk was ranked brand value among brands korea following samsung 
galaxy and mart this big jump from its previous rank last year the general public especially 
the users kakao services should not unfamiliar with the kakao branded bank with partners such 
kih bank and market consumers should find kakao bank quite approachable our view 
the kakao bank brand will not need heavily marketed the 
traditional fashion media advertising the general public should 
know what kakao bank 
exhibit top brands value korea october

well established customer base and channel network kakaotalk has users when compare 
kakao bank other competing consortia and even existing financial institutions has distinct advantage over 
them effective channel interface already available and well established the market kakao corp 
already has experience providing financial services through its kakaotalk platform and assuming kakao bank 
uses the kakaotalk platform should significantly ahead its potential competitors our view 
well structured partnerships should provide captive business ecosystem effective big data 
capability 
the kakao bank consortium has some the top ecommerce and online mobile service providers including 
ebay market and even tencent which should all somehow linked into kakao bank there are 
limitations customer information sharing view stringent regulations but there should enough room 
for business ecosystem set around kakao bank with the internet bank becoming financial enabler 
within the ecosystem concert with the ecosystem element the effective utilization data held each the 
partners should also major advantage held kakao bank how big data implemented should 
determine the effectiveness marketing activities 
innovation should drive business strategy targeting underserved areas using new platform 
korea internet financials october 
being newly established bank kakaobank should not have burdened legacy businesses should 
able select and focus key business areas rather than full banking services provider which not very 
profitable business model korea also think kakao can differentiate its offering from other service 
providers through user reach frequency social graph real time delivery believe key catalyst lies niche

some the key opportunities for kakao bank should mobile cards physical cards longer have 
issued mid prime personal lending relatively less well covered compared the prime and sub prime 
markets small business lending focus sohos being served second tier lenders not banks and 
student loans generally riskier but able track borrowers better owing connection with kakaotalk and 
other kakao functions 
mobile cards card loans the credit card business quite saturated korea credit cards and 
check cards had been issued end furthermore with nearly private consumption 
being done with card the penetration level also very high however there increasing usage cards 
online plus gradually proliferating with samsungpay having been launched summer mobile 
cards are gaining ground and all the top card companies are moving proactively into mobile cards note that 
physical card issuance longer needed for mobile cards there are two functions for credit cards payment 
and loans mobile cards should continue proliferate while plastic cards gradually get phased out

important ones should 
approval business scope regulators

customer data sharing and customer targeting 
execution initial setup and ongoing operations 
core banking and risk management systems 
full business scope not expected provided 
the government has stated that rule changes should not made for internet banks relation business 
scope when compared full service banks even expect regulators limit the operational scope 
internet banks the main reason for doing this should concerns related ensuring that systemic risk 
controlled and ensuring that internet banks not experience accidents believe internet banks should 
limited deposit taking retail small business lending mobile cards and possibly sale financial products 
corporate foreign currency and derivatives related operations have high probability being restricted for 
now the government desires success for internet banks but ensuring there are major accidents problems 
from this endeavor probably more important our view 
basically the business scope should similar that savings banks but with bit more 
deposit taking flexibility also the business platform will fully online mobile which 
believe should enough for our base case not include retail mortgage home 
equity loans and bancassurance business scope 
corporate business likely restricted for internet banks prevent insider loan 
origination and limit the potential losses that could incurred note that savings banks 
during the gfc period went through severe asset quality downturn npls for some 
reached nearly the loan book mainly because corporate lending project 
financing loans 
also expect foreign currency business limited the beginning view the

effective customer data sharing and customer targeting 
according the multiple media sources and based our channel checks the utilization big data 
supposed one the key advantages the upcoming internet banks especially with the kakaobank 
consortium having partners such ebay and other online commerce players however internet banks 
will separate entities there are limitations customer data sharing hence how the data the 
stakeholder companies would effectively utilized needs thought through 
korea internet financials october 
execution should important especially with many partners the consortium 
there are currently nine different major partners the kakao consortium with stakeholdings and business 
goals being different could quite difficult execute effective strategy kakao corp has only stake 
and the timing the passage the relevant laws allowing non financials higher stakeholding remains 
uncertain thus management control the internet bank could somewhat complicated our view 
effective setup core banking and risk management systems 
kakao bank will need build core banking system and the costs involved are very high especially new 
system set estimate that setting new system with new apps would cost around 
however with the government wanting the internet bank launched within 
believe that hybrid approach should taken with the applications the bank partner being used and 
basic architecture being simplified deposit taking lending and credit card operations risk management 
going particularly important mishaps accidents could turn customers away from using internet banks 
what are some real life differentiated services kakao can offer 
brand kakaotalk was ranked brand terms value korea 
according brandstock kakaotalk was ranked brand value among brands korea following 
samsung galaxy and emart this big jump from previous rank

sbi sumishin net bank sbi net bank was established september sbi holdings and sumitomo 
mitsui trust bank full service internet banking business platform compared rakuten sbi net bank 
somewhat more oriented toward traditional banking business but the interesting element that sbi net bank

opportunities with kakao bank assuming that regulations allow such products provided customers 
this time korean brokerage companies not provide such hybrid deposit product but they collaborate

with deposits continuing accumulate rapid pace sbi net bank has diversify its lending business into 
segment where can provide larger loans hence targeted the housing loan market originating loans 
directly sbi net bank also the banking agency sumitomo mitsui trust bank for housing loan business 
april the bank housing loan balance reached 
sbi net bank has set network alliances with real estate companies since september 
and uses this network acquire customers 
november launched new product called housing loan which helped its 
new housing loans balance grow 
implications for kakao bank are not assuming that kakao bank enters the housing loan market the 
onset because requires more servicing such collateral valuation and other verification processes which 
would mean more costs however kakao bank were gain deposits faster pace than expected with peraccount balance also being larger then would probably have consider diversifying into other lending 
markets kakao bank could find way making the housing loan origination more efficient and set 
networks with online real estate brokers believe could interesting business proposition

kakao bank should hybrid 
the banking business korea has become unprofitable operation average roa dropped the level 
and expect meaningful improvement quite gradual hence would not make sense for 
internet bank emulate the banking business model should become specialized financial services 
provider with the advantages commercial bank furthermore there should limitations the scope 
business that internet banks are able 
korea internet financials october 
hence believe kakao bank should hybrid monoline credit card companies savings banks and 
commercial banks 
the main advantages banking license that kakao bank should utilize are 
the ability procure funding from diverse sources utilizing diverse range funding 
products 
the capacity provide transactional services and connectivity all financial clearing 
networks card merchant network kftc network 
the ability issue credit cards and mobile cards 
the ability sell diverse range financial products ranging from bancassurance mutual 
funds 
some the areas from which internet banks should restricted and should keep away are 
corporate business including lending deposit taking and related services 
low margin mortgage lending 
complex businesses such derivatives and trading 
shown the previous section believe the key business areas focus should mobile cards 
mid prime consumer lending and small business lending collateralized believe student loans could 
also retail sub segment where kakao bank could have advantage 
kakao has acumen acquiring customers when kakao launched kakao wallet money transfer 
service expectations were high that sending money would easy sending chats since its launch 
december kakao wallet users have reached only july this year with total money 
transfer payments were only kakao wallet wants increase max balance from

mobile credit cards 
mobile card card loans within the financial sector the credit card business remains the most profitable 
lending business except for micro lending but that completely different segment were focus 
the prime and mid prime customer segments recently mobile card issuance has been allowed without 
providing physical plastic cards this should something that kakao bank could effectively utilize though 
kakaopay has not worked out that well has acquired more than customers the problem more about 
lacking merchant network which limits where cardholders can use their card

mid prime consumer lending the korean consumer lending market quite well covered but there 
slight gap the mid prime consumer lending segment because banks are not able enter the lending 
market while micro lenders and savings banks are generally more focused the sub prime customer segment 
which has higher yields however bank owned savings banks have been focusing more the mid prime 
segment and appear making some strides 
through card loans and consumer term loans believe kakao bank should able penetrate the midprime market especially can focus its efforts within the partners ecosystem normalized basis 
believe the mid prime consumer lending business should able show pre tax roa assuming 
that average yield around funding cost around credit costs are managed around level 
and administrative costs are 
soho loans small businesses mom pop business small business lending bit more risky and 
hence believe that collateralized lending should the way but this would mean that kakao bank 
would need have way valuing the collateral hence believe kakao bank would need have offline 
sales associates provide such services operate small offline sites

scenario based analysis base case shows roa 
order come with our scenario based analysis have made lot assumptions reflecting our 
standpoint regulatory market and strategic directions below are our basic assumptions used for both our 
base and bull case which includes mostly cost elements 
initial paid capital for our base and bear case and for our bull case 
even though the minimum required capital expected lower early losses should 
incurred and hence stronger capital base should needed our view 
internet banking system likely simplified much possible have earmarked 
initial costs and assumed five year amortization schedule 
because customers need withdraw money times kakao bank would need link 
atm network are assuming that kakao bank would linked existing network 
fees would need paid for usage 
for staffing have used similar sized savings banks reference well the size 
staffing smaller banks for general costs which would include deposit insurance fees and 
credit guarantee fund contribution have assumed assets our base our bull 
case have increased the number staff around added work would require 
more staff

unsecured consumer loans card loans and secured soho loans reference derive our 
provisioning assumption

consumer loans where pricing should small business loans where pricing

key question how will kakao and kih benefit from internet banking 
kakao aims become dominant channel for financial services 
think the ultimate aim kakao entry into internet banking become dominant channel for financial 
services products from simple messaging app kakao has evolved become platform choice for 
discovering new mobile games has also become app for hailing taxis with internet bank kakao can 
extend its user engagements and time spent new activities personal banking establishing demand 
deposits taking out personal loans and investing financial products 
becoming effective channel think kakao can target revenue stemming from the financial sector 
financial and insurance businesses are among the largest revenue contributors google adwords 
likewise korea financial and insurance businesses are the seventh largest source advertising accounts for 
the total search market engaging people direct their banking activities the kakao platform kakao 
can also cross sell financial products users who would normally use search platforms discover financial 
products 
exhibit spending for korea financial institutions are among the key advertisers 
rce aco rgan stan ley research 
kih seeks new channel addition and low cost funding opportunities 
kih entry into the internet banking business will expand its business banking adding its existing 
diversified financial services brokerage wealth management investment banking mutual savings banking 
asset management etc except for banking services 
particular think its higher ownership the new internet bank entity will drive business 
development with eye toward penetration the banking business expect limited earnings contribution 
for the next five years given the investment systems and marketing the early stage the business kakao 
bank will need offer attractive interest rates attract customers via various service and higher yield offering 
for the deposits 
however see two main benefits for kih from entry into this new business 
new channel addition kih will benefit from adding kakao new channel for its promotion 
korea internet financials october 
wealth management products kih can improve its relationship with partners leverage out 
their vast channels 
low cost funding opportunities kih can find another lower cost funding source the new 
entity for its lending service existing affiliates including mutual savings bank and brokerage 
business 
synergies within consortium ecosystem 
see important synergies across partners within the consortium for example 
credit cards mobile payments rakuten bank has proven with its build out revolving 
credit loans its ecommerce buyers think ebay which holds share the 
marketplace business korea could expand credit card rollout for kakao bank with reward 
systems this can leveraged with kakao services such kakao taxi well gift 
store building out kakao bank credit card user base participants within the consortium 
would benefit from what likely lower merchant fee structure while kakao bank would 
benefit gains market share the credit card segment considering roughly online 
and mobile transactions korea leveraging ebay transactions with kakao transactions 
could capture further market share from traditional financial service providers 
financial insurance hub korean yuebao think kih motivations align closely with those 
kakao kakao can replicate yuebao korea demand deposits kakao users could turn 
flow into into kih investment funds the deposits could also used provide margin loans 
for stock investors think kih belief that kakao can attract large user base funding 
source why kih has agreed initially own the consortium with the option 
eventually sell the majority stake kakao 
offline channels content developers offline channels such korea post and yes can act 
banking stops convert cash kakao bank users expand their banking activities these 
offline sites can become face face representation kakao bank products tencent 
netmarble and loen are content providers generating meaningful transactions they too can 
benefit from lower merchant fees and larger number potential buyers from kakao bank credit 
card holders 
korea internet financials october 
exhibit kakao bank participants what they can gain offer 
rce rgan stan ley research 
participants within banking consortiums are aiming for fintech 
how could different internet bank license obtained fintech operators not require 
strategic tie with financial services intermediaries 
leads higher monetization revenue share interest margin can maximized cutting 
out intermediaries 
time market fintech services could expedited even more because negotiation 
agreement longer required with intermediaries 
small chance exists independent rollout fintech services without internet 
banking license regulators provide regulatory loopholes 
what are the risks competition and cost services 
the debate not simply whether people will use kakao bank surely some will given higher interest rates and 
convenience 
the real debate whether kakao bank can fundamentally change how consumers and merchants behave can 
people invest the best rates offered for their credit standings without being limited one commercial bank 
can people pay for things without taking their wallets out for that matter bypass the mobile payment 
altogether 
messaging platforms are well positioned compete fintech opportunities 
think kakao well positioned capture fintech opportunities because its unique social features and its 
real time communication aspects which are conducive innovative and differentiated financial services 
korea internet financials october 
kakao monthly users korea put the company favorable position gain first mover advantage 
this nascent market the ubiquity kakao mobile payment suite our view should pave the way for new 
products and services such virtual items kakao offers beacon taxi daily deals yellow and 
kakao pay bank wallet can reach three critical payment segments our view 
small amount daily money transfers consumers were about which 
was transferred online and was transferred branches 
online mobile merchants ecommerce transactions including online and mobile were 
roughly last year 
offline mom pop merchants there are roughly smes korea and they represented 
roughly transactions last year 
lending lending club zopa 
fintech operators could adopt online peer peer lending platform which connects multiple individual 
borrowers and lenders 
ideal lending platform would allow lender better diversify his her investment into large number 
borrowers thus even some borrowers default lending would still offer higher return than investing 
bank deposit 
lending club the largest online lending platform the had loans and share the 
online consumer loan market there are few online loan platform providers korea but none has 
meaningful size given the lack broad borrower base think lending could target users consumer 
finance card loans cash services offering loans lower rate
