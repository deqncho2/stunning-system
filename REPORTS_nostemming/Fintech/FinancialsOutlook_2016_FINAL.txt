from rising rates their variable rate assets reprice faster than their

use the fed funds futures curve when modeling bank earnings 
which drives net interest margin and net interest income 
however now that the fed has started raising rates the next 
question consider how quickly will liability costs increase and 
will that have meaningful negative offset bank asset sensitivity

greater asset sensitivity than peers
