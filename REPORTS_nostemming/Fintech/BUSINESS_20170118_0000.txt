solutions 
growth expectations have been deflated and margins have risen faster thanexpected and become more predicable

rising interest rates should smaller headwind for tru than efx 
prefer tru lower mortgage exposure compared efx total rev for tru 
for efx given our economist expectations for rising interest rates which 
impact mortgage activity particularly refi the mba expects total originations will fall 
and rise only against this backdrop find the outlook for 
mortgage related revenue more uncertain and thus prefer tru relatively lower 
exposure recall that our prior work with morgan stanley equity strategy team led
