spend more and step out which identify this report three key drivers drive 
growth like because its margin improvement potential 
alibaba has been enriching social features the taobao app enhance user 
stickiness increasing monetization given getter targeting technology and 
emphasizing globalization and cloud 
tencent launched mini program january which helped both user retention 
and monetization its aggressive strategies helped expand its global footprint 
and its fast growing payment business helping broaden its product lineup 
ctrip our long term top pick among online verticals because its dominant 
position fast growing industry ctrip has been aggressive expanding overseas 
late acquired skyscnner based meta search and two tour 
operations result the gmv contribution from the international markets has 
been increasing 
momo live broadcasting and short video product initiatives have been boosting its 
overall user engagement time spent retention well the monetization level 
the platform expect momo leverage the strong cash flow generated live 
broadcasting expand the user base and develop new product initiatives which 
will return further drive long term monetization

segment update 
advertising budget allocation shifts continue favor ecommerce and social media 
forecast the online advertising market size will register cagr 
reach highlight three key drivers steady growth china 
total advertizing market low double digits continued budget shift from offline 
online due continued shift user time spent from offline online measurable 
performance and better advertising targeting capabilities and online budget 
allocation shift with ecommerce and social gaining share mainly the expense 
search project ecommerce advertising made total online advertising 
revenue based the aggregate sales the companies under our coverage 
outpacing search advertising for the first time whereas estimate social would 
make from only 
ecommerce new retail fuel growth 
project the ecommerce gmv will deliver cagr reach 
with the online penetration rate rising from 
see room for further online penetration grow all categories especially fmcg 
fast moving consumer goods online gmv growth china has decelerated 
yoy from yoy mainly because decelerating number online 
shoppers but growth still higher than that offline retailers alibaba 
initiated new retail strategy aiming integrate online offline and logistics 
empower offline retailers like intime use alibaba data technology this 
strategy enables alibaba leverage offline retailers gain bigger addressable 
market than purely online 
payments the competitive arena the offline realm 
china online payment transaction value will reach 
cagr and the mobile payment transaction value will reach 
cagr the same period according iresearch alipay has been the 
market pioneer and currently holds the leading market share but tenpay has been 
catching since from low base given its strong social nature and extensive 
ecosystem believe the offline realm will become the primary area for online 
payment competition with rising competition between alipay and tenpay however 
government scrutiny intensified which could lead short term volatility the market 
development but would constructive the long run helps avoid potential 
systematic risks 
verticals another tough year 
most vertical companies yoy top line growth set decelerate significantly for 
variety reasons near term margin improvement key theme for online verticals 
ctrip our long term top pick among online verticals because its dominant 
position fast growing industry expect achieve solid top line growth and 
steady margin improvement had very tough year and think the 
company might continue face challenges due soft property outlook and 
rising competition online auto and online property verticals are getting rid the 
transaction based business model and returning their core media business autohome 
has officially announced that will exit the transaction business and soufun has 
already changed its transaction business model from hiring house agent teams 
forming partnerships with individual agents 
social social advertising revenue growth top all other key advertising categories 
expect that social advertising will become the fastest growing segment the entire 
online advertising space driven increasing online user time spent social apps 
expect leading platforms with better user retention rates and longer user time spent 
gain market share and eventually have better monetization opportunities see 
scarcity value for the leading social media and news apps with massive user reach 
mobiles and expect they will capture the majority incremental budgets 
allocated towards social media and promoted feed formats momo our top 
segmental pick given its robust revenue and earnings growth steady user base 
expansion and attractive valuation like weibo long term positioning but see 
increasing downside risks given current valuation expect continue the 
stagnant user trend due competition indicating downside current street consensus 
earnings estimates 
game esport the spotlight 
expect china overall online gaming market will continue shift from and web 
games mobile propelled increasing mobile gaming user penetration and the 
ongoing structural trend titles transforming the mobile arena forecast 
china total online gaming sales reach rising cagr 
with gaming increasing cagr and mobile expanding cagr 
over the same period believe diversified game play with innovative technologies 
such location based services lbs esports and live game broadcasting could 
continue support growth the mobile gaming market and that key gaming 
distribution channels will play more important role than pure game developer game 
targeting emerging gaming promotion channel expect esports grow 
rapidly with increasing attraction from both gaming developers operators and gamers 
has become important component the gaming value chain 
online video game giants 
china online video market reached with yoy growth according 
iresearch tencent video iqiyi and youku are the top three online video players 
terms revenue according analysys the top three competitors are supported 
tencent baidu and alibaba respectively expect content investment will continue 
increase the investment will mainly flow two areas premium content 
produced traditional movie companies and drama companies well 
professionally produced content from studios and house produced content paid 
subscriptions have now become one the revenue pillars for online video websites 
while house produced content the most important category that attracts paying 
users thus tencent aims increase house produced content evolutionary 
patterns such short video and live streaming our view will continue fast growth

china cloud market poised for strong growth given the chinese government push 
and currently low adoption estimate public cloud penetration 
alicloud china amazon web services aws yes believe has such potential 
key cloud players china include alicloud china telecom china unicom 
microsoft partner china kingsoft and sinnet aws partner china project 
alicloud revenue share china public cloud market reached around 
alicloud advantages versus global leaders concerns about information security likely 
constrain the development global leaders china despite their superior technology 
providing tailwind for alicloud versus local rivals alicloud outshines peers given its

ctrip alliance together had market share the consolidation has help 
ctrip become dominant player the market although not monopoly some 
newcomers have appeared 
according traveldaily meituan total room nights reached yoy 
rise from its major reservation purpose leisure rather than business 
addition less than half its room nights come from local demand and less than 
from hourly rooms thus meituan has become china leading online hotel reservation 
platform terms room nights 
meituan and ctrip still target different user groups meituan mainly covers 
low midrange hotels its average daily room rate was only december 
versus ctrip and meituan more popular among the post 
generation according baidu index during february february 
users who searched for key word meituan hotel booking were years old versus 
for ctrip according phoenix new media the past two years meituan 
hotel booking users are years old 
meituan gradually expanding into the high end arena after ctrip invested qunar 
and elong the ctrip alliance had nearly monopolized the high end hotel 
online booking market hotel suppliers might benefit having some alternative 
channel diversify the distribution network december intercontinental signed 
global distribution agreement with metiuan and both sides are integrating data 
granting metiuan real time access intercontinental hotel inventory information the 
data integration still progress thus intercontinental room information not yet 
available meitun but think this agreement indicates that high end hotels are 
willing cooperate with meituan given its large user base and strong influence among 
the younger generation who are the next backbone consumption

aggressively build transaction platforms that they hoped would provide allaround services for car buyers the plans were successful the companies thought they 
may able double even triple their addressable market exhibit similarly

after focused two year effort the margins both autohome and soufun were 
dragged down dramatically the new business and neither the companies realized 
better operating efficiency than traditional offline players autohome has officially 
announced that will exit the transaction business and soufun has already 
changed its transaction business model from hiring house agent teams forming 
partnerships with individual agents thus expect autohome total revenue
