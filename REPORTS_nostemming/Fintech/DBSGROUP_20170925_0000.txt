price target 
dbs continues provide the most detailed esg disclosure 
the singapore banks has more balanced board mix 
investing the most digital banking solutions and pushing 
hardest for financial inclusion these qualitative indicators 
support our call 
have call dbs this driven our view that strong loan and fee 
growth plus fall loan loss charges will deliver above consensus cagr eps consensus upgrades eps growth and multiple expansion 
from improving earnings quality drive upside our price target 
see continued dps growth and have forecasts and ahead consensus 
and respectively see this achievable with the limited rate 
rises implied the fed funds futures curve were rates rise line with 
morgan stanley economists forecasts there would upside risk our 
earnings estimates and valuations our bull case value assumes this 
our updated esg analysis provides qualitative support for our call this 
note have updated our esg analysis take into account data from the 
report and accounts the key takeaways from our analysis for dbs are 
dbs has consistently produced the best esg disclosure although uob has 
caught both dbs and uob are compliance with global 
reporting initiative framework 
dbs leading technology investment one the stand out features 
reporting has been the emphasis technology innovation given the 
variance data disclosures are not able draw specific 
comparisons among the banks however available disclosures and 
announced initiatives seem suggest that dbs the leading investor 
dbs has the most comprehensive financial inclusion outreach mainly 
through its posb franchise singapore also has the best gender 
balance board level 
oil and gas losses remain the key risk and substantially worse than expected 
loan loss outcome would hurt earnings and potentially share price recovery 
however potential losses are finite and measurable and unlikely impact dbs 
long term earnings potential dividend capacity current levels much 
the price and any recognition these losses could therefore act catalyst

investment thesis eps growth and growing dividend are 
reasons buy this stock esg analysis adds qualitative indicator 
have call dbs 
recently published note arguing why saw value dbs see dbs group 
holdings eps growth and growing dividend are reasons buy sep the 
main arguments behind our positive call were 
our forecast for year eps cagr out consensus and therefore 
expect that dbs will surprise the market the upside over the next two years 
also believe that our estimates are driven higher loan and fee growth 
expectations than consensus and are less reliant nim expansion and trading and 
securities gains quality well quantum earnings should therefore surprise 
the upside expect combination consensus earnings upgrade eps 
growth and multiple expansion from improved earnings quality will drive the share 
price 
dbs raised its dividend see dividend 
also yoy with roe expected rise forecast 
payout and rwa growth see dbs capital ratios rising above 
even based our above consensus cagr dividend our dividend 
forecasts are and ahead consensus and respectively 
capital ratios remain comfortable even assuming bear case credit losses its oil 
and gas support services osv book and increase rwas from basel 
thus see increased capital flexibility dbs coming years think this could 
further enhance earnings multiples 
our nim forecasts are based the fed funds futures curve and assume one rate 
hike and one see loan and fee growth fall the 
cost income ratio and absolute fall loan loss charges meaningful drivers 
eps growth rather than nim expansion the fed funds futures curve suggests rates 
significantly below the forecasts our economist ellen zentner who expects 
one rate hike december and three believe the market 
discounting limited rate increases dbs our bull case valuation uses 
mse rates were rates track this path there would considerable upside risk 
both our earnings estimates and valuations 
our esg analysis adds qualitative support for this call 
singapore banks esg analysis have published updated esg analysis taking into 
account data from the published our first asean esg analysis analyzing stocks with esg lens late last year believe understanding and 
factors can enhance investment decisions whether not investors have sustainable 
responsible investing sri mandate addition see strong structural growth 
sustainable investment itself global assets under management aum 
between and and the number signatories the principles 
responsible investment pri has expanded the past years over

years adding qualitative support for our call has the most detailed disclosures

improvement disclosures 
the report and accounts all banks made improvements disclosures 
most notably uob dbs already produced comprehensive disclosures prior 
dbs and uob also disclose compliance with the global reporting initiative framework 
uob has made significant improvements disclosing quantitative information

data disclosures are not able draw specific 
comparisons among the banks available disclosures and

investor dbs digibank pilot project india one its initiatives 
lower the cost banking and potentially extend financial 
inclusion expects use its experience here improve 
efficiency across the group dbs has seen its cir fall from 
improved efficiency expect continued efficiency improvements 
other indicators relatively stable yoy 
measures board independence business conduct gender diversity and human capital 
management have been broadly stable across the banks dbs stands out financial 
inclusion singapore whilst all three banks also have extensive disclosures 
community outreach and their environmental footprint dbs has the most 
comprehensive financial inclusion efforts driven its ownership posb the former 
post office savings bank singapore singapore banks saw lower yoy profit 
given higher provisioning charges from exposures and result ceo 
remuneration fell all three banks 
risks our call 
the main risk our thesis dbs substantially worse loan loss outcome than 
forecast most likely driven losses the osv book have analysed this more 
detail and see additional losses our bear case which includes one 
further major default the space plus dbs smaller exposures this space 
becoming npls assume provisioning these npls whilst this outcome would 
impact near term earnings and delay recovery year the problems the osv book 
are finite and manageable thus the impact capital dividend paying capacity and 
longer term earnings would limited are also the view that only downside 
our bear case and and upside our base case and bull case respectively 
this was already the price investor feedback after our original note was largely 
supportive this view although detected reticence invest until the scale these 
losses was actually known ironically therefore realisation these losses would 
potentially provide further catalyst for the stock
