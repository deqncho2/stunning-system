blackstone making big entry into big data theme with their announced 
deal for thomson reuters financial data unit this represents blackstone 
largest deal since their acquisition hilton

taking the alternative asset managers while the headline deal size appears 
large blackstone equity check likely around for position their 
flagship buyout fund valuation that discount peers this does not

last cycle larger club deals that disappointed blackstone more conservative 
today with underwriting new deals this includes consideration significant 
economic downturn over the investment horizon and stress testing around hold 
periods leverage levels and impact rising rates the key focus for blackstone

transaction details and history blackstone announced agreement purchase 
stake thomson reuters financial and risk business thomson reuter 
revenue for enterprise value thomson reuters tri board approved the 
transaction this afternoon see press release here while the headline number very 
large value the equity check much smaller with the remaining 
consideration coming from debt financing along with ownership stake that tri 
will continue own 
the blackstone led consortium that includes sovereign wealth fund and pension fund 
will split the equity commitment could also see additional third party capital 
were syndicate portion this could potentially generate transaction fee revenue 
for blackstone believe this deal will done out blackstone bcp vii flagship 
private equity fund and estimate check from blackstone which equates roughly 
position the fund had available capital bcp vii 
according tri management relationship and dialogue began nearly years ago and 
conversations picked back over the summer 
see four strategic opportunities for blackstone harness 
the big data revolution 
reinvent mature data company 
see potential for blackstone create value providing new services such 
alternative data for existing customers growing new revenue pools expanding 
new customer sets and extracting cost savings 
thomson reuters has the existing customer base and under ownership see new 
offerings such web scraping alternative data and industry specific data that could 
support cross selling the existing customer base along with new customer growth 
this could reinvigorate old world data company and support topline acceleration 
from low single digits today mid single digits closer peers along with higher 
normalized ebitda margins from the low range mid 
tri has turned around revenue growth its business over the last few years from 
organic flat and and the company expects the new 
blackstone partnership able help accelerate growth see revenue growth 
the main driver upside valuation and could support multiple expansion althought 
likely not part blackstone underwriting criteria factset competitor saw 
growth and trades closer ebitda estimated that 
blackstone paid the transaction price 
believe that thomson has experimented with alternative data but unclear 
whether they have had success for example added news sentiment data and 
sentiment analysis twitter feeds its desktop product has coverage 
key kpis such data unique drugs across biotech pharma that 
said tri has among the weakest economic moats business services competitive 
products can often substituted new data services could differentiate the service 
peers 
cost savings initiatives likely available but focus growth from here tri has been 
cutting expenses for years expanding adj ebitda margins from 
mse through head count reductions data center consolidation and product 
rationalization see gradual margin expansion continuing the segment and 
expect revenue growth more the focus for value creation 
extract expertise insight that can enhance other portfolio 
companies 
blackstone has history plugging their portfolio companies into network 
vendors and experts help drive value creation the extent could help other 
portfolio companies with data data mining and usage see that low hanging fruit 
extract adjacent synergies 
also see the potential for blackstone combine with other portfolio 
companies the extent value enhancing however would difficult combine 
portfolio companies that sit different funds any potential conflicts interest 
would need resolved but portfolio company combinations are not outside the 
scope possibility 
create investment products strategies around alternative data 
such their hedge fund unit 
alpha will increasingly accrue persons with machines the discretionary investing 
world rather than those without new processes around machine learning and will 
have profound impact the investment process and the asset management 
landscape over the next decade our view it not man machine but rather about 
combining the two 
arms race underway for new and proprietary data feeds that could give investors 
edge growing use big data and machine learning will make data more valuable 
particularly proprietary data while there are questions around statistical significance 
see that double edged sword new data sets have limited historical information 
that may give quant investors hesitation see opportunity for active managers 
use their experience and intuition exploit market inefficiencies discretionary managers 
are likely more comfortable than quants without the crutch statistical significance 
hence see further value combining the two investment processes which our 
expectation over the next decade given the significant growth data see our note 
global asset management building the money manager tomorrow sep 
disrupt industries that current consensus thinking doesn 
anticipate 
see opportunities for blackstone enhance their tool kit with big data and 
order bring transformational change companies and industries era 
disruption across the economy creating winners and losers see blackstone current 
and future portfolio companies either risk being disrupted they can 
disruptor with nearly billion dry powder which leverage can applied 
the portfolio company level and enhanced with friendly investor capital suggests 
well over half trillion spending power blackstone has tremendous capital drive real 
change for companies including with transformative blackstone can harness the 
power big data and automation improve operational efficiencies and create new 
revenue pools see potential for blackstone act disruptor
