commodities super cycle fuelled investment and consumption but 
now facing burden adjustment lower real incomes 
stepping away from our usual month investment horizon

the next five ten years flag ten companies under our coverage that are well positioned benefit from these themes 
australia transition making the case for change 
years growth australia has delivered years robust gdp 
and earnings growth supported strong institutions commodity 
linkages the asian growth story structural rise household leverage good economic management and dose luck 
source australian bureau statistics abs reserve bank australia rba gillitzer and kearns 
morgan stanley research 
but three key tailwinds have reversed the outlook challenged 
the peak reversal the structural rise household leverage 
the commodity super cycle and the rise the oligopolies 
significant impact macro and micro outlook five tenyear view expect real gdp growth slow down below 
versus historical average consumption growth drop 
from and corporate earnings growth and 
profitability weaken 
leverage china china will remain key driver and risk national 
income given accounts for one third exports however while 
recovery china would help terms commodity revenues 
would not drive the economy through renewed mining capex cycle 
more importantly sustainable recovery china can only come from 
services consumption where australia does not have material competitive advantage other than tourism which address theme new export economy

index transition structural challenges will create longterm opportunities 
australia generally seen investors providing defensive 
growth australia accounts for the msci axj benchmark 
and has outperformed the region for out the past years the 
australian dollar top five traded currency and many its industries trade premium global peers 
but growth risk being diminished the risk for the australian equity market that the structural headwinds identified this 
report are not embraced and negotiated the public and private sectors the growth offer will threatened with risks earnings valuation and long term expected returns 
with direct challenges the largest industries identify the 
challenge directly posed resources banks general insurers and 
supermarkets the end the household leverage and commodity 
super cycles and peak oligopoly market power these themes will 
also result indirect headwinds aspects many other business

government policy makers and companies are generally aware 
the issues the five themes identified this report are not new and 
much has been written about them recent years the government 
and policy makers have started take into consideration some the 
issues raised this report the treasury intergenerational 
report australia addresses changing demographics and 
includes proposals better prepared the henry tax review 
focused major budget reform improve sustainability simplicity 
and competitiveness both federal and state governments have long 
argued over infrastructure needs and financing outlined infrastructure australia audit and infrastructure plan while work 
progressing quickly both the national broadband network nbn 
and the new payments platform npp however despite the awareness and progress far believe the risk that some the 
reports are underestimating the structural changes identified this 
report and their impact underlying economic growth and there 
has not been enough momentum terms execution especially 
many the recommended changes are politically sensitive 
but the risk underestimating the impact significant our 
view the risk the government policy makers industry bodies and 
companies not executing proactively and decisively some the 
necessary changes will significant for the australian economy 
equity markets and shareholder returns the macro level believe 
would drive lower gdp growth weaker fiscal position widening 
current account deficit and ultimately further currency weakness 
the equity level this would turn drive lower eps growth lower valuation multiples and higher risk good australian companies being 
taken over diminishing index returns for the australian market would 
make the market even more concentrated with less scope for outperformance and relevance for global investors superannuation flows 
would increasingly directed towards global markets increasing the 
cost capital for domestic corporates

introducing five structural themes 
have identified five structural themes that should embedded 
into the investment process when making investment decisions 
australia over the next five ten years the list not exhaustive but 
believe these themes will have the biggest direct impact equity 
markets other themes such social infrastructure reforms spanning health education and welfare and climate change are important for the broader economy and society but they have fewer direct 
equity implications while the other hand themes such non tech 
disruption and new competitors from international markets are 
industry and company specific that believe they are better covered the relevant analysts 
australian companies are increasingly likely pursue global 
expansion opportunities the domestic growth outlook slows and 
there are fewer opportunities for local market share gains acquisitions australian companies have mixed record offshore the market remains skeptical but identify clear potential benefits for 
shareholders

vocus poised benefit from the national broadband network 
rollout which will open the regional home market market which vocus communications does not compete today vocus

them rise further the rba has historically adjusted cash rates lean 
against margin trends both directions but has been reluctant

australian companies are increasingly likely pursue global 
expansion opportunities past efforts help identify the 
essential characteristics successful offshore strategy and the 
key reasons global expansion fails our view domino pizza 
dmp goodman group gmg and virtus health vrt stand out 
global expansion stories that offer material opportunity for 
investors 
global expansion increasingly likely 
australian companies have mixed record offshore the track 
record australian companies expanding offshore mixed with 
some significant success stories offset some high profile failures 
the successes have tended come from companies with unique 
market leading customer proposition and with the exception 
healthcare have been wide range industries contrast the 
biggest failures have often come from market leaders australia 
particular disappointing outcomes for companies which have thrived 
australia oligopolies such nab iag and amp had established highly successful domestic franchise and brand before venturing offshore fosters harvey norman toll billabong has created 
view many investors mind that australian companies are not good 
going offshore 
but global expansion looks increasingly likely despite the mixed 
track record and investor concern believe there are three key reasons why many australian companies will conclude that growth 
prospects australia are fading making them increasingly likely 
pursue offshore expansion 
lower domestic growth outlook with household debt elevated 
levels and the medium term fiscal outlook uncertain expect australia experience extended period sub trend growth domestic demand this will prove challenging for many large cap companies 
which have large domestic businesses and rely heavily the australian consumer accordingly expect that management teams will 
increasingly motivated look offshore for higher growth rates 
achieve above peer shareholder return potential and meet short term 
and long term performance incentives 
less scope for market acquisitions market share gains many 
australia largest industries have become more concentrated over the 
past decade limiting the opportunities for further consolidation 
market share gains that can meaningfully improve growth prospects 
fact think that the competition issues will limit domestic acquisition opportunities for the largest banks insurers supermarkets and 
energy retailers and that they are more likely lose than win market 
share over the next five years 
more intense competition australia from new entrants given the 
oligopolistic industry structures embedded the economy there are 
number industries that generate both high roes and high margins 
relative global peers think domestic incumbents will face competition from international businesses expanding into australia 
from new business models these excess returns are targeted are 
already seeing this unfold staples and discretionary retailing banking and insurance 
and there are clear benefits for shareholders think the decision 
accelerate existing offshore plans pursue new growth opportunities will motivated one more the potential benefits 
economies scale large offshore markets while the and european economies face both cyclical and structural challenges their size 
alone offers compelling opportunities for businesses that are able 
establish competitive advantage particular highlight that 
australian companies have been able establish large businesses 
relatively small segments 
favourable demographic and economic trends asia much has 
been written about australia proximity asia and the potential benefits the asian century while there considerable debate about 
china balancing and investors are focused the challenges for 
emerging markets asia continues offer the combination relatively large population with economic growth and immature industries 
higher valuation potential australian companies with credible offshore growth options have tended trade premium their 
domestic peers the broader australian market one reason for 
this has been that there can comparable peers other markets that 
trade higher multiples and provide benchmark for valuing the offshore opportunity another that investors may prepared value 
the blue sky potential offshore growth opportunity they see 
source ongoing upgrades 
diversification one the traditional motivations for expanding 
outside domestic market buffer the shocks that periodically 
hit individual countries regions while australia consistent economic performance over the past years has reduced the need for 
diversification emerging cyclical and structural challenges australia 
could mean that the benefits diversification for australian shareholders emerge 
form defence while companies should only offshore there 
viable business case for doing believe that becoming 
more likely that there will second order benefits for their domestic 
businesses increasingly global economy sees the potential for new 
entrants australia which means that lessons from offshore could 
actually help companies evolve their strategies form defence 
against new entrants 
key characteristics success 
conjunction with our industry analysts have identified australian 
companies that have established and sustained successful offshore 
expansion over the past years the list includes but not limited brambles cochlear csl james hardie macquarie group 
news corp ramsay healthcare resmed sonic healthcare and 
march 
rgan arch 
field these companies generate about more their earnings 
outside australia and have outperformed the asx over the past three 
five and ten years while they operate different industries and have 
expanded different geographies our analysis reveals number 
characteristics that are common most these companies accordingly feel that investors should use these five factors identify 
companies with the potential succeed the future argue that 
most companies that have succeeded offshore exhibit industry leading capability best practice and have chosen the right markets 
which expand however also think there are other factors investors can look for when evaluating the probability success 
best class capability and execution believe differentiated 
best class capability combined with good execution from strong 
management team results better customer relationships higher 
margins and stronger growth reducing the impact response from 
local competitors examples include westfield retail landlord 
amcor packaging csl blood plasma extraction sonic healthcare 
pathology rhc private hospitals and macquarie infrastructure 
funds management 
the right market and partners given the natural impediments 
for offshore start ups such front costs lack scale local competitors lack brand recognition and existing customers 
think identifying the right market partners and customers can prove 
the difference between success and failure for example westfield has 
been successful the because large fragmented market and 
westfield had existing relationships with retailers james hardie has 
identified states and regions the where the benefits fibre 
cement are most pronounced brambles and amcor continually leveraged their existing relationships with global consumer product companies enter new markets news corp identified the market 
where the customer was willing and able pay for television content 
innovation differentiation innovation differentiation allows 
company gain first mover advantage building scale and establishing customer relationships ahead local competitors thereby 
growing the addressable market and generating excess returns some 
examples that spring mind include brambles pallet pooling 
cochlear ear implants james hardie fibre cement and resmed 
sleep apnea treatment ongoing success requires the investment 
some these excess returns into further innovation 
scalable model core business our view execution risk significantly reduced where company takes successful domestic business and can establish market leading position with scale advantages 
offshore target market with similar characteristics contrast 
think the probability failure materially higher company has not 
proven that can dominate its home market expands offshore 
business that non core examples success include brambles pallet pooling amcor packaging mqg specialist infrastructure funds 
management news corp pay television and sonic healthcare 
pathology 
strategic leadership the identification structural change 
emerging global regional trends ahead offshore incumbents can 
underpin successful expansion the best example can think 
news corp which transformed itself from domestic newspaper business into global television business identifying the growth potential pay television and establishing number offshore beachheads other examples include westfield which predicted the growth 
retail shopping malls the expense the traditional corner shop

the next five ten years will similar those that have worked 
the past however think possible that new drivers success

have gained advantage over competitors has been via product

key reasons for failure 
investors can think many examples australian companies with 
successful domestic businesses that have failed their efforts 
expand offshore including amp bhp billabong fosters gpt iag 
national australia bank qbe rio tinto and toll while there are always 
company and industry specific factors our analysts have helped 
march 
rgan arch 
identify five key reasons for failure that are common across industries 
poor acquisitions our view the simplest way increase the probability failure make expensive acquisition the wrong time 
the cycle the most obvious examples recent years have resulted 
from turn the commodity cycle with rio acquisition alcan and 
bhp entry into the shale market springing mind while these 
companies had the capability operate the acquired businesses 
high purchase price near the peak the commodity price cycle led 
significant write downs similarly entry into particular market can 
undermined when the industry cycle different from australia such 
amp expansion into the life insurance market fosters entry 
into the wine market 
expansion non core business some australian companies have 
built strong track record australia but have chosen offshore 
completely different business and have failed because they didn 
have any competitive advantage understand the risks involved for 
example nab expanded mortgage servicing the when 
acquired homeside gpt ventured into german residential property 
toll moved into freight forwarding asia and more recently qbe 
entered range non traditional specialty lines including lenders placed crop insurance and argentinian workers comp 
different business model there have been instances australian 
companies expanding overseas the core line business but 
employing different business model for example iag entered the 
motor insurance market but chose acquire mono line player 
rather than entering diversified personal and commercial lines 
insurer similarly telstra first effort move offshore saw buy disruptor hong kong even though was incumbent australia 
and bbg entered the buying retail stores despite the fact that 
was wholesaler home 
strong competitors can think many instances where australian companies have struggled succeed because they have entered 
large national regional global markets with number strong 
competitors examples include nab banking billabong 
apparel retailing fosters the wine industry and toll freight forwarding more often than not the australian companies have been 
competitive disadvantage from the outset and have struggled 
compete with offshore incumbents they have lacked scale product 
differentiation brand strength customer relationships distribution 
management capability 
different industry characteristics australian companies have often 
expanded outside australia without fully understanding the differences between the domestic and offshore industries for example 
believe that amp misunderstood the implications product features 
the life insurance market hvn failed recognise the customer 
preference for markets rather than shopping malls asia ccl underestimated the cultural differences between indonesia and australia 
and iag entered the general insurance market where cover for 
bodily injury harm attached motor insurance

looking for 
with the exception news corp each the companies identified 
exhibit above which have track record successful global expansion still listed the asx our view these companies will continue grow their global businesses varying degrees and there 
may opportunities for further expansion however believe that 
these global expansion strategies are well understood investors 
and are relatively mature the purpose our analysis this report 
identify companies where the global expansion opportunity 
being ignored being materially underestimated while expect 
some growth from their offshore businesses the near term are

term recent research shows that offshore investment associated

and development the successful companies identified above are 
likely retain strong global presence but the growth outlook for 
some australia largest companies and industries looks constrained because they don have attractive offshore expansion opportunities the potential winners have identified choose not

are entering the fourth industrial revolution 
new wave technologies and their broadening diffusion are 
bringing about the fourth industrial revolution australia 
behind the innovation curve heightening the risk that australian 
companies will feel greater disruptive forces than international 
peers 
technological disruption can also enable new opportunities 
highlight aconex example australian company using 
disruptive technology create new markets 
why focus technological disruption 
technological improvement and its diffusion are accelerating 
developments across computing software materials biology energy 
artificial intelligence and robotics converge the application potential 
and capabilities these technologies result are broadening 
thereby lowering barriers entry and enabling new disruptive business models rapidly iterate and alter value dynamics 
australia concentrated corporate structure creates incentives for 
many the country largest industries resist these new models 
attempt protect established super normal profit pools they are 
therefore more likely disrupted than disrupt placing the 
underlying profit base much australia index weight asx 
under threat 
course disruption not zero sum game there will also winners present the australian equity market not rich with opportunity there only small set stand out examples such aconex 
who are benefiting from the use technology disrupt established 
industries that said australia has least recognised the challenge 
rejuvenated innovation framework under the current government 
suggests that greater set positive and potentially investible disruptive agents will emerge time 
are entering new age despite the broad scale disruptive 
technologies currently know them their apparent uniqueness 
and perceived cutting edge nature the vast majority represent the culmination now decades long technological trends 
source world economic forum 
instead are now entering new era potentially more radical 
change that believe will make the influence new technologies 
and their disruptive impact existing business models increasingly key component the investment decision process this next 
economic phase now perhaps optimistically being referred 
the fourth industrial revolution within corporate and academic circles this concept now mainstream with the topic the key theme

any given business model the fourth industrial revolution has the 
potential further hasten this process 
the general purpose horizontal nature many these new technologies for example advanced robotics will eventually make their 
impact nearly universal just technological developments such 
electricity have the past that now have many potentially 
transformational general purpose and specific vertical technologies converging once what could render this fourth revolution the 
most disruptive yet 
reflecting the scale dislocation that could confronting the economy the recent committee for economic development ceda

existing australian jobs will displaced emerging technologies

demographic changes and challenges are globally well understood much has been written about changing demographics ageing populations generational shifts and the negative impact that this 
will have economic growth social infrastructure spending and budgets this global issue and many argue that australia better positioned than many other countries given the steady and high flow 
working age and well qualified migrants offset the pressures from 
ageing population 
but the impact australia could easily underestimated 
reading the many key reports the issue believe there significant risk that the impact australia understated and based 
underlying assumptions economic growth job creation and wealth 
creation that are unrealistic given the structural changes highlighted 
section australia transition making the case for change this 
report consequently the current measures place boost economic growth sustain the current levels migration and fund the significant requirement for social infrastructure are not enough our 
view acknowledge that these are not easy problems fix bigger focus the spending gap and budget pressures could slow down 
the economic growth and job creation needed but the bottom line 
that the pro active management the government and policy makers 
will determine the impact how play this theme through equity

lower gdp growth the historical experiences japan and

growth the impact firstly through slower growth rate decline 
the working age population implying less availability labour 
secondly consumers typically defined those the non working 
age groups will account for rising share the population which 
means natural drawdown the level overall savings available 
the economy which turn will restrain investment levels thirdly total 
factor productivity growth also tends slow interestingly despite

change economic structure the shift from investment consumption and the diminishing the pool surplus labour highlighted before means will harder for government and policy 
makers invest job creation infrastructure and economic growth 
tightening labour markets will place upwards pressure wages

misallocation financial resources policy makers were 
underestimate the impact slowing gdp growth due weaker demographic trends and continue target unsustainably high gdp

stated offshore growth targets rather than the upside from 
additional store rollout new territories and new formats the 
global quick service restaurant qsr industry with track 
record expansion into new territories and upgrades rollout potential success should driven domino pizza best 
class qsr capability scalable business model and technological leadership see opportunity for offshore ebita 
reach almost which more than three times the 
group total 
what the offshore expansion opportunity 
new store targets new territories and possibly new format 
domino pizza has built the leading qsr business australia via the 
growth its domino pizza franchise over the past ten years has 
also demonstrated that its business model can successfully transferred offshore markets current guidance its network will grow 
stores across australia new zealand japan france germany 
belgium and the netherlands however see upside 
these targets well growth opportunities from new territories and 
new formats 
why think the company will successful 
seven reasons for success our view there are seven reasons why 
the offshore expansion can successful and material driver value 
creation has proven high return format international markets domino pizza has led the industry product digital and 
store design which are all skill sets that are transferable across geographies and formats expect excellent execution the global 
strategy given that senior management have store hands 
background the business scalable because capital light 
franchise model with competitive advantage driven scalable technology across increasingly aligned systems domino pizza has the 
strategic leadership maintain best class position the global 
pizza industry its track record highlights ability deliver

another qsr format 
how the company positioned versus global competitors 
performing well relative pizza hut domino pizza has

majority competitors within the pizza category are independents 
which are localised sub scale terms digital expertise and charge 
higher prices pizza hut the only competitor within chained 
pizza that meaningfully overlaps across multiple territories like domino pizza expanding internationally and opened new 
stores across countries however the territories where 
domino pizza overlaps with pizza hut the former consistently 
delivering stronger same stores sales growth considering potential 
competition for the pizza category from other qsr formats note 
that mcdonalds burger king hungry jacks kfc and subway all have 
meaningful scale across several domino pizza territories 
why the market currently under appreciating the 
opportunity 
current market value only captures stated targets acknowledge that domino pizza consensus multiple reflects 
its strong growth profile however would argue that captures the 
company stated long term goals rather than the additional upside 
opportunity from further store rollout existing geographies expansion into new territories and even development another successful 
qsr format 
how big the opportunity 
additional ebita opportunity versus group 
ebita using management targets estimate that 
offshore earnings could grow the group over the next five

potential for further upgrades long term store targets existing

long term target stores five year revenue cagr 
and ebit margins this implies that offshore ebita would grow 
almost from last year which equates

australian competitor monash mvf are the only two listed ivf companies globally that are looking expand offshore think there 
more potential upside from virtus health global strategy over the 
next five years given its strategy more advanced and focused 
developed countries with similar characteristics the australian ivf 
market the where virtus health looking pursue buy andbuild strategy the key competitors are care group and reproductive 
partnerships both unlisted while the regional clinical commissioning groups ccg are restricting ivf services owing funding constraints 
why the market currently under appreciating the 
opportunity 
little value attributed the global opportunity investors are

mark goodridge mark goodridge morganstanley 
vocus communications voc poised benefit from the 
national broadband network rollout which will open the 
regional home market market which vocus communications does not compete today vocus communications 
retail broadband prices are cheaper than those incumbent telstra which has allowed vocus win share metro 
areas and expect similar scenario regional markets 
estimate this regional share gain could generate 
ebitda equivalent consensus estimates see the nbn opportunity underwriting 
super normal returns through vocus communications broader 
transition vertically integrated telco over the next three 
five years which expect would also feature corporate share 
gains and above guidance revenue and cost synergies 
what the opportunity 
think the nbn will underwrite regional market share gains 
accelerating vocus transformation into major integrated telco 
vocus communications has about retail broadband market share 
and the nbn rolled out believe vocus communications well 
positioned win portion the regional market 
homes which telstra has about market share the broader 
growth story for vocus communications includes the opportunity 
take corporate market share extract vertical integration benefits from 
its merger with mtu and utilise balance sheet optionality 
why think the company will successful 
vertical integration provides sustainable cost advantages while 
nbn removing telstra infrastructure monopoly regional 
broadband today telstra has monopoly retail broadband infrastructure with providers needing rent tls infrastructure provide broadband service customers the post nbn world all 
providers will rent the infrastructure from the nbn and hence telstra 
will lose its infrastructure advantage and therefore lose market share 
particularly regional areas also see telstra losing corporate market share vocus communications based the results alphawise survey july august australian businesses with 
annual revenues from less than over this survey 
provides clear evidence that vocus communications very good 
position win market share recognized price leader plac 
believe the market under appreciating this nbn opportunity 
because vocus communications has recently merged with mtu 
hence the focus the short term integration and merger benefits 
believe there are significant merger cost synergies with 
versus guidance but also highlight 
the nbn opportunity longer term driver for this company 
how big the opportunity 
regional nbn market share wins the nbn rolls into regional 
areas expect vocus communications win nbn subs tls has 
about regional market share and vocus communications does 
not compete this market today vocus communications were 
win regional share subs this could generate 
ebitda equivalent consensus 
estimates assuming per month arpu ebitda margins 
corporate market share gains forecast vocus communications increase its corporate market share from over the 
next two years and gaining the mtu sales force should accelerate this 
growth estimate that for every change share this represents change about ebitda 
mtu merger synergies the cost side vocus communications 
has announced synergies released from the 
merger with mtu however believe the vertical integration benefits 
this merger could see approximately further synergies 
released this period also identify revenue synergies the 
merger can halve mtu industry high retail broadband churn 
back the industry average adding ebitda per 
annum 
what are the key risks 
telstra engaging price based competition vocus communications set win both corporate and regional retail broadband market share from telstra hence the biggest risk telstra was move 
away from its current asian growth strategy refocus the domestic 
market and engage price based competition stem share loses 
not expect this occur this would value destructive for 
the industry including tls existing customer base and telstra has

drivers the vendor side including the changing landscape distribution the increasing cost distribution for smaller hoteliers and the 
increasing importance inbound tourism demand the medium

record delivering value enhancing consolidation has developed scalable operating systems has significant competitive 
advantage through its res central reservation system distribution terms inventory and yield management well structurally lower average cost distribution and has australiacentric investment focus compared with other participants whose 
main operations are based out asia good cash generation and 
strong balance sheet combined with increasing exposure vendors 
which means the driving seat for further consolidation 
new china demand for tourism and structural tailwind our view 
there are six main reasons why australia well positioned capitalise 
march

the strong outbound demand china the increasing disposable income china urban consumers australian dollar depreciation making australia more attractive international destination 
relaxed visa restrictions and government initiatives further streamline the visa approval process lower oil price driving the reduction the cost international flights the aggressive capacity 
additions chinese carriers into australia the fact that australia 
multicultural country and the fact that flight time relatively 
attractive compared with other western destinations 
exhibit 
how mantra group could become australia largest accommodation provider 
why the market currently underappreciating the 
opportunity 
current multiple reflects return new rooms per 
annum while historical context mantra group and 
ebit consensus estimates appear elevated would 
argue that given the rate consolidation the momentum within the 
business and the potential for further consolidation the current valuation materially underestimates the medium term opportunity backing 
out our estimate the ebit contribution per new room believe the 
market forecasting return the historical new rooms

estates able capture higher margin have greater control over 
inventory and able widen its distribution base considerably the 
chinese wine market the largest consumption and the 
largest imports the world hence the opportunity considerable 
while earnings forecasts have risen for treasury wine estates asian 
business think that the current month forward consensus 
multiple doesn adequately reflect this opportunity given 
treasury wine estates underpenetrated compared with global peers 
feel that should trade premium multiple 
how big the opportunity 
treasury wine estates could triple its asia profitability

think that the opportunity for treasury wine estates should 
increase its market share from treasury 
wine estates significantly underpenetrated china compared with 
other developed markets like thailand hong kong singapore and 
japan where has market share should share increase 
believe that treasury wine estates would need start selling lower 
price point wines which generate lower profits per case hence our 
analysis factors reduction profit per case 
what are the key risks 
key risks believe that treasury wine estates exposed the following risks consumer preferences shifting away from wine 
retailers and distributors using their power crimp trading margins 
macroeconomic slowdown where consumers shift their preferences lower value wine and appreciation the australian dollar 
exhibit 
value australian alcoholic beverage exports the 
value exports has risen the australian dollar has depreciated 
strength across brands distribution and execution treasury wine 
estates has strong brand portfolio that has long heritage including 
brands such penfolds wolf blass lindemans chateau jean and 
beringer sources grapes across australia new zealand the and 
italy which provides geographic diversification and within countries 
from range areas further increasing diversification management 
change over the past few years has increased the level focus sales 
and marketing functions drive improved commercial outcomes and 
better direct product more profitable markets lower australian 
dollar provides significant tailwind given that earnings are 
generated offshore and australian wine moving back into favour

disrupting traditional construction management processes 
displacing non integrated legacy systems improve accountability and deliver value the largest player the industry 
and has strong pedigree existing customers the network

online collaboration software across the global industry 
believe this market has the potential grow more than six 
times over the next years result aconex could generate 
additional ebitda around above levels 
what the opportunity 
specialist collaborative software disrupting disconnected paper 
email and internal systems believe aconex can become the standard platform for construction collaboration and workflow globally 
displacing traditional inefficient non integrated systems its differentiated neutral offering with which all users paying and nonpaying 
control their own data scalable multi tenant saas platform currently engages users about major projects australia 
however fewer than construction projects globally use any 
online collaboration system see opportunity for aconex 
become the connected industry standard and much larger global 
business providing more than six times upside current sales with 
scope take share add new products monetize the non paying user 
base and put through meaningful like for like price increases 
why think the company will successful 
best class product aconex has created product that can handle huge flows data onto the system and back users each the 
users has their own terms service not just the paying customer this 
neutrality creates confidence willingness engage and truly collaborative solution across the entire network paying and non paying 
given the collaborative nature the product expect small numbers players dominate the global market the long term winner takes most aconex the largest and best resourced these 
players and likely successful given its track record relative

offices countries and volumes data generated single projects that exceed some their competitors entire ecosystem and its 
product expenditure industry leading 
true collaboration and real network effects you work almost 
any capacity project that selects aconex you become user 
choice however alluded above you also become non paying 
customer and receive strong customer experience and develop 
familiarity with the product this creates real network effects for example government might select aconex contractor may then use 
and take for all projects result that initial exposure the 
contractor developer clients may then adopt too after first being

why the market currently underappreciating this 
opportunity 
disruption opportunity understood but undervalued offshore 
aconex trades consensus sales multiple and offshore revenues account for the group total successful offshore expansion clearly already being anticipated the market 
however would argue that this opportunity undervalued given 
the relative size the global construction market compared with that 
australia consensus was significantly below recent long term revenue guidance with offshore growth the key driver the upside surprise think this pattern will continue and see scope for material 
top line surprises aconex achieves both globally dominant position and the penetration online collaboration tools grows 
how big the opportunity 
truly transformational opportunity the global construction market turns over trillion per annum which aconex sees its 
addressable market the revenue growth opportunity 
available aconex simply from increasing the penetration its product the construction industry potentially transformational 
assume global construction activity grows per annum and collaborative cloud software penetration increases from around currently 
ten years time and aconex grows this industry rate 
estimate aconex revenue would grow over the period further assuming that aconex could lift its group ebitda margin 
line with that currently achieved australia ebitda would rise

believe aveo group offering premium retirement living 
solutions that allow the elderly release capital from the family 
home and obtain care services expect the addressable market increase substantially because the ageing population 
and see potential for the penetration rate over 
increase more line with that new zealand and the 
aveo significant development pipeline and capability allow the 
company benefit from this increase demand and positions 
aveo group increase its market share from currently 
estimate aveo group should able generate 
additional ebitda which more than double the reported 
group levels 
what the opportunity 
four key drivers deliver strong growth over the long term 
there significant opportunity for growth earnings from four key 
drivers first the addressable market over the average entry 
age and the average age residents will grow substantially 
owing ageing population second see opportunity for the 
retirement penetration rate measured the percentage over use this measure compare with offshore markets grow from 
the current australia closer that new zealand which 
about the even higher about the elderly are 
attracted the care offering and they use this product way 
release capital from the family home this will more common 
aged pensions means testing the value the family home 
potentially loosened relieve pressure the public purse third 
see opportunity for aveo increase its market share above the current approximately predominantly through developments meet 
increasing demand finally expect the dmf deferred management fee capital gains margin increase from leaving 
residents are the more favourable contracts created this does not account for the higher fee aveo way contracts that were

development ryman targeting five villages melbourne 
while stockland reassessing its strategy retirement with 
little other investment the industry believe aveo group can continue increase its market share 
integrated care offering retirement villages have historically been 
invested and constructed property developers australia who 
focus the rental income aveo now purely focusing retirement 
and adopting strategy that integrates care services offer residents place for the remainder their lives the company acquisition freedom care february supports this shift 
furthermore believe retirement becoming the logical place 
offer low medium levels care for the elderly aged care nursing 
homes are increasingly positioned end life care offering the 
average tenure aged care now about years this integratedcare strategy has been very successful for new zealand operators 
ryman and summerset and see reason why this would not

uses nta anchor for the share price which result fairly 
poor return capital historically believe the focus nta does 
not reflect the improving return assets that the company targeting the profit generated from completing

how big the opportunity 
quantifying the opportunity from each the four key drivers discussed above allows assess the size the opportunity 
over this period expect the addressable market over grow 
people believe the retirement penetration rate 
can potentially grow from percentage over 
from over which still about below the 
new zealand rate and see further opportunities over the longer 
term also expect aveo group market share position increase 
about assuming aveo group develops new 
units per annum from and the total number retirement places 
grows per annum places per annum again there further upside over the longer term finally assume the dmf margin increases from currently residents leave more 
favourable contracts that are already place
