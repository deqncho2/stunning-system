executive summary 
bottom line view orange bank credible new entrant the combination 
banking licence strong parent balance sheet support growth trusted brand and 
existing customer network position for success achieving targets million 
customers and revenues however suggests risks the existing 
french bank revenue pool manageable but combined with range other online offerings including the other orange bank ing chipping away profitable 
niches consumer loans insurance fees further ratcheting the pressure reinvest 
for digital incumbents response see domestic profit targets challenged 
cut eps estimates for french banks undemanding valuations 
limit downside however remain positive bnp where diversification benefits 
mitigate 
digital disruption assess risks from new entrants and challengers our new 
analysis adds previous work the digital shift banking and implications for banks 
lower cost serve mobile should think lead efficiencies for the industry over 
time though the pace this shift varies banks are already enjoying the benefits 
fte and branch reduction for example boa consumer divisions has seen cagr 
reduction costs top line cagr which compares french bank retail 
units cagr top line essentially flat costs over the same period the challenge 
from here that the recovery top line given the combination lower for longer rates 
and competitive pressures building will not allow the french banks the air cover 
deliver the digital agenda whilst also driving the hoped for improvement cost 
efficiency 
the combination banking licence balance sheet trust and technology data make 
orange bank more credible threat hitherto have argued that the hurdles trust 
client acquisition network and brand were significant barriers new entrant success 
banking heavily regulated industry however the launch orange bank november 
owned orange groupama combines the established network 
customers orange france technology savy and brand orange with 
banking licence via groupama orange willing invest quite heavily its banking arm 
mse opfcf losses individual subsidy per new sub 
moreover note that french tmt consumers are more open than european peers adopting new technologies pay smart phones tvoverdsl etc this suggests 
more significant threat orange looking lower churn via banking telco churn for banks estimate that the efcf benefit for orange group could 
they sell banking significant portion french subscribers 
orange bank and online peers pose threat the recovery thematic french retail 
banking for key incumbents the narrative top line inflection prepayment 
drag moderates and reinvestment pressures ease given gradually rising rates had driven 
our cautiously optimistic view outlook for french retail see from headwinds 
tailwinds august particularly given the strong growth lending france 
particularly corporate source positive revision risk for whilst 
expect inflection for french retail revenues and remain encouraged volume 
growth dynamics france the shape recovery now challenged not only more 
uncertain rate normalisation path see delay rate hikes keep preference for self help 
may but the emergence credible new entrants the french market who 
can chip away top line growth whilst pressuring incumbents accelerate investment 
plans address the digital transformation 
competition not new the other orange bank ing has been the market for 
years competition online banking has existed for some time ing entered the french 
market years ago since when has grown its client base million customers with 
customer deposits however progress growing the asset side the 
balance sheet has been more modest part hampered the specifics the french 
mortgage market for example mortgages with guarantees via the credit 
logement ing view the million customer level threshold where scale and brand 
awareness become mutually reinforcing moreover they develop their partnership 
with axa distribute its insurance product and product development costs 
become more efficient under their model bank concept products for challenger 
markets developed and rolled out across combined million clients across international 
markets they expect become more active broader retail offering consumer 
loans mortgages 
but changing regulations and customer behaviour increase odds success and 
orange bank has banking licence growing usage mobile apps and improving 
technology regulations moving towards open banking helping level the 
playing field for new entrants are clearly moving favour increasing competition 
range other new entrants and line challengers revolut ing direct 
alongside orange bank are adding the pressures for incumbents 
the combined effect new entrants and the response function incumbents that 
drives the risk profits rather than orange alone reality the economics implied 
orange even assuming success based our proprietary model for orange bank 
not suggest significant risk the incumbents estimate market share build 
retail deposits and consumer loans however when combined with 
possible resurgence other challengers ing leverages its model bank 
approach better scale product across international markets and others such 
revolut eating into profitable niches the industry such insurance and other 
fees think risks become more meaningful moreover with growth customers 
almost entirely driven line offers for incumbents and new entrants alike the risks 
cannibalisation lowering revenue capture branch based customers increases for 
incumbents 
cost service mobile should lower lot lower longer term shouldn banks 
see better profitability argued see banking the speed light january 
per below exhibit that the cost serve mobile banking customers should materially 
lower than customers branches dbs argue that digital customers have lower 
cost income ration for branch customers and drive roe higher 
than the latter driving cost efficiencies clients migrate hence the correlation between 
increased mobile banking penetration and lower cost income per below however 
think that for number european markets the slower uptake mobile app usage 
and other challenges priorities for the banks the post crisis period litigation penalties 
addressing non core npls negative rates etc have meant that this investment process 
has been delayed the risk then that ratchet higher new entrant pressure top 
line could coincide with accelerating cost investments leading profit squeeze

also assume that investment requirements will remain elevated incumbents 
respond the threat from online new entrants limiting the hoped for operating 
leverage although this suggests risks more the realm sand the wheels rather 
than game changer for the banks assume orange bank offering secondary 
bank rather than primary offering limiting scope and products offered would watch 
carefully for growing traction and for any signs extending more aggressively across 
current accounts mortgages and broader product offering note for example that 
orange bank will generate ebitda free cash flow 
post dividends simplistically assuming allocation ebitda post 
dividend free cashflow could garner further million clients based the current sign 
bonuses extending balance sheet via loans would clearly require more investment 
but would not rule this out depending progress from here

behavioral and regulatory changes 
the online retail banking market france has been developing strong pace over 
the past few years and expect this trend strengthen going forward albeit 
representing only less than the retail banking market france online banks 
represent more than the new bank account openings banque france this 
migration online banking mainly driven local behavioral and regulatory changes 
the customer behavioral change well evidenced the french banking 
association yearly survey which continue observe increasing use online 
banking customers access online accounts online 
payments online transfers information products and 
services going forward expect this digital shift amplify think 
will supported the following factors 
stronger willingness see online banking services further developed opposed 
physical relationship branches still according the fbf survey when asked 
about what ideal banking means french people considers that means 
fewer branches and more online services versus 
strong attractiveness online banks versus traditional banks offering the 
former offers almost all basic banking services free charge whereas the latter 
keeps increasing banking fees banking fees per customer were 
versus panorabank etudes 
recent regulatory changes have also introduced new dynamic the french retail 
banking market competition has been strengthened with loi mobilite bancaire which 
facilitates and eliminates switching costs for french customers though not 
observe significant increase the churn rate for now furthermore the loi 
dematerialisation gives the same degree legal recognition digital 
contractualization and online signature paper contractualization 
expect this trend strengthen over the coming years 
orange bank new entrant big aspirations 
background 
orange bank was launched during november france the new entrant offers

online digital banking vast majority banking services are free charge 
mobile payments directly via orange bank with apple pay 
bank cards visa orange bank offers free withdrawals across the eurozone 
secure online transfers including via sms

with its large loyal french telco subscriber base lend realising decent commercial 
traction with its new mobile banking service indeed some orange bank 
accounts were opened over weeks the end subs present mse this initial success comes surprise french consumers tend embrace new 
technologies and disruptors with open arms see below 
the orange bank launch france follows sustained online banking push the

oranger bank distribution being expanded include both groupama and gan

expect premium banking credit card offers made available soon this 
premium product would more line with orange position segment the 
telco market quality high end 
orange plans offer its customers home mortgages some point the future although take this product remains significant question mark 
very interestingly orange bundling telco and bank subscriber acquisition costs

believe the nature orange bank investments will change over the coming years 
initial spend will developing systems distribution marketing etc 
however once systems shave been built expect that orange will focus spend 
more subsidy and customer acquisition 
targeting lower churn 
believe that key objective for orange launching its banking platform tie 
customers into the orange ecosystem and thus lower churn and default subscriber 
acquisition costs orange push into convergent services was successful achieving 
this enhance loyalty lower churn banking particularly sticky business notably 
mobile telcos 
estimate that churn orange mobile customer base averages contract 
and prepaid blended 
fixed line churn broadband triple play subs 
interestingly believe that fixed mobile convergent churn open love 
customers are far more sticky than single play double play triple play subs 
orange has successfully migrated its french broadband and contract 
mobile base these packages 
interestingly our estimates suggest that banking migration rates are this 
figure suggests scope for orange lower its churn even further

french consumers typically welcome new entrants and products 
orange bank new entrant disruptor 
orange entering the financial services market new player and disruptor 
believe that the telco well positioned given its retail network distribution via 
stores brand name and how receptive french consumers are new players 
the french consumer typically embraces new technology 
recent history shows that the typical french consumer notably the tmt space 
very forward looking and often takes new technologies very quickly illustration 
pay pay penetration took off very quickly france the early mid 
far faster than other countries western europe driven the success 
canal 
smartphones the french consumer was among the very first embrace the new 
phenomenon smartphones post the launch htcs spv handset early 
far earlier than the launch iphone 
tvodsl france was one the pioneer countries markets for over dsl 
technology 
and disruptors 
believe that french consumers embrace new players and disruptors nowhere this 
more evident than telcoland embodied iliad success 
iliad entered the french fixed line telco market offering consumers tripleplay services for just per month the new entrant has since gathered 
impressive market share 
iliad subsequently launched its mobile offering early the new entrant has 
since gathered market share french sims just years 
orange has challenger mentality 
while orange the incumbent french telco operator state owned french 
government still owns stake and unchallenged market leader french 
telcos believe that orange does have challenger mentality certain fields 
illustration orange disruptor spain via its orange jazztel amena 
brands 
orange has also launched challenger discount telco brand france namely 
sosh 
orange positioned sell banking services its large base 
client base scale security trust 
orange has very large captive subscriber base cross sell potential 
orange france has many deep telco subscriber relationships including 
contracted mobile subscribers and particular 
convergent customers taking fixed and mobile subscribers single 
contract these subscribers are particularly sticky low churn loyal orange and 
could perhaps look buy more products off orange 
these deep relationships could enable orange cross sell banking services its 
existing telco services 
security and trust are key 
clearly online security and consumer trust are critical success factors the banking 
sector our view that orange ticks both boxes 
believe that orange enjoys reputation trust among french consumers 
why this trust driven its long term established nature household name exfrench state ownership best network reputation etc indeed believe that the 
orange brand particularly valuable 
consider that the high security features offered sim card technology 
coupled with orange expertise security largely via its enterprise arm give 
orange reputational advantage for selling banking services 
micro transactions first but could orange bank have bigger 
aspirations 
orange bank secondary banking relationship first 
believe that orange bank may primarily act secondary bank account for many 
its customers 
customers may use orange bank for large number small transactions small 
loans almost like working capital bank for the consumer but 
retain larger bank such bnp paribas for the bulk its banking 
services primary bank for large loans mortgages etc 
going forward see interesting read across iliad mobile offering 
iliad aimed convert secondary sims primary sims 
when iliad launched its mobile service france offered two very different wireless 
packages 
per month package and 
more comprehensive per month offer unlimited voice sms and large 
bucket data 
believe the offer was primarily taster the product was designed 
secondary telco product whereby the mobile customer would use iliad sporadically 
but retain their primary sim with incumbent operator such orange bouygues 
tel 
however the iliad aim has been convert subs subs that iliad would 
ultimately become the customer primary service provider iliad has been reasonably 
successful with this strategy since 
believe there could interesting read across orange bank where over time 
orange financial offering could emerge the customer primary banking tool 
more service are added trust security built further 
orange bank has real competitive advantage capturing 
shifting customers versus incumbents 
orange bank can easily leverage off orange significant telco client base 
develop its market share the online retail banking market orange clients 
and potentially the groupama insurance network base

risk recovery narrative for french retail for french banks see risks that the 
onset more intense competition could coincide with the point which positive 
inflection french retail revenue and profitability was anticipated given the skew 
french retail within group which highest soc gen group revenues and 
profits believe that risks multiple contraction limit multiple expansion 
looks most worrisome here 
although orange bank not any means the first challenger the large domestic 
banking incumbents ing which launched france had group exposure 
france end view the interplay regulations facilitating new 
entrants allowing them access bank customer data with well funded well 
known brand with strong technology offering and existing french client footprint 
credible threat 
new players like orange bank widen the competitive gap with 
traditional banks offerings

well maintain competitive pressure incumbents new 
online digital offerings 
have performed comparison analysis assess the attractiveness orange bank 
existing offering versus french banks existing online offers turns out that orange 
bank has the most competitive offer the services currently offered reflecting its 
strong customer acquisition strategy orange bank and other new entrants will exercise 
continuing competition pressure and such will prevent french banks from adjusting 
their online offer pricing upwards 
exhibit orange bank product offering more competitive than traditional french banks

what for banks reinforcing cost reinvestment pressure 
correlation between app usage and lower cost income suggests opportunity have 
previously argued see banking the speed light january that the 
correlation between cost income efficiency and banking mobile app usage suggest 
opportunity for cost improvement over time for markets such france italy and 
germany where digital adoption has progressed slower pace relative markets 
such the nordics 
but pace and cost transformation impacted client behaviour and labour law 
flexibility inter alia however have also noted that the ability benefit from digital 
transformation likely long dated for number european banks including the 
french see the challenge for french banks fourfold 
banks can only move the pace their client base cost reduction initiatives 
have managed reflect the fact that revenues from french 
retail are generated customers years age this demographic continue 
value face time with advisors and branches unhelpfully for the banks 
demanding clientele want both improved digital offerings but continued access 
branch driven advice such even where identified opportunities for branch 
rationalisation our previous research see french banks long road 
efficiency sept expect that cost benefits will long dated nature 
some costly payment practices are unlikely change the near term france 
check payments are frequent and represent around the total payments 
france and circa the eurozone total check payments banque france 
cashing check cost heavy for bank hence online banking could viewed 
real cost saving opportunity however reducing the number check payments 
would require both real change customer behaviors well legal actions 
which could only happen the long run 
labour laws constrain action although macron has moved increase labour 
flexibility the ability reduce costs remains constrained relative anglo saxon 
markets where flexibility greater this part helps explain why boa able 
consistently deliver reduced ftes and branches its retail bank quarter

gen they more rationalise branch footprints 
technology costs remain significant headwind near term and ongoing 
investment needs digital remain significant for the french banks

under pressure update legacy infrastructure the main back bone the

help trusted entrants compete core banking 
have previously argued that could pose risk the incumbents when looking 
the established card payment infrastructure however have argued that the 
challenge for new entrants pisps payment initiation services providers the case 
the payments space was that the combination trust brand and network would 
represent significant hurdle overcome order disrupt the incumbents and drive 
meaningful shift business away from them see holding the networks

nutshell 
new directive that amongst many other changes forces banks share account data with authorised 
parties opening bank data facilitates two new services payments via direct transfer from the 
customer bank account the merchant parties providing account information and aggregation 
services account holders 
until this year and prior the level churn bank customers and bank 
accounts has been extremely low reflecting investor stickiness and the limited 
opportunity for other players access account data better inform product offers 
making the data available under the possibility exists for new entrants prize 
away customers the large incumbent banks 
have generally explored this risk the payments space see holding the 
networks account though see having broader relevance over time should 
new entrant apps develop sufficient functionality use the data gleaned from 
incumbents offer more compelling product offerings the loan and deposit side 
gdpr general data protection regulation which became effective from may 
providers potential counterbalance this requires consumers give specific consent 
for their personal data shared making extremely expensive should data 
breaches occur new rules call for companies report breaches within hours and the 
introduction fines global revenues for non compliance likely raise 
barriers new entrants 
expect become fully effective france the french banks 
launched joint initiative propose the best solution for connecting third party 
providers tpps and the account service payment providers the end they 
decided build open api propose strong secure resilient and standardised 
solution for connecting tpps and banks this api will developed french banks and 
expected implemented and fully effective september following this 
deadline the payment market france will open new players and hence 
competition will strongly enhanced expect french banks develop further their 
payment services offering position retain their market share versus new 
rivals 
exhibit morgan stanley fintech framework see the combination accommodating 
regulation increasing digital penetration banking and client willingness churn 
increasing the potential for success for well funded new entrants with combination technology
