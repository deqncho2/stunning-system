modest underperformance over the last several months markets have flipped 
from the deflationary environment that characterized much clear 
reflation trend with rates rising inflation expectations moving higher and 
cyclical risk outperforming while this environment should benefit financials 
unlike the equity market bank credit has not outperformed late discuss 
some reasons for this modest underperformance from heavy supply the 
prospects lighter regulation come 
stabilization regulation while uncertainty clearly high walk through 
specific changes that could impact investors the months come high 
level the potential for financial deregulation certainly risk credit investors 
while much more positive for bank equities however though expect 
lighter regulatory touch predominantly through leadership changes the 
various regulatory agencies not anticipate meaningful legislative changes 
for banks the near term the end the day credit quality may 
approaching plateau but the starting point strong 
still favor fins continue see financials better risk reward than nonfinancials now trading roughly similar spread levels our view financials 
will not the center the next credit cycle and should trade well tight 
non fins when credit markets turn bigger way think bank cds looks 
attractive relative cdx and would lighten financial prefs due 
rich valuations lastly end presenting framework for valuing callable

introduction 
most our regular readers are aware our generally cautious view credit markets 
first with respect the new administration washington believe the market 
optimism that characterized the post election rally about meet policymaking reality 
see public policy reality bites jan second think the macro backdrop 
will become less benign for credit markets the fed withdraws liquidity both through 
rate hikes this year and shrinking its balance sheet shortly thereafter see 
economics strategy the fed balance sheet jan third our view 
fundamentals are challenged and the cycle its final chapter and lastly valuations 
are quite rich any way look the data 
however while many our notes this year have focused the challenges come 
this week provide our updated views bright spot financials short 
maintain our preference for fins over non fins the fundamental picture financials 
remains strong contrast with most other sectors track think financials will 
not the center the next credit cycle and such should trade well inside 
non fins when credit markets turn bigger way addition while financials are not 
cheap absolute terms and certainly not immune from market volatility think the 
risk reward fins attractive relative the alternatives trading nearly top 
the broader index 
more specifically the report that follows look into recent financial performance 
update our views the sector and detail our thoughts potential regulatory changes 
come 
financials lag the broader market 
begin looking into the recent performance financials absolute terms and 
relative the broader index over the last several months markets have flipped from 
the deflationary environment that characterized much clear reflation 
trend rates have risen inflation expectations have moved higher and cyclical risk has 
outperformed our house view that this reflation trade will continue for some time 
but investors will want fade some point later for details see 
global strategy outlook sparkle and fade nov theoretically this 
environment should benefit financials big way higher net interest margin nim 
driven higher rates well stronger loan growth from corporate capex should 
lead better net interest income nii addition capital markets businesses could see 
stronger transaction volumes and credit quality would likely remain healthy 
bank stocks have responded accordingly but somewhat surprisingly financial credit has 
underperformed show below

what explains the modest underperformance financial credit first technicals are 
one possibility least focusing the last month our historical data indicates that 
financials typically outperform january excess return terms but financial supply 
has been particularly heavy with issued january versus the 
january average since 
exhibit financial issuance has been particularly heavy

second optimism better growth come may simply having disproportionate 
benefit non financial corporates non financials fundamentals deteriorated most 
this cycle and non fins especially energy sold off hardest through february last 
year result they had the most credit risk price out broad rally driven 
rising economic optimism similar what have seen over the past year 
third investors may anticipating higher credit risk for financials going forward part 
given expectations less stringent regulatory environment these explanations could 
account for some the outperformance financial stocks particular 
think all three explanations have likely had some impact financial 
underperformance 
will discuss financial regulation bit more detail the next section but short 
with respect the points mentioned above our view regulation may ease modestly 
going forward especially regulatory heads change which the margin benefits 
bank equities over credit however given the very healthy level for capital and liquidity 
and the odds that regulatory changes are incremental and net positive for earnings 
don think investors are should pricing meaningfully higher credit risk given 
potential policy changes the more transformative proposals would require 
congressional action amidst busy legislative agenda and opposition from senate 
democrats with the aca and tax reform seemingly the priorities for now see 
election senate control key sep would point out that modest loosening 
regulatory requirements certainly does not mean return the pre crisis era with 
the entire regulatory framework much stronger today 
terms broader fundamentals trends continue note that the starting point 
strong see investment grade research back banks jun capital levels for 
the largest six banks have increased from after the financial crisis 
addition asset quality and liquidity are both much stronger 
exhibit bank capital levels remain very strong 
average ratio largest banks 
exhibit banks have tightened credit conditions deeper into 
the cycle 
senior loan officer survey 
tightening lending standards

that said credit quality likely approaching plateau with banks having met their postcrisis capital requirements and the ccar bar more stable over time addition while 
asset quality remains credit positive with npls and ncos near cycle lows our 
bank analysts expect credit costs increase through chargeoffs normalize from 
historical lows see large cap banks outlook keep your motor running dec 
finally while lighter regulation could drive stronger loan growth based the 
senior loan officer survey exhibit note modest tightening lending standards 
certain areas over the past year this trend could signal late cycle environment 
where banks begin respond weaker credit quality certain pockets markets 
tightening the spigot modest degree hence see some reasons argue that 
the fundamental and regulatory backdrop may become less supportive for banks the 
margin however again given the starting point financial credit quality still seems far 
healthier than most non financial sectors and much less prone broader turn the 
cycle 
changing regulatory landscape 
thinking about financial regulation more detail the next section assess expected 
changes come the regulatory front well potential implications for banks 
addition briefly discuss the final tlac rule issued late last year 
the wake the republican sweep the potential for financial regulatory reform has 
become hotly debated topic the plans which have been publicly released and 
discussed the incoming administration haven yet been spelled out legislative 
language detailed proposals while the republican platform ratified during the 
convention calls for repeal dodd frank our view that full repeal unlikely 
and that there are two areas incremental change focus those that new 
leadership the key regulatory agencies can drive and minor tweaks dodd frank 
which have chance surviving filibuster from senate democrats 
our policy strategists have noted see public policy reality bites jan 
that tax reform and the aca obamacare are likely dominate the early days 
trump administration this leaves legislative action financial regulation the back 
burner note our colleagues government relations believe financial services reform 
legislation may drift into however this does not mean that other changes can 
happen sooner but just that they would occur more through regulatory 
appointments least initially our financials equity research team has also written 
about the potential impact these regulatory changes see large cap banks rising 
nim lifts earnings boats buy citi for capital return feb given their estimate 
that large cap banks have excess capital and their expectation for lighter 
touch regulation they expect gross payout ratios increase from post 
ccar post ccar 
thinking about potential changes come below walk through some the specifics 
starting with the few proposals far from house republicans course reiterate 
that uncertainty high and the details will clearly change along the way 
assessing the gop proposals 
the two critical gop proposals financial regulatory reform are jeb hensarling 
financial choice act fca and paul ryan better way plan the plans have 
number similarities both try limit the authority the fsoc designate nonbank 
sifis both address the cfpb structure and funding and importantly for credit both 
envision changes title dodd frank the section which created orderly liquidation 
authority for the resolution failed sib this last piece could have significance for 
credit markets changing the recovery prospects the event failure sib 
addition the features common with the better way plan the fca also includes 
off ramp provision for banks opt out basel capital standards they maintain 
leverage ratio almost double the current levels for sibs therefore not very 
attractive option for the larger banks however this could make sense for some card 
companies that already have higher leverage ratio lastly repeals the volcker rule 
durbin amendment and compensation rules well blocks the implementation 
the department labor fiduciary rule 
upcoming changes regulatory heads can powerful 
turning more immediate matters significant changes can come with different 
leadership the regulatory agencies even without any changes the dodd frank act 
itself assuming mnuchin confirmed treasury secretary expect series 
regulatory appointments announced over the next three months 
most impactful and likely the first change will appointing new vice chair 
supervision the fed governor tarullo has interim basis filled the vacant vice 
chair for supervision position and has been instrumental shaping number 
rulemaking processes well their implementation over the past several years 
likely that the trump administration will nominate new vice chair with the effect 
moving the fed regulatory responsibilities appointee with different viewpoint 
than governor tarullo this could drive more quantitatively driven supervision model 
that regulators are already inching towards with banks under assets excluded 
from ccar qualitative assessment further new regulatory heads can change 
calculations for the various capital and liquidity ratios fed governor tarullo has also 
recently suggested that the fed may consider some changes the rules for custody

risks around the volcker rule 
the new administration may revisit certain aspects the volcker rule embedded 
the dodd frank bill which intended curb proprietary trading activities but had 
unintended consequences clos are good example legislation exempt all existing 
clos from the obligations under the volcker rule which was approved the house 
representatives over two years ago but made legislative progress because 
potential presidential veto now has better shot being signed into law 
recently fed governor powell known for his focus market infrastructure 
commented speech that the current volcker rule effectively force you look 
into the mind and heart every trader every trade see what the intent saying 
that doing has required tremendous expense and burden the comments from 
governor powell dovetail with recent discussion paper authored the federal 
reserve board staff the impact the volcker rule market looking 
particularly fallen angel downgrade events the paper concludes that the volcker 
rule has had real effect dealer behavior with significant effects only those 
dealers affected the volcker rule and not all bond dealers they find that volcker 
alone distinct from the transition the post crisis environment dodd frank basel 
iii and ccar has dramatically decreased credit market liquidity during periods 
market stress according the paper over the period studied the volcker impacted 
dealers lost market share non volcker dealers and account for higher percentage 
agency trades along these lines loosening certain volcker provisions could have 
net positive impact market liquidity but don see meaningful immediate 
impact corporate credit spreads with the liquidity premium markets already very 
compressed see premium for liquidity jan for our original liquidity premium 
analysis and credit outlook presentation fewer words more pictures jan 
slide for the latest liquidity premium update lastly while loosening the 
volcker rule risk for financial credit holders certainly not expect banks 
ramp the risk profile trading business back pre crisis levels 
pending regulatory changes 
also note few pieces pending regulation which may impacted changing 
the regulatory guard the finalization the fundamental review the trading book 
frtb process the ccar gsib surcharge and the gold plating existing standards 
the basel committee referred basel see global banks insight asel 
exploring the next wave bank regulation nov could now postponed 
adopted materially different forms there also potential for changes the 
calculation the lcr and slr requirements which could lead less onerous 
treatment for balance sheet intensive trading business rates trading and repo 
finally the likely trump nominee for ctfc current acting director giancarlo has 
proposed few regulatory priorities which differ from the previous cftc chair these 
include being less prescriptive sef rules changes swap data repository sdr 
reporting rules and directing the agency integrate fintech concepts such 
distributed ledgers into future rulemaking 
leveraged lending guidelines 
the interagency guidance leveraged lending initially promulgated the federal 
reserve occ and fdic march could see less strict interpretation under 
trump administration while the guidance not binding banks has effectively 
become constraint leverage and structure the loan market certainly 
possibility that trump appointed regulators would focus less this guidance from 
supervisory perspective however again until the leadership the various agencies 
put place the details remain highly uncertain 
tlac finalization 
one dodd frank requirement which was only recently finalized dec the 
total loss absorbing capacity tlac and minimum long term debt ltd requirements 
applicable sib refresher title dodd frank spelled out orderly 
liquidation authority for the resolution non viable sib which would create new 
recapitalized holding company for failed institution allowing the operating subsidiaries 
continue operations however order capitalize the new holdco with equity 
regulators would need enough long term debt hence the fed interest ensuring 
sufficient tlac and ltd 
tlac defined tier capital plus eligible long term debt ltd defined 
unsecured plain vanilla long term debt issued the holdco with least 
maturity and governed law the plain vanilla requirement excludes notes with 
certain acceleration provisions credit sensitive coupon steps structured notes equity 
conversion features 
with applicable buffers considered the final rule requires tlac equivalent 
rwa and total leverage exposure which according the fed means 
aggregate incremental issuance our view this supply requirement very 
manageable over the coming years and takes off the table the bear case significant 
incremental issuance needs 
for example change from the draft rule otherwise ineligible debt was permanently 
grandfathered specifically debt with acceleration language for anything other than 
nonpayment event insolvency and foreign law debt additionally 
trust preferred securities will not qualify tlac full compliance with the rule 
required january though without phase period the draft rule suggested 
phase until jan 
lastly the treatment bank holdings other sib unsecured debt was delayed for 
the next administration this rule could have implications for market liquidity making 
more costly for banks trade financial debt the draft rule contemplated capital 
deductions for sib holdings other sib unsecured debt which was removed this 
final version the fed has indicated that these deductions will decided the product 
separate interagency rulemaking process 
impact callability financial debt 
response tlac over the past six months banks have begun issuing debt that 
callable one year before final maturity the rationale for this issuance that very short 
duration debt does not get credit under the tlac regulation alluded above 
result can expensive for banks have these bonds outstanding from capital 
perspective with the new structure banks have the option redeem bonds before 
final maturity practice around the time they start lose tlac eligibility far 
estimate that roughly senior bank debt issued since august has these call 
features the section below think about how value the imbedded option 
these new bank bonds 
first exhibit compare the spread these new structures relative the most

approximate the fair spread differential estimate the value the option that 
investors are short when owning the callable debt without going into too much detail 
can think callable bond bullet bond maturing the call date and short 
payer put option forward expectations the interest rate level the calldate the value this option would account for the risk the bond extending the 
issuer not calling which turn would depend interest rate volatility 
accordingly price payer options the swap rate with expiry equal the first 
call date the structure and with strike that would make the yield expiry equal 
the coupon the bond the yield above this strike expiry makes sense for the
