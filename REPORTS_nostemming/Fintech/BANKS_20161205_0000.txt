reflation rising inflation higher rates the steeper european curves and 
higher gdp growth are positives for bank stocks the short term margin

among our most preferred upgrade hsbc equal weight the revenue 
outlook has improved better apac loan growth and higher rates argue 
here 
restructuring despite the more positive revenue outlook costs will the 
battleground for differentiation all european banks have cost plan they are 
mostly long dated and infrastructure driven harnessing technology across the 
business wholesale banks are still working through legacy portfolios and more 
aggressive rethinking the business models execution always will key 
yet banks continue restructure and risk business models their appeal 
should broaden think ubs can positively surprise and upgrade

regulation while await clarity the final basel iii framework early 
discuss why current proposals may softened here recalibrated softer 
framework could benefit excess return stories lloyds kbc but also those 
trading with high divi yields sharp discounts part capital concerns bnp

deposit rates higher interest rates steeper and european yield curves 
stronger usd and better global growth are adding caixabank and bankia for 
european rate sensitivity and better domestic spanish asset quality gdp 
growth spain continues stronger than the euro area pace caixabank 
our preferred spanish play expect the bank continue generating higher 
quality nii and gaining market share corporate and insurance expect 
outperformance from bankia based three pillars the highest rate sensitivity 
excess provisions and strong organic capital generation see spanish banks best 
play steepening yield curves for details add ubs for its positive gearing 
all things usd see link here bnp also sees modest gearing 
restructuring keep bnp our list see further scope for efficiencies 
beyond cib the new plan and balance sheet options accelerate

capacity play this theme via kbc and bnp both cases believe that 
regulatory clarity can act improve expectations payout albeit final

remove abn continue see potential for upside abn linked 
regulatory clarity and pragmatic outcome basel allowing for increased

interesting earnings recovery stories elsewhere remove from our most

keep danske still see decent value the shares the broader european 
context expect some mortgage pricing come through the next quarters 
given the shift competitive dynamics nykredit raising prices this boosting 
margins and loan growth should remain steady with excess capital now 
established danske main appeal remains its yield ability expect further 
buybacks

add sabadell think sabadell most risk spain from the recent sovereign 
yield shift the longer duration its bond portfolio years one the longest 
europe could force sell bonds and risk hits tbv margin pressure 
the would add further pressure group revenues which together with the 
lower coverage its real estate portfolio peers leave underweight the stock 
our valuation factors the shortfall real estate provisions peers which drives 
our downgrade 
add aberdeen with reflation and macro benefitting developed markets positive 
emerging market sentiment appears fading given that higher rates have 
historically been seen detrimental growth see several idiosyncratic 
risks aberdeen that skew the risk reward profile the downside particularly 
across key global asia pacific equity products which account for aum 
and revenues the debate over quality and quantity capital could 
intensify given regulatory pressures whilst the restructuring over the last few 
years leaves limited scope for further new cost saves 
keep standard chartered think that consensus revenue and earnings 
expectations are too bullish stanchart reshaping the business improve

standards and exit low return businesses also faces external headwinds asset 
quality remains risk and the dividend longer support the final 
dividend was canceled and not expect more payments until

years sustainable reflation and floor under the ecb depo rate are notable change 
are the inflection point with our macro and strategy colleagues calling for higher 
growth higher inflation and ultimately higher policy rates this feels like uncertain 
mixture for cycle that has been one the longest record 
the context our outlook rates important are incorporating six fed hikes 
through with fed funds reaching yet europe where the yield curves 
steepen the most the ecb starts tapering from lifting the year bund 
from the current yet depo rates are stable through the forecast period 
prolonged period exceptionally low rates has weighed financials business

pensions life insurance payouts potential hard landing house prices relentless 
pricing pressures active asset managers etc while none the challenges away 
overnight are likely see gradual relief and improvement the sector earnings 
rehabilitation balance sheets resulting stronger levels capital there are outliers 
italian banks should have been forced deal with the stock npls earlier the 
market still wants see progress wholesale banks non core legacy units and 
minimize future drag returns litigation risk persists 
there are definite risks our sectoral glass half full view

market optimism over better growth higher yields stronger usd did 
the first quarter that the case financials are unlikely perform 
this could much ado about nothing the recent moves share prices and

most the increase driven higher inflation expectations expect short term 
impact capital and tbvs some cases believe this could prompt banks sell 
down part their bonds which could also impact nii short term 
the average duration the bond portfolios according eba data years across 
europe since when the yield steepened believe most banks have 
been swapping their bond portfolios however the spread the bund has been 
increasing italy most notably and spain and france too this could prompt some 
banks sell bonds even these are swapped believe this bigger issue for 
peripheral banks which increased the duration and size their bond portfolios during

restructuring legacy cost takeout technology 
european wholesale banks are still figuring out the ultimate shape balance sheets

and the take out the associated costs will key our best money making ideas are 
the european restructuring names those where expect the market increase 
conviction that tooled business models are fitter deliver sustainable returns the 
world continuing revenue pressures see ubs socgen and bnp the banks most 
likely the able this 
frustration for the market how some the restructuring cost takeout targets are 
long dated the reasons will vary each case ubs rightsizing cost base 
revenues socgen branch network injection operating leverage bnp extension 
cost efficiencies from cib broader retail divisions and unicredit aggressive strategic 
repositioning but are convinced the progress over the coming year will drive 
outperformance patience probably required for other major restructuring stories like 
deutsche credit suisse barclays and rbs 
industry largely failing cost reform 
relentless focus running off legacy portfolios taking out operating costs and 
harnessing technology will key restoring profitability the european banking 
sector while see nii driven revenue troughing injecting structural 
operating leverage will drive roe improvement 
while over the last few year costs have been cut reducing footprint the industry 
large has not succeeded cutting enough while cost growth has been contained 
revenues have fallen even more quickly non producer costs have risen steadily since 
banks have scrambled take support staff fulfill regulatory 
requirements invested technology and operations risk and finance programs 
improve business positioning but also keep with new regulatory frameworks 
reporting resolution etc every bank the world has cost programme one sort 
another under way highlighting that more needs done hence the question the

are still waiting for improved efficiencies elsewhere largely cib businesses 
bnp rbs barclays though also certain retail markets france germany 
would draw attention number reasons for this cost take out failures 
distinction between footprint and footprint cost reduction the fastest way 
cut costs shut businesses locations changing the footprint lot harder 
get costs down without changing the footprint this requires engineering 
booking trading processes new technologies organisation and 
many cost programs focus entirely getting headcount out within year some 
ways this the strength the investment banking industry redundant 
capabilities are cut out quickly but the flip side there limited focus getting 
unit production costs down footprint this invariably requires multi year 
investment the universal banks the process slower and politically charged 
with high restructuring costs union negotiations and sometimes consumer 
backlash 
costs are duplicated across firms banking sector supplies huge proportion its 
own cost structure creating utilities spinning costs out suppliers often 
requires year investment horizons and this basis bolder moves such these 
are largely overlooked one move would highlight socgen cib outsourcing 
its securities processing back office accenture post trade processing aptp 
system are also likely see similar initiatives from the swiss banks 
retail and wholesale banks have kept their options open too long particularly 
the cross border setting roe optimization will need come from market share

temporary regulatory costs should start declining from and 
required very high legal costs due the set ihc along with compliance with 
the new rules switzerland around capital and resolvability while still expect 
high temporary regulatory costs due basel ccar and brexit 
assume some reduction from onwards which keep 
constant until given the uncertain environment should get further clarity

the benefits digitalization shared economies namely via optimization

within cib given that existing plans full implementation are relatively shortdated and our estimates would still leave cost income global banking

the tullett icap transaction where the broking businesses will continue run 
separately bgc gfi announced cost savings delivered which 
amounts the target cost base comparison tullett has outlined 
cost synergies the target cost base delivered year 
management expects the targeted savings realised from technology and 
other support service functions this equates the enlarged group 
management and support costs think this target may prove conservative given 
overlap geography and product the combined group and tullett plans bring 
board brokers and support staff while the aim run both broking 
businesses separately think plausible management could extract greater benefits 
from scale particularly given the businesses are similar size also tullett currently 
employs support service staff iii see scope for tullett put downward 
pressure broker compensation given icap runs comp revenue ratio

the basel committee currently putting the finishing touches proposals dubbed

concept asel simple banks should measure risk weighted assets rwas for 
loans and trading books the same way across countries there have been comments 
from senior regulators mario draghi january ministers sept that 
the new rules will have significant increase capital driving market hopes 
pragmatic outcome but the proposals they stand imply point capital hike 
base global basis and for europe 
our base case and consensus assume the basel committee softens the current 
proposals minimal rwa inflation given the growth that imperative europe and 
elsewhere below focus the likely impacts basel capital requirements 
loans and trading books 
potential impact loans would require the most increase capital average

potential impact trading would require more capital too though more 
manageable average

amount under the new rules until that point using five observable stats help map

although our work highlights the scale the gap between the basel committee 
statements around significant increase capital requirements for the sector and our 
estimate actual impacts based current proposals view the above very much 
bear case think compromise highly likely without given the comments from 
european politicians and central bankers see risk that europe chooses not adopt 
the basel framework our asel note here outlined number possible 
routes pragmatism the basel committee could abandon substantially water 
down the proposals leaving impacts much closer the status quo this now seems less 
likely given chairman ingves comments above long phase period could allow 
banks build into ratios iii local regulators could given significant discretion 
recalibrate proposals lower the rwa inflation effects use capital buffers shock 
absorbers pillar add ons sifi counter cyclical and management buffers 
particular swedish and dutch banks have scope absorb impacts this way

standard that european banks will need comply with means banks will need use 
expected loss provisioning rather than incurred loss provisioning this will lead oneoff charge through equity that will reduce book values banks and potentially have 
impact capital too depending phase ins will also introduce volatility into the 
for banks the banks see most risk are those with large amounts stage 
loans the balance sheet these are loans that have significantly deteriorated 
credit quality since origination but have not yet defaulted and will need have lifetime 
expected losses applied against them also see banks that have low capital ratios 
and weak profitability likely find the changes hardest digest 
the implementation the standard due periods from onwards 
expect banks will start give estimated numbers around the impact ifrs the 
earliest the spring which not that far away the reason for the 
implementation the new standard ifrs that around the financial crisis the banks 
could not recognise losses they expected they were obligated use incurred loss 
provisioning rules this meant that the accounts the banks did not capture 
expectations for losses and were not thought prudent enough the aim ifrs 
address that 
regulatory pragmatism improved dividend clarity 
while look for more clarity the regulatory agenda assume pragmatic final 
solution the most likely outcome clarity here expect should increase dividend 
confidence assuming long phased implementation and softening existing proposals 
prevail look perennial favorites continue delivering are more constructive

diversified financials fca and mifid rules pose risks for 
asset managers 
see forthcoming fca recommendations the key near term regulatory risk 
particularly for the asset managers the fca recently published its interim report 
the asset management market study launched see our note the 
announcement here recap the fca has proposed number remedies address 
what regards market shortcomings from its study have captured the remedies 
that believe will have the most significant impact below 
strengthened duty asset managers act the best interests investors 
including reforms that will hold asset managers accountable for how they deliver 
value for money and introduce independence fund oversight committees 
introducing all fee approach quoting charges that investors funds can 
easily see what being taken from the fund 
helping retail investors switch share classes and identify the best fund for them 
requiring asset managers clear about the objectives the fund and report 
against these ongoing basis clarifying and strengthening the appropriate 
use benchmarks iii providing tools for investors identify persistent 
underperformance 
note jupiter henderson pre janus merger and aberdeen have significant exposure 
domiciled clients see exhibit for the european traditional asset management 
sector whole our base case models price compression management fees 
over the next two three years with the final package proposals due next year 
think these remedies could accelerate fee pressure particularly through the 
introduction all fee and making easier for retail investors move share 
classes some the measures may also lead additional costs and could drive 
profit hit for the asset management industry argued our march blue 
paper link 
the fca also raised concerns that fund managers generally not robustly consider 
value for money for fund investors one their concerns was that fees charged for 
managing retail fund portfolio should compared with the fees charged for 
comparable institutional client accounts see the difference reasonable compared 
the differences costs possible this might included part the duties 
expected from asset managers fund governance bodies going forward such 
situation see negative impact industry profitability margins retail and 
institutional funds converge 
although mifid rules around retrocessions and inducements are known tail risks that 
outcomes could worse than our base case expectations remain elevated for
