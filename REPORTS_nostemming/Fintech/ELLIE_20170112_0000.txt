originators typically fall into one three categories mega lenders other mortgage 
lenders and mortgage brokerages

retail branches that originate loans and wholesale channel which they buy 
loans originated others mortgage banks smaller lenders credit unions and 
mortgage brokers 
mortgage lenders these lenders include non depository mortgage banks thrifts 
and credit unions these companies source and fund loans and generally sell most 
these funded loans mega lenders other investors 
mortgage brokers independent sales companies that originate loans for multiple 
mortgage lenders they process and submit loan files mortgage lenders that 
turn fund the loans 
the mortgage origination process involves multiple parties across series 
transactions that must handled specific order under tight time constraints the 
time loan funded typical package includes over one thousand pages documents 
and has been exchanged among many participants through fax courier mail not only 
the process very inefficient duplicative efforts time delays and costs often 
exposes the borrows data potential privacy and security breaches
