implications for apple aapl covered 
katy huberty 
mobile payments major opportunity for apple improve 
user experiences and potentially add new revenue stream 
the company has historically been very good integrating 
hardware and software and believe can further 
differentiate itself and increase preserve the value its 
devices adding services mobile payments can help apple 
collect more data consumers order create more 
relevant and useful recommendations and advertisements 
and create additional revenue opportunities for developers 
and other partners especially brick and mortar retail

growth revenue cagr through msd for 
semis and opportunity for multiple expansion 
for peers the company strong momentum 
close sales another important tenet our 
positive view nxpi better late than never upgrade 
overweight deep dive also believe the adoption 
nfc customer apple would represent strong catalyst for 
the stock and into our base case for this 
opportunity incremental sales and 
eps detailed page 
the company nfc sam could see cagr for the 
next four years nfc has always been area interest for 
nxp despite contributing just the company revenues 
though nfc penetration has been far from impressive date 
believe adoption should pick from here and accelerate 
move into driven technological innovations 
such nfc combo chips and host card emulation that lower 
the barrier for nfc adoption see nfc enabled 
smartphones growing cagr from

while and remain agnostic mobile payments 
technology believe that nfc based authentication 
reinforces their role within the payments value chain and limits 
the disintermediation risk note that both companies have 
recently endorsed hce technology given its open architecture 
and ability scale faster enabling democratization 
payments believe both are working specifications that 
include combination hce tokenization and possibly 
other technologies apple fingerprint that could

implications for gemalto gto covered 
andrew humphrey 
while believe gemalto one small number 
players globally with substantial expertise secure ota 
provisioning secure elements believe recent moves 
both apple and the android camp galaxy has 
android introducing hce apple working directly with card 
issues are the very least deflationary for gemalto and 
worse substantially reduce the addressable market for them

apple embrace nfc key catalyst that should 
drive nfc penetration over the next months 
apple continues dominant player the high end 
smartphone market with market share however 
one the few oems that has yet embrace nfc apple 
support for nfc could shot the arm for this technology 
instantly boosting nfc user base units 
head into apple developer conference early june 
and its new product refresh cycle the fall there are elevated 
expectations for the company unveil its mobile payments 
strategy the following items support our view that apple may 
about embrace nfc for its upcoming payment system 
even apple decides incorporate nfc its products 
iphone ipad and possibly iwatch later this fall there are still 
many unanswered questions related technology 
implementation for instance will apple incorporate 
standalone nfc controller possibly from nxp 
the integrated combo chip route broadcom for 
the security aspect its mobile payment system will the 
company decide invest the elevated security provided 
embedded implementation the secure element with 
the cloud version host card emulation hce note 
nfc has recently received google endorsement via its 
support for the technology android kitkat well 
network processors visa and mastercard support 
expect apple with standalone nfc controller 
apple recently filed patent 
outlines payment system that uses nfc well wifi for 
payment transaction and makes use the secure element 
store the customer credit card information exhibit 
addition press reports have stated that apple has 
reached agreement with china unionpay mobile 
payment service that would incorporate nfc brightwire 
finally apple lent support nfc and contactless 
technology general upgrading its mobile point sale 
terminal infrastructure its stores support the technology 
forbes

nfc and wifi bluetooth

what happens apple adopts nfc 
our conversations with companies the nfc ecosystem 
suggest that the majority nfc implementations 
smartphones over the next months will still with 
standalone nfc controllers nxp rather than 
nfc part combo chip such broadcom 
given the current technical challenges faced 
oems with antennas and nfc 
secure element embedded the cloud hce 
secure element arguably the most debated aspect nfc 
technology this time case can made for both camps 
embedded implementation not the sim based approach 
advocated gemalto and other tsm providers the 
cloud based approach via host card emulation the one 
hand having embedded secure element would provide 
apple enhanced security ensuring credit card information 
stays within the iphone encrypted format while also 
tying nicely the company recently filed patent the other hand proponents host 
card emulation exhibit will point advantages such 
faster time deployment and the ability circumvent the 
mobile network operators mnos escape the logjam that 
samsung galaxy faced when google wallet was 
blocked carriers 
our opinion given the heightened focus security after 
recent high profile incidents such the target breach 
believe there good chance apple may decide the 
embedded route and perhaps incorporate stacked nfc 
radio and embedded secure element solution such nxp 
exhibit addition given apple strong domestic 
market share and large high end user base the company 
likely has enough clout overcome the logjam faced other

move toward embedded secure elements and host card 
emulation potentially deflationary for gemalto 
believe the implications iphone with embedded 
secure element are complex for gemalto the company has 
increasingly stated agnostic about the type nfc 
solution pursued including excluding secure element 
embedded sim based secure element practice 
however believe the earnings impact different solutions 
suggest there wide range outcomes order help 
investors negotiate the outcomes what apple may 
announce provide breakdown potential revenue 
components for gemalto from most secure element based 
nfc deployments 
sim based secure element generally for telcodriven deployments nfc mobile wallets gemalto will 
sell uicc containing various sim applications 
lte along with secure element designed 
accept ota credentials part the revenue will silicon 
pass through for the chip provided for example 
infineon stmicro samsung but there typically 
significant mark for the newest most secure version 
gemalto operating system 
embedded secure element for handset oemdriven nfc wallet deployments gemalto works with 
stmicro and others products for this market though 
believe the economic model less well established 
gemalto would still expect generate royalty for its 
java card software stack which would integrate with 
provisioning back end however nxp own embedded 
software provides very similar functionality believe 
handset oem choices this scenario are influenced 
the type provisioning setup required 
trusted service manager tsm revenue find 
bulls gemalto tend most focused the 
opportunity here though believe this the part the 
business most threatened recent developments around 
hce recent press articles around apple working with 
visa mastercard and amex token service providers 
tsps also raise questions around gemalto potential 
role ios mobile payment platform our view 
seems unlikely that apple would pay away 
substantial portion value for third part manage 
secure element where access only envisaged for 
small number well established card issuers
