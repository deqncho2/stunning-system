increase attendees this year and 
representative investments into the space incumbent players and vcs

payments summed the state innovation the industry best stating that 
more innovation has happened the payments industry over the past year 
than the prior continue monitor how emerging players and

takeaways for payments stocks while there are many new entrants trying 
enter the payments space came away incrementally positive the 
outlook for the payments networks along with axp are not 
only providing the payment rails for apple pay but plying enhanced role 
through provision tokenization services and will likely play similar role 
other mobile digital payments schemes come their role tokenization 
could also potentially extend banking transactions for smaller mid sized 
institutions that not have their own tokenization capabilities even 
mcx currentc which many investors including had previously assumed 
bear case scenario for the networks announced that would 
accepted general purpose credit cards accounts funding source for the 
merchant acquirers processors believe that increased security concerns 
could provide some momentum for their tokenization encryption emv

relatively new entrants such poynt square along with merchant acquirers 
devoting more resources their own house pos systems first 
data clover heartland leaf 
takeaways for large cap banks scale matters closed loop matters 
innovation matters banks that have these are likely win out the everevolving payments ecosystem think jpm axp dfs usb are best 
positioned why elevated security costs are not going away fraud ever 
evolving and banks will have keep spending more stay one step ahead 
scale lets you invest house and lower transaction costs lots interest 
mobile wallets following apple pay wallets that will win are those that can 
integrate reward offerings better and issuers that will win are those that are 
top wallet big opportunity big banks want piece the action 
particularly new solutions provide cost saves and better information all 
parties real time payments are inevitable given they critical for 
ecommerce and international adoption picking but can banks 
generate enough fees offset giving float stay tuned 
payments and processing november 
security cost and never goes away 
addressing security the payments system was the front and center several panels presentations the 
discussions drove home the point that cyber attacks are all time high and increasing and that layered 
approach security key keep increasingly sophisticated bad actors bay the industry continues view 
combination emv point point encryption and tokenization the most effective way devalue the data 
risk but hackers are creative and will keep evolving expect security methods will need evolve too 
keeping security costs elevated 
the industry track for emv adoption with the expectation that nearly tier merchants will emv 
enabled october tokenization the ultimate goal years and biometrics are gaining ground 
too following their incorporation the new apple devices 
implications for banks scale matters larger banks should able invest house taking overall security 
investments the near term but per transaction costs down the long term smaller banks will likely 
continue use third parties stay the front lines security management which means smaller banks will 
want have top wallet relationships with their security vendors closed loop institutions axp dfs 
chasenet are think the best position their end end view gives them the ability see where security 
stresses are emerging ahead peers driving opportunity for differentiation lower fraud costs and enable them 
attract more customers 
implications for the networks while competing solutions may emerge think the networks and are 
well positioned monetize the revenue opportunity from tokenization given their first mover advantage apple 
pay represents the first commercial deployment tokenized wallet solution 
implication for the merchant acquirers positive for the large merchant acquirers increased focus 
security could create increased demand for security solutions such tokenization and encryption vntv noted 
that they are currently focused selling these services into their top retail clients where penetration 
remains low vntv has also launched tool help merchants certify for emv which could potentially generate 
demand from merchants that are the queue for certification and want meet the october deadline 
implication for pos hardware providers believe pos providers like pay and ingenico should continue 
see tailwind from emv upgrades tier merchants progress smaller merchants may take longer they 
feel less threatened the liability shift 
emv key takeaways 
very good addressing counterfeit card fraud but not very successful ecommerce 
the mag stripe emv card can still cloned risk counterfeit fraud still exists long 
have terminals supporting mag stripe 
emv only solves the front end data still exposed the back end 
ultimate goal for end end encryption need tokenization keep merchant out sensitive 
information flow 
the industry should expect see more fraud move ecommerce emv rolled out 
adopting chip and signature emv which less secure than chip and pin 
emv investment today isn waste even though will eventually move tokenization because 
physical cards will not completely away 
tokenization key takeaways 
payments and processing november 
strong empirical evidence that card not present fraud will increase when emv rolled out 
innovative token based solutions like apple pay are bringing dynamic data remote payments for the 
first time and could silver bullet solution help protect online retailers 
tokenization schemes need standardized and interoperable for widespread adoption can have 
every player come with their own scheme 
risk could get concentrated around token vaults over time 
can embed tokenization mobile today should able this physical card couple 
years 
tokenization could become widespread years and eventually become table stakes 
there will likely multi party environment for providing tokenization services 
large fis will likely source given their own scale small banks will likely outsource third party 
schemes 
the networks job convince issuers that they can provide this service the most secure way 
possible 
distinction between card present and card not present interchange fees will blur over time 
biometrics key takeaways 
behind the rest the world 
fido fast identity online alliance payment networks alibaba paypal google microsoft bac 
rsa and others has come together set specifications for industry wide use authentication 
technology for biometrics 
apple announcement has spurred lot renewed interest 
concern whether biometric information should stored the cloud the device cloud 
more vulnerable attacks scale but devices more vulnerable malware

mobile wallets consumer choice matters most 
apple pay has helped elevate the energy and discussion around mobile payments but ultimately widespread 
adoption unlikely occur until consumers can use the wallet their choice the phone their choice 
with the issuer their choice for mcx believe widespread adoption will depend the value add 
consumers not merchants given the recent incidences fraud think convincing consumes share their 
bank checking account information fund their mcx wallet currentc will challenging mcx however 
announced would also include general purpose credit cards fund its currentc wallet positive for the 
incumbent payment rails 
implication for the issuers believe the increasing use mobile wallets will drive shift away from 
cash check card benefitting issuers they will able collect interchange higher percentage 
payments expect issuers will work hard ensure their card payment offering the top the consumers 
mobile wallet expect issuers will compete with seamless payment delivery potentially including algorithms that 
enable mobile wallet users program which their cards use which merchants this will enable 
integration with merchant loyalty programs issuers loyalty programs and integration with other financial 
accounts the issuer addition standard competitive practices like reward points and marketing axp dfs 
chasenet and syf benefit because their closed loop allows them directly align the wallet with merchant 
needs strong relationships with merchants are essential drive better experience layering their loyalty 
programs will critical mcx inclusion general purpose credit cards their mobile wallet positive for 
issuers signals that wallets need partner with the existing members the payments ecosystem 
truly relevant 
implication for the networks continue see the networks beneficiaries widespread mobile 
payment adoption given the potential for accelerating the secular shift away from cash and check based 
payments the mcx announcement include open loop credit cards the currentc wallet reinforces our view 
that collaborating with the networks likely increase the chances success for emerging mobile payment 
providers that are likely face the challenge driving consumer adoption 
implication for the acquirers positive increased electronification payments will drive transaction growth 
for merchant acquirers 
implications for the pos hardware providers positive apple pay could catalyst for nfc become 
the dominant pos technology the helping accelerate the emv upgrade cycle and asp for pay apple pay 
success could also help drive nfc driven pos upgrade cycle outside the the ingenico only selling 
pos terminals with nfc functionality tier merchants which seeding the market with nfc enabled 
machines 
overwhelmingly positive sentiment around apple pay industry participants highlighted the clean user 
experience superior security standard via tokenization and partnership with wide swathe banks key 
components differentiating from all other mobile wallet options launched thus far that said expectations 
for adoption the near term are measured given 
low penetration nfc terminals the estimated all point sale terminals industry 
experts think that apple pay usage may slow down after the initial euphoria downloads the 
first hours coolness factor wears off given lack places use 
well functioning card payment infrastructure that presents high barrier entry for new payments 
forms experiences the pos 
lack value proposition beyond payments such integrated loyalty reward programs 
payments and processing november 
industry optimism higher for apple pay potential transform the app shopping experience 
the near term due 
its seamless and secure checkout presents compelling value proposition for merchants that typically 
struggle with low mobile checkout conversion rates according visa checkout friction amplified 
the mobile device with conversion falling from desktop mobile devices 
this also the first time that mobile wallet allowing the use dynamic data the most secure 
form transaction take place remote payments environment 
although app transactions attract card not present interchange fee tokenization and biometric 
authentication used apple pay will result liability shift the issuer 
merchant concerns apple pay while response from the merchant community has been varied part 
determined whether not they belong the mcx consortium one the main concerns voiced the 
merchant community seems around the ability lack thereof use tokens track consumer data 
tokens are device specific merchants will unable tie transactions made using the same credit card from 
two different devices well transactions made using apple pay those made using the plastic card carrying 
the same underlying credentials appears that the industry working towards solution although unclear 
will represent additional cost for merchants have the ability translate the tokens into consumer data 
and what impact that might have broader implementation token based wallets 
where might apple pay next while there some expectation that apple may europe next due 
comments made visa europe and hiring former visa europe executive apple our conversations with 
industry experts brought china and canada two potential regions where apple pay could launch next 
given the high penetration nfc these regions while nfc penetration also high certain european 
regions poland experts opine that the lower interchange fees and fragmentation market country 
could make europe complex implementation 
mcx yet see the light day but getting closer mcx ceo dekkers davidson highlighted consumer 
choice funding options device etc and benefits digitized receipts integration loyalty offer programs 
drivers for potential adoption also stated that currentc the mcx wallet will open wallet which will 
include certain open loop credit cards well general purpose prepaid cards funding options addition 
checking account store gift cards and private label cards this was surprise move given mcx stance thus far 
bypass the networks axp this positive for the issuers and networks but appears that there 
hasn been much dialogue between the parties about potential agreement yet currentc will available 
all ios and android phones the market while running behind original schedule the currentc app 
currently pilot and expected launched soon early consumers will have choice how they 
want engage merchant proprietary apps currentc app through bank apps banks will have the ability 
embed currentc into their own apps 
softcard paddling hard but can stay afloat following national launch softcard has seen little 
success date but following the launch apple pay could benefit from being the default mobile payment 
solution for all non ios devices least until start see wider implementation hce based mobile 
wallet applications those devices note that limited issuer adoption remains key obstacle for softcard

globalization ecommerce 
although many technological developments have been taking place one the most underappreciated 
developments the payments space has been how fast cross border ecommerce has been taking place see 
global insight ecommerce still early innings published october published katy huberty for 
more global ecommerce trends cross border ecommerce china now similar the total size 
and growing twice the rate 
implications for networks given higher fees for cross border transactions and the fact that ecommerce 
typically funded via electronic forms payments believe the continued growth ecommerce will provide 
tailwind for the card network revenues china expected the key growth driver for cross border 
ecommerce recent news that the chinese government contemplating opening the payments market for 
foreign players increases the upside potential for axp and dfs 
payments and processing november 
online wallets more competition both financial and tech firms attempt 
offer one click checkout 
given that commerce the fastest growth category within retail payments merchants develop 
omnipresence providing sales through every available channel not surprising that increasing 
number players are focusing providing simplified check out experience the consumer merchants 
turn will benefit from higher check out conversion rates currently estimated desktop 
mobile devices 
implications for banks expect more banks join providing online wallets with select few winning out 
the end convenience coupled with enhanced security through tokenization where available should drive 
higher customer spend the margin 
implication for the networks admittedly the networks are late the game amazon paypal have had 
figured out for while but increasing adoption debit credit card funded online wallets own third party 
should help drive more transactions and revenues the networks think that and strategy open 
their apis should enable easier consumption their network assets third party innovators 
implication for the acquirers potential slight negative depending the implementation model 
while more transactions are positive for the merchant acquirers their role could reduced processor 
cases where third party wallets directly integrate with the merchant 
key takeaways 
both financial and tech firms are reaching out merchants provide one click checkout features 
using online wallets 
chase pay month old uses tokenization secure information currently supports only payment 
through chase visa debit and credit cards view expect jpm could eventually upgrade this 
support all cards 
login and pay with amazon allows amazon users shop third party merchant websites with 
payment and shopping credentials stored their amazon accounts 
option embedded merchants websites along side visa master card etc 
user does not need enter their payment billing shipping information 
helps reduce shopping cart abandonment 
helps reduce fraud user credentials shipping information already stored and authenticated via 
username and password view expect these will eventually upgraded permit biometric 
authentication once technology widely available 
while adding few additional checkout options could beneficial there are diminishing returns after 
point when comparing cost implementations increased checkout conversion 
payments and processing november 
point sale systems proliferation smarter multifunctional pos 
systems 
reduced cost computing technology tablets has led the emergence lower cost smarter pos 
terminals that can accept multiple forms payment mag stripe emv nfc code along with integrated 
software solutions run the business 
implications for banks smarter pos systems will facilitate merchant acceptance across different methods 
payment this should promote the use nfc particularly apple pay and other forms payment barcode 
bluetooth driving shift from cash check card course one would expect adoption accelerates 
vendors demonstrate how these new pos systems can lower costs and increase management information 
largely not more than entirely offsetting the costs upgrading these systems 
implications for the networks neutral slight positive networks will benefit the extent that availability 
more affordable pos solutions helps drive increased penetration electronic payments 
implication for the acquirers positive lower cost new pos technology should help increase the adoption 
integrated pos systems smbs turn providing merchant processors opportunity establish stickier 
relationships with their merchant clients 
implication for the pos hardware providers slight negative given the potential for these new emerging 
pos providers take share from the incumbents 
key takeaways 
first data launched clover mobile mobile pos solution for smbs 
new pos system has swipe emv wifi bluetooth nfc barcode 
allows mobile pos like you see apple stores

integrated software solutions for employee mgmt payroll inventory mgmt loyalty etc result this can

payments and processing november 
real time payments the coming soon 
implications for banks critical that the banking system offers real time payments offer best class 
service and security its difficult say this neutral positive for the banking industry they would 
need give float but they would have the opportunity generate fees several countries have started 
offer real time payments brazil therefore think critical that the banking industry also move 
real time payments consumers will increasingly demand this given the ability alternative payment 
providers offer real time payment banks that have already started move toward this include chase with 
quickpay and regions with their immediate funds transfer offering critical follow emerging fed policy real 
time payments are important for ecommerce consumers will receive products faster spurring more online 
purchases 
implication for networks slight negative real time ach may give rise viable alternative consumer 
payment methods that could take share from the networks though note that the networks atm pin debit 
infrastructure are under consideration design options for certain types real time payments 
key takeaways 
fed released consultation paper sep outlining its goal improve the current payments 
system work toward improvement security ubiquitous faster payment capabilities 
improvement security better international payments plumbing improvements ach checks 
system collaboration between all industry participants 
real time payments are important for commerce online customers can buy products today for next 
day shipping but settle the proceeds with the merchants ach can take days which delays 
merchants restocking inventory slowing down availability products for the next customer real 
time payments would reduce this delay driving more inventory available for online customers 
faster payments will eventually spur more businesses that require faster payments like uber air 
kickstarter 
the same way the internet benefitted disproportionately from speed too will the payment system 
options implement real time evolve ach evolve atm pin debit infrastructure iii direct 
clearing over networks build new clearing only infrastructure build completely new 
infrastructure 
tokenization around the transaction will solve lot the problems around fraud 
international adoption has been quicker than the scale the market increases the complexity 
implementing real time payments need learn from the aus 
takes the years this there will likely another markets over the world that will 
have already moved onto real time 
competition between payment rails networks might good thing but cross border across multiple 
networks will the bigger problem solve

virtual currencies still long way 
virtual currencies still have some way establishing trust with consumers which turn will only 
result better regulation regulation hasn kept with innovation the space particularly the but this 
could turn once the nydfs releases their final rules next year over time the virtual currency system provides 
many benefits including faster cheaper money transfers and more inclusion the unbanked particularly 
implications for banks banks are staying away from virtual currencies today given concerns around 
regulation and aml the blockchain system particular interest banks its digital encryption could 
provide more efficient mechanism for transferring funds and other information like documents etc given 
the importance trust the financial world the need for credit and stickiness consumer preferences 
not think virtual currencies the blockchain will necessarily disintermediate banks but rather drive banks and 
blockchain operators partner the long term 
implication for money transfer operators blockchain technology expected democratize payments and 
could likely lead further pricing pressure for all parties involved global remittance but key players such 
western union are keeping eye the technology management sees little risk from virtual currencies the 
near medium term the majority its customer base are not even aware the technology still does not 
understand how anti money laundering aml and know your customer kyc issues can addressed 
these emerging players but will look fast follower and when regulatory and compliance issues are 
resolved the company has project group currently looking leveraging bitcoin technology 
key takeaways 
trust the key issue 
gox collapse was blow but after the collapse some exchanges allowed users independent audit 
rebuild trust 
but the end can build trust without regulators backing 
from the consumers point view plastic works just fine the average consumer unlikely use virtual 
currencies widely until there are incentives discounts convenience and assurances security 
many companies have innovated around charge backs this opportunity consumers need able 
trust 
industry participants need better regulation 
there lot innovation this space and regulation has not kept particularly the 
currently participants need licenses states different states also have different requirements cost 
compliance prohibitive today given the current level activity comparison all requires only one 
license 
clarity inter state and even international transactions especially around jurisdiction 
operating unclear regulatory environment has been really challenging for players and stifling 
innovation 
payments and processing november 
most other countries also taking wait and see approach only dealing with issues taxation and aml 
despite gox japan the most bitcoin friendly country today 
eventually companies will whichever jurisdiction most open crypto currencies just the 
became the hub for internet companies 
banks 
banks not want engage with companies offering services around virtual currency because regulatory 
concerns need virtual currencies adhere same standards other currencies for banks engage 
banks fascinated block chain and general ledgers and how payment systems can have less friction but 
their views are highly dependent regulation consumer preferences are sticky there still widespread 
use cash and checks today use magstripe cards will continue well into the future even when have 
emv tokenization similarly use traditional forms payment will continue even when virtual currency use 
becomes more prevalent 
there credit based bitcoin product credit side needs addressed 
banks should interested because bitcoin offers near real time settlement takes mins clear 
transactions average 
also has uses cross border tranfer 
benefits bitcoin the payments system 
payments system has evolved over time had redesign from scratch today wouldn have 
designed with many middlemen 
bitcoin fundamentally rethinks payments for the internet age connecting the merchant directly with the 
consumer 
bitcoin particularly useful for the unbanked there are billion people the world outside the banking 
system this driving interest from countries like argentina brazil and russia 
africa can key market interest bitcoin can the best way drive ecommerce where there low

biggest opportunity payments 
implications for banks with businesses using checks for half their payments more financial and nonfinancial providers are looking enter the market most notable among the large banks are usb axp and dfs 
through its partnership with ariba pay believe this represents significant opportunity for banks 
increase fee based revenues especially interoperability and expense saves drive more businesses toward 
products availability real time payments would drive higher adoption 
key takeaways from the conference 
misunderstood viewed extension but nature the relationship completely 
different 
more interdependent and ongoing relationship 
payments are made part full and multiple invoices 
most efficient way currently provide explanation writing along with the check but there are better 
ways this 
size the market the biggest opportunity businesses use checks for half their payments 
also heavily underserved 
what will motivate businesses move away from checks 
benefit for the buyer can use multiple methods payment rebate extension grace period can provided

benefits for the suppliers get paid sooner get more data usable format cost saving

jpm chasenet platform formed result its partnership with visa designed leverage data from 
chase cardholder transactions help its merchant clients benefit from higher sales reduced fraud and

implication for networks negative for mastercard chase consolidating its consumer card portfolio 
under the visa brand part the agreement though the impact already priced into the stock note that 
potential for similar agreements other issuers could create further risk for market share shifts between the 
networks note that while they have made such announcement visa recently announced renewal its 
contract with bofa with potential for share gains 
implication for acquirers slight negative due potential for increased price competition given chase ability 
subsidize the merchant discount rate based merchant all relationship with the bank
