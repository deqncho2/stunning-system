summary and conclusions 
following the development payment infrastructure china 
and bank centric payment systems believe bank payment 
data offer unique angle into business activities china 
light heightened debate the accuracy many 
traditional economic indicators particularly during the 
economic transitional period believe bank payment data 
could good supplementary data set analyze tracking 
the actual number and amount payment transactions 
china analyzing relatively comprehensive bank payment 
data published pboc see the following 
growth bank payment value has consistently 
outpaced nominal gdp growth which could also 
driven the following factors 
bank payment data suggest that business activity 
growth could better than gdp figures imply 
growth the number and total value bank payment 
transactions remained high and continued outpace even 
growth recent years and which implies still 
healthy money velocity 
growth total bank payment value would healthier 
adjusted for fluctuation shadow banking activities which 
could imply better growth economic activities outside 
heavy industries this will also provide room for china drive 
further change the structure economic growth structure 
this also supported consumption payment data which 
posted much better growth than retail sales well growth 
bank card consumption related payments remained high 
yoy despite stable card penetration ratio meaningfully 
outpacing retail sales growth this could driven 
consumption shift from products services medical 
services 
exhibit 
non cash payments increased recent years 
more active transactions capital and assets created 
previous years 
business transactions related services and 
consumption that are still underestimated under china 
current gdp calculation method 
development alternative financing channels and 
fluctuation shadow banking activities 
banks are active adapting new payment 
technologies and regained some commerce payment 
market share 
addition reflecting business activities believe the 
payment data also offer some color deposits allocation 
which influenced payment needs 
currently two thirds payment value handled the 
pboc high value systems with average transaction 
value over area likely remain dominated 
banks banks have been active developing electronic 
payments more than payments were initiated via 
online platforms 
third party payment companies had lead commerce 
payments but their aggregate value remains small 
total payment value addition banks have regained 
commerce payment market share moving all 
payment online channels believe development thirdparty payment firms win win for banks and china rather 
than pure new competition 
chinese banks remain attractive given still low valuation 
this analysis confirms lower systemic risks than 
expected and less threat from new competition 
better growth the new economy will offer better 
environment for orderly npl clean process china 
traditional industries 
addition the threat chinese banks deposit base and fee 
opportunities may also manageable will also hinge

bank payment data imply still healthy business activities 
why analyze bank payment data china 
currently the pboc publishes very comprehensive system 
payment data which track nearly all the noncash fund 
payments and transfers via the major payment and clearing 
systems china tracks both the number transactions 
well the value noncash fund transfers and breaks data 
down three ways 
method payment bills checks wire transfers 
bank cards 
platforms used initiate the payment online 
banking bank counters telephone banking and mobile 
banking 
payment systems that processed the transactions 
pboc high value payment systems unionpay intrabank payment systems 
payment and transfer data are easier track and tend 
relatively accurate 
there has been ongoing debate the quality china 
gdp and other economic indicators particularly given the 
current transitioning period economic growth and 
production focused gdp calculation methodology used 
china 
addition payment one the most important functions 
the financial system payment trends will also influence the 
movement deposits the system for example many 
banks focus trade finance because trade routes are where 
payment activities and therefore deposits tend 
concentrated 
will continue track and analyze bank payment data 
trends supplement our credit allocation and economic 
indicators 
exhibit 
china non cash payment value method 
payment 
however also acknowledge the limitation this data set 
because some granularity lacking which makes bit 
more difficult understand the drivers some the 
fluctuations payment data 
nonetheless believe does provide good additional color 
particularly when analyzed with other bank data sets 
bank payment data show better money velocity 
trends than data suggested 
historically have been using growth and 
percentage gauge money velocity tends 
indicate money base that involved more active 
business transactions 
source wind morgan stanley research 
since nearly all business activities involve some fund 
transfer payment transactions believe fund transfers and 
payments data are good reflection true business activities 
the economy from different angle the traditional 
indicators such gdp fai consumption growth etc 
however given the improvement bank systems the 
emergence quasi deposit products and increased 
depositor attention returns growth may longer 
the best indicator money yu bao actively involved 
business activities but shows banks balance sheets 
interbank deposits 
believe fund transfers and payment cash likely 
represent less than all fund transfers and payments 
the economy roughly estimated thus believe 
the noncash fund transfer and payment data could offer some 
unique insights into real economic conditions

high payment value growth likely reflects wealth 
creation development service industries and 
growth shadow banking activities 
exhibit 
activities involve large amount payments 
recent years payment value growth has even modestly 
exceeded growth and has also outpaced nominal gdp 
growth this shows that new credit and money supply created 
recent years has not been sitting around the system 
rather has been facilitating business transactions although 
more and more such transactions are not directly generating 
gdp 
exhibit 
growth non cash payments outpaced gdp 
growth 
source wind morgan stanley research 
transactions and monetization land and natural 
resources have also been key reason why payment value 
growth has been higher than gdp growth shown the 
exhibit below the rising gap between fai and capital 
formation also partly reflect the growing size this factor 
exhibit 
the difference between fai and capital formation 
was likely due the land sales 
source ceic morgan stanley research 
cite the following key drivers the development 
more active transactions capital and assets created 
previous years 
following years investments china has created 
considerable amount assets and wealth the capital 
formation was completed previous years transactions 
such assets will not generate large amount new gdp 
even they still require credit and money supply facilitate 
addition state owned entities still controlled large amount 
assets and wealth transactions those assets did not all 
require credit facilitation certain transactions were done 
based government orders the government continues 
drive asset transactions via market oriented formats more 
credit and money supply was needed facilitate such 
transactions 
shown exhibit the pickup activities 
example rising business transactions that not generate 
large gdp that year 
source ceic morgan stanley research 
business transactions related services and 
consumption still underestimated under china current 
gdp calculation method 
detailed study done our strategy and economic research 
team concluded that consumption meaningfully understated 
chinese gdp this also line with our analysis 
consumption related payment data please refer appendix 
page this report for more details 
addition believe services and which has 
increasingly become larger part chinese business activities 
are also under represented under the current method gdp

development alternative financing channels and 
fluctuation shadow banking activities 
believe this has been key driver fluctuation 
payment value many alternative financing channels require 
multiple payment transactions complete financing activity 
that can done via one payment transaction the regular 
financing channel for details please see our report march 
china banks asia insight the new financial 
channels what will scrutinized how and when 
notably have observed accelerated growth alternative 
financing channels shadow banking activities and 
which corresponded with much higher growth 
payment transactions followed slower payment value 
growth and with some shrinkage shadow 
banking activities due regulatory scrutiny 
exhibit 
interbank assets the biggest driver alternative 
financing channels also posted much higher 
growth and line with payment value 
payment data may suggest even healthier business 
activities when fluctuations shadow banking 
activities are smoothed out 
growth noncash payment amounts yoy slowed 
the low teens following year excessive growth 
due higher shadow banking activities however believe 
growth payment transactions related real business 
activities likely remained much higher maybe around 
when adjusting for payment transactions related 
shadow banking activities those payment transactions are 
not used support any business activities the real 
economy 
this level payment value growth was achieved when real 
estate and fixed asset investments were also slowing which 
may suggest stronger growth new economic areas

addition growth the number transactions remains high 
but each transaction has become smaller even for large

data bank card consumption growth are another 
interesting set observations that also support our view that 
business activities could better than reported indicators 
total bank card related payment value slowed notably 
amid slower growth transactions related cash 
deposits withdrawals but consumption related bank card 
payment remained high yoy despite some slowdown 
exhibit 
growth consumption with bank cards still high 
believe could reflect the ongoing change consumption 
structure china consumption includes not only consumer 
goods but also services recreation healthcare etc 
see possibility that service related consumption could 
growing more rapidly than consumption consumer goods 
acknowledge that the data for both retail sales and bank 
consumption value are not perfect both data sets include 
some wholesale related transactions addition certainly 
believe some the gap between bank card consumption and 
retail sales reflects greater penetration card usage 
however given the cap both growth rate 
and total value just found bit 
hard explain this just more penetration payments 
particularly when bank card penetration rate slowed 
exhibit 
penetration bank cards close china
