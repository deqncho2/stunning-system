established payment companies have been willing accept expanding valuations especially low rate 
environment believe that potential incremental investors remain sidelined disruption concerns for 
challenger companies like and pypl believe that current valuations well balance the opportunities 
afforded continued growth with the likely limitations that growth 
the pace electronic adoption over the past few years was consistent with expectations growth but 
slower than our forecast see exhibit this performance our forecast informs our view the 
payments industry that any changes the status quo are likely steady and predictable allowing 
incumbents withstand and ultimately opt most efforts disruption believe that the incumbent tends 
win view enabled key aspects 
adoption cycles are very long making surprising disruption difficult even see good continued 
secular shift electronic payments around the world the reality that the growth mobile payments 
developed markets well the adoption electronic payments emerging markets has not tracked better 
than expected most cases the steady and predictable pace adoption makes disruption incumbents 
difficult because they are afforded very long lead times adapt offerings and business processes needed our 
revisit actual adoption rates previous expectations highlighted today note 
disruptive risk overestimated assuming coverage indicates that macro the biggest variable 
and that secular growth can difficult measure let alone drive for key point the somewhat muted 
rate electronic adoption vis vis our estimates from several years ago serves highlight the difficulty 
truly disrupting the incumbent payment ecosystem not mention the carriers abandonment its payment 
effort softcard which was sold google and the still pending launch the merchant backed mcx 
typical efforts disrupt currency payment systems focus primarily redistribution fees that 
for most are negligible besides changes payment behavior being very slow develop find that most 
efforts disrupt the current payment structure are usually intended redistribute traditional interchange and 
may provide some incremental economic benefit merchants and consumers however expect that those 
new schemes are unlikely meaningfully change the payments landscape for key reasons 
are already the low cost networks while lower cost processing may available 
compared that the networks almost always the expense key aspects 
functionality and service time settlement assurance clearing etc have been 
compromised nearly all cases that have examined those new processing networks 
attempt replicate the strengths the capabilities order improve attractiveness 
costs have always ended being excess those that are collected the biggest 
network operators scale matters

exhibit disruptors have seen success creating greenfield market within the existing ecosystem but 
attempts displacing the existing value chain have been more challenged 
rce data rgan stan ley research 
redistribution modest fees consumers difficult because few many 
redistribution fees consumers difficult because the overall savings consumer 
negligible while the potential adverse impact those that are collecting interchange and 
fees considerable concentration benefit will lead more robust defensive behavior 
banks acquirers etc and most consumers are likely find that the potential savings tens 
basis points transaction not worth pursuing especially acceptance other 
assurances are compromised 
merchants paying lower fees probably does not result more profitability fund 
payment change efforts some the biggest pushes for changes transaction processing 
order reduce fees and interchange has come from merchants however remain 
skeptical that such schemes can effective for the simple reason that the more successful 
any merchant based initiative the more likely result reduced feeds for all 
merchants and those transaction costs are reduced for large proportion merchants 
then any savings are likely competed away thereby reducing the ability fund and 
justify the investment the alternative schemes that say believe that the more 
broadly appealing initiatives like mcx merchant customer exchange could the less likely 
sufficiently funded and show continued development 
attempts disruption have ultimately come full circle benefit existing networks believe that 
and are highly defensible position within the payments ecosystem and that they will continue play 
key role even the ecosystem evolves with new technology seen evidence this over the past several 
years most disruptors have either failed take off softcard gained limited traction dwolla and 
the ones that have persisted have almost entirely partnered with the networks and thereby become enablers

mcx highlights 
the mcx consortium comprised leading retailers that together constitute 
retail spend over trillion and its initial goal was launch mobile wallet currenc compete 
head head with credit debit cards better serve the interest merchants but since its formation 
has far changed its model currenc will now accept credit debit funding source instead 
ach only changed its management and delayed its launch multiple times highlighting the difficulty 
herding together group competing merchants with disparate needs currenc has piloted 
several merchants but formal launch date hasn been announced its latest expectations are for 
launch 
regulation persists biggest wild card but incumbents tend have the most influence view 
that regulatory changes are the most likely drivers changes the current industry structure indeed have 
seen regulatory mandates that have necessitated structural changes including the durbin act congressional act 
that cut debit interchange fees half the well reduced cross border interchange rates and the 
separation brand and scheme which disallows the bundled sale brand scheme and processing services 
clients the nevertheless expect that these changes are unlikely provide demonstrable evidence 
reduced consumer costs the near term and such think any appetite for incremental regulatory changes 
largely being sated and given the importance payment and financial system stability expect that even 
with the clamor against big banks incumbent institutions are likely retain the most influence 
underappreciated secular beneficiaries even shift not faster than forecast while changes 
the supplier and incumbent structure payment service providers difficult believe that the opportunity 
for companies like and fdc that there are secular shifts that allow for more sustained growth with 
better margin leverage than potential incremental investors appreciated further when compare
