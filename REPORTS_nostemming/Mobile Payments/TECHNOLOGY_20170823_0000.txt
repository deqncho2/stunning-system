potential risk mastercard acquisition vocalink the

banks fintechs offers opportunities broaden revenue streams and offset

the card payment infrastructure 
nutshell 
new directive that amongst many other changes forces banks share 
account data with authorised parties opening bank data 
facilitates two new services payments via direct transfer from the customer 
bank account the merchant parties providing account information and 
aggregation services account holders see small chance these new services 
could disrupt the established card based system and issuing banks particularly for 
online transactions 
starting point the four party payments model 
the traditional four party payments model for card transactions consists the 
merchant the acquirer bank payments company the cardholder and the issuer 
normally bank working association with card scheme such visa mastercard 
this payment model the issuing bank card network and acquirer are paid out the 
merchant discount rate mdr the difference between what the merchant charges 
for goods services paid for with card and the proceeds the merchant ultimately 
receives put simply the merchant that funds all the participants the payments 
landscape merchant acquirer processor card scheme and issuing bank processor 
stages card transaction 
merchant rings transaction for 
acquirer captures details the transaction merchant details card details transaction 
value and runs fraud checks 
acquirer requests the transaction amount from the issuing bank via the card network 
issuer debits consumer account the value the goods and remits the value less 
interchange and network fees the acquirer 
acquirer remits the net amount the merchant less the acquirer fee the 
merchant

breaking down the value chain 
within the roles illustrated the classical four party model there are number 
distinct payment services with different characteristics makes sense separate out 
these functional roles into payments value chain because the simplicity the four 
party model belies the fact that the card payments system can take large variety 
forms and players can take number the following functional roles 
consumer risk issuing banks payments companies provide the consumer with 
payment method your bank sending you credit card paypal providing you with 
online wallet these players hold the customer relationship provide protection 
against fraud provide loyalty schemes and some cases will provide credit the case 
cards this piece the value chain will usually represent the largest part the fees 
data capture transmission this the first step any payment where terminal 
offline gateway online provider will install and run either point sale pos 
terminal offline secure payment webpage gateway online for merchants the role 
simply about securely capturing and relaying the card transaction information the 
other players the four party model these parts the value chain are one the 
most commoditised particularly offline 
processing and authorisation the heavy workload running payments 
infrastructure providing processing and authorisation services this involves running 
platform that operates checking card details relaying information and 
clearing settlement you find different forms these services across all the major roles 
the four party model with acquirers issuing banks and the networks all running large 
processing platforms other than the inherent economies scale this part the value 
chain also largely commoditised 
merchant risk acquiring all merchants accepting visa mastercard card transactions 
must have acquirer who essentially provides insurance that the merchant goes 
bust and customers seek return goods the acquirer will pick the bill acquiring has 
historically been lucrative business the risk bankruptcy has generally been 
overstated and smes pay little attention the fees they are being charged addition 
given the liability they have take the acquirer will often own the merchant 
relationship providing channel through which acquirers can sell value added 
services and other parts the payments value chain 
card payment network infrastructure the card networks are the web linking 
together the merchant acquirer side and the customer issuing bank side the 
payments network the huge barriers trying recreate these networks and limited 
functional role makes this part the value chain highly profitable and well protected 
value added services value added services catch all name for wide range 
add ons payments companies will try sell into merchants this includes software 
terminals for viewing and managing card transactions cash flow financing mobile pos 
terminals omni channel solutions management etc this cross sell the primary 
way payments companies seek offset the commoditisation other parts their 
business

how will change the four party model 
opening bank data parties leads enable new type payment 
provider called payment initiation service providers pisp pisps are institutions that 
initiate payments the instruction the account holder via direct transfer from the 
account holder bank account the merchant payee what differentiates pisps from 
normal bank transfers that these institutions not ever hold the funds they simply 
provide the software link between customer bank account and the merchant 
illustrated below this new method payment attempts disintermediate the card 
networks from the four party model payments will now done via direct transfer 
ordinated the pisp rather than card addition the roles acquirer and issuing 
bank are likely changed pisps move owning the customer relationship and 
processing risk protection adapts direct transfers 
direct transfer payments pisps are initially only likely used for online 
payments authentication and adoption likely prove much harder the offline 
space

our view 
new pisps will struggle gain traction 
disintermediating the current card infrastructure with direct transfers would require not 
only new payments platform but also mass consumer and merchant adoption the 
merchant side smes are likely willing adopt given the potentially significant 
savings over card payment however large merchants will prove harder convince 
cost savings will more limited the consumer side with cards perceived free 
getting adoption will difficult and likely require incentives encourage 
switching further eroding merchant cost savings consumers must also trust the new 
pisps and willing accept lower levels financial protection 
addition also note that under the new general data protection 
regulation gdpr consumers will required give specific consent for their 
personal data shared new rules for companies report data breaches within 
hours and the introduction fines global revenues for non compliance 
likely make consumers more aware which companies they share their data with 
and raise barriers new entrants 
overall expect these issues are insurmountable for new entrant but may 
achievable via cooperation between existing players however believe the incentive 
for the existing players limited 
regional differences across europe will key with the 
likely the most exposed market 
there are significant variations across europe the importance cards the value 
ecommerce and the existing banking payments infrastructure these three factors will 
determine both the potential impact for existing players and how likely 
adopted using data from across countries conclude the the most 
exposed market given its high card use high levels ecommerce consolidated banking 
sector and real time payments infrastructure contrast see less significant 
for germany due limited card use existing direct transfer options sofort and more 
dispersed banking sector theory should facilitate cross border solutions but 
differences regional implementation are likely pose barriers entry 
played right think acquirers could benefit from the transition 
our view only truly changes half the payments network opens 
bank data any authorised party and doing largely removes the network barriers 
entry created having convince issuing banks allow you connect with them 
what does not make easier sign thousands merchants accept 
particular player direct transfer payment method which view the bigger task 
the one exception this the scale acquirers who currently hold these merchant 
relationships and can decide which payment types integrate believe these 
merchant relationships put acquirers the best position out the incumbents 
quickly transition into the role pisp 
network risk from direct transfer mitigated low costs and 
robust fraud prevention 
the core and most profitable businesses the card payments system networks 
potentially have the most lose from shift direct transfers pisp world there 
need for network the traditional sense because the pisp directly transfers 
money between the bank account the customer and the merchant pisps are 
reality the networks the direct transfer world however even direct transfer 
services were offer reduced fees card networks they are unlikely ever have 
lower cost transaction and the card networks can always underprice the challengers 
moreover the networks can with better acceptance and likely lower levels 
fraud nevertheless expect the existing card networks will build their own pisp 
services hedge 
see some tail risk pisps moving into offline payments 
theory see reason why direct transfer pisp model could not combined 
with mobile payment technology such apple pay this scenario customers would 
effectively store their account details the form pisp account their apple pay 
rather than virtualised version their cards this could extend network direct 
transfer payments into the offline world therefore the long term direct transfers 
could start compete with cards virtualised cards offline

how are the payments players positioned 
acquirers 
likely give large acquirers the opportunity spread themselves further along 
the value chain taking the role the bank network however this upside tempered 
the potential for direct transfers hit acquirers traditional card acquiring and 
processing business 
our view acquirers successfully put themselves the centre the pisp world 
would give them dominant position within the value chain which would more than 
offset any reduction card acquiring revenues 
networks visa mastercard 
visa and mastercard could have substantial exposure the extent viable 
direct transfer product takes share from card transactions but the risk low our 
view given the lack consumer incentive switch and the low cost card acceptance 
for large merchants meanwhile both visa and mastercard are making investments 
turn this potential risk into opportunity visa and mastercard are potentially best 
suited offer risk mitigation and authentication tools clients help navigate the 
change mastercard though its acquisition vocalink has positioned itself 
potential leader direct bank ach payments which should allow participate any 
new types payment flows would expect visa also explore potential expansion

the nordic markets therefore parties were enter the market and gain adoption 
nets could see risks its merchant services and financial and network services 
businesses however the fact nets already runs the end end payments infrastructure 
norway and denmark means exceptionally well placed lead facilitate any shift

already cheaper than international card schemes and share many features pisp

eurozone full service payments providers worldline 
think worldline business mix will make one the least exposed see 
the potential pisp opportunity limited worldline relatively small quantity 
customer and merchant facing payments revenue however this also means less

there may impact ingenico gateway business which around

that most merchants will still need technology providers build and maintain online 
payment gateways the case today with number alternative online payment

somewhat exposed the event decline acquiring volumes resulting

alice timperley european banks 
banks have simple choice join the disruption disrupted regardless the fact 
that the final regulatory technical standards rts for are still not set out 
european banks still need demonstrate their compliance with having open 
available apis january progress this front appears somewhat 
heterogeneous with some seeking purely compliant while others seeking map 
out broader operational strategy post world taking the former approach 
think will lead cluster banks morphing into utility data provider and thus 
see their business models highly disrupted while the latter offers the opportunity 
engage with the disruption enabling broader business models and course cultivating 
new revenue opportunities 
the stakes are high client data open real time world very valuable 
commodity its understandable that banks are keeping cards close their chest 
this stage with the january deadline fast approaching banks need plan yet far 
many the banks have yet formally set out their vision the market for fear 
giving too much away other market players that said many recognise that the crux 
this new wave regulation takes aim the very heart their franchise client data 
ownership for the banks the sharper end the development spectrum such the 
nordics large spanish benelux banks are seeing step change managements 
strategic thinking with platform investment and fintech partnerships becoming 
greater focus 
many banks view opportunity rather than threat client ownership 
balance sheet muscle and rich understanding regulation are key positives you 
would expect the banks are spinning this structural industry change opportunity 
rather than threat from the perspective the fintechs they don see them 
meaningful threats given the balance sheet scale and client ownership that they already 
have however they concede that they need operate much possible with the 
fintechs and embrace new customer solutions 
the spectre prompting wave collaborations with fintechs many the 
banks have spoken recognise that leverage their own attributes balance 
sheet scale client ownership and regulatory knowledge that they are going need 
sharpen their front end understanding via partnerships with fintechs already there are 
many partnerships place see exhibit and banks are opening their apis

source insights morgan stanley research 
payment chains and nordics stand out european 
context ripe for disruption but the banks are fighting back 
high ecommerce activity and higher degree card usage mean and nordic 
markets look most risk disruption the clearly stands out both the 
largest ecommerce market and the one with the conditions that would enable 
disruptive pisp adoption consolidated banking sector faster payments infrastructure 
and limited direct transfer use the nordic market too shares similar attributes though 
smaller scale contrast see lower risk disruption countries such 
germany and the netherlands that have relatively low card use online payment options 
that are similar sofort and ideal and are yet fully adopt faster payments 
infrastructure 
bank fee income could risk from erosion though somewhat contained the 
recent implementation interchange fee caps the implementation fee caps back 
late has already dampened banks fee income especially from credit card fees 
which are now capped while the banks don specifically disclose levels 
interchange fees their accounts many the names indicated that fee income fell 
primarily because the new cap interchange the accounts for rbs 
for instance interchange fees fell pbb given this structural shift 
fees the sector already believe that while there are certainly risks further 
erosion they will contained broader group context this supposes course that 
the banks nothing inhibit the growth pisps 
banks have launched their own payment solutions such pingit plus they are 
collaborating with paym bid the front foot barclays launched its own

what can the banks learn from pingit swish ahead 
the next months will critical for banks strategies but they can take heart 
from the successes apps such pingit paym and swish commonalities between 
some the apps far nordics offers lessons for the future and how the banks 
meet the challenge disruption collaboration will key for instance whether with 
other banks the case swish and paym with fintech the case pingit given 
the high degree client ownership banks are able influence their behaviour 
well put together connected product will continue serve well without the need 
explore other options top worth highlighting that world where cyber 
security remains under constant threat the notion sharing information with untried 
untested third party providers still somewhat taboo the banks need capitalise 
this and utilise their balance sheet scale along with input from fintech develop 
truly transformational banking product they are able achieve this they open the 
door many other opportunities support and grow their revenue streams 
but don expect significant change banking landscape january 
without clarity the final rts don expect see step change offerings come 
january whilst the apis will available with all regulation think the 
devil the detail and such think that pisps and banks alike will wait for the 
final standards plus course observe what others are doing the changes proposed 
certainly signify transformational change ahead though the current detail proposed 
presents some roadblocks being real force for change banking which for 
now errs the favour the banks least the near term 
key details 
implementation underway but likely delayed 
the european union payments services directive will have potentially 
significant implications for acquirers processors banks card networks and merchants 
operating the the final text was agreed the end but the legislation still

open access for authorised parties bank data 
will force banks release customer account data any party that 
authorised the relevant regulatory authority and has permission the account 
holder this data expected released via apis application programming 
interfaces created the banks and which parties can connect apis are software 
interfaces that provide standardised link portal into information contained back end 
databases and systems banks will not allowed discriminate between authorised 
parties they will also prevented from requiring contractual relationship with 
the parties the aim create level playing field data access for both 
incumbent and new potential payment service providers psps 
also note that the european general data protection regulation gdpr will come 
into force may giving consumers new rights over their data and introducing 
significant fines this could some extent limit the benefits one the key 
changes that consumers will have provide clear consent for sharing their data with 
third parties and have the right withdraw consent believe this will mean 
consumers will more focused which companies they share their data with and 
highlight exhibit only banks are trusted the majority consumers 
facilitate payments 
new type regulated psp 
opening bank data parties leads expand the types firms that will 
regulated under the directive include payment initiation service providers pisp 
pisps are institutions that initiate payments the instruction the account holder via 
direct transfer from the account holder bank account the merchant payee what 
differentiates pisps from normal bank transfers that these institutions not ever 
hold the funds they simply provide the software link between customer bank 
account and the merchant therefore pisps will share many similarities with current 
direct transfer methods such sofort germany and ideal the netherlands the 
exception here will that new pisps will not employ screen scrapping techniques 
where the provider given unrestricted access bank account the user 
contrast pisps will given limited access the details the bank account via api 
the discretion the customer order facilitate the initiation payments 
what would direct transfer payments system look like 
the major change from card transaction pisp transfer that the roles the card 
networks and acquirers would removed the traditional sense addition there will 
number other changes where liability sits how authorisation occurs and the 
roles the participants currently can only speculate the final details how 
pisps will operate but given the current state the regulations think the most 
likely scenario 
liability issuing banks the bank that the customer holds account with will 
continue take the liability for fraud responsibility for incorrect miss processed 
transactions will then split between the issuing bank and the pisp depending who 
committed the error the key unresolved issue who anyone will take the 
acquiring risk the risk customers will demand money back from bankrupt merchants 
may end that some pisps charge higher fees and cover acquiring risk and others are 
cheaper but with less protection pisps will take liability for errors they will 
required hold indemintiy insurance against such losses however the structure 
these insurance contracts and their cost still largely unknown but likely play 
important role the profitability these companies 
roles who actually performs the functions pisp transaction very uncertain all 
the major current payment service providers acquirers networks issuing banks 
have characteristics that would make them good pisps banks currently own the 
customer relationships acquirers own the merchant relationship and networks are 
trusted and experts managing complex networks connections all these would 
needed make pisp finally fintech companies are likely enter this space 
seeking disintermediate the existing players therefore could see world which 
issuing banks are reduced simply balance sheet they could expand into providing 
end end payments ever payments building the network will the key for any 
player 
authentication the text states that the case fraud the payee the 
merchant accepting the payment will liable does not accept strong 
authentication equally the consumer will not liable for any losses their payment 
service provider does not facilitate strong authentication depending the 
interpretation this rule could imply all transactions will require higher level 
authentication than currently the case the directive defines strong authentication 
follow 
strong customer authentication means authentication based the use two 
more elements categorised knowledge something only the user knows possession 
something only the user possesses and inherence something the user that are 
independent that the breach one does not compromise the reliability the others 
and designed such way protect the confidentiality the authentication 
data article directive 
particularly the online world simple authentication crucial for achieving the balance 
between low fraud and high transaction completions direct transfers from someone 
bank account end requiring substantially higher authentication than normal card 
transactions this could represent meaningful barrier adoption however see 
little reason why the new pisps only have restricted access there would necessarily 
need this distinction would expect see set different transaction 
thresholds each requiring different levels authentication have with contactless 
cards today

clearly ideal and sofort giropay have seen success their domestic markets and 
doing demonstrate the viability account account payment mechanisms these

issues 
liability ideal and sofort giropay are largely irreversible from when the transaction 
authorised and not allow chargebacks providing consumers with much more limited 
consumer protection than credit card this also true new pisp payments 
believe could represent meaningful barrier adoption for consumers who are used 
credit debit protections and chargebacks 
commerce but not offline both sofort giropay and ideal are predominantly used 
for online transactions believe this reflection the technological difficulty 
account account systems would face tried move into the offline world 
importance culture the netherlands and germany have historically seen much 
more limited adoption cards than the nordic countries this made them fertile 
ground for account account transfers for online payments think pisp success 
likely rely heavily the markets they try enter and would caution that the 
success sofort and ideal may well not accurate guide for heavily card 
penetrated markets such the 
addition surcharging visa and mastercard was also more prevalent germany 
and the netherlands which helped drive adoption account account will ban 
surcharging visa mastercard and doing may remove barrier card use and 
lower demand for account account payments 
four potential pisp worlds 
acquirer driven 
the major acquirers are currently the only players the payments networks have 
close working relationships with large numbers merchants once bank connections 
are open anyone think these merchant relationships that will become the 
major source competitive advantage therefore see acquirers well placed 
set the rails which pisp payment system would run illustrated exhibit 
foresee acquirers adding the role aggregating bank connections currently done

them provide customers with direct transfer payment options once established 
would very hard displace these acquirers just with the card networks today

banks currently hold the customer relationship issuing cards and holding customer 
bank accounts importantly they are also already trusted hold customer details and 
transaction data this means banks are well placed gain rapid consumer adoption 
their pisp payment options however for bank succeed pisp world banks 
would need build merchant relationships which likely prove difficult unless they 
already have large acquiring business question also hangs over whether other
