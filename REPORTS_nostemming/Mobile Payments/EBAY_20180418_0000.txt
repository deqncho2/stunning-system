win win situation for its platform monetization and sellers essence see seller payment fees falling platform 
conversion rising and ebay monetization improving too 
our detailed payments model shows that ebay can generate revenue and ebit even ebay 
chooses reduce seller payment fees more than returning over back sellers also assume that

sizing the ebay payments opportunity 
what will the overall economics look like

this scenario analysis shows ebay has material flexibility its 
merchants believe ebay will generate revenue ultimately 
payments revenue depending how much chooses give back 
through all take rate that offers payment service component 
merchants while payments take rate yields rev 
below the take rate paid currently ebay merchants paypal 
enue and back merchants take rate yields 
ebay stated that this opportunity could lead billion more 
revenue with only back merchants 
which take imply that going charge least 
intend monitor this closely the seller community but our base 
assuming our estimated gmv processed 
case assumes ebay charges merchants generating 
ebay whether branded unbranded generate least 
revenue while still giving its merchants 
more than back most importantly worth noting that this

from consumer perspective the current checkout screen user can select either paypal check out put his her 
debit credit card information check out using paypal times requires additional steps including logging into the paypal 
account off site switching external app for moment which can time consuming entering card information 
consumers have come expect seamless transactions and the new ebay payments model could provide that offering new 
payment methods not currently available apple pay that payment could confirmed using touchid faceid once 
the payment information stored synced mobile payment scenario friction could removed for the customer and the 
process simplified more than ever before 
why the payment mix between branded and unbranded matters from ebay profitability perspective the mix between 
branded and unbranded matters estimate the gross margin profiles for intermediating the processes are very different 
this because the processing costs charged the payment service providers psps this case paypal and adyen are 
different from one another paypal will processing transactions from buyers who have chosen check out through the 
paypal branded option and estimate could charge ebay meanwhile the ebay unbranded checkout option would 
have back end payment service provider acting essentially gateway risk manager acquirer that charges much less 
estimate processing fees high level this results paypal gross margin profile unbranded gross

commentary from paypal management and the fact that the target paypal processed ebay gmv target set the

three reasons why have taken this conservative approach 
expect promoted listings drive companywide take rates higher 
given amazon believe large focus its business and 
than previously expected 
etsy lower core non advertising take rate would rather take 
the promoted listings revenue likely substitutive rather 
than incremental away from third party off platform ads 
would rather more conservative our initial total spend 
assumptions detailed below lastly expect ebay take 
methodical approach about how quickly pushes the business 
emphasizing buyer and seller experience over near term monetization 
incorporate the business expect companywide take 
rates stronger than expected indeed with the addition the

marketplace 
pragmatic approach with our initial ebay expectations some 
current 
prior

lift mentioned above from advertising estimate that take rates will gradually increase over the next four 
there also case made that ebay expands promoted lis 
years prior this leads higher monetization 
tings and removes advertising that directs traffic off the site 
and cash flow across ebay platform 
could lead faster gmv growth more transactions will captured platform this over time could lead faster gmv growth

use ebay marketplace resulting total the take 
direct checkout optional since was launched the justifi 
rate with paypal relatively high the payments industry and some

apple pay could also help with adoption especially with mobile 
apps models just sellers won have choice expect ebay 
users and transactions this could very well become even more 
update its terms and conditions user buyer the platform 
seamless transaction than paypal which could potentially sway 
updating all buyers that transactions will intermediated ebay 
even those who have used paypal over the years design there 
notably this not out the ordinary either other popular apps 
are various design elements that could addressed desktop and 
marketplaces such uber lyft airbnb and netflix all manage the 
mobile make ebay payments the default option put the top
