our view regulatory risk 
several market participants argue that the regulator the payments industry the 
central bank will likely shorten the settlement credit card transactions from the 
current day period something closer international standards days while 
some press articles here have suggested the regulator indeed looking into this the 
central bank has not officially commented the news nor has said plan cut the 
settlement period indeed the works needless say this action could materially 
reduce revenues and income associated with prepayment for merchant acquirers 
brazil pagseguro derives the majority its profits from prepayment 
have different view believe unlikely that the regulator will interfere with 
the current market driven settlement period any time soon our thinking the 
following 
cutting the settlement period would reduce competition the merchant acquiring 
space exactly the opposite what regulators are trying our view all the 
regulatory measures seen over the last five years have been aimed leveling the 
playing field that new smaller acquirers can start operations brazil merchant 
acquiring fixed cost business that requires big investments upfront scale 
paramount achieve profitability this relatively young marketplace with most new 
players operating for less than years most new entrants don have the scale yet 
profitable the transaction business the bulk their profits come from the 
prepayment business where scale not issue increasing the regulatory hurdle 
prepayment would likely put small players disadvantage over their larger peers 
the brazilian acquiring industry challenging for new entrants given the presence 
two mega acquirers that control the market cielo and rede any measure 
that reduces the ability the small guys compete could potentially result less 
competition this would counter what seen the regulator recent years 
brazil payment industry still underpenetrated heavy regulation this early stage 
could negatively impact the proliferation electronic payments 
think that shortening the settlement period cards will end hurting consumers 
presumably something regulator wants why because the day settlement 
period and the interest free installment purchases cards are interconnected and this 
our surprise something that many market participants have overlooked banks 
partly fund interest free installment purchases with the existing day float they have 
all credit cards this has always been the complexity changing the settlement 
period the other side the coin subsidy credit card consumption the float 
eliminated the banks will likely have cut installments add interest rates them 
and increase credit card fees rates order make for the elimination the 
credit card float ultimately hurting consumers interest free installment purchases are 
staple brazilian consumption particularly for big ticket items over the last months 
they amounted billion originations roughly total credit card 
originations 
financial inclusion priority what the regulator and other government agencies 
have said that the ultimate goal the regulatory changes that have transpired the 
payment industry since increase the penetration card payments means 
promote financial inclusion brazil and when comes financial inclusion 
pagseguro certainly stands out the majority its customers did not accept cards 
before struggle with the notion that the regulator could jeopardize pagseguro 
and other similar players sustainability this early stage financial inclusion 
brazil believe that the regulator clearly understands that the bulk the profits 
the new entrants comes from prepayment and that eliminating the day settlement 
period and consequently prepayment profits will probably put many the new small 
acquirers out business this think not sync with the stated goal increasing 
financial inclusion 
most merchants are unaffected the lengthy settlement period cards the 
regulator does not see the urgency act think recall that today only 
around total consumer expenditure brazil done credit cards there are 
only few large merchants that sell the bulk their sales credit cards airlines 
large department stores and supermarkets but for the rest the merchants the 
mid and small size companies that make the bulk the millions merchants 
brazil credit cards represent more than their total sales the amount 
money that tied for days very small arguably irrelevant for their working 
capital needs this why the central bank does not have millions merchants 
asking lobbying for shorter card settlement hence reducing the pressure act large 
merchants complain extent and they are likely behind the recent senate report 
recommending regulatory action more this later that said suspect that this 
point pushing for financial inclusion and proliferation electronic payments 
higher importance the regulator than help handful large multi billion dollar 
merchants that get affected the day settlement period all told think 
are still years away from the point where credit card penetration will level 
where small and mid size merchants are truly disadvantaged the day card 
settlement period then market forces have not taken care this think there 
more regulatory risk the good news that that point most the now small 
merchant acquirers will likely have achieved scale enough profitable the 
transaction business and may have added additional products and services their 
ecosystem prepayment would not longer critical 
the resurgence regulatory concerns probably stems from recent senate document 
recommending shortening the settlement period credit cards indeed the credit card 
parliamentary commission cpi published last month here series suggestions for 
the central bank including the reduction the settlement period from days 
immediately and subsequently gradual reduction the settlement period days 
the following months 
important note that the regulator the payments industry the central bank 
the senate document has power change the regulation only list 
suggestions also several the initiatives proposed have been pushed unsuccessfully 
other congressmen the past nothing new here think further the issues 
raised the cpi are well known and have been analyzed the central bank length 
the past not think this report will spark round rethinking regulatory 
action per our understanding the central bank not even obligated respond 
the cpi report 
cielo management comments during the earnings call have also created 
confusion indeed the company cfo said that the shortening the settlement period 
could happen faster than expected maybe years unclear the 
comments were made because management really thinks there meaningful 
probability that the settlement period will change within the next years the 
comments were made exemplify the different regulatory risk that cielo faces vis vis 
pagseguro and the other new entrants this because prepayment only 
profits cielo versus most the new competitors suspect that the 
latter the case would contradictory for cielo making strong push into 
micromerchant acquiring they are through stelo they thought the prepayment 
business risk given the high cac they will likely face the new venture the ability 
prepayment critical for their return investment

competition risk and underappreciating the operational leverage the payment
