smartphone penetration along with the convergence the 
physical and digital retail environments creating new 
opportunities for electronic payments this opening the 
door for new players enter the payments ecosystem and 
potentially shifting the balance power among current 
players 
mobile payments opportunity growing the 
pie shifting revenue among players 
mobile payments represent opportunity expand 
overall transaction volumes will current volumes 
essentially divided among different fewer players 
think the answer depends part the market developed 
markets may more matter shifting volume but value 
added services such targeted marketing could help expand 
the revenue pie emerging markets are more confident 
mobile payments are expanding opportunities 
developed markets 
mostly shifting transaction volume 
because penetration electronic payments relatively high 
developed countries expect mobile payments 
primarily replace traditional forms electronic payments such 
credit and debit card transactions although mobile 
payments could the margin also help increase penetration 
electronic payments for small ticket transactions such 
fast food which remain predominantly cash based today 
the according the nilson report merchants paid 
approximately billion fees accept card based 
payments exhibit illustrates our estimate how issuers 
networks and payment processors share these merchant 
fees revenue mobile devices become payments 
vehicle new intermediaries such telcos hardware software 
vendors etc are exploring opportunities play role the 
payments supply chain raising questions about how revenue 
streams will divided 
several revenue models are emerging 
wallets such isis sponsored mobile network 
operators mnos are pursuing piece the existing 
economic stream seeking fee from issuers for 
storing payments credentials the secure element 
the phone typically chip with secure microcontroller 
others such the google wallet are seeking new 
revenue opportunities gathering and packaging user 
data help retailers with targeted marketing 
still others including the retailer sponsored mcx are 
looking lower acceptance costs using alternative

come through monetizing the rich data consumer behavior 
that mobile payments are expected generate the 
total transaction related card revenue pool the was 
billion fraction the estimated total advertising

mobile phones payment companies have the opportunity 
leverage captured data for mobile marketing campaigns 
estimate merchants developed countries spent billion accept card based payments which was 
shared revenue among the incumbent players the value

mobile payments the coming battle for the wallet 
mobile payments effect current players 
payment network operators 
the payment network operators are well positioned continue play 
key role facilitating mobile payments although some disintermediation 
risks exist depending what technologies end dominating most 
the known emerging mobile payment schemes rely the networks 
play their traditional role authenticating and authorizing transactions 
however solutions such paypal and dwolla that bypass the network 
operators either partially fully through the use ach automated 
clearing house could take volume from the networks certain emerging 
markets too telecom operators have effectively replaced the networks 
collecting interchange mobile transactions 
mobile wallets should positive near term but see 
disintermediation risks long term too early pick 
winners and losers however expect growth mobile 
wallet solutions positive development for the payment 
networks visa mastercard discover and american 
express helping accelerate the shift away from cash 
checks especially emerging markets expect most 
transactions conducted through digital wallets ultimately still 
ride the network rails and see low risk that ach proliferates 
retail payment solution while paypal has had some 
success driving online transactions ach its funding mix 
from ach its digital wallet has been largely unchanged for 
several years other upstarts such dwolla are also 
seeking gain share this area but our channel checks 
indicate that banks have little incentive promote this funding 
mechanism given risk their interchange revenue streams 
another looming risk the payment networks could the 
merchant customer exchange seems that mcx will use 
code technology for its app for now and think likely 
circumvent the traditional networks favor closedlooped credit ach funded accounts there little history 
retailers cooperating successfully this type venture but 
the participation several large retailers could significantly 
lower the hurdle merchant adoption 
the use mobile point sale acceptance device 
should have positive impact the networks helping 
facilitate the use credit debit cards everyday 
transactions from the perspectives consumers and 
merchants mobile acceptance solutions could particularly 
instrumental driving increased use card based payments 
emerging markets which lack traditional pos 
infrastructure visa expects five year cagr 
mobile payments emerging markets 
finally see mixed impact networks from the use 
mobile devices facilitate loyalty reward programs 
the one hand the networks could play important role 
processing the data needed generate targeted real time 
offers that drive additional sales the recent partnership 
between visa and gap the other hand think new 
mobile payment solutions could lessen the networks ability 
collect transaction data for example when consumers use 
digital wallet operator paypal pay for transaction paypal 
shows the merchant record mastercard the 
network operators realize this potential threat mastercard 
recently instituted staged digital wallet operator fee wallet 
operators such paypal 
issuers 
the issuers role providing funding and authorization funds 
electronic transactions will unchanged our view none the 
potential players the mobile payment ecosystem seem have the 
financial resources ambition compete this role one traditionally 
played banks given that banks are likely remain the primary 
sources funding for mobile wallets when credit cards are used 
fund the wallet believe there limited downside for the group and 
potentially some upside mobile payments increase transaction volumes 
and accelerate the shift away from cash check transactions 
positives for banks issuers 
share gain from cash mobile wallets could help 
consumers shift away from cash checks and bring 
additional transactions onto the axp dfs networks 
addition 
move toward trusted names the mobile payments 
system turns out fragmented consumers will likely 
turn trusted brand names that offer better customer 
service and where the risk fraud perceived low 
banks including axp and dfs would stand benefit 
international opportunity whereas the debate 
developed countries primarily over whether non fee 
payments will gain share from debit credit emerging 
markets provide higher growth opportunity given the 
low penetration card based payment infrastructure 
majority transactions emerging markets are still cashbased emerging markets are likely make the shift 
directly from cash mobile skipping the card phase 
mobile payment providers stand gain share from cashbased transactions given the increasing penetration 
mobile phones banks such axp dfs and which 
already have presence emerging markets stand 
benefit from this trend

debit and credit card payments ach each these 
attributes critical though offers have compelling 
useful for the consumer otherwise they are spam 
they also have frequent enough otherwise they are 
not worth switching payment vehicles 
however believe this negative unlikely happen 
large portion credit card users still need access 
credit and revolve their balances each month even 
under the mobile payments system banks will remain the 
primary providers credit with the only difference being 
that customers load their mobile wallet with their credit

banks can also partner offer customized deals 
closed loop networks like amex and discover can use the

make customized real time offers their customers 
issuers can this too partnering with merchant 
acquirer and network thereby closing the loop 
the jpm partnership announced february 
there are limited disadvantages using cards some 
observers believe the mobile wallet solution looking 
for problem not cumbersome use cards and 
many view funding mobile wallet added step

merchant acquirers 
merchant acquirers levered small merchants may face the highest risk 
disintermediation from mobile pos hardware providers vendors like 
square and paypal see our note survey says square risk acquirers 
minimal for now published october while merchants 
interested mobile pos capabilities may not switch acquirers right 
away the pricing transparency introduced the new entrants may drive 
traditional acquirers discount their services pressuring their margins 
mobile wallets should positive for the merchant acquirers 
driving more transactions their platforms there are 
disintermediation risks however vntv partnership with 
paypal and hpy partnership with isis are examples how 
acquirers are distinctively positioned drive merchant 
adoption some these newer technologies and benefit 
from associated transaction growth that said not all 
acquirers are equally well positioned think acquirers with 
direct distribution model could advantage they 
seek partnerships with these new solution providers 
the use mobile pos acceptance device implies 
risk merchant acquirers the low end the market 
our view merchant acquirers are perceived most risk 
from dongle providers evidenced autumn when 
stock multiples for the acquirers compressed across the board 
following the announcement the square starbucks 
partnership investors became concerned that incumbent 
acquirers would lose market share and face increased pricing 
pressure from new entrants 
think those concerns are overstated and that large 
merchant acquirers will not feel significant impact from 
companies like square least the near term square and 
similar companies evidently have the ability gain significant 
customers shown the billion annualized 
processed volume square has done its short history but 
think the maximum impact could felt the low end 
the market where square transparent pricing model fixed 
fee for card present transactions could create 
pricing pressure for small merchant acquirers that often 
charge higher fees based our checks

expect most emerging payment technologies initially 
target the small merchant market given the ease switching 
providers that end the market smaller merchants may 
also lured new entrants offering free equipment and 
simple pricing structures which could more favorable for 
small ticket transactions than the fees charged merchant 
acquirers that serve smaller merchants such hpy tss

work with acquirers result see increased risk the 
business models isos that target small merchants and this 
could result pricing pressure hpy and gpn are most 
exposed the sme merchant segment and potentially most 
risk hpy has acknowledged losing small ticket merchants 
square the past although recently management stated 
that the company has won back some the lost customers 
none this meant imply that the incumbents are sitting 
still they aren hpy collaborating with mobile payment

products such payroll services could help lower churn 
making harder for customers leave based our 
conversations with industry experts and the evidence our 
october alphawise survey see near term risk 
large merchants moving away from incumbents favor 
emerging platforms security and reliability are very important 
large merchants and few emerging platforms have the 
scale infrastructure cater these clients for instance 
square still has hour customer support which makes 
difficult even for mid sized clients choose the service 
also important note that many these emerging 
solution providers ultimately not process their own 
transactions they typically are aggregators that still use 
processors the back end square transactions are 
processed chase paymentech they could try vertically 
integrate over the long term but for now they are driving 
revenues for the incumbents one exception new entrant 
with the potential take meaningful share the near term 
could paypal has begun create direct relationships 
with the top offline retailers though think has had 
limited success thus far 
overall think the risk acquirers manageable near 
term and they are more likely feel impact trading 
multiples than the bottom line see still significant 
growth opportunities for acquirers the medium term the 
market remains highly fragmented and think traditional 
acquirers would not find much profit the merchants targeted 
new entrants like square evidenced verifone 
decision shut down sail its foray into dongles 
mobile facilitator loyalty reward programs should 
have mixed impact merchant acquirers should 
the networks for similar reasons merchant acquirers 
currently use transaction data primarily for risk and spending 
analysis the new environment they could partner with 
other players the value chain level share data 
create and distribute value added targeted offers 
customers cardholders 
see reduced transactional friction the ability manage 
finances control spending and the ability receive targeted offers and 
promotions the key benefits mobile payments that should drive 
consumer adoption over time however consumer concerns around loss 
privacy security financial transactions could bottlenecks 
today consumers use mobile devices largely for 
showrooming comparing prices store with those 
available the web 
the future expect consumers increasingly use 
mobile devices 
receive direct mobile promotions coupons and loyalty 
programs 
monitor finances and control spending 
authenticate payments 
relevant promotions and loyalty programs are key 
driving consumer adoption wallets long term our 
view the conventional payments value chain 
couponing loyalty schemes are normally fairly blunt 
instrument they are typically merchant led and bear limited 
relevance likely purchases card schemes not typically 
receive sku level data from merchants loyalty programs 
are typically limited cash rebates offers with direct 
association the card brand british airways american 
express example merchants have access sku level 
data transactions but they not normally have access 
purchase history demographic information about the 
cardholder that would enable tailored targeting promotions 
monetizing the role repository customer information 
which can benefit consumers believe mobile wallet 
providers can drive customer preference through loyalty 
programs and targeted promotions they can for instance 
make coupons relevant consumers making them 
timely and predictive based prior purchases other

mobile payments the coming battle for the wallet 
people prior purchases they can further offer coupons that 
can redeemed only through particular payment method 
over time promotions can also funded selling customer 
data merchants despite sensitivities around the question 
selling data believe wallet providers can still frame 
offers drive consumer preference for their payment 
methods furthermore with gps functionalities being 
increasingly embedded mobile phones location based 
offers that send real time offers consumers based where 
they are physically located will likely more meaningful 
trend 
expect increased penetration mobile wallets the 
online space centered existing providers all this 
clearly presupposes high degree trust between the 
consumer and the wallet provider which one reason why 
see high barriers entry the wallet space compete 
with established companies such amazon and paypal 
believe new wallets are likely come from parties who have 
already built trust with consumers visa case 
point 
the success mobile wallets offline commerce will 
depend the consumer offering several wallet 
providers have started make moves into the offline space 
such paypal and square pay with square offering 
believe these players success moving store depends more 
what they offer consumers terms loyalty value than 
the experience the point sale the merchant side 
paypal has introduced card reader pin pad with which 
smaller merchants that not have traditional pos 
infrastructure can accept payments the consumer side 
more relevant for our immediate discussion manufacturers 
pos hardware have started integrate paypal 
acceptance into their latest pos devices authentication 
typically done mobile number and pin code and 
not view this any more convenient than swiping and 
signing chip and pin for standard debit credit card 
ability manage finances could added advantage 
unlike traditional payment methods that provide limited ability 
monitor finances while shopping mobile payments can 
empower consumers check their balances prior making 
purchase brick and mortar retailer thus given them better 
control over their finances moreover the ability load 
multiple payment methods onto mobile phone will allow for 
greater flexibility choosing the most desired payment 
method complete transaction view this valuable 
attribute for consumers case point being the success 
debit cards which are seen effective budgeting tool 
merchants retailers 
view merchants overall beneficiaries the trend toward mobile 
payments the ability capture transactional data and use 
increase consumer engagement through targeted offers and promotions 
should help drive incremental sales expected returns should justify any 
incremental investments required enabling mobile payments 
technology that said the cost accepting these new payment methods 
likely remain concern 
merchants and consumers have main priority when 
comes introducing new point sale technologies 
our view both expect the method payment itself present 
low barrier possible satisfactory purchase 
practice this means that merchant should able accept 
and wants accept whatever payment method the 
customer chooses use and that this should entail little 
time and effort possible the point sale 
mobile payment presents opportunities for merchants 
especially collecting information about consumers 
the standard payments value chain merchants have skulevel data see the type payment method used and know 
the size the total purchase however they receive little 
demographic information about the consumer about 
purchasing habits beyond single basket result 
couponing and loyalty schemes are rather haphazard 
promotions are often redundant inconvenient for 
customers one way look how many partially filled

providers drive consumer and merchant adoption 
tokenization enables card present interchange fees for digital 
wallets removing major hurdle merchant acceptance 
based our analysis the mobile wallet space 
outline four potential scenarios for pos transaction 
technology and customer adoption digital wallets think 
the key parameters for these scenarios are whether not 
mobile wallets are primarily cloud based hardware based 
and whether the market fragmented concentrated 
among few key wallet providers

implications believe incumbent card networks would 
most advantaged the proliferation hardware based 
authentication for mobile payments favors players with 
existing interests chip based technology for markets 
where chip based transactions are already the norm store 
europe asia china latin america the impact may 
neutral however adoption chip authentication new 
markets the china lowers fraud costs those markets 
and savings may only partially belatedly passed 
consumers and merchants this should sustain profitability 
for card networks issuers and possibly acquirers way 
illustration according the nilson report the generated 
only total transaction volume but accounted 
for global card fraud losses the only market 
where counterfeiting activity continues rise consistently 
merchants are also likely long term beneficiaries our 
view believe lower fraud costs resulting from chipbased authentication will mean overall system costs are 
lower this should translate into lower merchant discount 
rates mdrs over time partly result ongoing 
regulatory pressure industry costs but also due the 
consolidated market merchants would also able 
partner with existing providers offer coupons discounts via 
mobile wallets there potential revenue upside for 
merchants from increasing proliferation mobile payments 
view this scenario relatively neutral for analytics 
companies there would some opportunities generally for 
incumbents however chip based authentication would 
mean that aggregating data remains challenge unless the 
card networks change some element authentication 
protocols merchants would not have access customer 
demographic data and issuers would not see sku level 
information 
also view this scenario neutral for tsms and other 
enabling business models for chip based nfc mobile 
payments there would some opportunities for these 
players provisioning secure elements whether the 
sim card embedded the mobile handset the inclusion 
chip based security could also open the door several 
other nfc based applications for transit corporate 
security etc however the number opportunities this 
scenario likely low consumers would likely load only 
one mobile wallet onto smartphone the consolidated 
nature the market also likely would mean that incumbents 
issuers card networks retain significant leverage over 
tsms the economics there would some scope for 
gemalto oberthur and others sell high end multi tenant 
sim cards though believe these would see significant 
deflation before mass adoption this scenario 
this scenario neutral for pos providers nfc 
functionality already being rolled out many markets 
including the and has only modest positive impact 
asps payment acceptance would not become any more 
complicated given the emv compatible landscape and 
consolidated market 
believe cloud based wallet providers would more 
challenged this scenario thus far these players models 
have been based one two formulas either basing the 
wallet cheaper funding mechanism such ach direct 
debit disintermediating card networks using their position 
both sides the transaction effectively both issuing and 
acquiring analyze consumer data with view 
monetizing via promotions neither these models would 
possible for third parties scenario where the 
incumbents dominate and authentication chip based 
also believe telcos would challenged this scenario 
least terms entering the mobile payments space 
there would still some opportunities the sim rental 
model where telcos own secure element the sim card 
and rent this out third parties incumbent issuers this 
case however with the opportunity set for tsms and

opportunities and the economics sim rental may not offset

mobile payments the coming battle for the wallet 
the case for hardware based cloud based ecosystem 
view widespread adoption consumers crucial 
the long term success any payment method adoption 
consumers think what ultimately will drive more 
merchants accept payment method 
however technical and security standards are likely 
influence heavily what payment methods are available 
consumers emv europay mastercard visa has become 
global standard for card payments the early stages 
being rolled out the and china and has reduced fraud 
substantially markets where has been rolled out the 
case for nfc based mobile payments rests the fact that 
many cases would make use existing emv infrastructure 
introducing online mobile payment methods the offline 
space thus carries security risk for merchants banks 
the rise commerce online banking and wallets more 
generally has disrupted security standards for payment 
online business empirically less secure than traditional 
methods payment yet strong growth commerce has 
driven merchants accept business through online channels 
despite higher fraud risk 
the central point the debate whether mobile wallets will 
gain traction the bricks and mortar world whether 
convenience and consumer preference will drive merchants 
accept form payment that inferior cash and cards 
from security point view and bear the resulting costs 
offline payment still constitutes the bulk transactions developed markets introducing card not present 
forms payment into the offline environment must raise 
aggregate fraud costs most online payment providers have 
proprietary least semi proprietary fraud prevention 
technologies which they seek differentiate themselves 
however aggregate statistics offline online fraud show 
that fraud rates for card not present transactions are higher 
what defines card not present transactions cardpresent transaction one which the cardholder 
physically present with the card the time that the payment 
made the alternative card not present transaction 
which most common for online transactions 
telephone mail order the transaction less secure because 
the merchant acquirer cannot confirm the cardholder 
possession the card when the transaction made 
lines are becoming blurred however from security point 
view transaction which the consumer physically 
present the shop but makes transaction using 
online mobile wallet deemed card not present this means 
that the merchant pays higher fee offset higher fraud 
costs for all online transactions regardless the actual fraud 
costs this type transaction card associations and other 
related parties contend that online wallets are easier hack 
than the security protocols around payment cards justifying 
the higher charge 
the main advantage card present transactions from 
security point view that they enable two factor 
authentication essence this requires two independent 
factors confirmed before transaction authorized 
these factors are based something the cardholder 
knows and something the cardholder has security 
standards such emv chip and pin have arisen around 
this make the two independent factors secure 
possible 
strong two factor authentication these terms are 
often used interchangeably but technically they have different 
meanings two factor authentication more secure than 
strong authentication because requires that one factor 
confirm identity physical possession the card the 
user 
strong authentication normally involves two independent 
variables being interrogated before authentication granted 
other features strong authentication can include not having 
reveal the entire password part the process selected 
characters possession something card 
two factor authentication there normally dynamic 
element involved least one stage the process 
the ecb has formal policy introduce strong 
authentication for all online payment service providers psps 
and issuers february discuss these 
requirements which are for online and mobile credit card 
transactions including mandates wallets store value

mobile payments the coming battle for the wallet 
the advantages strong authentication 
the main aim strong authentication increase 
security and reduce fraud costs payment processing costs 
can significant factor for retailers issuers and acquirers 
absorb risks around fraud consumer credit merchant 
solvency etc and ultimately pass them back the system 
the form charges mdrs the case acquirers 
interchange the case issuers this why merchants 
pay higher charges process credit card transactions than 
debit card transactions 
fraud can substantial component costs fraud rates 
for online transactions can run around transaction 
values retailers have generally accepted this cost part 
expanding their business include commerce however 
payment methods traditionally associated with commerce 
start used store the increase fraud rates would 
affect the ultimate mdr paid the merchant this the 
main reason why card networks and banks have sought 
build ecosystem for payment around mobile handsets that 
has similar levels security that being adopted most 
the world and coming the and china that emv 
standards 
there are also collateral benefits introducing strong 
authentication for mobile payment from the perspective 
the card networks first keeping control hardware 
authentication standards the card networks make more 
difficult least more costly for new third parties enter 
the ecosystem second the presence secure element 
similar that regular chip card tandem with nfc 
chip the handset results authentication process 
identical that used with the contactless payment cards 
already being rolled out many parts the world this 
means the same pos infrastructure could used accept 
payments would expect this become more apparent 
the migrates emv chip cards over the next several 
years our conversations with pos terminal vendors indicate 
that almost all the terminals being sold the today are 
emv compliant include chip readers and many also 
include nfc 
proponents nfc argue that nfc based wallets provide 
faster and easier tap and go consumer experience 
while enhancing payments security consumers credentials 
are securely stored the secured element mobile device 
thereby protecting against skimming and 
compromise account information with other mobile 
wallets multiple payment options can stored inside the 
nfc wallet the technology also lends itself serving 
customized offers and coupons users based their 
spending patterns research also claims that such 
contactless payments technology can help increase the 
frequency and average ticket size transactions 
representing distinct advantage for merchants

security advantage case study france

for card present transactions card not present

the implications for mobile payment are clear our view 
fraud levels could significantly higher the point sale

online transactions holding other factors constant 
assume that shifting today card present transactions

very strong proposition from security point view are 
also among the more expensive solutions implement 
what are the alternatives hce and tokenization

savings can quickly consumed incremental costs 
the example above total cost savings from introducing 
higher levels emv type security compared simpler 
weak authentication could million retail 
pos transactions migrate mobile savings could double 
that amount transactions migrate mobile strong 
bull case our view the incremental cost the rollout 
the bank would consist setup fees the network and tsm 
per year sim rental cost from the network 
provisioning cost from the tsm plus another per year 
service cost from the tsm applied across large portion 
the issued base cards france believe costs this 
level could rapidly consume most not all the savings 
costs could amortised more widely more service

the point sale square move its deal with starbucks 
introduce visual recognition the point sale one such 
method the online fraud rates above also include 
significant portion transactions where only card details not 
even password would needed authenticate the 
other hand the increased fraud cost above could 
underestimate total system costs that wallet players would 
presumably have invest additional security measures 
the offline environment order compete this space 
with android kitkat google has introduced new 
platform support secure nfc based transactions through 
host card emulation hce the system uses software 
emulate emvco type smartcards and can used for 
payments loyalty programs card access transit and other 
custom services the system requires the mobile handset 
have nfc controller but not necessarily secure element 
although believe would support the latter other 
words hce has the potential bypass the tsm secure 
element infrastructure which mobile networks are seeking 
base their mobile payment solutions 
hce relatively untested the broader environment 
however believe has the potential offer lower cost 
alternative service providers seeking incorporate 
payment functionality into android mobile applications 
not believe google seeking monetize its hce activity 
directly the way for instance that mnos and tsms are

tokenization 
tokenization not new concept but gained more serious attention 
during the conference las vegas when visa 
mastercard and american express announced proposed tokenization 
framework simplify the consumer experience and enhance security for 
mobile and online shopping 
tokenizing payment data would better protect cardholder information 
reduce fraud using alternate identifier payment token 
substitute for the card number and other cardholder authentication data 
for given combination consumer issuer merchant ultimately 
reducing fraud risk and its associated costs networks could then 
potentially reduce eliminate the card not present surcharge reducing 
interchange issuers and total revenue cost the ecosystem the party 
responsible for tokenizing and maintaining customer account data has 
not been determined but our view will likely reside with issuers

google wallet according survey conducted 
comscore late google wallet the second most 
used digital wallet that said believe google still 
experimenting with the product and the early stages 
solving merchant and consumer adoption issues 
the merchant side google wallet has experimented with 
nfc technology and combining with some elements 
cloud authentication nfc would most likely require 
merchants purchase new pos terminals 
the consumer side google wallet offline payment 
capabilities are enabled only certain android devices that 
have nfc iphones not have nfc capabilities though 
available apple ios limiting the use case its product 
for iphone consumers 
not believe that google intends replace truly 
disrupt the payment landscape rather think google 
wallet will another layer top the current payment 
system our view google primary motivation behind its 
mobile wallet effort gain transactional information which 
would use bolster its online mobile advertising business 
google could use store shopper level data close theloop and prove out the roi merchants and brands that 
online mobile impressions drive purchases 
drive consumer adoption google wallet links google 
offers which gives consumers access deals and discounts 
from retailers additionally google recently announced 
card based wallet product partnership with mastercard 
consumers can use the google wallet card anyplace 
mastercard accepted similar debit card funds are 
then deducted from the balance the google wallet account

solution while this joint venture has yet formally launch 
product believe its solution focused delivering 
compelling value proposition merchants and consumers 
and restoring balance the payments ecosystem which 
merchants view heavily tilted toward networks and 
issuers 
mcx primary objectives 
lower cost acceptance mcx seeks fund 
majority transactions using ach could pass the

protecting merchants interest securing and 
monetizing consumer data mcx promises not 
monetize the data holds and give merchants the 
ability control their own transaction data not 
shared with competitors 
common consumer experience common 
experience across merchants seen important 
driver consumer adoption the plethora mobile 
platforms available have added consumer confusion 
and slowed adoption mobile payments 
estimate that adoption the merchants that are part mcx will 
drive payment volume away from the networks mcx 
according available statistics merchants that are part the mcx joint 
venture have over trillion aggregate annual sales volume 
estimate that adoption mcx its merchants members could drive 
payment volume away from the incumbent networks mcx 
this optimistic scenario our view assumes that consumers 
that adopt mcx shift all their spending these retailers mcx 
think our assumption adoption among smartphone users may 
also relatively optimistic 
assumptions assume that the volume the mcx retailers 
transacted via credit debit card roughly line with the average for 
the whole this funded via debit cards given 
smartphone user penetration assume this spending 
made smartphone users assuming these smartphone users 
adopt the mcx wallet over first three years launch similar 
penetration rates for target redcard this represents billion shift 
payment volume away from the networks mcx their total 
purchase volume 
preliminary information available mcx indicates that visa 
mastercard and the other payment networks may 
excluded from this retailer led digital wallet that looking 
establish its own mobile payment network using ach the 
funding source follows that any traction that mcx gains 
could represent risk for the incumbent payment network 
operators while the participation several large scale 
retailers could reduce the adoption hurdles the merchant 
side think that consumer adoption will uphill task 
and require substantial incentives bigger and better than 
those offered incumbent providers remains unclear 
how mcx will fund such incentives and operate lower 
cost support significantly lower pricing model while

our view the carriers face uncertain path 
monetization isis mobile wallet this raises key 
question around the carriers role within the mobile 
payment ecosystem will the carriers just provide wireless 
connectivity for mobile payments will they able 
monetize the service other ways transaction fees 
profit sharing see limited upside the carriers 
primarily provide connectivity for mobile payments not 
see significant upside profitability this scenario given that 
the service would not require substantial amount data
