there the regulatory response has been slower and regula 
payments currently one the most 
dynamic segments financial services 
see disruption but will differ across 
markets 
tors are also having balance the opportunity for greater 
financial inclusion addition banks charge more for simple 
transactions this provides the opportunity for non bank 
players like telcos the philippines and independents 
indonesia 
indonesia possibly more risk cite the pres

challenge for banks but the threat new entrants has spurred 
both financial institutions and regulators into action the proximity

the industry and regulators response has been the development 
real time payments everywhere except indonesia are now seeing 
overall see banks losing value across 
apps built out around this paynow singapore promptpay thai 
asean non bank operators with telcos gaining 
land other innovations such codes are expected further 
and independents gaining 
drive disruption 
consumers will gain the balance this value transfer 
through lower transaction fees the value transfer expected 
many periods rapid change often see the development 
particularly beneficial for globe the philippines and telkom 
curve period slow initial adoption user group fol 
indonesia where see move into payments adding 
lowed rapid acceleration before the product matures 
market value 
believe this curve now occurring cashless payments asean 
other markets have seen this develop two ways 
whilst the banks lose revenue project that they will able 
recover value cost savings from the digitalization 
china where financial infrastructure was less developed 
payments hence the net impact will gain 
market share shifted from the banks new entrants mainly 
value with singapore banks the biggest winners and indonesian 
alipay and tenpay both which received high levels 
banks the biggest losers consequence this see singa 
cross subsidization from parents over long period time 
pore banks potentially earning higher roe than indonesian banks

market view the market has yet consider this 
opportunity there plenty discussion regarding the 
move increase payments and potential savings from 
digitization but not think the market has yet 
focused valuing the potential impacts these 
changes our view that earnings estimates not fully 
take into account revenue risks indonesia and the 
income loss offset cost benefits 
see net value creation 
for the banks overall with potential value 
loss for indonesian and 
philippine banks 
philippines the flip side they not take into 
why are considering this topic our view are already seeing 
account the potential cost benefits especially 
many changes the asean payments market both new entrants 
singapore 
look exploit falling barriers entry and governments push 
earnings estimates not take these risks into account 
agenda make payments easier and less costly see five main 
share prices certainly don valuations dbs and ocbc 
issues for the banks from these developments 
the positive side and mandiri and bri the 
negative side are most exposed 
negative risks 
our view yes especially for philippine and indonesian 
banks but also for the singaporeans see two main 
risk income payment and remittance fees get eroded 
issues for the banks from digitization 
risk income competition for deposits increases 
loss payments revenues this not particularly 
important for singaporean and malaysian banks and 
longer major issue for the thai banks but for those who 
doubt whether this could issue elsewhere 
increased competition product channels possibly affecting 
ability sell third party products such insurance even 
challenging banks own channels for example loan origination 
recommend looking thai bank earnings forecasts and 
share price performance when the issues discussed 
this report were major driver performance think 
indonesian and philippine banks are risk similar fate 
over the next years 
potential cost synergies from lower cash handling and 
physical distribution singaporean banks are particularly 
well placed benefit from this 
positive risks 
potential benefits from cost savings 
revenue upside from increased financial inclusion especially 
digitization reduces the unit cost delivery for financial 
services products making economical offer products 
with smaller ticket size addition see scope for industry 
consolidation which could benefit individual banks although 
where could wrong this report argue that 
not all the players each market finally note potential 
regulation will play large part driving the pace 
for new revenue streams from creation ecosystems 
change this has been particularly clear thailand 
change the regulatory outlook elsewhere could slow 
conclusion upfront 
down the speed which non banks take share 
addition cultural factors propensity give 
cash could also play role influencing the pace 
which things change 
the cost side note that management teams have 
the most likely net losers are the philippine and indonesian 
banks not believe this reflected either earnings

the banks most likely win are the singaporean banks this

our view payments are important bank for three main reasons 
region force banks both open their payments networks and make them interoperable this fostering 
they represent source fee income 
increased competition 
they offer source customer data 
addition central banks have sponsored the creation free 
real time payments initially these were limited small pay 
they are gateway deposit products the other being

governments have been actively publicising these new

potentially most risk from lower payments incomes are unsure 
how quickly these banks will cannibalised increasing mobile

thailand thai banks are showing some the lowest cost growth 
have offset revenue pressures with cost cuts incorporate 
asean line with their low inflation economy expect that 
these concerns our base case estimates

similar the opportunities see for asean telcos their markets 
however these opportunities will not necessarily each exist every 
market either because regulatory constraints this because 
money transfer payments this mostly cash trans 
fers but also includes transfers like payment salaries 
another player has already seized exhibit shows the opportunities market 
pesa charges commission this money transfer 
which then shared with agents incentivize them 
remittance this simply the transfer cash from the local country 
promote and use the pesa product 
other country the telco makes money from this transaction 
mobile bill payment payments this using pesa 
charging fee and spread the transaction this revenue 
buy goods and services the merchant then charged 
opportunity has been dominated banks and pure play remittance 
accept payment using this product the customer using 
services like western union exists all asean markets but 
pesa not charged 
clearly much larger singapore because the larger volume 
banking pesa offers micro savings credit and insurance 
remittance transactions 
partnership with equity bank pesa will paid the 
bank for successful referrals 
airtime customers can still buy airtime for their mobiles 
across the platform 
unfortunately this window opportunity already closing fintech 
players which may charge only very small transaction fee and make 
money the spread are moving transferwise example 
this 
pesa success now very important value driver for safaricom 
covered morgan stanley analyst madhvendra singh equal 
payments all the telco operators with wallet operations with 
weight recommendation price target per share now repre 
which have spoken believe there opportunity for them win 
sents safaricom current valuation clearly this goal for 
market share the payments market however are far less 
asean telcos this market also 
bullish than the telcos and see little opportunity this business 
singapore and malaysia 
morgan stanley research 
believe that over time payments will purely become revenue and 
our discussions with incoming media advertising firm with focus 
cost neutral for telcos because already these markets there are 
app mobile advertising which has relationship with globe 
payment platforms with either zero very low cost like fast 
suggests they can generate per month adver 
singapore and promptpay thailand and the only players who 
tising arpu 
shall able charge for this product will the large players with 
significant market share like visa mastercard paypal and applepay 
estimate that telcos could also monetize the data they collect 
indonesia thailand and the philippines all have low rates credit 
from their customers selling referral bank for loan 
card usage population per market thus they are seen 
insurance product depending the market the 
markets where wallets from telcos could gain share 
wallet customer becomes strong user the product then the 
telco would able estimate the customer salary and creditwor 
agree with regard both the philippines and indonesia note 
thiness which could then sold referral bank believe this 
that the opportunity indonesia also dependent regulation 
opportunity will largest markets where credit card and bank 
this because november bank indonesia introduced new 
account penetration low the philippines indonesia and thailand 
electronic payments regulations for the first time these captured 
wallets payment gateways and other services supporting pay 
lending the final revenue opportunity for telcos for wallets 
ment systems licensing approval and reporting requirements will 
lending the formation loans consumers believe this 
now apply wallets and payment gateways this led indosat 
opportunity really exists only markets where banking penetration 
sell its wallet operations because this high cost regulation 
very low namely indonesia bank account penetration and 
axiata has also emphasized the product 
the philippines bank account penetration 
tlkm has gained license for its tcash product along with other 
however because the changes regulation indonesia and the 
firms but are watching the regulatory front very closely 
restrictions providing new banking licences not think this 
opportunity for telcos there rather see this opportunity 
advertising data analytics see two ways for telcos make 
existing only the philippines the recent investment globe 
money here 
mynt financial wallet ant financial and ayala suggests that 
they also see the opportunity payments 
simple advertising placing ads within the wallet 
using the data collected from the underlying customers then

strengths and weakness the telcos 
the wallet market 
telcos key competitive advantages the wallet market include 
existing relationships with end users 
wide reach consumers through national network 
before address the competitive advantages telco wallet 
ability manage and secure payments across the network 
peers offerings there are number compelling reasons why 
being deemed trusted provider 
telcos are moving into this area these include 
these advantages mean that markets where there low banking 
new revenue stream potential share the fees 
penetration mobile wallets could benefit from strong network 
tool increase customer acquisition 
effect and increase rapidly adoption 
increased data traffic which could drive arpu increases 
reduced churn 
unfortunately telcos also have number weaknesses this 
reduced billing costs 
market 
enhanced brand image 
lack expertise dealing with financial regulations 
but telcos are not alone entering this market the competition for 
lack knowledge financial products and risks 
telcos comes from three distinct areas 
established infrastructure for payments and money 
transfer system like banks 
banks which are creating their own wallets and linking 
credit and debit cards these wallets 
handset manufacturers like apple with its apple pay which 
takes portion credit card payment fees 
valuation the telcos wallet 
opportunity 
commerce platforms like amazon with its closed wallet 
just use amazon pay tokopedia semi open wal 
global payment platforms currently trade sales 
lets and paypal with its open wallet use everywhere 
this multiple held until and apply multiple 
telco wallet revenue then estimate the opportunity 
while telecom operators and handset manufacturers have the 
worth for the five asean markets 
greatest customer base credit card companies and independent card 
issuers have well established retail networks the banks another 
important player carry comprehensive financial infrastructure that 
essential for processing financial transactions

from global perspective singapore sits terms ability 
invested heavily for example their apps score relatively well cus

infrastructure ranked third globally after the and switzerland 
addition the revenues risk are relatively small with some off 
but its scores are capped the age its population and limited 
sets pressures expected from increased card usage the cost 
scope benefit from increased financial inclusion certainly relative 
side believe that the singaporean banks are already position 
indonesia and the philippines scope for banks consolidate 
benefit from past investment and reap digitization savings our
