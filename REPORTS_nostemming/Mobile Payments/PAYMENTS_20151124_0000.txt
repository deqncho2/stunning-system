opportunity social commerce retail transactions driven through online 
social networks only make total ecommerce sales and 
total retail sales it small because our view shopping still emerging 
online social network use case but ecommerce penetration grows from 
estimated and the annual pool ecommerce 
grows from per year see social shopping being 
materially larger distribution channel 
takeaways for payments companies view buy buttons generally 
positive for payment companies they could accelerate the growth online 
and mobile commerce visa and mastercard stand out the key 
beneficiaries our view however for certain companies such paypal the 
increased adoption buy buttons presents both opportunities and risks 
paypal the leading general purpose buy button used consumers 
purchase goods online and also powers the buy buttons several social 
commerce websites thus the deployment buy buttons could drive 
diminished use for paypal check out button 
takeaways for internet companies see facebook and the other leading 
online platforms google twitter pinterest etc adding various versions 
buy buttons their offerings our view buy buttons are part the 
internet platforms efforts more directly link advertising dollars 
transactions leading more measurable and likely higher advertiser 
roi our view successful consumer adoption buy buttons likely lead 
even faster dollar growth for the major social networks see 
facebook and its global monthly users the most likely beneficiary

mentioned above the leading online platforms google facebook instagram twitter pinterest etc are all 
adding some version buy buttons their offerings our view buy buttons are part the internet 
platforms efforts more directly link advertising dollars actual transactions leading more 
measurable and likely higher advertiser roi changing consumer behavior difficult driving people 
actually purchase items within google search results facebook but one several the 
platforms successful with buy buttons would expect acceleration online dollars toward 
that company 
for google buy buttons are way continue close the mobile monetization gap 
estimate that google search clicks come from mobile but that mobile only makes 
total search revenue while google mobile desktop monetization gap starting close believe 
smartphone cpcs are still less than desktop this largely related advertiser mobile roi and lower 
purchase intent successful buy buttons with searchers purchasing directly google would improve 
the advertising roi measurability and likely help close this mobile monetization gap our base case 
google model assumes that the mobile search cpc gap gradually closes but that even mobile cpcs are 
still less than desktop any faster improvement than this provided desktop search continues its stable togrowing trend likely lead higher long term earnings power

platform and significant scale monthly active users their online storefront 
the facebook shop storefronts are free set and again are primarily designed bring more advertising

facebook also recently announced partnership with shopify shop covered morgan stanley software

for free this makes easier for merchants showcase and sell their products directly their facebook page 
and removes friction from the smb selling processes facebook 
facebook taking steps grow its traffic with purchase intent too now allowing google crawl

google searches smartphones will display content from facebook app listings will appear deep links 
that will take users the relevant part the facebook app when clicked with any retailer traffic matters

how will buy buttons impact payments companies 
broadly view buy buttons positive development for payments companies reduced friction the 
payment checkout process should help elevate conversion rates for mobile apps websites simplistically 
cash typically not option for these transactions higher conversion rates will help drive incremental growth 
electronic payments volumes which the key revenue driver for most payment companies the impact 
could however more nuanced depending what role entity playing the payments value chain 
for the card networks buy buttons are all good although platform specific buy buttons could 
potentially compete with the networks own checkout buttons some level visa checkout and 
masterpass believe the networks are ultimately agnostic between the two and goal drive 
more transactions ride over their rails providing tools that make consumption their assets easier 
third parties and consumers the extent that transaction will ultimately funded credit debit cards 
either case proliferation buy buttons positive for the networks 
the margin think that wider adoption buy buttons over time could even help the networks gain share 
paypal which has thus far been the dominant player for ecommerce transactions with its 
transactions funded via ach 
for the merchant acquirers buy buttons could drive more competition and increase their 
commoditization longer term the near term believe that buy buttons will likely neutral 
development for the acquirers higher conversation rates the mobile online environment positive given 
that the majority transactions will funded via electronic payment methods whereas paper based 
payments are more prevalent offline transactions however new entrants the space are starting 
differentiate themselves moving into areas where they can deliver more value such easier integration with 
developers and making easy for sellers build their own buy button third party website through deeper 
integration with retailers inventory stripe relay product these instances the role the acquirers 
could reduced that low value added processor which yields lower economics per transaction 
for paypal buy buttons are potentially double edged sword the positive side the leading 
general purpose buy button the desktop environment paypal has large lead over other general purpose 
buy buttons both merchant and consumer acceptance with opportunity bring its active user base 
consumers over the mobile environment the company has also introduced one touch technology 
which allows its users store their paypal user name and password securely the mobile device enabling the 
bypassing the login and password entering process eligible sites one touch also works desktop laptop 
environment 
paypal braintree segment see next section for braintree primer also provides the back end payment 
infrastructure that may necessary launch platform specific buy buttons for instance braintree has 
partnership although not exclusive with pinterest enable buyable pins such that payments info entered 
when registering for the first time for purchase pinterest stored securely braintree vault 
the negative side proliferation platform specific buy buttons which offer seamless one click checkout 
functionality could reduce the use case for paypal own general purpose buy button the long term the 
amazon checkout experience though near term impact limited given how nascent the buy button 
phenomenon with buy buttons also think that consumers would not change their payment settings often 
before completing purchase which would make the primary funding source all the more important several 
the platform specific buy buttons that have been launched far not currently include paypal funding 
option 
more broadly are seeing the emergence more companies who view control the digital wallets and 
their potential act buy button being core part their respective strategies with companies such 
visa mastercard apple google samsung facebook chase amazon and large merchants such walmart and 
payments internet software november 
morgan stanley research 
target all working initiatives that could lead decline the use case the paypal digital wallet 
furthermore more and more commerce shifts the mobile environment paypal could disadvantaged 
google and apple control the leading mobile operating systems globally and could position their respective 
payment offerings android pay and apple pay the default digital wallet their platforms these initiatives 
have limited acceptance far for app purchases and not currently work for browser purchases where 
the majority purchase volumes reside this point time although would not surprised see these 
mobile wallets incorporate some form browser functionality the future

retail software platforms primarily view buy buttons way enhance channel access for their 
merchant customers several the major retail software vendors have pursued offering buy buttons

what buy button 
buy buttons offer payment transaction experience that swift and easy mobile device desktop 
broadly speaking link embedded website mobile app that enables easy and efficient purchasing 
just few clicks allowing consumers pre register their payment account credentials thereby taking the 
friction out the checkout process 
there are main types buy buttons 
generic buy buttons what may called general purpose buy buttons such paypal visa checkout 
masterpass express checkout from amex these aim solve the checkout conversion problem broadly the 
digital commerce environment consumers can use these checkout broad selection merchant websites 
apps that choose integrate with these buttons 
platform site specific buy buttons these may embedded advertisement within specific website 
app and enable seamless purchasing item without ever leaving the platform examples include buy 
buttons launched facebook instagram twitter and pinterest for these platforms buy buttons are way 
drive incremental advertising dollars from retailers for retailers and cpg companies way drive more 
online sales and compete more effectively against online merchants like amazon 
who using the buy button now 
over the past year facebook instagram twitter and pinterest have been experimenting with buy buttons 
their websites both facebook and twitter began beta testing their buy buttons july and september 
respectively and rolled them out more widely june and september respectively instagram and 
pinterest launched their versions the buy button june called the shop now button and buyable 
pins respectively 
most recently facebook partnered with shopify enable shop section for facebook pages facebook 
which makes easier for merchants showcase their products directly their facebook page and allows 
consumers check out mobile device without leaving facebook 
why buy buttons matter 
general consumers are comfortable purchasing items their desktops but given the global 
smartphone and global tablet install base people are increasingly connected the internet using 
these mobile devices mobile penetration rising globally our latest alphawise survey data show that 
consumers worldwide are increasingly comfortable transacting their mobile devices mobile 
penetration ecommerce has grown from see free shipping trumps sameday and smartphone ecommerce budding yet while positive sign that mobile ecommerce 
penetration growing still fewer than consumers have made purchase their mobile devices 
over time believe increased willingness purchase items mobile devices will drive faster overall 
ecommerce growth essentially see the combination consumers that are increasingly always connected 
shop with higher willingness make purchases mobile devices bringing larger share consumers 
wallets online 
follows that providing mobile friendly shopping experience will become increasingly important retailers 
buy button can take some the friction out the purchasing process believe that will long way 
towards encouraging more mobile ecommerce and shopping that because today most retail mobile sites 
payments internet software november 
morgan stanley research 
require consumers type their credit card and billing information into their phones each time they make 
purchase resulting clunky and unpleasant user experience this has resulted significantly lower 
conversion rates smartphones compared desktops see exhibit 
exhibit sales conversion rates smartphones are far lower than desktop

rce etate 
one early solution has been the development mobile apps whereby logged consumer payment 
information saved however most shopper traffic occurs mobile browser sites apps believe 
browsing search results are most akin offline shopping behavior well designed buy button could hence 
take some that friction out mobile purchasing offering single button that seamlessly connects the 
consumer payment information with retailer back end website the platform that powers the buy button 
will have access the consumer payment information but via tokenization will not actually know store 
consumer credit card data 
buy buttons and the integration ecommerce into search and the social platforms 
mobile ecommerce trends matter for online advertising companies believe that increase mobile 
shopping behavior will drive more advertising dollars online onto mobile platforms buy buttons offer 
chance for social networks and search engines turn their platforms into commerce apps sites that can 
potentially bridge the gap between browsing and buying activity 
facebook twitter and pinterest are all experimenting with buy buttons they position themselves partners 
for retailers that are trying compete against the likes amazon google well and they arguably could 
best positioned given their ability bundle search functionality with their existing android payment 
ecosystem for all these players successful buy buttons are likely foster dollar growth they 
would help google continue close its mobile desktop cpc monetization gap still for the social 
networks little can long way given only total ecommerce social enabled 
what the opportunity 
for social networks like facebook instagram and twitter the buy button way drive incremental 
advertising dollars from retailers this good way for these platforms leverage their large audiences 
connect retailers with consumers further facilitating actual purchase their platforms through buy 
button enabled unit facebook instagram and twitter can directly prove the conversion and roi 
advertising their sites better roi should lead more advertising dollars flowing the social platforms 
payments internet software november 
morgan stanley research 
for facebook specifically buy button one way the company trying attract advertising dollars from 
small medium businesses smbs who often not have the resources capabilities develop mobile app 
mobile optimize their browser site effect selling directly facebook these smbs can leverage 
facebook platform their mobile storefront 
for pinterest and extent instagram the buy button way better monetize the content that already 
its platform users are already sharing photos their favorite apparel shoes and home goods name 
few examples closing the loop and allowing consumers purchase these items directly from retailers 
pinterest better monetizing its users proving its value advertising platform and keeping users its 
platform 
for retailers and cpg companies buy button potential way drive more mobile online sales and 
compete more effectively against online merchants like amazon 
what are the challenges 
given that the first iphone was sold years ago perhaps surprising that easy use mobile buy 
button has not been developed received widespread consumer adoption the case with all payments 
systems the challenge has been get both consumers and merchants use and accept the buy button which 
has been challenging all participants 
changing consumer behavior one the biggest obstacles will changing consumer behavior 
because while estimate the majority people browse for products online any given month only 
people worldwide actually purchase products via their mobile devices 
trust consumers must trust the platform with their financial credit card information gaining that trust may 
challenging 
managing inventory product out stock will the inventory management system communicate that 
info and deactivate buy buttons for that item the platform

quick primer braintree 
both braintree and stripe offer the back end payments infrastructure enable the seamless checkout 
functionality buy buttons 
what role does braintree play the payments ecosystem 
braintree third party payment service provider that enables retailers accept payments for 
mcommerce ecommerce transactions founded and acquired paypal the company 
initially focused simplifying payments acceptance for startups and mobile app developers and has since 
gained traction with larger retailers well 
braintree sought make payments easy plug and play through api based approach that enabled 
developers quickly integrate payments functionality into mobile apps websites contrast traditional 
acquirers processors that could take weeks set retailer braintree apis are well documented and 
essentially provide bunch code variety languages and customized for the ios android and 
windows mobile platforms that can integrate with the code the merchants website app the company offers 
full set payment services including acceptance credit debit card and digital wallets such paypal 
applepay and androidpay well payment gateway recurring payment processing and marketplace 
payment services 
from payments value chain perspective braintree akin non bank iso the company uses top three 
merchant processor behind the scenes for the actual transaction processing 
exhibit braintree transaction flow 
rce rgan stan ley research 
what are the advantages using braintree 
ease use alluded above braintree adds value simplifying the front end process process setting 
merchant account and the software development effort required incorporate payments functionality into 
mobile apps commerce websites the company has full stack payments platform that can abstract all 
payments related needs for retailer developer into the back end but also offers payment gateway only 
services for retailers that already have merchant account and payment processor relationships 
pci compliance braintree helps alleviate the pci compliance burden encrypting and storing customer 
payment information securely additional cost when payment method stored the braintree vault 
the information encrypted the braintree gateway and associated with unique token this token can 
used create transactions without the pci compliance burden that comes with handling unencrypted data 
simplified pricing braintree charges standard fee per transaction after the first 
processed volume which processed for free with additional monthly fees the company assesses 
fee for processing chargebacks per incident for retailers that want only use braintree gateway service 
available month transaction retailers that process more than annual volumes can 
payments internet software november 
morgan stanley research 
negotiate pricing directly with the company 
who are braintree competitors 
braintree competes with host traditional and new disruptive payment service providers that cater 
ecomm mcomm retailers among the traditional providers the notable ones include visa owned 
cybersource authorize net worldpay chase paymentech vantiv etc broadly think these providers have 
more scale and experience and hence can potentially offer more sophisticated tools fraud prevention 
support more complexity and wider range payment types and cater better the needs large merchants 
where they may lacking likely longer application processing onboarding time more cumbersome 
software integrations and not enough focus the developer community 
some the newer players that compete with braintree include stripe chargify recurly paysimple etc 
view stripe the most notable with very similar set capabilities braintree while some the others may 
lend themselves better specific use cases such recurring billing marketplace environments 
braintree stripe 
our checks with industry experts indicate that both braintree and stripe are pretty similar capabilities with 
very developer friendly reputations 
the margin stripe considered easier use the developer community although 
braintree has also simplified its software stack considerably 
braintree has slight upper hand integration capabilities given that integrates with 
paypal and venmo stripe integrates with alipay while braintree does not yet 
braintree also wins marginally international availability although both have multicountry presence 
pricing very similar for both braintree and stripe the although there are differences 
for non usd transactions 
both braintree and stripe offer the back end payments infrastructure enable seamless 
checkout functionality buy buttons but stripe has gone step further with its new relay 
product that allows for deep integration with merchant inventory such that stripe can 
manage payments and inventory information flow for the merchant merchants can provide 
their product info and skus relay which then enables them launch buy buttons 
third party apps such twitter pinterest 
braintree integration with paypal 
braintree offers zero sdk with which retailers can accept both credit debit cards and paypal with one seamless 
integration however order accept paypal via braintree merchants must use braintree full stack payment 
services opposed gateway service only braintree does not charge any fees for paypal transactions but the 
retailer will required pay the fee has directly negotiated with paypal 
what merchant account 
account with acquiring processing bank which allows merchants accept credit and debit card 
payments can obtained either directly from acquirer processor from reseller such 
independent sales organization iso that sells the services one multiple processors
