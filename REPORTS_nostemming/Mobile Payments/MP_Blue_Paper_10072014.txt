acceptance more transactions are 
routed via ach direct debit 
consumers move mobile payment 
including offline cloud based 
authentication software based fraud 
algorithms are considered secure 
enough for most uses which could 
include google hce 
few ott players with mobile wallets and 
cloud based authenticating would eliminate 
the strict need for pos devices mobile 
wallets that gain prevalence the pos

would best positioned merchants would 
likely keep some pos terminals for basic 
visa and mastercard acceptance 
replacement cycles for established pos 
vendors would lengthen 
strong authentication becomes the 
norm for mobile payments the 
higher security levels provides can 
economically offset higher ecosystem 
costs reducing fraud and 
continue dominate terms 
setting standards players with control 
over hardware handset oems and 
mobile networks are successful new

continue set payment standards

advantaged and disadvantaged players the evolving landscape 
advantaged 
card networks believe scenario represented 
apple pay almost the best possible outcome for the 
networks and axp far future development 
mobile payments concerned the scenario positive for 
volumes small ticket mobile payments transit could 
accelerate share shift from cash electronic transactions 
and keep fraud prevention standards under the control the 
main networks any potential dilution fees due rebates 
would small worst 
issuing banks scenario also positive for issuing banks 
apple pay and other mobile wallets are largely based 
already issued cards tokens linked those cards 
above would expect small ticket mobile transactions 
take share from cash resulting higher volumes for banks 
any additional costs for banks for inclusion third party 
wallets such the widely reported the case 
apple pay should our view offset increased 
volumes 
acquirers processors positive mobile payment 
system based existing infrastructure poses risk the 
processors role the current ecosystem and they should 
benefit from increased volumes longer term believe that 
the acquirers could get disintermediated from providing 
value added services such security solutions the use 
tokenization and biometric authentication for mobile 
payments able significantly increase the safety 
electronic payment transactions 
terminal manufacturers positive for pay and ingenico 
think apple pay could increase merchant appetite 
upgrade nfc which should additive asp could 
also drive increased demand for pay payment aservice paas offering merchants look outsource

apple reducing fraud improving data security and 
increasing credit debit volumes for issuers and networks 
while protecting the value the existing payments value 
chain believe apple pay has high chance success 
apple market share the its exposure relatively 
affluent demographic and the ease use along with 
unique form factor apple watch position apple pay the 
player beat the mobile wallet space 
semiconductors nxpi remains our preferred way play 
increasing nfc adoption due its strong leadership position 
controllers secure element addition its strong expertise 
software java card operating system and payment 
related licensing places nxp good position for 
recurring sales expect nfc rise from sales 
over the next few years for nxp providing important 
source upside estimates into 
disadvantaged 
tsms while scenario suggests mobile payment 
architecture similar that proposed tsms the move 
visa mastercard and amex provide tokenization services 
apple pay represents major challenge independent 
tsms such gemalto oberthur and giesecke devrient 
our view 
telcos apple pay along with google hce poses 
threat mnos efforts the mobile payments arena while 
accelerated adoption nfc likely positive 
softcard likely blocked out from iphones 
market share the near term given that apple currently 
restricting use its nfc antenna third parties 
paypal paypal has moved toward store payments using 
its cloud based mobile app while paypal aims steer 
customers link the wallet their bank account 
paypal account funding comes from credit debit cards which 
are treated card not present transactions the networks 
and attract higher interchange costs than applicable apple 
pay paypal could still offer competitive rates merchants 
due its lower blended cost owing significantly lower 
costs tied bank funding total but this could lead 
margin erosion for the company 
other wallet providers most mobile wallets employ existing 
issued cards funding source but use cloud based 
authentication these will therefore more expensive 
option for merchants accept resulting slow adoption 
note the one exception the mcx wallet which 
merchant consortium funded initiative the the wallet 
expected use direct debit fund transactions thereby 
lowering the cost acceptance for merchants however 
remain uncertain about the consumer value proposition 
also worth noting that apple will not grant third party access 
for the nfc antenna least for the time being

the future nfc 
while the debate around standardization technology still 
far from resolved believe that apple adoption nfc 
decidedly tilts the balance favor nfc based solutions 
the introduction apple pay likely helps accelerate the 
adoption nfc based technologies this especially 
true the where apple has the most meaningful market 
share smart phones with market share apple 
iphone users are generally higher income and are typically 
earlier adopters new technologies relative the android 
user base which attractive merchants that are looking 
increase sales this demographic 
emv upgrade cycle may aid nfc adoption based 
merchants are currently the middle pos upgrade 
cycle that driven liability shift that takes place 
october instead issuers merchants who not 
upgrade their pos the deadline will liable for 
fraudulent transactions this upgrade cycle may prompt 
merchants who may want future proof their pos order 
terminals with additional nfc functionality compatible with 
apple pay and other nfc based wallets verifone the 
leading pos terminal manufacturer the has noted that 
the majority terminals that has shipped over the past 
year have nfc functionality although the majority have nfc 
turned off this point 
increased security concerns also provide momentum 
nfc note that concerns driven data breaches 
leading retailers such target and home depot have 
accelerated the emv adoption cycle ahead initial 
expectations and may also provide tailwinds for nfc 
consumers learn more about enhanced security apple 
pay consumers payments credentials are securely stored 
the iphone secure element which protects against 
skimming and potential compromises account information 
this form two factor authentication has made nfc 
relatively more secure when compared the cloud although 
higher cost implementation given the associated 
hardware costs the mobile device and the pos 
however the benefits reduced fraud may convince both 
retailers and handset manufacturers absorb the increased 
costs note that one day after apple pay was announced 
mastercard issued new mandates that required all pos 
terminals sold europe post january have nfc 
capability and that all active pos terminals would need 
have nfc capability january 
expect inflection nfc adoption 
believe inflection point for emv nfc penetration 
imminent and expect payment terminals have 
nfc capabilities early october accelerated 
emv roll out the terminal side positive most new 
payment terminals with emv capability support nfc well 
albeit most these dark nfc terminals still have the 
nfc contactless functionality turned off due incremental 
costs associated with back end software certification and 
testing 
think apple pay will help kick start what has been slowgoing nfc ecosystem both the smartphone and merchant 
fronts particular expect other smartphone oems 
especially the android ecosystem adopt nfc 
technology for mobile payments and merchants 
increasingly upgrade their payment infrastructure support 
mobile payments consumer adoption rises overall the 
introduction apple pay could lead steeper ramp 
nfc penetration compared our estimate 
from less than see exhibit 
what different this time for nfc 
nfc based mobile payments have had number false 
starts recent years mostly hampered lack merchant 
adoption the technology the terminal side well 
disagreement among various parties involved viable 
business model however believe that this time 
different and consumer adoption the technology poised 
accelerate over the coming years 
three critical differences between the current nfc 
landscape and the one from few years ago 
higher nfc penetration the merchant 
payment terminal infrastructure and while most still have 
the nfc functionality turned off can enabled with 
software upgrade 
accelerating nfc adoption smartphones especially 
after apple embrace the technology expect over 
nfc capable smartphones ship 
the advent host card emulation hce and 
tokenization replacing digit credit card numbers with 
dummy numbers for authenticating transactions are 
disruptive innovations for mobile payments they

promise the potential simplify the prevailing complex 
mobile payment landscape involving numerous parties 
mobile network operators mnos smartphones oems 
issuers banks trusted service managers tsms 
such this could reduce the time market well 
lower the cost deployment for mobile solutions 
addition think tokenization will help alleviate some 
the security concerns surrounding mobile payments

can apple pay help accelerate adoption mobile payments 
think that several issues need resolved before 
see more widespread adoption mobile payments but 
think the launch the apple pay wallet could tipping 
point and here why 
apple has proven ability change consumer 
behavior they done multiple times before and with 
market share smartphones the 
globally believe they have the clout again 
think the simplified user experience offered apple pay 
tap pos and authenticate fingerprint through the 
touch sensor superior several other mobile 
wallets out there typical user experience involves 
unlocking the phone opening mobile wallet app and 
inputting pin password and could help reduce friction 
using mobile devices make purchase the pointof sale pos moreover apple can leverage its database 
cards file simplify the process signing 
consumers for apple pay 
exhibit 
apple smartphone share region 
iii the timing the apple pay launch ahead the emv 
upgrade cycle could help mobilize nfc adoption 
according apple there are only merchant 
locations the that currently support contactless 
payments representing penetration it secret 
that nfc has had little support from merchants thus far 
given high costs associated with terminal upgrade and 
lack consumer adoption however described earlier 
see page believe growing consumer adoption 
apple pay could the catalyst that drives retailers 
upgrade activate nfc capability their devices 
tokenization combined with touch should help 
drive confidence its security surveys show that 
consumers have been particularly concerned about 
security and privacy when comes mobile payments 
adoption the fact that apple pay will store only tokenized 
credentials its secure element thus protecting the 
consumer digit pan from being shared and will 
further use touch for payment authorization could help 
convince consumers the safety apple pay 
transaction and help drive adoption 
exhibit 
reasons for the slow adoption mobile payments 
source idc morgan stanley research 
issuers representing credit debit card volumes 
the are part apple pay apple pay working 
collaboratively with the existing payments ecosystem 
which helps reduce friction from incumbent players that 
may have been skeptical about getting displaced from the 
value chain believe this one the reasons that 
apple has been able garner participation from group 
six leading issuers jpm bac wfc axp and 
cof part the wallet from the start contrast 
google launched its nfc wallet with one issuing partner 
citibank and softcard has three issuing partners chase 
axp and wells fargo significantly limiting the reach 
these wallets consumers 
source federal reserve bank morgan stanley research 
more than one answer was allowed numbers not total 
apple staying away from transaction data think 
this should help dispel one the major concerns that 
merchants and issuers have had with the google wallet 
that data protection 
however this not say that adoption will happen overnight 
several roadblocks remain 
apple pay will available only iphone and iphone 
users given that nfc chip required for the payment

mobile payments 
app function this will initially restrict consumer 
adoption only those consumers who buy new phone 
think global smartphone penetration iphone 
likely end and end 
mcx merchants are holding out for now note that the 
merchants walmart target kmart sears cvs 
rite aid lowe kohl best buy and that are part 
the mcx consortium are currently holding off 
partnership with apple pay store though apple pay will 
accepted inside the target app its members are 
prohibited from accepting all third party mobile wallets 
bid promote their own yet launched mobile 
payment solution this has driven member merchants 
switch off nfc capability their point sale while this 
may not change the near term would not 
surprised see least few the mcx merchants open 
themselves apple pay once the current agreement 
banning third party wallets expires 
iii loyalty solution skeptics believe that just the cool 
factor transacting with mobile device may not 
sufficient drive adoption and that mobile wallet has 
offer enhanced value proposition while apple pay 
first cut includes loyalty offerings would not 
surprised see integration loyalty programs into the 
app over time see page 
the tailwind for debit will unlikely 
strong was the past 
the primary funding source leading mobile wallets have 
been credit and debit cards apple pay exclusively credit 
and debit believe that once consumers start adopt 
mobile methods payments the share cash transactions 
will decline accelerated pace 
exhibit 
despite conventional wisdom cash usage has not 
fallen significantly over the past decade the 
checks have mainly been replaced debit and 
electronic ach transactions 
share consumer payment volume 
electr 
debit 
cash 
overall believe that apple pay will accelerate mobile 
payment adoption although will likely take some time given 
the hardware upgrade cycle that consumers and merchants 
will need through once this process completed 
believe the launch apple pay will help accelerate the shift 
from cash and checks electronic forms payments over 
the past decade the secular shift cash and checks 
credit and debit has mainly been driven primarily 
transition checks debit and electronic payments ach 
given that checks accounted for only transactions

what about android mobile payments for the other 
apple unique the mobile payments space the 
company vertical integration strategy gives control over 
both hardware and software the iphone contrast the 
android ecosystem highly fragmented with hundreds 
hardware makers and thousands devices the open

fragmented across different software versions with only

android smartphone market share 
what about the smartphone oems samsung looks 
have been the most proactive android oem mobile 
payments seeks differentiate itself given aggressive 
competition from chinese oems samsung launched 
mobile wallet platform conjunction with visa oberthur 
broadcom and stmicroelectronics early february 
however further partnerships with banks launch apps have 
not materialized this could related tsm economics 
complexity user interface 
among other oems china based xiaomi which one the 
fastest growing oem emerging markets expected 
introduce nfc based transit ticketing solution think 
this noteworthy the company could eventually broaden 
its strategy support payments merchant terminals 
well xiaomi had adopted combination nfc embedded 
secure element its flagship phone but dropped the 
given low consumer adoption the technology think 
the company return nfc technology could signal broader 
momentum behind nfc based mobile payments 
overall following apple lead expect android oems 
launch their own mobile payment offerings based either 
embedded secure element via hce 
source idc morgan stanley research 
therefore believe that android based payment platforms 
will remain fragmented over the next years with the 
likelihood multiple offerings from various entities involved 
payments such smartphone oems mobile network 
operators mnos and banks and merchants also 
believe host card emulation hce key technology for 
the android platform will allow third party providers 
develop nfc based mobile wallets which could potentially 
offer similar economics the merchant apple pay 
rates similar card present interchange rates although 
hce compatibility limited only android latest kitkat 
version 
samsung has the largest market share for android 
devices while the next biggest player sony has 
only market share this would suggest that 
google samsung partnership likely the best shot 
replicate android devices what apple doing with apple 
pay samsung the past has utilized embedded secure 
element for storing payment credentials galaxy and 
and could continue with the same strategy given controls 
the hardware environment its smartphones smartwatches 
there would still however the question negotiating with 
issuers and networks play along convincing merchants that 
are wary google hijacking their data and working around 
the mnos given their interest promoting their own mobile 
wallet softcard 
other partnerships announced samsung far include 
those with paypal and china unionpay the paypal alliance 
expected launch with samsung next generation

differentiate their offerings from the rest believe that the 
tamper proof secure element approach still provides higher 
level security than cloud implementation via hce 
finally know that merchants are looking expand the

with android kitkat google has introduced new

host card emulation hce the system uses software 
emulate emvco type smartcards and can used for 
payments loyalty programs card access transit and other 
custom services the system based tokenization the 
creation dummy set numbers linked actual 
customer credentials the cloud not dissimilar from the 
method used apple pay 
the system requires the mobile handset have nfc 
controller but not necessarily secure element although 
believe would support the latter there need for 
third party tsm per but some kind platform required 
provision one off credentials onto the smartphone securely 
hce relatively untested the broader environment 
however believe has the potential offer lower cost 
alternative service providers seeking incorporate 
payment functionality into android mobile applications 
not believe google seeking monetize its hce activity 
directly the way for instance that mnos and tsms are 
seeking generate direct fees from service providers for 
supporting nfc wallet that said data transactions 
would clearly value google targeting advertising 
its platforms this may barrier third party adoption 
tokenization 
tokenization not new concept but gained more serious 
attention during the conference las 
vegas where visa mastercard and american express 
announced proposed tokenization framework simplify the 
consumer experience and enhance security for mobile and 
online shopping the use tokenization apple pay 
represents significant further endorsement our view 
tokenizing payment data would better protect cardholder 
information reduce fraud using alternate identifier 
payment token substitute for the card number and 
other cardholder authentication data for given combination 
consumer issuer merchant ultimately reducing fraud 
risk and its associated costs networks could then potentially 
reduce eliminate the card not present surcharge reducing 
interchange issuers and total revenue cost the 
ecosystem for apple pay the networks will providing the 
tokenization service other wallets could potentially use other 
providers for tokenization services but view networks 
being best positioned

least for now blocking any other digital wallet from

force card issuers offer tokenization via the cloud instead

why has the tsm model been unsuccessful thus far 
there are few examples the market from which draw firm 
conclusions but our conversations with industry participants 
suggest there have been two main barriers the tsm model 
getting traction 
cost while think there has been substantial 
reduction the last years several banks have cited 
cost major reason why they have struggled make 
business case participate operator led simbased mobile wallet part the reason has been 
fragmentation bank looking launch application 
for such wallet has had pay set fees both 
operator and tsm rental fees for space the simbased secure element and ongoing tsm fees 
gemalto indicates today that the upper end its pricing 
for tsm services around per user per year 
however believe initial tsm setup fees have been 
much some cases admittedly primarily for 
global agreements and have seen some instances 
sim rental costs coming multiple what costs 
mno buy multi tenant sim one conversation 
with tsm immediately after the announcement host 
card emulation google was revealing the tsm 
stated hope that the move might lead mnos make 
sim rental costs more affordable for banks and other 
service providers 
compared the fragmented and relatively expensive 
tsm model believe simple pay per use model such that being introduced apple should highly 
attractive for service providers even beyond the 
card issuers already signed apple pay visa will 
provide tokenization services for free initially and 
thereafter terms likely similar mastercard 
per user monthly fee and initial provisioning fee 
equivalent per user per year 
the apple pay model carries additional implicit cost 
issuers speculated basis points volume 
that will paid away apple believe less 
debit possible little while this may 
ultimately represent similar level cost sim rental 
from telco note that apple pay user would have 
spend the region single card before 
the costs become comparable highlight that this 
would likely viewed good return investment 
the issuer for the additional payment volumes realized 
user experience problems with telco operated mobile 
wallets have been well documented particularly around 
the enrolment process gemalto has indicated this was 
one factor aside from security that has delayed 
operator purchases high end multi tenant sim cards 
apple pay has however has been able simplify the 
process taking photo the card leveraging its 
existing database cards file with itunes 
more pertinently several banks have registered concern 
that the telco model effectively disintermediates them 
from the consumer payment experience and may result 
brand dilution think these issues are only partly 
addressed apple pay apple move restrict third 
party use the nfc antenna means that issuers may 
not able launch contactless payment modules 
within their own mobile banking applications rather 
apple pay will the only payment experience the 
iphone least initially and tokens representing issuer 
cards will sit within apple pay users will able select 
default card and see image the issuer brand 
once the transaction complete but other aspects the 
payment process will remain apple control 
with apple pay launch the tsm model unlikely gain 
significant traction the united states while apple 
adoption nfc for the iphone goes some way towards 
making nfc the standard form contactless payment the 
fact that the company has shut down the nfc antenna third 
party providers means that other service providers developing 
for ios will have little chance capitalize increasing 
standardization 
there may opportunity for tsms and other players 
launch services around the hce ecosystem created 
google google current model for mobile payments does not 
make use secure element the handset whether 
embedded the sim instead involves provisioning 
tokens the cloud virtual secure element the 
technical capability here similar service provider tsm 
tokens provisioned the service provider platform are then 
transmitted over the air the handset completion 
transactions given recent moves visa and mastercard 
into tokenization not mention their role the development 
hce believe both companies are likely offer services 
here and expect pricing competitive

will apple pay follow similar architecture for international rollout 
while apple announced support from three major payment 
networks american express mastercard and visa 
issuers supporting apple pay are far limited the 
note that apple itunes store which opened april 
was originally available only users with valid credit card 
and billing address and did not launch internationally 
until june similar itunes expect apple pay 
expand internationally over time steve perry chief digital 
officer visa europe confirmed the payment network 
working closely with apple and its member banks bring 
this new service market europe although timing 
remains uncertain apple recently hired mary carol harris 
who was director visa europe and head the nfc 
division telefonica before that 
the european model for apple pay may differ from the 
model result some structural differences between the 
markets specifically lower interchange rates both credit 
and debit cards issued european banks and the likelihood 
that these may regulated lower still there may further 
complications with the enrolment process which requires 
each issuing bank agree 
interchange the easiest factor here quantify and debit 
interchange europe may particularly problematic 
april the european parliament voted favor 
proposals impose caps interchange fees the cap would 
limit interchange fees for credit cards for debit cards 
the fee would capped the lower this 
compares debit card interchange rates 
the and average credit card rates 
the interchange fee differential europe could make the 
apple pay model where apple receives 
transaction volume challenging for issuers accept 
course apple pay may still more attractive than the tsm 
model given the higher costs for that model but there 
could yet other models that emerge 
one option could the development the model proposed 
wirecard its mobile wallet launches with vodafone 
orange and others here wirecard issues prepaid card 
behalf the mno and splits the small fees that card 
with the mno the fee represents upside for both players but 
has the potential cannibalize transaction volumes 
existing issuers 
according various news sources apple has reached 
agreement with china unionpay enable apple pay the 
country competing technology nfc quick response 
codes was halted china central bank earlier this 
year due fraud concerns note that china apple

will apple wrap loyalty offerings into its wallet 
while the company has not commented its plans offer 
rewards for using apple pay recent job posting suggests 
apple could working loyalty program july 
apple posted job listing for global retail marketing 
program manager who will champion and expert the 
apple brand the loyalty space apple could leverage 
content from its extensive itunes library and app store 
incentivize higher transaction volume via apple pay note 
that apple recently gifted complimentary album its 
itunes store customers around the world according the 
new york times release the album for free apple paid the 
band and universal blanket royalty fee and committed 
marketing campaign worth december 
apple released app called days gifts which released 
free content including songs apps and videos users 
during the holiday season believe these experiments with 
pushing free content ios devices could intended 
gauge user feedback potentially leveraging itunes 
rewards medium 
integration merchant rewards programs with apple pay 
could another driver user adoption note that 
passbook where credit and debit cards will stored already 
has the ability store multiple retailers loyalty cards 
however through the process tokenization the announced 
apple pay offering completely disassociates the payer 
identity from the transaction that merchants cannot tie 
transactions back the customer therefore currently 
unclear how apple will enable seamless earning loyalty 
points and rewards note that competitive solutions have 
similar issue while google allows customers store 
digital copy loyalty cards google wallet loyalty program 
information not automatically entered when user pays 
with nfc device and the customer has make sure 
show the cashier loyalty account information before paying 
while details are difficult predict this point believe 
apple touch and ibeacons which can begin interacting 
with customer when they enter store will afford simpler 
method automatic rewards and loyalty point collection with 
merchant addition apple pay relies per device 
tokenization technology potentially leaving avenue 
associate the device token across multiple transactions

status mno led wallet ventures 
mobile network operators have had limited success 
launching nfc mobile wallets date this has been the 
result variety factors the most frequently cited 
problems our conversations with industry participants are 
the cost the telco led efforts potential partners banks 
transit authorities enterprises and issues around branding 
typically telcos and banks view mobile wallets 
important tool for reinforcing extending their brand 
increasing the amount time for which customer interacts 
with them and tool for marketing other services clearly 
this can create conflicts when the two are required work 
together launching mobile wallets 
this has been the reason why the majority european mno 
wallets have been launched using only prepaid 
visa mastercard maestro the first instance mnos aim 
expand this include the major issuing banks over time 
though thus far have been unable strike mutually 
acceptable terms 
believe international roll out apple pay and the 
introduction host card emulation hce google 
represent significant threat mno wallets apple pay the 
has indicated how elegant the enrolment process can 
where there buy from all players something which has 
been palpably absent from european mno launches apple 
recent recruitment key personnel the european 
payments industry shows that further roll out the 
cards which could threaten mno launches 
european banks have already started roll out mobile 
wallets based hce bbva launched its nfc wallet 
december september announced that the 
wallet had acquired customers and that this could 
rise year end sberbank russia also 
testing hce pilot and expect others follow the 
major advantage for hce for issuer that can include 
payment module within its own mobile banking application 
something that not possible either with apple pay with 
mno wallets believe this significant attraction for 
many issuers some issuers might still prefer require the 
presence secure element which could present 
either the sim card the handset though believe 
the economics are likely better with hce solution 
latest isis softcard the mno wallet 
over the last several months commentary around the 
softcard formerly isis wallet mobile payment app 
joint venture verizon and mobile has slowed 
there have been some positive developments due apple 
decision include nfc into the new iphone and plus 
which important because apple dominance the 
smartphone arena estimate that apple penetration 
the big smartphone installed base verizon sprint 
and mobile over while iphone inclusion nfc 
positive step forward given the positive effects could have 
merchant adoption nfc terminals continue 
believe that there uncertainty around softcard ability 
reach critical mass remains blocked out from the new 
iphone least for the time being highlighted before 
believe that issuer adoption also remains issue for 
softcard with only few large issuers chase wells fargo 
and amex signed date 
merchant support could also important increase the 
adoption softcard for instance subway recently 
announced that was partnering with softcard although the 
payment terminal will also support apple pay 
can softcard reverse trends and viable competitor 
the mobile payment space our view the carriers 
may run the risk realizing accelerating negative returns 
the softcard investment light slow adoption trends rollout 
costs deals and promotions and apple pay head start 
with current iphone customers most recent 
softcard recorded year date loss which worse 
than last year ytd loss has one third 
stake the suggesting that total losses could 
approach for near term all eyes will focus 
and when softcard can sway apple enable the nfc 
support the iphone and plus softcard ceo michael 
abbot recently stated blog post that the company 
actively working with apple enable softcard the iphone 
using integrated secure sim based hardware 
solution the event that the iphone and plus support 
softcard another potential obstacle could that softcard 
users may required install enhanced sim card their 
devices such the one required for android devices 
summary apple pay ease use and brand dominance 
could win over potential softcard users

insights into the leading mobile payments market south korea 
korea proving that mobile messaging platforms offer 
very strong value proposition for consolidating mobile 
payment segment following the success tencent 
wechat china kakaotalk the leading mobile messaging 
platform korea has acquired mobile payment users 
kakao pay less than month launch 
expect rapid user adoption for kakao mobile payment 
services korea first kakaotalk boasts monthly 
active users korea over the population users 
access messaging applications roughly times day 
kakao related apps and services see significant downloads 
think kakao pay well bank wallet will see very high 
downloads thanks viral marketing and network effect 
second kakao messaging service conducive for 
money transfer well mobile payments because the 
social graph contains close friends and family and mobile 
ubiquity and real time communications allow for quick 
confirmation remittance and payment receipts lastly 
think both kakao pay and bank wallet will more 
convenient and easy use than existing payment options 
high user adoption should force merchants accept kakao 
payments provide customers with the convenience 
multiple payment options mobile well online merchants 
are likely offer kakao payment options off line merchants 
could also accept bank wallet payments creating their own 
account bank wallet could avoid credit card transaction fees 
off line merchants with card reader can also accept kakao 
pay 
kakao transactions rise merchants will look capture 
higher share the transactions influencing purchasing 
decisions kakao users this could the form 
proximity offers virtual currencies coupons daily savings 
and for these influenced transactions kakao can 
negotiate for share the revenue with merchants least 
having transaction data will allow kakao better target users 
for advertising purposes the meantime yellow can 
used kakao mobile landing sites for merchants where 
click call well cost per click can monetized 
korea think apple pay faces several obstacles 
iphone market share stands around korea which 
will likely limit user adoption apple pay 
merchant adoption nfc near field communication 
terminals remains key bottleneck with only 
penetration although most smartphones are now nfcequipped the lack users continues prevent merchants 
from purchasing nfc terminals which cost average 
despite the unique security features touch and secure 
element strict korean regulations may have issues with 
information storage the device itself 
think however apple pay could facilitate the rollout 
nfc based mobile payment suites handset manufacturers 
samsung electronics electronics telecom operators 
and commercial banks the rollout should involve fresh 
revamp their existing mobile payment suites they have 
already introduced nfc based mobile payment platforms 
rather unsuccessfully similar global markets the mobile 
payment market remains fragmented korea 
skt smart wallet now known syrup wallet has been 
the most successful mobile payment product korea with 
users according nielson korea nonetheless skt 
syrup has become more repository various reward and 
savings cards rather than mobile payment system with 
actively rising mobile payment transactions the second 
player shinhan card smart wallet with monthly 
users according the company 
samsung electronics samsung wallet has been rather 
insignificant with only users fact samsung card 
mpocket has been bit more successful with users 
electronics has had limited direct involvement the mobile 
payment suite allowing uplus the group telecom 
affiliate launch smart wallet which gathered only 
monthly users 
the fragmented korean mobile payment segment result

regulatory environment korea could prevent kakao 
from expanding into core banking card businesses 
think daum kakao will able engage mobile payment 
services with limited scope such small amount money 
transfers and mobile payment gateway however will 
difficult expand the scope into traditional financial services 
which could capture core banking card businesses given 
the tough regulatory environment korea 
according the electronic financial transaction law 
nonfinancial institutions are not allowed provide traditional 
financial services such deposits loans security brokerage 
insurance some financial transactions are allowed upon 
financial services commission fsc approval

account and electronic bill payment services accordingly 
global online companies are expanding their financial services 
korea via partnership with local banks financial 
institutions 
under the current law new ict based financial services are 
difficult regulate internet companies that are not 
registered electronic financial business operator are not 
subject the electronic financial transaction law such 
the fsc has been recently considering measures 
supervise regulate new ict based financial services such 
kakao pay likely come with measures the 
end this year after three months research believes that 
new measures could protect consumers from security 
stability concerns though other countries like china japan
