will key our paper could not find clear winner the 
current crop mobile wallets and conversations with 
investors confirm this general view apple has been 
making several comments around payments including 
filing patents most apple activity far through 
ibeacon has been around the retail experience rather than 
the act payment however now seems increasingly 
likely that the company will make decisive move during

investment case 
the month since published our mobile payments blue 
paper the coming battle for the wallet january 
have met with wide range investors discuss the market 
for mobile payments and company and stock implications 
most the investors we talked are focusing the 
potential roll out smartcard payment technology the 
particularly chip and pin and emv europay mastercard 
visa questions have centered whether the data breaches 
seen target neiman marcus and other yet unnamed 
retailers late could accelerate the timeline for 
deployment emv believe the payment security 
questions raised the data breaches are likely lead 
renewed focus the roll out new payment technology 
including emv which could create short term earnings boost 
for both gemalto and ingenico 
the thesis presented our blue paper 
mobile payments could expand the industry revenue pie 
billion globally the significant opportunity for mobile 
devices facilitate payments underscored the disparity 
between active credit debit accounts globally estimated 
and active mobile phone accounts some 
them smartphones think mobile payments can expand the 
global revenue pie from including 
developed markets and emerging markets 
unclear which revenue model will dominate existing 
models have been place japan and korea for several 
years but new ones are emerging europe and the 
mobile wallets such isis sponsored several telecom 
companies may seeking fee from issuers for storing 
payments credentials phone others such google 
wallet are seeking create opportunities gathering and 
packaging user data for targeted marketing still others 
including the retailer sponsored mcx seek potentially lower 
acceptance costs using alternative payments rails 
scenarios explored four scenarios around technology 
and adoption two look most likely hardware solutions 
become the mobile wallet standard best positioned visa 
mastercard merchants banks potentially challenged 
paypal google and other wallets telcos and few 
cloud based providers become the standard best positioned 
paypal apple google potentially challenged telcos pos 
vendors tsms expect visa and mastercard model 
remain unchallenged under all scenarios 
what happened target 
discount retailer target announced december that 
had been the victim systems breach the previous few 
days which compromised the personal data some 
cardholders with target store accounts security company 
symantec has stated that the software likely used the attack 
called blackpos states that the malware had been 
target systems since some time prior november and 
that the initial point the breach was target web server 
target has indicated that the data breach could affect 
consumers including the theft the details credit 
and debit cards estimates potential losses have varied 
widely though most commentators have indicated these could 
total over billion data lost includes names phone numbers 
email and home addresses and card details 
according target cfo john mulligan the breach occurred 
when hackers infiltrated target computer systems and 
installed malware the point sale network the company 
states was able remove the malware from virtually all 
registers our stores december and disabled 
further registers december 
would emv have prevented the target breach 
there has been much discussion around this consensus 
that emv would have partly prevented the target breach 
least have made the theft payment card details significantly 
less likely and less valuable 
when traditional magnetic card swiped the cardholder 
details contained the magnetic stripe similar vhs 
cassette tape are transmitted into the terminal where they are 
encrypted using payment card industry pci standards the 
terminal has been compromised card data can stolen 
skimmed with emv card the chip embedded the card 
employs cryptography and other security features protect 
cardholder information the ability combine the chip with 
secure pin which can verified offline well the back 
end infrastructure mean that emv has reduced fraud 
substantially markets where has been introduced discover 
financial services stated that the has seen 
reduction credit card fraud since emv was introduced while 
the has witnessed increase over the same period 
the one the last markets globally other than china 
introduce chip card technology

will the breach accelerate emv roll out the 
potential upside for companies with emv exposure 
believe very likely that the sees faster uptake 
emv cards and terminals over the next few years after fairly 
slow start visa and mastercard have reaffirmed the deadline 
october when merchants who not have emv 
terminals will liable for fraud resulting from transactions 
where customer has tried use emv card progress 
towards this target has been slow partly due the chickenand egg problem merchants and banks each waiting for the 
other invest roll out emv retailers will have pay 
install the terminals and the banks will have pay reissue 
cards investment spend will split along those two lines 
hit the goal for full emv adoption the incentive 
make the investments clear retailers without emv terminals 
will not reimbursed for fraud after the deadline 
among our coverage believe ingenico best positioned for 
growth the emv market pos terminal shipments are 
revenue for ingenico where gemalto banking 
business the group total addition believe 
ingenico could benefit from growth market share the 
following recent deals gemalto market share likely 
lower the than the rest the world least initially 
several comments and announcements from industry players 
over the last few weeks support our view while have yet 
see major bank announce wholesale roll out emv

replacement cycle believe the total number pos

been relatively stable since the last confirmed world bank data

this may overstate the addressable market for ingenico the 
company not present pay pump facilities gas stations 
taxi terminals for instance and the world bank statistics 
for installed base not include self service 
ingenico cites the replacement cycle being around 
years implying addressable market around million 
terminals per year believe more aggressive roll out 
emv could see this cycle accelerate typical replacement 
cycles the brazilian market are around years the 
could accelerate this level bull case which would imply 
doubling the market from today level 
ingenico could also see some additional market share gains 
result the emv roll out the company saw significant 
reduction market share over from its 
addressable market around lost share the iso 
market the company has recently signed some additional 
deals with isos chase paymentech vantiv which could see 
the recovery some share the market has also changed 
with equinox previously hypercom losing share since its 
acquisition private equity 
bull case for ingenico the company could win market 
share addressable market million pos

terminals into the compared current shipments

cloud based hardware based technology 
this debate far from resolved but believe the renewed 
focus emv implementation viewed many shot 
the arm for nfc near field communication technology the 
argument being that the pos upgrade cycle driven emv 
implementation will provide retailers with the necessary 
incentive simultaneously adopt technology that capable 
supporting nfc transactions well following the recent data 
breaches both visa and mastercard have reaffirmed the dates 
for migration emv implementation the through 
liability shift beginning october 
could security concerns drive hardware based solutions 
proponents nfc have argued that nfc based wallets allow 
for faster and easier tap and go consumer payments 
experience while enhancing payments security consumers 
credentials are securely stored the mobile devices secure 
element thereby protecting against skimming and compromise 
account information while the two factor authentication 
makes nfc relatively more secure payments technology 
our view its cost implementation has been significant 
barrier adoption thus far think the recent data breaches 
could cause issuers and retailers evaluate the cost and 
benefits associated with implementation nfc based mobile 
payments technology for perspective the consumer 
bankers association estimates the costs date replacing 
cards for its customers affected the target breach 
total costs could multiple this figure with 
million customer cards affected the breach target the 
cost terminal replacement smaller relatively speaking 
target had retail locations november 
assuming pos terminals average per location 
average cost per terminal suggests replacing the 
entire estate pos terminals with emv nfc equipped 
terminals would 
but even with increased security concerns believe that 
nfc faces significant hurdles adoption the given 
apple ios operating system accounts for 
smartphones the and apple has decided not 
enable nfc its phones 
the merchants behind the retailer funded mcx have 
stated that they will not accept any other forms mobile 
wallets their stores view the upgrade cost nfc 
minimal verifone has the past sought charge 
premium for nfc terminals though ingenico indicates 
there additional cost however mcx will likely use 
barcode generated the mcx app authenticate 
customers there maybe disincentive for mcx 
retailers promote nfc within stores 
the percentage non apple phones that are nfc 
enabled the remains limited according 
november survey deloitte only 
consumers stated that they their mobile phones have nfc 
capability 
tokenization could make cloud based payments more 
secure while nfc technology has distinct advantages over 
cloud based technologies when comes security 
believe that recent initiatives taken the leading networks 
move towards tokenization could considerably beef security 
for card not present transactions believe that tokenization 
could make cloud based mobile payment transactions more 
secure use one time payment codes authenticate 
transactions without any card information actually being 
present the mobile device what could make cloud based 
solutions more attractive retailers enhanced security due 
tokenization resulted lowering interchange fees for 
card not present transactions 
apple poised make its move mobile payments 
recent comments the company indicate increased 
likelihood that apple will launch mobile payments platform 
ceo tim cook commented the december quarter earnings 
call and since then the wall street journal that the company 
plans launch new product and services categories 
when asked directly about mobile payments the earnings 
call cook said that customers want purchase content using 
touch the fingerprint sensor because simple easy and 
elegant currently apple allows users purchase content 
from the itunes and app stores using their fingerprint but the 
technology not available third party applications cook 
also said saw more opportunity this area especially when 
given the demographics apple customers and the amount 
commerce that goes through ios devices versus competing 
platforms 
apple and others are creating ecosystem beacons 
recent months have seen trials and adoption beacons 
and bluetooth low energy the standard this network 
beacons will essential simple and easy use mobile 
payment network our view fact there could many 
applications such deliver advertisements public 
information and locate something someone indoors 
believe apple will unlikely launch mobile payment system 
unless the supporting infrastructure ready based its 
historical behavior since does not want users have

successful mobile wallets take off given the fact that the 
retailers behind the consortium will ban the use other forms 
mobile wallets their stores this could present strong 
enough incentive for consumers download and use the mcx

also make consumers less willing share there financial 
credentials with retailers consumers trust retailers

with see exhibit and the highly publicized news regarding

strategy behind the success its decoupled debit redcard 
which offers discount off each purchase fellow mcx 
consortium member such wal mart may not willing
