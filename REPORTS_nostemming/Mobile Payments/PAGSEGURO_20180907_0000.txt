trying make sense recent underperformance pags 
looked for perspective from our payments processing 
research team below conversation between our two 
teams 
jorge kuri james many thanks for your input this pagseguro shares 
have come under significant pressure lately the back comments from cielo 
they are planning launch operations the micromerchant space segment 
that pagseguro dominates today and has had limited competition over the 
last years pags down from its recent peak and the bears argue that 
growth and margins will come under pressure the back competition 
have different view think the bears are underestimating three things 
the vast white space available acquiring the penetration cards 
still low with plastics representing only consumption 
acceptance and usage still have significant runway think there 
plenty room accommodate existing and new acquirers without major 
disruptions growth and profitability

pags has significant head start with million active merchants today 
and adding million more over the next months and product 
offering ecosystem that far more robust 
acquiring for micromerchants unique and challenging business where 
the large incumbents have experience think there tough ramp 
for them get right especially they are not particularly customercentric highly innovative companies product the duopoly structure 
they operated for decades view 
james are there any similarities here with the way competition evolved 
acquiring square and other similar players appeared the market 
james faucette hey jorge would attribute square success the 
main points continued tailwind consumption spending and shift 
electronic payments sq ability eliminate upfront credit checks the 
merchant onboarding process develop brand around its services and 
differentiation that left incumbents consistently looking like the also ran 
imitators 
point pervasive all the players the payments ecosystem but point

report 
relied square realizing that its original focus small micro merchants would allow 
diversify away most the same risks that historically merchant acquirers were 
trying control with credit checks was the real innovation the pursuit risk 
diversification allowed for introduction what amounts freemium model for 
gaining acceptance thereafter has been really good continuing evolve its 
automate its risk management systems such that has been able push down losses 
bps remarkable given that anybody anywhere can get square terminal and 
start taking credit and debit card payments less than minutes incumbent 
merchant acquirers were slow develop those same risk management and customer 
service abilities further the incumbents focus larger merchants makes the 
diversification process harder achieve least the way square has done 
developing brand has resulted square ability rollout new services merchants 
that improved retention and provided substantial pricing leverage these incremental 
services largely revolve around capabilities that are intended more fully integrate the 
payment systems with the merchants own business processes while also providing new 
data analytics capabilities the merchants 
the incumbents have moved rapidly emulate square successful services 
integrated payments customer analysis inventory management working capital credit 
etc the result has been that merchant acquiring generally has seen much reduced 
churn levels the while just the space couple years merchant acquiring 
has stopped being driven primarily price competition fact prices have generally 
begun rise for all merchant acquirers they introduce their additional services 
similar square which turn has benefitted the entire industry profitability and 
stock performance 
jorge kuri thanks james indeed pagseguro has put lot emphasis adding other 
products services their payments platform order increase client retention and 
revenues however most bears pags tend concerned that these add ons 
represent competitive advantage they think the incumbents can quickly copy the 
most successful parts pags offering hence limiting its market share grab was this 
the case with was there skepticism initially about its competitive advantage and 
what point what were the catalysts that convince the bears otherwise 
james faucette has rolled out range additional operational services its 
platform including full function checkout cash registers software modules that can 
handle scheduling invoicing inventory management etc and recently square acquired 
weebly which should help its traditionally bricks and mortar customers more easily 
develop commerce websites bring their goods and services line nutshell 
square wants provide business box that all small new business needs 
have idea and square can provide all the operational tools needed get 
and running 
those new services sound great and have seen modest adoption but they have not 
driven most the revenue growth square subscription and services line item 
instead most the growth yoy that reporting segment has come 
from sources credit and instant deposit with the credit product square takes 
advantage the historical transaction data offer and underwrite loans its 
customers nearly apr and essentially garnishes revenue assure high 
payback rates those loans instant deposit service whereby square will for fee 
bps deposit cash into the businesses account the same day instead 
waiting the days for card payment transactions clear should noted that the 
credit product likely highly cyclical and the long run the federal reserve 
would like see services like instant deposit away 
are not sure bears have been convinced that some aspects the square business 
are appropriately valued but they certainly are frustrated particularly square has 
consistently posted better than expected results and raised its outlook primarily 
because faster transaction volume growth because greater than expected 
contribution from square credit instant deposit date software products and 
services have not been meaningful upside contributors 
jorge kuri may add another question the bears pags also think that pricing 
mdr equipment key for merchants choosing acquiring companies tend 
disagree difference mdr ends being small amount terms 
given that small micro merchants don sell lot cards once they have 
provider unlikely they switch around minimize mdr this something you see 
the too did the incumbent acquirers initially try compete with price 
happening now with pags brazil and how did that turn out 
james faucette historically mdr pricing has been key part deciding merchant 
acquirer decision making process and depending the business and volume can 
important part churn square has been leader reducing the impact mdr pricing 
decision making metric across the industry has focused building consumer 
brand awareness providing more pricing transparency and more fully integrating with 
the business processes its customers the rest the merchant acquirers are now 
following square approach and that generally resulting lower churn and higher 
pricing across the industry would point out that the reduced price sensitivity may 
also attributable the strength the economy and the preoccupation with fending 
off line competition from the likes amazon both which can occupy more 
merchant concern than trying squeeze out incremental bps payment 
processing costs 
jorge kuri thanks again james there anything you want ask anything you 
think should thinking about this industry evolves 
james faucette indeed jorge four things come mind 
how you feel about the ability the incumbent merchant acquirers banks hire 
key data and analytics scientists and pair them with strong risk managers 
how important brand development and association likely for merchants 
pags key markets 
the government implementing policies encourage the adoption electronic 
payments over cash check 
are the incumbents starting talk about emulating pags service offerings more 
than pricing differentiation imitation the sincerest form flattery you know 
jorge kuri innovation through data and risk think will slow process james 
bradesco caixa economica federal and santander brasil control loans and 
deposits the country well dominant shares other products such asset 
management insurance brokerage and course merchant acquiring this highly 
concentrated market structure has resulted banking system that has limited 
competition very high prices across the board arguably the very top global 
banking and generic and non client centric products and services this favorable setup for the banks has meant that they been able sit back charge high and make 
attractive returns capital without necessarily having leaders efficiency 
innovation some brazilian banks don even risk based pricing yet all this 
probably explains why the incumbent banks acquirers have been late identifying 
and profiting from the micromerchant space and why wasn until pags became public 
earlier this year that they started get interested with that backdrop just seems 
unlikely that the incumbents will get right quickly for what its worth also note 
that many the efforts that the large banks have made penetrate the bottom the 
pyramid the past have failed taii fininvest finasa 
regarding brand development think will very relevant for seems that 
brand and identity have become critical for fintech companies globally fintech clientcentric approach finance has brought brand the forefront the competitive set 
and brazil different pags has strong brand already they effectively introduced 
micromerchant acquiring brazil years ago and arguably have meaningful head 
start versus the peers pags controlled one the largest media companies 
brazil and such has leveraged the parent online and offline properties including 
the largest newspaper circulation build strong brand name among consumers 
and small companies the incumbent merchant acquirers banks have deep pockets and 
can invest heavily building their micromerchant brand going forward but said 
before think pags has very strong first mover advantage indeed with close 
million active merchants today pagseguro way ahead the peers while stelo from 
cielo and credicard pop from itau rede push get their first thousand 
merchants over the next months pagseguro may add another 
thousand over the same period expect pags reach million total active 
merchants year end 
yes the government has been pushing for more electronic payments and this has been 
key driver behind the dozens new acquirers operating brazil far the 
government efforts have been aimed reducing card processing cost for merchants 
brazil had very expensive mdr and pos prices result the acquiring oligopoly for 
decades cielo and rede had market share due the exclusivity agreements they 
had with the large global card networks the government eliminated those exclusivities 
this opened competition and lower prices ensued more recently the 
government imposed caps interchange rates expecting that the acquirers will pass 
the savings the merchants the card usage side the government has also 
implemented policies reduce the cost credit cards for consumers specifically 
limiting the issuers ability charge compound interest card balances after certain 
period time recent dispatch our view regulation outline more detail 
our expectation for government action this industry summary believe the 
government will continue support the proliferation electronic payments mostly 
leveling the playing field that small acquirers such pags can continue thrive 
lastly your question about incumbents emulating pags offering think they have 
been slow the reality that the incumbent acquirers have launched their 
micromerchant solutions just recently maybe the last months their initial 
advertisement and positioning has been more focused pricing than features and 
services for the most part they are offering basic payment processing solutions with 
limited differentiation other than price just recently maybe month ago they realized 
their offerings were somewhat uncompetitive because they don include digital 
accounts and pre paid cards and require bank account with the incumbents parent 
bank they are changing this now order offer the same set pags that 
said pags has continued products and services the ecosystem such 
erp solutions cell phone top off and account reconciliation among others pags 
also pilot testing lending product now continue think that pagseguro more 
robust product offering represents key competitive advantage just you mentioned 
for think merchants choose pags mostly because has superior product with 
pricing representing secondary factor 
reiterate our overweight rating pags see multi year period strong eps 
growth driven the low penetration card based payments brazil the attractive 
opportunity cross sell products and services beyond payments the client base and 
the high operating leverage embedded pags business model think the market 
too negative regulatory and competition risk and underappreciating pags 
competitive advantages from its more robust platform recently published reports 
with our views competition and regulation the two key debates pags you can
