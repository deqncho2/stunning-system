largest payment networks revaluation process which could persist the primary investor concern continues 
focused around potential disruption from technology however believe that any changes the status 
quo are likely result very slow behavior changes and the slow and steady changes should allow the 
incumbents withstand and ultimately opt most efforts disruption believe that the incumbent tends 
win view enabled three key aspects adoption cycles are very long making surprising disruption 
difficult typical efforts disrupt currency payment systems focus primarily redistribution fees that for 
most are negligible and regulation persists biggest wild card but incumbents tend have the most 
influence 
have slight preference for over raise our from and our from 
are both and but have slight preference for for two reasons first accretion from the 
visa europe acquisition which not baked into consensus estimates yet street estimates our view are likely 
once the deal completed possibly early april and see potential for upside risk 
accretion guidance provided visa over time second trading discount our 
estimates including accretion from visa europe the discount not justifiable our view given our 
expectation for visa earnings growth outpace and beyond accretion from visa europe starts 
materialize

how will the proliferation mobile wallets impact visa and mastercard expect will support the

positions the company favorably reap long term revenue and cost synergies that should drive potential

secular shift electronic payments around the world the reality that the growth mobile payments 
developed markets well the adoption electronic payments emerging markets has not tracked better 
than expected most cases the steady and predictable pace adoption makes disruption incumbents 
difficult because they are afforded very long lead times adapt offerings and business processes needed our 
revisit actual adoption rates previous expectations highlights that macro the biggest variable and that 
secular growth can difficult measure let alone drive for key point the somewhat muted rate 
electronic adoption vis vis our estimates from several years ago serves highlight the difficulty truly 
disrupting the incumbent payment ecosystem not mention the carriers abandonment its payment effort 
softcard which was sold google and the still pending launch the merchant backed mcx 
typical efforts disrupt currency payment systems focus primarily redistribution fees that 
for most are negligible besides changes payment behavior being very long develop affording 
incumbents substantial adaption time and extending the time viability for challengers particular find 
that most efforts disrupt the current payment structure highlight some these exhibit are usually 
intended redistribute traditional interchange and may provide some incremental economic benefit 
merchants and consumers however expect that those new schemes are unlikely meaningfully change the 
payments landscape and that challengers will continue partner with the networks for key reasons 
are already the low cost providers while lower cost processing may available 
compared that the networks almost always the expense key aspects 
functionality and service time settlement assurance clearing etc have been 
compromised nearly all cases that have examined those new processing networks

redistribution modest fees consumers difficult because few many 
redistribution fees consumers difficult because the overall savings consumer 
negligible while the potential adverse impact those that are collecting interchange and 
fees considerable concentration benefit will lead more robust defensive behavior 
banks acquirers etc and most consumers are likely find that the potential savings tens 
basis points transaction not worth pursuing especially acceptance other 
assurances are compromised 
merchants paying lower fees probably does not result more profitability fund 
payment change efforts some the biggest pushes for changes transaction processing 
order reduce fees and interchange has come from merchants however remain 
skeptical that such schemes can effective for the simple reason that the more successful 
any merchant based initiative the more likely result reduced feeds for all 
merchants and those transaction costs are reduced for large proportion merchants 
then any savings are likely competed away thereby reducing the ability fund and 
justify the investment the alternative schemes that say believe that the more 
broadly appealing initiatives like mcx merchant customer exchange could the less likely 
sufficiently funded and show continued development 
regulation persists the biggest wild card but incumbents tend have the most influence 
believe that regulatory changes are the most likely drivers changes the current industry structure indeed 
have seen regulatory mandates that have necessitated structural changes including the durbin act 
congressional act that cut debit interchange fees half the well reduced cross border 
interchange rates and the separation brand and scheme which disallows the bundled sale brand scheme

broadly speaking expect the proliferation mobile wallets will support the shift from cash 
electronic payments and the fact that most mobile wallets have chosen use the existing networkcentric payments infrastructure rather than create competing system means that growth should 
ultimate beneficiary the pace adoption mobile wallets for payment transactions however 
likely remain slow and uneven given that requires considerable change consumer behavior and 
merchant infrastructure 
developed markets where innovation focused making the purchase experience easier expect 
mobile wallets substitute plastic cards first with longer term potential for displacement cash 
the experience becomes stickier emerging markets the opportunity drive financial inclusion 
among the unbanked and enable electronic transactions environment where existing infrastructure 
not ready support traditional card use 
expect use mobile wallets will gain faster traction for remote online payments given clearer 
value proposition for the consumer and easier enablement the merchant end but the emv upgrade 
cycle the should provide impetus for infrastructure upgrade nfc and mobile adoption the

markets think the proliferation mobile payments will help make the checkout experience more seamless 
enable new types commerce experiences uber and help displace the use cash checks and even 
plastic developing markets the penetration mobile phones much deeper than penetration bank 
accounts which makes mobile payments more powerful medium drive financial inclusion among large 
unbanked populations mobile payments technology also expected leapfrog traditional card based 
payments given lack broad based issuer distribution and pos infrastructures these regions 
mobile payments viewed more opportunity than threat for visa and mastercard today few years 
ago given that several the high profile wallet launches the apple pay android pay samsung pay

see the ultimate embrace the traditional payment networks mobile wallet sponsors partial

usage the offline world are not applicable the online world there hardware upgrade requirement 
and there clear value proposition for consumers hence the near term are more optimistic about

contactless payments may more receptive mobile payments given familiarity with the tap and 
experience and broader availability acceptance infrastructure australia stands out country which 
usage contactless card payments relatively high mobile payment adoption this point low but six 
australia largest banks have recently signed with android pay and the service expected live

europe credit and debit interchange fees are considerably lower following legislation 
following the european commission proposal from july new interchange fee regulation was 
implemented europe effective december the regulation caps consumer credit card interchange fees 
and consumer debit card interchange fees similar existing interchange rates for crossborder transactions addition member states will have the flexibility impose lower rate caps and 
maximum fee amounts for consumer debit cards final guidance the rules was provided march 
other notable but yet implemented provisions the legislation includes separation payment card 
schemes and processing entities the separation processing from scheme provision disallows the bundled

believe affluent spending remains bigger driver growth than mass market spend growth 
despite near term impacts from lower fuel prices and stock market wealth effect volatility ultimately

affluent mass spending 
affluent credit spending growth continues outpace other categories consumer credit according 
commentary from visa and mastercard large part the recovery consumer spending since the last 
downturn has been driven the affluent credit segment developed markets given the resiliency the 
affluent consumer mass market consumer this segment has been bigger focus for the networks and 
issuers alike they were historically underrepresented this segment with amex enjoying the strongest 
foothold here according visa affluent credit represents its overall credit portfolio 
believe affluent credit spending continues grow significantly faster than all other consumer credit 
categories although assume lower gas prices may have served bigger headwind affluent segment 
mass consumer segments this because mass market segment has started redeploy their savings from 
lower energy costs other categories such restaurants while affluent consumer spending less sensitive 
gas prices and hence resulted increased savings from lower gas prices that said note that gas price 
spending slightly more skewed debit and therefore likely have muted impact credit spend 
believe that continued stock market volatility could expose affluent spending slowdown given risk the 
wealth high net worth individuals although visa has noted that they have not seen any impact yet 
meanwhile mass market spend likely more stable until start see rise unemployment rates

cross border transactions generate the highest yields for and but these are also the most cyclical 
transactions seen during the last recession and currently have similar exposure cross border 
revenue ltm gross revenue for both companies note that cross border volume growth has 
consistently outperformed visa this due greater exposure everyday nature intra european 
cross border travel which has proven relatively more resilient uneven macro conditions this should 
continue benefit were head into downturn though visa should also start benefit from these 
trends once the visa europe acquisition complete additionally believe that the strengthening the usd 
has also impacted cross border spend more severely than given that some the loss inbound

the share shifts have stabilized over the last couple years with regaining some momentum cobrand portfolios and with improving performance from its large issuers future share gains and losses 
between the two networks are hard predict while may incented price more aggressively 
given its smaller market share think scale favors visa ability more aggressive when needed 
recent renewal certain large clients for longer should lead relative stability market share over 
time 
debit has gained share from driven primarily the durbin debit interchange regulation 
going forward expect that market shares should remain relatively stable although they could flip 
flop quarter quarter based large merchant routing decisions 
visa inc completes the visa europe acquisition believe europe likely the next big focus for 
market share wins mastercard has been gaining share europe over the last several years and this 
could change consolidates the operations although acquisition integration process could take years giving the opportunity poach new clients 
given global transactions are still conducted cash expect both and continue 
gain share from cash check based transactions 
visa has been consistent share gainer credit visa has been and remains the dominant network for 
credit card purchase volumes the data from the nilson report shows that has consistently gained 
share and represented general purpose credit purchase volumes from this 
not surprising given its scale advantage competition which can give edge contract negotiations 
growth credit has lagged following the financial crisis driven least part its association 
with large issuers that underperformed through the downturn citibank well its smaller exposure 
brand portfolios like airlines hotels which are skewed affluent cardholders and performed better post 
the financial crisis 
over the last few years has made concerted effort improve its position credit and has been 
successful winning disproportionate share relatively small brand deals and few large ones like 
walmart and target also now benefitting from late cycle recovery its largest issuers like citibank that 
are investing growing their card business and potentially taking share from visa issuers 
the traditional issuer side seen some shake ups recently driven the networks desire renew early 
and issuers willingness consolidate its business with one network partner and get locked for longer due 
better pricing higher rebates incentives strategic considerations both examples include jpm chase 
which entered year network license agreement with visa establish chasenet wherein jpm consolidated 
its entire consumer portfolio with visa and created its own virtual closed loop network citibank which plans 
consolidate its global business with and while citi predominantly issues branded cards the 
believe that globally the citi portfolio that will win from larger than what lost the jpm chase 
deconversion and iii usaa bank which has decided flip its entire credit and debit portfolio from 
believe that longer term contracts should ultimately good for stability the industry with lesser volume 
available for flips given high conversion costs that said flips are inevitable given part the competing interests 
payments and processing march 
morgan stanley research 
that the networks face retailer desire for low fees and issuer desire for sufficient interchange fund their 
rewards model 
going forward think that while large portfolio flips are unpredictable following several large renewals 
completed recently both traditional issuer and branded may see slowdown large renewals the 
though few prominent issuer renewals are potentially upcoming suntrust share gains and losses 
between the two networks are hard predict and while one can argue that may incented price more 
aggressively given smaller market share think scale favors visa ability more aggressive when 
needed

rce nilso rep rgan stan ley research 
durbin regulation was serendipitous for unlike the credit market has been the net share winner 
the debit market largely account the debit interchange fee regulation also called durbin regulation 
after the sponsor the bill which disallowed exclusive deals between debit networks and card issuers the 
regulation mandated that all debit cards should have least two unaffiliated networks one signature 
network the front and different pin network the back one signature network the front and 
separate pin networks the back with merchants having more control over routing decisions although there 
are several other regional pin networks star nyce accel etc and dfs pulse network that were positioned

going forward expect that market shares should remain relatively stable although they could flip flop 
quarter quarter based large merchant routing decisions which turn are likely influenced the

while the chinese payment market has been growing rapidly the overall penetration cards per person 
relatively low compared asian markets such japan cards per person and south korea cards per

while rural regions which still have high population density are less penetrated 
terms penetration credit and debit cards accounted for all consumer payments china 
this compares card payment penetration pce the based data from the

and progress could slow but should accretive revenue and eps growth over time 
china opens its domestic payments market think are well positioned gain share over time 
although initial progress could slow given the challenges building acceptance any new market they are 
also likely face competition from new domestic entrants that are also expected apply for bank card 
clearing license when the market finally opened meanwhile third party payment providers such alipay 
and tenpay already have considerable lead for online commerce and have previously announced plans 
venture into offline payments through mobile form factors mobile payments adoption picks estimate 
that mobile payment penetration the point sale relatively small today 
that said given their participation branded card issuance over the past few years both networks have 
relationships with several large issues china many whom are also large acquirers the market think 
many banks china are likely view the increased network competition positively allows them offer 
more diversified suite product offerings their end consumers and also have the advantage global 
acceptance and bring several competitive tools such sophisticated reward services platform help drive 
cards usage seasoned advertising and marketing engine influence consumer behavior and rebates and 
incentives drive issuer and merchant behavior 
overall estimate that even achieving little combined market share purchase volumes over 
year period purchase volume cagr could generate combined revenues based 
yield assumptions which could accretive revenue growth over that period according 
the companies profitability could take longer than typical trajectory prior instances new market entry given 
that china may require soil presence processing infrastructure which could cost tens millions

payment rails with least dozen banks expected live with the service year end 
visa and mastercard believe that the investments towards real time ach are targeted towards interbank and payments and that ach even real time cannot replicate the value proposition 
offered the networks the pos ach does not allow for real time authentication dispute 
resolution chargebacks etc 
think that the near term real time pay likely compete with non bank payment options 
such paypal and venmo longer term could potentially slow the growth rate debit card payments

service year end the backbone this real time payments service are the ach automated clearing 
house bank owned network for clearing and settling between banks clearxchange and early

employee bank account same thing when you authorize the electric company pull funds monthly out 
your bank account that payment runs over the ach rails

with handful more banks joining then well she estimates that least the country deposits will 
able live with real time pay the end 
one the reasons that banks will able offer real time pay national automated clearing house 
nacha roll out same day settlement between banks september the initial roll out two

the gauntlet for ubiquitous and secure real time payments end end means from the point

step address this request the payment service launched usb and bac march graseck 
expects that over time real time ach will expand include and well 
visa and mastercard believe that the investments towards real time ach are targeted towards inter bank 
and payments and that ach even real time cannot replicate the value proposition offered the 
networks the pos ach does not allow for real time authentication dispute resolution chargebacks etc 
the networks also believe that lot the objectives moving real time payments can achieved with the 
networks existing technology pin debit and least has acknowledged that they are trying engage 
discussions with the relevant parties that regard think that the near term real time pay likely 
compete with non bank payment options such paypal and venmo longer term could potentially slow 
the growth rate debit card payments consumers get used sending money securely via tokenized email

morgan stanley research 
recent conversations with and 
recently had the opportunity spend time with visa and mastercard managements during which 
reviewed some key questions that are topical investors our key takeaways each follow 
visa 
our recent visits with management including cfo vasant prabhu have been upbeat have found that most 
investor inquiries into the visa investment case seem focused primarily around the potential for technology 
regulatory disruptions 
investment prioritized motivate continued shift electronic visa management has consistently made 
investments with eye continuing enable sustained shift electronic transactions from cash and check 
this has been central driver many visa investments third parties well recent introductions new 
functionality like visa checkout visa digital enablement program launch visa developer etc generally 
management looking for partners drive traffic its network and the degree that decides that there are 
new applications that further help the shift the company likely increase investment those areas the 
same time expect the company continue find ways encourage newest payment tech efforts 
parties migrate its payment network 
china opportunity likely slow developing visa beginning the initial stages building presence 
china but expects that the time profitability likely measured years many new markets visa 
able take advantage its existing processing infrastructure achieve profitability quite quickly after 
entering new markets however with the regulatory requirement that card networks build out processing 
capability china itself investment that likely cost tens millions the time profitability likely 
much longer china estimating time profitability further complicated because the full regulatory and 
competitive framework likely still not complete 
comfortable with current regulatory evolution environment our conversations with management 
indicated that the company generally feels comfortable that has good understanding current regulatory 
processes and objectives nevertheless management remains cognizant that change administration and 
congress post upcoming elections could reintroduce new challenges 
mastercard 
potential impact from visa inc acquisition visa europe has anticipated this merger for years and 
has been planning for while likely emerge stronger competitor expects based its own 
experience that will take least years for visa integrate the two companies and bring visa europe 
deficient technology par the interim believes there are opportunities flip clients although the 
performance linked earnout provision visa acquisition agreement could create some variability timing 
doesn anticipate pricing increases europe the near term does expect that potential pricing increases 
visa europe should alleviate some pressure its own pricing discussions with existing potentially new 
clients 
regulation europe the proposed regulation separation scheme from processing expected take 
effect june the regulation calls for functional separation the payment card scheme and processing 
entities into two separate business units with separate workspace and would entail staff independence senior 
management independence and accounting independence noted that all related expenses are already 
contemplated guidance but expects provide more color get closer the implementation 
china still distant opportunity noted that among other aspects there clarity how many 
licenses the chinese government will grant initially and whether they will grant license foreign 
payments and processing march 
morgan stanley research 
entity will required other industries that have opened china the government has started 
granting only one license opening more broadly over time expects could different for the 
payments industry given the involvement the wto that said there are examples china granting 
license foreign entity and hence exploring all potential options they prepare for market 
entry reiterated that while its guidance bakes investments tens millions dollars 
assumes incremental revenue contribution from the domestic payments market china
