despite rally the stock since its merger 
with kakao was announced may think the 
market still not fully pricing the growth 
opportunity from new services mobile payments 
kakao mobile payment revenues will hit 
our view the company recently soft launched 
its payments service initially linked card and 
accelerated user adoption adding hyundai card 
management says working security upgrades 
attract more credit card companies and banks onto the 
platform teething issues aside think the fact that 
kakao has monthly users places the 
strongest position capture leading role korea 
nascent mobile payments market think this market 
could worth transaction values 
estimate this opportunity worth 
revenues there are two buckets value creation 
transaction based charges similar paypal venmo 
and square cash and cross selling for its yellow 
advertising platform and lower third party commissions 
for its own content and games sales 
also have bull case that suggests upside 
this assumes kakao effectively replaces the wallet 
enables offline merchant transactions and expands into 
some core banking services over time 
where could wrong competition risk for 
example apple pay though apple smartphone has 
share only around korea also think 
kakao hardware agnostic platform will broaden its 
appeal there are also regulatory risks given kakao

questions 
will there high 
user adoption for 
kakao mobile 
payments 
why expect success 
yes first kakao boasts monthly active 
users korea over the population 
users access messaging applications roughly 
times day kakao related apps and 
services see significant downloads think 
kakao pay well bank wallet will see very 
high downloads thanks viral marketing and 
network effect second kakao messaging 
service conducive for money transfer 
well mobile payments because the social 
graph contains close friends and family and 
mobile ubiquity and real time communications 
allow for quick confirmation remittance and 
payment receipts lastly think both kakao 
pay and bank wallet will more convenient 
and easy use than existing payment options 
what could wrong 
will merchants 
accept kakao mobile 
payments 
yes high user adoption should force merchants 
accept kakao payments provide 
customers with the convenience multiple 
payment options mobile well online 
merchants are likely offer kakao payment 
options off line merchants could also accept 
bank wallet payments creating their own 
account bank wallet could avoid credit card 
transaction fees off line merchants with card 
reader can also accept kakao pay 
large retailers open market players could 
concerned that kakao could wield influence 
consumers financial institutions could wary 
that the value proposition could shift kakao 
large retailers might not welcome another middle 
player into the payment structure 
can kakao 
monetize payments 
yes kakao transactions rise merchants will 
look capture higher share the transactions 
influencing purchasing decisions kakao 
users this could the form proximity 
offers virtual currencies coupons daily savings 
and for these influenced transactions 
kakao can negotiate for share the revenue 
with merchants least having transaction data 
will allow kakao better target users for 
advertising purposes the meantime yellow 
can used kakao mobile landing sites for 
merchants where click call well cost 
per click can monetized 
kakao might not able offer product where 
merchant offers are matched efficiently with the 
right consumers which means influenced 
transactions could limited 
users might find the kakao pay bank wallet 
user interface not intuitive users could 
concerned about potential security and financial 
information leaks initially storing credit card 
information for kakao pay and linking bank 
account with bank wallet might cumbersome

the stock has risen since the announcement 
proposed merger with kakao may for 
the kospi index the proposed merger now approved 
more than two thirds shareholders the egm august 
and will completed october with the new 
shares listing october given shareholder approval and 
pending regulatory review the merger now issue our 
own proforma estimates the combined entity named 
daum kakao 
but there room for further rating driven new 
service launches and synergies from the merger our 
view for the most exciting new service kakao pay 
bank wallet also think yellow launched august 
will complimentary service this note further 
examine this opportunity detail conclude that kakao 
monthly users put the company unique position 
grab first mover advantages this nascent market 
estimate kakao will capture transaction value 
total retail transactions there scope for crossing 
and upselling within its existing portfolio including yellow 
advertisements and its gaming and content platform can also 
capture revenue share merchant services such kakao 
offers beacon taxi daily deals and food delivery 
kakao pay bank wallet launches are september 
kakao platform now extending financial services 
kakao pay was launched september enables users 
link and store their credit card information users can simply 
pay for products and services offered various merchants 
bank wallet kakao also expected launched some 
time september would allow users engage 
money transfer linking their bank checking accounts 
the bottom line that see scope for very high user 
adoption and thus wide merchant acceptance for kakao 
pay and bank wallet the ubiquity kakao mobile 
payment suite our view should pave the way for new 
products and services such virtual items kakao offers 
beacon taxi daily deals yellow and these new 
monetization models combine marketing capabilities made 
possible payment transactions 
think kakao mobile payment will capture transactions 
amounting representing roughly 
retail transactions that time which includes offline ecommerce and home shopping transations our base case

question can kakao monetize mobile payments 
think kakao mobile payment suite offers four distinct 
monetization opportunities for kakao 
kakao pay bank wallet can displace direct carrier 
billing for virtual item purchases within google play store 
kakao payment suite should enable new services such 
kakao offers beacon taxi food delivery and 
rich consumer data combined with merchant product 
information should facilitate yellow vertical search 
well mcommerce service such kakao gifting 
daily deals 
kakao payment suite should able receive portion 
interchange fees from banks and credit card issuers 
the end what matters the total size the transaction 
amount and the average fee received the transaction the 
total transaction amount should vary based how ubiquitous 
the kakao payment suite accepted online and mobile 
shopping offline merchants home shopping and department 
stores fees differ types transactions for example 
virtual items transactions are lucrative with revenue share 
think influenced transactions such kakao offers 
and kakao taxi could wield higher revenue share kakao 
can enable merchants influence purchasing decisions 
kakao users 
think kakao mobile payments could generate net revenue 
roughly assuming that kakao can 
capture transactions amounting which 
coming from influenced transations this influenced 
transaction think kakao can command roughly

they could capture potential monetization opportunities

they could engage disenfranchised younger consumers
