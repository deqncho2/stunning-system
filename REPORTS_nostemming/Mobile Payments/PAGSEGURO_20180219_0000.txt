credit and debit card penetration and usage brazil remains low relative developed

much lower than the the and canada for example where the level 
this means that the substitution effect that consumers using more card based 
payments relative cash should still powerful driver card volumes over the 
next decade credit penetration should also drive card usage particularly big ticket 
items via credit cards environment gdp growth improving employment and 
sustained low interest rates think there scope expand the gearing that 
consumers are willing incur and when comes borrowing the legacy and 
stickiness credit cards should fuel attractive growth over the medium term credit 
card loans represent only total consumer lending brazil versus

online commerce growing rapidly brazil low penetration suggests strong growth 
should continue commerce transaction volumes grew per year from 
according emarketer however only retail sales commerce 
penetration brazil looks low absolute and relative terms comparison 
penetration the and the brazil low commerce penetration 
odds with the country large online audience fourth largest worldwide and 
penetration the population according emarketer pagseguro stands 
benefit greatly from the secular shift from offline online commerce given its 
significant exposure online while most the incumbents are largely exposed 
offline regrettably pags provides very limited disclosure around revenues but from 
channel checks estimate that around its acquiring volumes are done through 
online transactions for cielo the same figure around 
also like pags given the cross selling opportunities and network effect its 
business model think the company business model with safe affordable 
simple and mobile first solutions for micro merchants and consumers represents 
attractive platform for bancarization and financial inclusion brazil expanding the 
product offering beyond the payment processing space and the value the network 
grows pagseguro adds products and services this increases the attractiveness 
belonging the network for merchants and consumers further the larger the 
network the more pricing power for pagseguro 
it not only about revenues operating leverage should also boost eps growth 
addition attractive top line expansion think pagseguro can generate additional 
eps growth through operating leverage indeed the company business model highly 
scalable with high percentage fixed costs and hence cost per transaction falls with 
incremental revenue growth additionally cross selling adds operating leverage 
new products can sold virtually customer acquisition cost surprise cost and 
expenses percentage transaction sales and prepayment revenues reached 
down from and see them and 
all said given pagseguro relative small size unique business model and 
differentiated target market the company should continue far outpace overall 
industry growth expect total payment volume growth and

attractive valuation pags now trading and 
roughly line with the peer group average yet pags growing much faster and 
delivering higher profitability than most the peers relative the faster growing 
payment companies the pagseguro trades large discount indeed pypl and 
now trade our price target implies which looks 
manageable given the beforementioned multiples 
regulatory risk and competition are the two key debates the 
stock our view 
regulation several market participants and news outlets argue that the regulator 
will likely shorten the settlement credit card transactions from the current day 
period something closer international standards days needless say this 
action could materially reduce revenues and income associated with prepayment for 
merchant acquirers brazil pagseguro derives the majority its profits from 
prepayment 
pagseguro prepays credit card receivables two ways prepayment for the day 
settlement period via higher mdr which accounted transaction revenues and 
prepayment for purchases made installments accounted financial income far 
the largest portion the two prepayment for installments 
don think the regulator will change the settlement period anytime soon our 
thinking twofold cutting the settlement period would reduce competition the 
merchant acquiring space exactly the opposite what regulators are trying 
our view all the regulatory measures seen over the last five years have been 
aimed leveling the playing field that new smaller acquirers can start operations 
brazil increasing the regulatory hurdle prepayment would likely put small players 
disadvantage over their larger peers shortening the settlement period cards 
may end hurting consumers presumably something regulator wants why 
because the banks may have cut add interest the credit card interest free 
installment purchases staple brazilian consumption installment purchases are 
partly funded with the existing day float cards this has always been the 
complexity changing the day settlement period the other side the coin 
subsidy credit card consumption 
what wrong what stake the regulator forces the day settlement 
period down days calculate that pags could lose transaction revenue 
total revenue all else equal basis clearly not game changer and the 
ultimate impact pagseguro business will function pricing power that the 
company ability increase prices order offset the loss prepayment revenues 
that said the impact profits may much larger the banks decide eliminate 
add interest the existing interest free installment purchases discussed above 
ran extreme bear case calculate fair value under significantly reduced 
prepayment business get pags fair value versus our for 
details please see page 
competition some market participants are unconvinced that pagseguro can 
continue deliver outsized growth and margins they argue that pags success and 
visibility from ipo has alerted competition about the attractive growth opportunity and 
high margins available the micro merchant segment and given the low barriers 
entry and the incumbents technological prowess and deep pockets just matter 
time before they launch competitive offers 
disagree with the skeptics there will competition doubt but the following 
three factors should alleviate the pressure market share and margins the 
penetration cards brazil still very low there plenty room 
accommodate existing and new acquirers without major disruptions pricing 
don expect the two large incumbents make aggressive move downstream their 
business model very different and importantly extremely profitable and sustainable 
the incumbents focus processing large volumes where their massive economies 
scale low acquisition costs and the corporate banking relationship and distribution 
network their controllers provide edge also the controllers previous forays 
downmarket have been largely unsuccessful different dna think true that 
there are relatively low barriers entry however for platform businesses like 
pagseguro first market and network benefits provide competitive advantage 
look back years evident that key criteria online success first 
mover with best class products services market with large opportunity 
think pags fits the mold 
notwithstanding our positive view pags the following investment concerns need 
considered and represent risk our eps and estimates 
regulatory risk the payments industry brasil regulated regulatory caps 
acquiring prices pressure companies reduce prices other regulatory decisions 
may have impact earnings and value particular regulatory risk the day 
credit card settlement period needs considered given pags heavy reliance

competition the large incumbent acquiring companies could decide copy many

debate regulatory risk settlement period 
several market participants argue that the regulator the payments industry the 
central bank will likely shorten the settlement credit card transactions from the 
current day period something closer international standards days and 
some press articles here have suggested the regulator indeed looking into this the 
central bank has not officially commented the news nor has said plan cut the 
settlement period indeed the works needless say this action could materially 
reduce revenues and income associated with prepayment for merchant acquirers 
brazil pagseguro derives the majority its profits from prepayment 
have different view our thinking threefold 
cutting the settlement period would reduce competition the merchant acquiring 
space exactly the opposite what regulators are trying our view all 
the regulatory measures seen over the last five years have been aimed 
leveling the playing field that new smaller acquirers can start operations 
brazil acquiring scale business many the new entrants don have the scale 
yet profitable the transaction business the bulk their profits come 
from the prepayment business where scale not issue increasing the 
regulatory hurdle prepayment would likely put small players disadvantage 
over their larger peers this would counter what seen the regulator 
brazil payment industry still young with relatively low penetration plastics 
heavy regulation profitability this early stage could negatively impact the 
proliferation electronic payments 
think that shortening the settlement period cards will end hurting 
consumers presumably something regulator wants why because the 
banks may have cut add interest the credit card interest free installment 
purchases staple brazilian consumption recall that the banks partly fund 
these installment purchases with the existing day float they have credit 
cards this has always been the complexity changing the day settlement 
period the other side the coin subsidy credit card consumption the banks 
may have cut installments add interest rates them and increase credit card 
fees order make for the elimination the credit card float ultimately 
hurting consumers and the numbers are big interest free installment purchases 
credit cards amounted around billion last year 
what the regulator and other government agencies have said that the ultimate 
goal the regulatory changes that have transpired the payment industry since 
increase the penetration card payments means promote 
financial inclusion brazil and when comes financial inclusion pagseguro 
certainly stands out the majority its customers did not accept cards before 
struggle with the notion that the regulator could jeopardize pagseguro and 
other similar players sustainability this early stage financial inclusion brazil 
what wrong what stake the regulator forces the day settlement 
period down days calculate that pags could lose transaction revenue 
total revenue all else equal basis clearly not game changer and the 
ultimate impact pagseguro business will function pricing power that the 
company ability increase prices order offset the loss prepayment revenues

source morgan stanley research estimates 
regrettably the company does not disclose the amount transaction revenues that 
come from prepaying the day settlement period know the mdr involved 
prepayment transactions making guesstimate volumes can approximate 
revenue impact below the math behind our estimate but again the company 
does not provide enough disclosure calculate this tread lightly with our estimate 
assume that credit cards represent pags total payment volume this 
roughly what for the entire card industry credit and debit then 
assume that credit card volumes are prepaid for the day settlement period 
using pags published mdr rates calculate blended mdr for day day and 
day settlement the gap between the and day rates versus the day rate 
arguably what stake the premium excess pricing for early payment 
multiply the excess mdr times the volume prepaid and that gets million 
lost revenues total transaction revenues again this all else equal the 
company may able offset some this given its relatively good pricing power 
now bigger picture the real risk around the settlement period that the credit card 
issuers the big banks decide cut add interest the interest free installments 
discussed before this would put jeopardy the largest portion pags 
prepayment business prepayment installment purchases represented all the 
profits and less than the profits forecast for the next two years 
interest free installment purchases are fully eliminated will the prepayment 
income associated with and the banks keep installments but add interest them 
consumers will probably use them much less given the higher cost hence reducing 
prepayment income for acquirers 
mentioned before pagseguro prepays credit card receivables two ways 
prepayment for the day settlement period via higher mdr which accounted 
transaction revenues and prepayment for purchases made installments 
accounted financial income far the latter the largest 
ran extreme bear case calculate fair value under significantly reduced 
prepayment business get pags fair value versus our 
for this analysis assume that the credit card settlement period forced down 
days hence the premium mdr for prepayment gone explained before then 
assume banks decide add interest rates installment purchases and reduce the 
maximum length installments said before this likely makes the product less 
appealing consumers and hence the demand falls believe that pags prepays 
around its credit card volumes for installments our scenario assume this 
figure falls half result lower consumer usage this not only impacts financial 
income but also transaction revenues there higher mdr for purchases made 
installments shown page that said there somewhat offset here 
interchange also higher for installment purchases presumably this reduces the 
company cogs unfortunately hard the exact math there not enough 
disclosure around cogs 
important say that the above scenario made all else equal basis the 
eventual real impact will also depend the ability that pags has pass price 
increases offset some the negatives add new products such direct lending 
merchants akin square capital arguably pagseguro has strong pricing power 
given that its target audience has limited options find acquiring and credit services 
mentioned before the incumbent banks and payment companies generally not 
service pags core client base also all else equal means are not making 
assumption the returns that can generated the capital that now funding the 
prepayment business which will longer needed and course can redeployed 
profit elsewhere 
debate regulatory risk mdr prices 
some media articles late here suggest that the regulator may looking limit 
mdr for debit card payments making them flat fee not percentage value 
today the central bank has not commented this news nor has said plan 
change debit mdr indeed the works 
don think now would the right time regulate prices brazil and think 
the regulator gets offer the following four viewpoints 
merchant acquiring fixed cost business that requires big investments upfront 
scale paramount achieve profitability given their small scale new entrants 
must able charge higher mdr order profitable cap mdr would 
make smaller players less economically viable and deter new acquirers from 
entering the business this relatively young marketplace with most new players 
operating for less than years the brazilian acquiring industry challenging 
for new entrants given the presence two mega acquirers that control 
the market cielo and rede any measure that reduces the ability the small guys 
compete could potentially result less competition exactly the opposite 
what regulators have been pushing for 
capping mdr poses problem for regulators what the optimal level think 
there not clear answer and any estimate entails many assumptions there 
not one mdr for the entire economy the rate ultimately depends credit and 
debit card volumes large merchants pay lower mdr while smaller merchants 
pay higher the risk that capped mdr could far from the optimal one 
leading reduction the supply merchant acquiring services for instance 
capped mdr could make some segments the market not attractive all for 
incumbent acquirers and this may play against the expansion electronic 
payments brazil capping prices might have also some unintended consequences 
for instance issuers can increase credit card fees interest rates cope with 
lower mdr reducing the benefit for consumers 
importantly hard argue that there excess pricing the industry hence the 
need impose caps prices indeed mdr brazil lower than most places 
latin america the average blended mdr credit debit brazil below the 
range the region credit card mdr brazil very close the 
level the and course the significantly more developed and 
competitive banking and acquiring market than brazil 
finally capping mdr probably not strategic importance for the government 
the impact consumer demand and gdp would minimal estimate 
that reducing mdr pretty punchy number and assuming merchants pass 
through the savings consumers big course this could result consumer 
savings just billion only personal consumption hardly game 
changer given the tiny size the possible benefit consumers and the risk that 
merchants may not even transfer the savings think unlikely that the 
regulator will undertake the complexity setting price caps this industry now 
debate competition 
some market participants are unconvinced that pagseguro can continue deliver 
outsized growth and margins they argue that pags success and visibility from ipo 
has alerted competition about the attractive growth opportunity and high margins 
available the micro merchant segment and given the low barriers entry and the 
incumbents technological prowess and deep pockets just matter time before 
they launch competitive offers addition smaller payment players such stone and 
mercadopago will attracted pags core space some argue 
disagree with the skeptics there will competition doubt but see the 
following factors alleviating the pressure market share and margins 
the penetration cards brazil still very low plastics represent only 
consumption acceptance and usage still have significant runway there plenty 
room accommodate existing and new acquirers without major disruptions 
pricing taking market share away from cash still the predominant means 
payment brazil offers much larger business opportunity think 
don expect the large incumbents make aggressive move downstream 
their business model very different and importantly extremely profitable and 
sustainable their acquiring platforms are based massive economies scale low 
acquisition costs and the corporate banking relationship that their controllers have 
spend per active merchant was last year the same figure pagseguro 
was evidently very different businesses for the large incumbents key 
success prevent the small acquirers from moving upmarket over the long 
term and given the scale advantages that cielo and rede have see them 
long term winners the big volume business all said see the large and small 
merchant acquirers complementary rather than odds with each other 
also note that for the most part the efforts that the large banks have made 
penetrate the bottom the pyramid have failed taii fininvest finasa given 
the lessons the past one has wonder posing tiny entrepreneurs 
something the banks are likely and well different dna think 
competitor threatening their acquiring subsidiaries perhaps also 
enabler helping them expand card acceptance brazil indeed while pagseguro 
competes with cielo and rede the same time successfully expanding card 
acceptance among small merchants whom the card issuers might not otherwise 
have reached and therein lies conflict interest between cielo controlling and 
minority investors argued before 
lastly true that there are relatively low barriers entry however for 
platform businesses like pagseguro first market and network benefits 
provide competitive advantage look back years evident that key 
criteria online success first mover with best class products services 
market with large opportunity think pags fits the mold 
pagseguro relatively small size and differentiated business 
model and target market should continue drive strong top 
line growth
