economic and social consequences alike

investment case 
mobile phone network operators can play important 
role providing economic and social benefits 
developing countries one the most important ways 
which this being achieved through mobile money 
services over the last five years the number the these 
services has increased over success not 
guaranteed but replication safaricom pesa business 
model across more developing countries could 
important driver growth and returns for mos 
mobile money helping increase financial inclusion 
the basic model mobile money allow individuals 
without formal bank account transfer money electronically 
another person this vitally important regions where 
mobile phone penetration far exceeds financial inclusion such 
sub saharan africa customers can register 
for the service authorised agent individual small store 
retailer depositing cash with agent the customer 
receives electronic money which can then withdrawn 
later date transferred another subscriber via their mobile 
phone the main use mobile money for person person 
transfers however other key uses mobile money 
include paying for bills utilities goods directly with merchants 
paying wages salaries and savings 
there are also social benefits tanzania for example the 
cost travel prevents many people from getting medical care 
however non governmental organisation using mobile 
money help patients pay for transport kenya the mobile 
money service enabling microfinance initiative disburse 
loans small holder farmers quicker cheaper and more 
accurate way than before 
safaricom the global market leader mobile money

which owned safaricom and was established 
over the last years more than people have subscribed 
pesa and now around kenya gdp

base and revenues has been driven ease use the large 
network subscribers and more services coming under the

operate other providers have had less success nigeria for 
example two years after the central bank nigeria launched

also succeed this area there evidence successful

were safaricom customers however another active 
accounts were identified during gsma survey the mobile 
money market june with the majority these 
eastern africa globally the number active accounts

particularly explicit targeting revenues for mobile 
financial services compared

money succeed high literacy high mobile phone 
penetration low financial inclusion and regulatory 
environment that doesn seek regulate mobile money like 
bank have looked the developing markets which the 
operators listed above are already present and that meet the 
necessary criteria outline assuming similar penetration 
that achieved safaricom kenya march 
the mobile money market could worth over this 
india key representing the estimated value low 
financial penetration makes attractive country for mobile 
money services but there are several challenges overcome 
namely market fragmentation tough regulatory environment 
lack infrastructure rural areas and growing penetration

necessary for all users mobile money able read 
since they can ask friends family agents assist 
however for widespread adoption possible there 
needs generally high level literacy 
low financial inclusion would not expect mobile 
money gain significant traction countries where most 
one the main reasons for this lack success may the 
fact that the mobile money nigeria run the central bank

india particularly interesting country for mobile money 
services our analysis exhibit shows that india 
represents the revenue potential that have 
identified view mobile money india having attractive 
prospects but also certain challenges 
the low penetration traditional banking makes india 
attractive country for mobile money established 
some rough estimates suggest only the indian 
population has bank accounts and there are large number 
accounts which belong single individuals which means 
actual banking access may even lower indeed according 
the world bank only the over india 
had access formal bank account there are many reasons 
for low banking penetration for example 
skewed income distribution with large population having 
low income and savings 
low literacy levels specifically rural areas 
low interest commercial banks opening branches 
rural areas 
costly access high minimum balance requirements 
open bank accounts 
lack suitable infrastructure rural areas

but execution will not without challenges the 
characteristics the indian market should make possible for 
mobile money established however see the 
following challenges 
airtel and vodafone both have taken the lead offering 
mobile money services customers they have both 
collaborated with commercial banks offer banking services 
customers 
the indian mobile market quite fragmented with 
market leader airtel having just revenue share 
followed vodafone with this does limit own 
network advantage such safaricom has kenya 
addition may mean that neutral payment gateway 
needed rather than each mobile operator developing its 
own payment gateway while also keeping mind 
payment networks operated traditional banks may 
make sense integrate with existing payment networks 
though may lead increase effective transaction 
costs 
airtel money was launched partnership with 
axis bank the services are available many cities and 
states now and both plan use axis bank branch and atm 
network well airtel outlets quite extensively 
customers can make variety transactions such deposit 
and withdraw money send money airtel and non airtel 
customers and bank accounts pay bills purchase tickets 
and shop online physical payments mobile shops restaurants 
caf stationery shops retail shops etc recharge airtel 
services online and even earn interest deposits 
higher regulatory oversight kyc know your client 
regulations are quite strict which means customers have 
visit either the bank branch airtel vodafone stores 
person sign the intended transactions exceed 
certain amount this can hindrance increasing 
penetration unbanked areas especially rural india 
where the nearest bank mobile store may far away 
similar process required open mobile money accounts 
people want hold bigger balances for example the 
rbi central bank also require operators have 
preapproval offer services and also has prevented cash 
from being withdrawn from mobile money account 
unless operators have banks partners 
focus rural areas still some time away 
operators are currently focusing bigger cities which 
are already well banked and have easy access banking 
services the motivation here get the low hanging 
fruit first this will also help push the services down the 
chain many migrant workers may use the services 
send money back home rural areas which then can 
aware and avail themselves the services 
airtel also offering heavy promotions popularize airtel 
money with discounts bill payments and recharges done 
through airtel money also collaborating with merchants 
encourage them promote use airtel money 
vodafone has launched mobile money under the pesa 
brand and currently available states out has 
partnered with icici bank seems bit behind airtel 
india still not widely available but expanding 
vodafone still launch services all major cities though its 
plan cover the whole india within months after 
initial launch 
the services currently offered are money deposits and 
withdrawals sending money vodafone and non vodafone 
customers and bank accounts bill payments payment for 
vodafone services

mobile money competes with mobile banking services 
traditional banks each large commercial bank either 
already has mobile banking platform working one 
launch soon customers can already make mobile 
payments through directly accessing their own bank 
accounts may limit customers inclination sign and 
through the hassle for additional payment option 
that said believe mobile money targeting the
