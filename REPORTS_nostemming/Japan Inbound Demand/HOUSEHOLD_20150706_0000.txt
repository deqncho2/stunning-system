method estimating the size inbound market

inbound market are limited the japan national tourism organization jnto estimates that tourists japan 
spent almost based the results its quarterly consumption trend survey for foreigners 
visiting japan now also calculate the amount foreign tourist spending various products and service 
categories likewise leveraging the data this jnto survey particular use the quarterly replies this 
survey tabulate the purchasing ratio and average spending within each product category 
then multiply these against the actual number tourists all nationalities and main asian countries 
calculate the market size our calculation total inbound consumption here comes versus 
the jnto cumulative estimate attribute this difference the jnto adding package 
tour participation fees for domestic revenues adjusted spending item whereas our models not include 
this this adjustment calculates around per person and when multiplied with the number 
foreign tourists amounts around increase 
exhibit gives breakdown inbound consumption estimate that foreign tourists spent roughly 
shopping all inbound consumption breaking the data down further the most 
purchased products were clothes other than japanese style clothing bags and apparel such shoes 
while cosmetics and toiletries perfumes ranked 
points note 
the jnto survey data had previously included cosmetics within relatively broad category cosmetics 
pharmaceuticals and toiletries but from has started tabulating the data splitting into two categories 
cosmetics perfumes and pharmaceuticals health goods toiletries which has made easier extrapolate 
the size demand addition the jnto survey classification toiletries refers solely everyday items 
such disposable diapers cleaners etc and products the cosmetics market that are often called 
toiletries such personal cosmetics make shampoo products etc are included under 
cosmetics perfumes the survey now 
our calculations here focus just individual spending data foreign tourists and not include 
purchasing parallel exporters accordingly actual sales foreigners are likely even higher than our

individual cosmetics firms have calculated the size their inbound driven sales which began increasing sharply 
most these however have operated under the assumption that the previously tiny inbound demand 
became significant factor after the duty free categories were expanded october which had been our 
sense well however indeed inbound demand was already inbound demand sales were 
hardly tiny for the major cosmetics manufacturers based estimation that inbound demand represented the industry believe inbound demand sales likely represented domestic sales several 
billion yen each firms including shiseido kao kanebo kose and fancl with the percentage naturally 
varying between firms what the firms estimated the size inbound demand then quite likely 
the increase from when the market grew further estimate shiseido inbound 
demand sales retail basis and kose about kose gives the number 
shipment basis kao also states that had shipment basis from inbound demand but does not 
break down that number between sundries and cosmetics unclear how that compares our rough image 
the breakdown cosmetics and other personal household products 
the brands that inbound travelers purchase are not limited japanese brands but the size that market 
completely unknown press releases issued the japan department stores association imply that 
number brands japanese origin which are now under foreign ownership such and shu uemura are 
also popular

department store channel mix surprisingly low 
the japan department stores association discloses monthly data the value tax free purchases tourists 
japan since cosmetics and foods were among the categories added tax free october the data 
release began that time break down numbers into the value tax free purchases traditional categories 
and the value tax free purchases the new categories the october data gave the ratio food cosmetics

cosmetics the average chinese visitor spends nearly while true that the average 
purchase value itself raised chinese purchases purchase rate and per person spend both double that 
the average well the highest absolute number visitors all contribute chinese representing far and 
away the largest percentage the inbound demand market for cosmetics the reason why chinese represent 
high percentage cosmetics purchasers appears that they are strongly attracted local souvenirs and 
enjoy cosmetics distinctive and relatively inexpensive for souvenirs give away for example face masks 
and cleansing foams find particularly high demand this market the reasons why these particular products are 
popular are not known but possible reasons are that these products may have relatively lower brand loyalty 
that basic skincare cosmetics such lotions and creams people feel comfortable about getting them 
souvenirs that cleansers may have unique characteristics functionality uniquely japan thick foaminess 
new functionalities such enzymatic cleansing powders also differences sales price between japan 
domestically and the overseas locale likely factor boosting cosmetics purchases visitors japan

inbound demand earnings impact 
amounts inbound demand sales forecasts revised for our covered cosmetics companies 
have raised our forecasts for inbound demand for kose and shiseido based our latest market simulations 
exhibit key factors the revisions are inbound demand sales generated were probably about 
higher than estimated the two firms fed that through estimate both firms about 
retail basis and over shipment value basis and put their growth inbound demand sales 
line with the growth the inbound demand market forecasting roughly yoy gain about 
gain and almost gain however forecast the market for chinese travelers alone 
will roughly double assume growth inbound demand sales for the two firms will exceed that 
the overall market 
further the reasons why think actual sales were about greater are follows certain 
cosmetics brands were already being purchased foreigners department stores some the popular brands 
that time were shiseido albion fancl and shu uemura the order mentioning varies somewhat 
month month which makes think that this the order highest lowest for the size inbound demand 
assume that foreigners purchased about cosmetics department stores think not 
unreasonable think that inbound demand for these brands was already size between several hundred 
million yen each that year similarly based our calculations think that purchases drug stores 
were also booming believe they overlooked about that point

additional considerations for inbound demand 
higher percentage contribution profits sales rises assume greater level revenue 
growth impact flowing through the profit line gross margin the cosmetics industry high 
structurally easy for higher revenues translate fairly directly higher profits however greater 
revenue from inbound demand likely boost profits rate higher than normal profit margin 
concentrated the mid and high priced products there are three primary reasons for this once customer 
adopts brand preference that demand persists fairly strongly even the corporation does not aggressively 
invest advertising fixed ratios are declining more makeover counters become operational and skin 
care products which have relatively higher gross margin tend popular with overseas visitors 
exhibit inbound demand sales growth likely boost earnings growth via higher than normal ratios

gaining the cooperation the distribution chain and securing shelf space important 
capturing both inbound and domestic demand all the drug store chains clearly line products hoping 
capture inbound demand but the products for inbound demand that command the good spaces are those 
which ultimately are also favored domestic consumers and they are linked increases domestic demand 
products that sell domestically become favored foreigners through word mouth and likely that 
products given greater store exposure capture that inbound demand also capture more domestic demand 
virtuous cycle being able reliably secure shelf space stores likely remain crucial 
parallel exporters apart from purchases full fledged tourists there are likely purchases parallel 
exporters not captured this estimation how great this remains unknown and likely have limited 
impact the cosmetics market this point but exporters appear active the daily toiletries market
