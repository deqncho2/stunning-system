quick comment our view that the inbound demand theme and will 
continue important medium long term growth driver 
unchanged since kao earnings briefing this past wed feb market 
sentiment the inbound market outlook appears have turned even 
more negative that had been but the comments from kao 
management were mix positive and negative tone and feel 
that the market understanding somewhat skewed have 
organized the key information below 
comments kao ceo the ceo explanations covered three parts but 
think that one those parts alone has taken over the limelight 
amid changing conditions kao taking sober view inbound growth 
prospects while expects foreign visitor numbers again increase this year 
also sees potential for changes the way visitors spend repeat visitors not 
buying per person spend declining etc hearing from retailers however 
that inbound purchasers are broadening their sights cover wider range 
brands products 
kao estimates that the total cosmetics toiletries market growth grew 
breaking down domestic demand inbound and 
for inbound demand for does not expect market growth 
differ much and looks for 
kao estimates that inbound sales across the kao group were around 
have subsequently learned from the company that its 
plans assume inbound sales fall short 
hence the nuance the ceo comments was not entirely negative 
our impression was that amid much uncertainty the market environment 
the ceo offered qualitative comments cautioning against overblown 
expectations while also offering quantitative projections that inbound demand 
likely continue contributing market growth extent the following 
figures can calculated based the quantitative comments 
inbound market scale kao had been estimating the inbound market

domestic cosmetics toiletries stood around retail sales basis 
which puts the total market around blending these figures 
and kao comments and can infer that the total market scale was 
inbound sales just under domestic demand the 
overall market grows its scale will rise kao 
assumptions put the inbound market roughly 
domestic consumption flat and around 
domestic consumption grows even the original outlook were 
market growth flat domestic consumption would put inbound 
market growth with domestic consumption growth only 
inbound sales growth becomes flat yoy for the first time 
the kao group inbound sales outlook does not seem downbeat either 
modeled roughly growth not think strange for cosmetics 
companies model their plans conservative inbound sales assumptions 
very possibly assuming inbound scale will flat yoy 
our view believe the cosmetics and toiletries market inbound scale 
correcting but rise visitors japan especially chinese from will 
drive market growth while factors like the weak chinese yuan certainly could 
depress average spending per person recent oct dec data shows signs 
that yet still project rise cosmetics buyers more visitors come 
japan will continue drive inbound market growth our transportation 
analyst takuya osaka forecasts the number chinese tourists japan will 
grow yoy for details please see our report below 
postscript kose our view that kose domestic sales trends january 
were largely unchanged from oct dec yoy uptrend this includes growth 
actual domestic demand not just inbound believe segments and brands 
across the board show signs slowing and see particular need for 
concern about kose earnings
