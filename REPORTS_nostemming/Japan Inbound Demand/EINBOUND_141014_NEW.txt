inbound consumption may partly explain the discrepancy

retail long term beneficiaries are don quijote bic camera 
given station proximity 
inbound tourism demand presence within the 
retail industry finally growing some cases 
now see potential for inbound related demand 
generate individual store demand 
key beneficiaries are firms that are near train 
stations late night operations deep 
product lineup and handle made japan 
brands our recommended plays here are don 
quijote and bic camera 
the upside catalyst for the stocks confirmation 
that gross margins are rising due inbound 
consumption positive results during the china 
national day holidays would also have 
implications for the upcoming chinese new year 
current conditions 
inbound tourist consumption starting have unignorable 
impact the retail industry retailers since autumn 
had started become aware this spending foreign 
tourists but the amount sales had been miniscule 
incidentally however department stores also saw luxury sales 
slump smaller magnitude than expected after the april 
consumption tax hike such retail management teams 
have finally started truly grasp this inbound demand fact 
more than few the fashion industry have estimated that 
department store luxury good sales would have declined after 
the tax hike not for inbound tourist spending are also 
currently seeing stronger than expected sales following the 
start new duty free system japan from october 
which also appears energizing retailers terms 
promotions and marketing 
looking worldwide inbound tourism trends see that 
galeries lafayette department store paris has inbound 
ratio while this probably par for the course paris 
destination for million foreign visitors per year the 
consensus among industry companies and the stock market 
that japan with its deep domestic consumption base should 
have inbound ratio its best only the single digits but 
the case don quijote and bic camera which have 
extensive product lineups and stores that are close train 
stations have started see repeated instances 
inbound ratios certain individual stores 
what retailers need benefit from inbound demand 
stores close train stations stores along tourist routes that 
make possible sell promote through public transport 
late night operations chinese travelers often known for 
sightseeing during day then shopping after dinner 
extensive product lineups providing major benefits from 
recently expanded duty free system stores expanding 
made japan brands from these criteria recommend 
don quijote and bic camera 
both companies have inbound ratios the most recent 
years months which higher than the 
department stores since the duty free system was recently 
expanded sales cameras and watches well basic 
use home cosmetics for female japanese workers has 
increased don quijote ginza shinjuku shibuya 
roppongi namba osaka and nakasu fukuoka stores

increased quickly bic camera exhibit shows those 
companies that are popular with foreign tourists one feature 
that commerce sites like amazon japan are essentially 
off radar inbound companies chinese tourists whether offline 
online are keen shorten the time takes

these hotels prior returning home likewise royal

stock price implications 
our stock selection confined individual companies rather 
than the broader sector given that inbound demand will benefit 
certain urban geared companies inbound driven demand 
even don quijote and bic camera amounts only 
single digits and thus the potential impact 
earnings should not drastic such although view this 
long term and structural theme expect the near term 
share price impact short lived given fundamental 
earnings impact still limited
