the market chief concern that cny depreciation would lower 
spending chinese visitors again did not materialize for 
cosmetics jan mar and with rising visitor numbers and 
ongoing rise the ratio visitors who purchase cosmetics our 
impression that the inbound market for cosmetics continued 
see strong growth overall 
japan 
industryview 
line 
key data summary see 
inbound market for cosmetics was jan mar increasing 
fold the year earlier period and maintaining strong growth spending 
chinese visitors jan mar was the total the 
cosmetics market expanded more than visitor numbers for all 
nationalities for chinese because per person spending continued 
rise modestly yoy for all nationalities for chinese both yen 
terms and the ratio visitors who purchased cosmetics also increased from 
for all nationalities from for chinese 
trends for cosmetics purchasing chinese spending per chinese 
visitor jan mar rose yoy but was down qoq 
converted into yuan this was yoy qoq the market 
biggest concern for jan mar was that per person spending would fall due 
exchange rate volatility and this outcome gives positive impression the 
ratio visitors purchasing cosmetics perfume rose jan mar 
from year earlier and the previous quarter exhibit 
categories that showed declines for per person spending and purchasing 
ratios oct dec data including cameras video cameras watches and 
electrical goods the same patterns were also seen jan mar apart from 
influence appears that changes the products that are fashionable with 
shoppers are also having effect and while cannot apply spending trends 
sweepingly across consumption whole there risk that the cosmetics 
category could also see spending per person and the ratio purchasers turn 
down will continue track closely however these levels have been higher 
than initially assumed spending per chinese visitor about 
purchaser ratio and given the brisk increase visitor numbers 
stick our view that even per person spending and the purchaser ratio turn 
down would not difficult for the inbound cosmetics market maintain 
the scale that assume
