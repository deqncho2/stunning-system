despite deep macro uncertainties our earnings revisions are 
only minor see chances buy into results though 
see risk guidance out beyond any correction 
the stock would offer good entry point for investors 
stock near bear case bad news mostly priced the market increasingly 
worried inbound demand falling due kansai int airport reduced capacity 
typhoon hokkaido earthquake and the weaker chinese stocks cny jat has 
underperformed topix the past months nearing our bear 
case which based the following and entails risks negating tiat 
consolidation impact passenger volumes haneda airport domestic int 
turning down avg duty free spend falling 
consol thus our 
base case 
inbound demand unlikely fall much market fears have revised our 
passenger related inbound assumptions see reports linked below revise 
down inbound demand overall from yoy for nationality 
cut assumptions mainly chinese tourists but also for korea hong kong 
taiwan but overall digit growth still looks possible with inbound demand from 
asia europe still strong cut haneda int passenger demand only 
for from for domestic lower from 
factoring ana route cancellations out haneda plus potentially 
weaker demand haneda shin chitose flights hokkaido quake yet our 
overall earnings revisions are only minor also raise avg passenger spend 
for based the growth duty free stores and thus maintain 
our 
focus points monthly data view the moj monthly port data more 
important than the jnto data forecasting earnings results 
forecast consol yoy though line with ifis consensus 
think market expectations which are probably down our bear 
case will pick back airline negotiations haneda int flight slots while 
these are effectively neutral for our jat earnings forecasts haneda itself gaining 
visibility can positive for jat shares earnings ifis more 
optimistic than our forecast guidance for
