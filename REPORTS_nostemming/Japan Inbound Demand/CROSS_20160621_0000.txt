stocks that have corrected near 
japan inbound shopping consumption hit estimate 
inbound shopping consumption japan forecast growth 
and demand growth 
should stall part because per shopper spend particularly for highpriced items favored chinese expected fall due the strong yen the 
chinese shopping spree winds down the sense that the growth period for 
inbound consumption over has spread the equities market but reiterate 
our outlook for structural medium term market growth driven further 
increases numbers tourists japan rising about annually also 
think the rate decline per shopper spending inbound shopping which has 
been trending down will probably pass the worst 
growth inbound shopping market driven airport dfs tfs business 
contrast the korean market where inbound shopping growth has been mainly 
driven downtown duty free shopping dfs business think the main 
catalysts for expansion the japanese inbound shopping market are airport dfs 
and tfs tax free shopping expect duty free market account for 
all inbound shopping from addition the rise 
inbound tourists expect the decline per shopper spend abate and the 
ratio purchases using duty tax exemption processes increase even our 
bear case where assume per shopper spend decline and 
another still see total inbound shopping demand reaching 
downtown dfs however have faced difficult start well 
below stock market expectations and company plans due lack awareness

dfs market definitions duty free shopping and tax free shopping the duty free market made two parts 
duty free shopping dfs shopping which exempt from consumption tax customs duty liquor tax and tobacco tax 
and tax free shopping tfs shopping which only consumption tax exempt there are also two types dfs airport 
dfs and downtown dfs bear mind these distinctions which can ambiguous japanese this report when talk 
about the duty free market unless otherwise specified mean the dfs and tfs markets combined 
exhibit three classifications for duty free market there are major differences between duty free shopping dfs and tax free 
shopping tfs duty free shopping comprises airport dfs and downtown dfs 
source jta morgan stanley research 
duty free market account for only total inbound shopping demand now but 
should grow estimate sales the duty free market amounted 
only about total inbound shopping demand but expect 
growth total inbound demand yoy and 
estimating the scale the duty free market impossible 
provide detailed bottom estimates not enough data exists but can make some 
broad assessments scale based the aforementioned japan tourism agency 
survey the use duty free procedures which was initiated january these 
data show constant increase until recently and expect the percentages will 
continue rise gradually the rising proportion inbound demand accounted for 
duty free shopping likely add momentum the duty free market expect 
growth accelerate and exceed the pace growth overall inbound shopping 
demand however the past there have only been airport dfs and the newer tfs and 
most inbound shopping demand was absorbed the tfs system estimate market 
share for airport dfs was only compared for tfs the new downtown dfs 
operations generated sales only about contributing only janmar anticipate growth downtown dfs but comparatively slow rate 
with market scale about equivalent about total inbound 
demand the duty free market noted later downtown dfs business 
japan will probably benefit from expanding inbound demand but unlike korea the 
business not free from competition from other formats fact think the key for 
downtown dfs differentiate from tfs accordingly could see either upside 
downside downtown dfs sales the market depending future developments

key points for growth japan downtown dfs 
while expect continued growth the duty free market sales for downtown that 
have opened have started off much more slowly than market expectations 
partly because mere lack shopper awareness but also because the market 
conditions noted earlier such see three key factors that can dictate the future 
pace downtown dfs sales growth improving relative appeal order gain share 
away from channels the time effort the buying process the assortment 
products and store locations strategic efforts attract group tourists efforts 
tap into demand for japanese travelers 
gaining inbound shopping market share differentiating from tfs expect 
the duty free market continue expand both terms tfs and dfs but over the 
medium long term also see potential for both productively exist the 
overall pie the market expands conversely for wallet share splintered 
other words tfs and downtown dfs some point could battling for market share 
categories where the two have identical products this point however the dfs 
market not real threat the tfs market one apparent reason that downtown 
dfs have yet adequately market promote themselves beyond this however also 
note that downtown dfs which specialize with tourists could disadvantage 
versus retailers which include tfs which have enormous popularity trust among the 
japanese addition downtown dfs can only open stores limited urban locations 
and thus demand for other inbound shopping structurally more beneficial tfs 
into details down below but downtown dfs this point probably appeal either 
people who already know what buy and want shop quickly given number 
vendors that are the market opportunists who are constantly checking 
pricing differences across various countries downtown dfs will probably need 
leverage certain benefits that couldn had without them order see faster 
growth going forward south korea downtown dfs offer better value proposition 
than tfs thanks its strong merchandising power cheaper pricing and aggressive 
marketing activities such additional discounts for repeat customers and events for 
foreign tourist casting popular pop music stars etc addition dfs specialize 
products that are exempt from other taxes beside the consumption tax and could take 
advantage liquor cigarettes that sense 
shopping experience inbound consumption demand said shifting 
from exclusive focus goods shopping spending leisure activities but 
even when considering goods shopping would not odd regard shopping 
experience savor with tourists preferring shop where japanese people 
shop they can claim the same tax exemptions there not have detailed 
data but get sense that this happening observing the cosmetics counters 
the ginza mitsukoshi store the same brands are available the downtown dfs 
within the department store and the dfs counter far less crowded but the 
counters the ordinary cosmetics floor which see buzzing with tourists even 
laox which has captured lot demand from chinese tourists appears have 
seen some waning its appeal chinese visitors the last year exhibit 
even year ago were already hearing that chinese tourists bused out 
laox tour groups were preferring spend their time japan personal 
shopping trips stores like bic camera and matsumoto kiyoshi this because big 
box electronics retailers and drug stores offer broader selection goods and 
tourists have started notice that store prices laox are more expensive than 
places like bic camera also seems that the range merchandise that foreign 
shoppers want buy broadening gradually but this has been spurred the 
spread shopping demand tfs that have wide selections and consistently 
fresh stock are also now hearing from cosmetic companies that purchasing 
patterns among tourist visitors are changing and that where they used come 
with predetermined purchase mind and buy only that item they are now 
getting counseling from sales staff and deciding what buy after comparing 
items the drug store shelf

purchasing downtown dfs japanese travelers prior departure estimate that 
japanese people spend around year airport dfs even without this amount 
changing much the share apportioned airport dfs and downtown dfs might shift 
downtown dfs korea spending korean travelers leaving the country accounts for 
certain amount sales largely done through online purchase and there are media 
reports that sales the mitsukoshi ginza dfs were expected come from 
japanese though this proved far wide the mark with few japanese people aware 
the downtown dfs existence however since already possible complete 
purchasing procedures the airport dfs website prior departure and pick the

dfs tfs market 
repeat expect airport dfs and tfs drive growth japan inbound consumption spending list here some 
companies that benefit from the market expansion 
expect jat benefit the most the expansion airport dfs market this due high share existing 
airport dfs market relationships with brand manufacturers procurement capabilities etc and expectations for strong 
growth tourists the key haneda airport 
the key words identifying potential beneficiaries from growth the tfs market are ocation while expect 
nationwide growth tfs stores think the trend will toward bolstering the business regional areas outside the 
major cities and daily products such cosmetics perfumes pharmaceuticals and confectionary 
currently cannot take bullish stance the downtown dfs market but airport companies are also likely 
prime beneficiaries while they face some cannibalization business from existing airport dfs forecast expansion 
new business opportunities operators and consignment fee income without direct involvement running stores 
transferring duty free products airport premises although the impact earnings will vary think retailers and real 
estate firms which lease sales space and foreign dfs operators with overseas experience will the beneficiaries

who will benefit from tfs market growth key words are location regional 
store expansion and daily products 
tfs store count still growing but what most notable how the expansion 
pace picking the non metropolitan urban areas that were originally not the 
key destinations for inbound visitors given the limited number the department 
stores and large scale retailers nationwide believe the inbound shopping 
demand that arise the suburban and rural areas will captured the tfs 
channel going forward 
shown exhibit tfs sales stores other than department stores have 
grown rapidly the last two years growing demand for electronics cosmetics and 
other daily use items likely has drove this trend while there are signs demand

focus differences japanese korean duty free markets 
surprisingly more differences than similarities 
how japan and korea duty free markets differ comparing the japanese and korean duty free markets 
surprisingly find more differences than similarities although key growth engine same for both rising chinese tourists 
spending the two markets have very different development past years yielding different structures the market more 
importantly these differences result different competencies the key players and their growth outlook therefore 
think misleading assume that japan will follow korea main differences are follows 
history the duty free markets korea downtown duty free stores have rapidly grown cagr over 
rising foreign spending cagr during the period while tax free stores tfs have not actively developed due 
inferior pricing addition strong merchandising power dfs are exempted from both vat and import duty whereas tfs 
are only exempted from vat and cumbersome process japan tfs has similarly lengthy history korea but 
development downtown dfs getting underway only just 
barriers entry for downtown dfs think korea has higher barriers entry korea stems from the government 
bid based licensing system japan requires such licenses issued but instead only approval from the tax authorities 
bonded warehouse 
the types players the duty free markets big conglomerates dominate korea and are also prevalent overseas 
markets japan meanwhile seeing new entry from retail and korean dfs companies addition airport companies the 
primary type far 
location korea downtown dfs are concentrated seoul whereas japan are spread out geography land space and 
number international airports are two factors involved here 
positioning airport dfs japan airport dfs business drives inbound consumption and many cases stores are 
directly managed the airport operators themselves the case directly managed stores understand margins are 
around contrast korea the leasing burden for airport dfs stores high making them less appealing for 
operators and their share the total dfs market shrinking 
contributions from outbound demand duty free stores japan estimate that annual purchases japanese 
outbound travelers airpot dfs stores have trended around which not think will change meaningfully 
the near term the contrary korea total dfs sales and airport and downtown dfs 
respectively were derived from korean outbound tourists 
overseas strategies korean companies are aggressively expanding overseas business understand japanese 
companies are still formulating strategies this area 
based the above our views the outlook the two markets are follows japan expect airport dfs and tfs 
channels remain the main beneficiaries inbound shopping demand growth meanwhile korea the government 
tries promote competition downtown dfs market through issuing more licenses think there will difficulty for 
key players because growing competition

korea the korea customs service kcs charge dfs related issues including 
license issuance licenses are currently issued the government decision and granted 
through bidding process since last year the kcs has been aggressive inviting more 
competitors downtown dfs business hence the number licenses seoul would

competitive landscape 
types duty free players korea mainly led conglomerates while japan led 
airport companies but also seeing many new entrants retailers korean dfs 
operators etc 
interestingly downtown duty free sites were originally developed hotel operators 
korea downtown dfs targeting foreign tourists the government granted licenses 
the hotel operators high end hotels were mostly run large conglomerates such 
lotte group samsung group group and shinsegae group thus these 
conglomerates have been involved dfs business thanks large merchandising scale 
and strong financial support these companies were able enter airport duty free sites 
which bring high rent burden lotte and samsung group shilla brand for hotel and 
dfs particular have dominated the downtown dfs market which makes them global 
players the duty free industry globally lotte ranked top three and shilla top 
seven based revenue 
based strong merchandising power think major dfs players have differentiated 
themselves three aspects 
pricing the industry has been well consolidated two players lotte and shilla 
they enjoy strong bargaining power with brands and also possess enough room for 
promotion thus overall price levels korean dfs are lower than tfs 
comfortable also the companies operate membership programs with 
additional discount offerings for customer loyalty and traffic attraction 
large marketing budget for travel agencies korean dfs players aggressively capture 
the opportunity from rising chinese tourist traffic allying with travel agencies they 
have financially supported travel agencies increase inbound traffic paying them 
commissions based tourist spending based the kcs release total commission 
expenses travel agencies reached accounting for around 
downtown dfs revenue think this marketing burden and already built relationship 
with travel agencies set another barrier new entrants 
overseas expansion leveraging merchandising power and their know how dfs 
business especially dealing with chinese travelers korean dfs players have pursued 
overseas expansion recently main target markets are asia and japan which are

where the competition 
korea competition fierce within the dfs market amongst the operators since the 
korean government focuses issuing more licenses for downtown dfs think 
competition should reach peak early with new store openings the tfs channel 
also expected grow but the competition between dfs and tfs should limited 
thanks the easing regulations that making tax refunds more convenient think 
tfs will grow rapidly the near term however long dfs offers better value 
proposition tfs should not big challenge 
japan tfs already established the main channel for inbound demand for 
downtown dfs also matter differentiating themselves from tfs attract 
customer traffic 
location downtown dfs korea concentrated seoul japan more 
spread out differences geography land space airports open foreign

according korea tourism organization kto survey foreign tourists visited 
seoul the past five years this trend has not changed with roughly inbound 
tourists visiting seoul recently jeju island has become another popular destination 
especially for chinese partially due its scenic beauty and free visa policy but still 
far below seoul hence downtown dfs has become well

contribution from outbound demand dfs business 
japan estimate that annual purchases japanese shoppers airport dfs stores 
have trended around about airport dfs sales for 
downtown dfs stores think that japanese shoppers are hardly aware them 
present unless the current situation changes significantly estimate the outbound 
contribution sales dfs channels only only about 
korea outbound sales accounted for total dfs sales break 
down further the ratios the airport and downtown dfs were and 
respectively our estimates the key incentives for korean outbound travelers make 
purchases departures include cheaper pricing and convenience particular 
online dfs downtown dfs stores has substantially upgraded shopping 
convenience considering the rapidly growing chinese contribution outbound mix 
should steadily decline but think absolute sales will grow moderately supported 
rising outbound traffic cagr over and online shopping penetration 
international strategies 
japan top firms account for total market share and local players have 
strong presence currently seeking opportunities abroad 
korea searching for new opportunities through aggressive international expansion 
understanding dfs market trends korea 
the back rising inbound traffic from china korea duty free market has enjoyed 
cagr the past five years cagr over excluding heavily hit 
mers outbreak during the period foreigners contribution has jumped from 
currently and see chinese tourists major contributor over 
foreign spending based our estimates this trend inbound traffic from china could 
explained two factors overall overseas travel demand china and korea 
destination share considering structural move chinese outbound demand still only 
total population traveling overseas and rising destination share 
neighborhood countries japan korea and asian countries the expense 
macau expect chinese inbound traffic korea increase cagr the 
coming three years adjusting for mers impact underlying trend cagr 
expected reaching given the easy comparison base from affected 
mers and operating space expansion seoul downtown stores think the dutyfree market size should see good recovery but after that expect market 
growth would slow with falling spending per person and stabilizing traffic growth

before chinese travelers became huge share the mix total inbound traffic 
japanese tourists represented major share with the total until 
given geographic proximity and cultural similarity however jpy weakening against krw 
has severely affected inbound tourism cutting inbound traffic almost half 
accordingly the japanese contribution has dwindled given the rising 
chinese mix expect this decline further but absolute traffic could 
start recovering from with jpy appreciation line with the traffic trend japanese 
spending korean dfs has shrunk recent years our calculation japanese dfs 
spending was only hotel shilla duty free sales far lower than chinese 
share estimated and its previous contribution over before thus traffic

key and basic information the korean duty free market 
structure the duty free market while downtown dfs have taken the lion share 
tourist spending tfs have remained relatively small tax free market 
size was downtown dfs with the number tax free designated 
stores having increased cagr over reaching stores recently regulations changed become more favorable for these tfs following 
the japanese tfs model originally tourists had get tax refunds the port 
departure when the product cost was more than but from january 
visitors may receive tax refunds immediately the store purchases below 
and below cumulative amount per person this 
regulatory change should accelerate tax free market growth improving convenience 
far this change has not had much impact dfs sales dfs still offers more 
attractive pricing than tfs 
mentioned earlier downtown dfs have became popular shopping places for foreign 
tourists thanks locations near tourist attractions strong value proposition 
the back merchandising power and tax exemptions dfs players rapid response 
merchandising selection and favorable shopping environment including language 
service also think tight relationships with tour agents have helped bring group 
tourist traffic the sites instead sales commission the korean government 
aggressively increasing downtown dfs think the market size should grow faster 
take further share foreign spending the coming two years 
licensing korea the korea customs service kcs charge dfs related 
issues including license issuance licenses are currently issued the government 
decision and granted through bidding process currently the license period five 
years but the government plans increase this years for stable business 
environment submitting proposal for regulatory change parliamentary approval 
needed minimum requirements are satisfied the existing license will easily roll over 
also the license fee will increase from revenue depending 
store revenue incrementally from for below from 
for above 
before the kcs had focused increasing sme company participation duty free 
business and there were new licenses available for large companies which made 
good entry barrier for existing players however since last year the kcs has been 
aggressive inviting more competitors downtown dfs business issuing three new 
licenses two for large one for sme and four more three for large and 
one for sme for seoul separately one more sme license issued busan and 
gangwon province respectively hence the number licenses seoul should increase 
dramatically from intensifying the competition result 
expect market share will shift rapidly especially for hotel lotte which has 
close one site having lost license the previous bidding and faces severe 
competition with shinsegae located very close lotte main site 
key issues korea dfs industry 
category shift 
compared dfs developed markets korea dfs has higher ratio high end 
watches jewelry and luxury brands the sales mix thanks attractive pricing 
compared general retailers department stores many koreans take the chance 
buy luxury brands dfs when they travel abroad the number outbound 
departures koreans was equivalent the total population and 
think downtown dfs offer favorable environment for foreign tourists for luxury 
shopping convenient locations wide selection brand offerings and attractive 
pricing watch and jewelry category sales especially have been led chinese travelers 
however these days cosmetics has been emerging main category reaching 
total mix since anti graft campaigns china and more chinese travel europe where 
these luxury products have cheaper prices should encourage chinese buy more local 
made korea products korea think the shift toward cosmetics with rising 
popularity korean cosmetic brands natural change dfs category local 
brands allow higher merchandising margin think category mix change could lead 
gross margin improvement the long run for dfs operators

person according kto survey the average shopping budget chinese 
tourists was higher than the overall tourist level shilla average 
spending was around estimated per chinese tourist and think 
could decline below owing chinese traveller profile change 
younger and more from lower tier cities category shift from high end luxury brands 
korean cosmetics and accessories and shrinking selling demand the chinese 
government policy direction continuously limits overseas spending strict 
enforcement tax free limit and gray market distribution such 
parallel imports without proper custom reporting would depress shopping 
chinese travelers for selling arbitrage the pricing gap between korea and china 
think these changes would viewed normalization chinese spending more 
driven end demand consumption and consumer shopping pattern changes having 
said that decline spending per person would key challenge dfs operators

downtown dfs crown jewel dfs business not any more 
downtown dfs was uniquely developed korea account for the entire dfs 
market most stores are located the central seoul area near popular tourist 
attractions offering convenient shopping environment well attractive pricing

since the downtown dfs market has consolidated around two players combined 
market share lotte and shilla these players have been able obtain 
enough scale for strong merchandising power and brand sourcing this favorable market 
structure has thus allowed high profitability over opm very high sales 
efficiency main stores lotte and shilla generated revenue per sqm 
more than higher than the industry average sqm addition 
huge merchandising scale lotte ranked global top player and shilla top player 
aggressive promotional activities such discounts vip members and 
gift vouchers purchase and rising commission expenses around group 
tourist purchase travel agencies have been well offset operating leverage effects 
the past smaller players such walkerhill and dong wha not enjoy such 
profitability slightly exceeding break even even with the same business model hence 
think merchandising scale determines the profitability downtown dfs players 
rather than the business model itself

believe scale the critical factor for the value proposition and merchandising quality

should lotte and shilla but until then brutal competition likely overshadow 
the profitability downtown dfs 
airport high rent burden not attracting operators 
airport dfs korea have become less attractive operators mainly due high 
minimum rent the airports ask for other than the jeju site not think any dutyfree operators make money airport sites the moment shilla and lotte used 
generate low single digit opm incheon airport icn under previous contracts but 
new contracts have left even these two big players incurring losses from higher rent 
burden korea duty free operators are selected from rent bidding and airports 
suggest minimum rent rising chinese traffic and strong duty free sales 
performance downtown stores invited more operators for airport bidding which only 
accelerated rent increases weak sales partially due the mers outbreak 
resulted huge losses airport sites and downtown dfs developments affected 
tourist shopping mainly chinese the airport hence duty free operators are more

hotel shilla still industry turmoil 
recently kcs announced bidding for four new licenses for seoul downtown dfs which should keep competition fierce 
into early 
meanwhile shilla biggest competitor hotel lotte has decided cancel its ipo plan due the prosecutor investigation 
alleged slush fund and embezzlement the owner family this investigation should have limited impact current 
business operations but could materially influence the bidding outcome depending the results 
recent dfs sales trends show that cannibalization between the jung site and hdc shilla site yongsan marginal 
even after the yongsan site grand opening mar the jung site has maintained solid sales growth thanks rising 
chinese tourist contributions expect sales growth yoy for downtown dfs for shilla jung and jeju sites 
shilla strategy that now firmly set market share gains should erode its near term margins materially and cut our 
estimates however think this strategy should enhance its market positioning the long run and thus 
our eps changes are much more moderate down for accordingly our new price target 
things getting interesting good and bad 
june kcs announced bidding for new downtown licenses four seoul three 
for large companies one busan and one gangwon province only for smes this 
bidding itself well expected the market line with the government plan disclosed 
april and will eventually intensify competition seoul dfs market especially 
early with new entrant openings given the crowded seoul central area from last 
year bidding think this time the battlefield will change the gangnam area 
however one the strongest candidates hotel lotte jamsil site faces serious 
headwinds the form prosecutor investigation the investigation process has 
just started difficult tell the potential impact the moment the event that 
any illegal issues are found duty free operations the bidding result could become 
favorable shilla with strong competitor losing market share 
exhibit downtown dfs bidding schedule announced 
source korea customs service morgan stanley research 
shilla turning more aggressive market share 
sales its new site yongsan have proved solid without cannibalizing existing sales 
shilla has pursued market share gains also think lotte situation jamsil store 
shutdown from june and going investigation would make shilla more aggressive 
about elevating its market positioning thus raise our sales assumption for jung 
and but dfs margins should depressed because rising 
marketing promotion costs especially opm cut even with nearterm earnings cut think shilla strategy should pay off well once competition 
becomes normalized later combined with the yongsan site expect shilla 
market share seoul dfs increase from

kose overweight 
kose jan mar inbound sales sales foreign visitors japan 
amounted and this point think they have probably settled back 
quarterly level around however think this partly because the 
difference between prices sekkisei skincare products japan and china has 
narrowed inbound demand for the line japan has slowed and our impression 
that overall trends remain steady 
estimate kose inbound sales for and about for 
however the company can secure inbound sales growth would 
boost the total about that works out additional adjusted 
eps discounting goodwill top our forecast 
our investment view has not changed but potentially limited upside the near 
term company guidance which consider conservative anticipates 
decline which entirely reflects expectations increased 
marketing expenses marketing costs were higher than consensus 
expectations the company spent aggressively early prompting many investors 
adopt wait and see approach until the announcement results 
however the shares are trading around our eps forecast discounting 
goodwill amortization expenses which well below the industry average 
around expect brisk sales momentum again apr jun and not expect 
slow sharply for the time being anticipate continued efforts exploit 
inbound demand well and look for the company share real domestic 
demand expand further the stock low valuations rank alongside kao within 
the domestic hpc market and think rerating likely continue quarterly 
results are announced 
shiseido equal weight 
shiseido announced its jan mar that its inbound sales sales 
foreign visitors japan had already reached the ginza business 
through other channels doubling the previous year total the 
past shiseido leveraging inbound demand has appeared somewhat lackluster 
given the scale its business but supported original strategies aimed 
exploiting this demand the company now showing the strength the shiseido 
brand has built over the years asia and elsewhere overseas average 
spending foreign visitors japan has softened due exchange rate 
movements has been concerning factor for the cosmetics industry too 
however based shiseido results would not surprised see 
full year inbound sales approaching terms eps impact estimate 
increase for each additional sales 
this point our forecasts assume sales foreign visitors 
japan but inbound sales are around instead could add about 
our eps forecast for the year adjusted basis after stripping out 
goodwill and extraordinary items 
for currently assume inbound sales about about 
yoy however these sales increase the same pace expect for 
the inbound cosmetics market whole would indicate upside our 
forecasts that level growth from works out nearly 
adding our adjusted eps forecast from about 
adding eps 
however the share price implications are limited our view plan review 
our earnings forecasts for now see little downside the stock but our 
impression that not possible confirm positive and ample enough catalysts 
that would push the share price toward our bull case results were 
certainly better than expected and noted above think inbound demand may 
provide stronger tailwind for japan business than previously anticipated 
accordingly while the shares are already trading above our target price the 
current level does not seem anomalous the other hand structural reforms 
and cost cutting efforts particularly overseas are not yet complete and would 
hard say that sales momentum back growth track stepped 
marketing investments have generated some effects for prestige brands which 
positive but are still waiting see whether future strategies will effective 
other price bands furthermore amid ongoing structural reform efforts there 
risk that new costs might suddenly arise are not yet the point where 
clear picture growth can drawn also unusual period with 
change the fiscal year end and revised segmentation making yoy comparisons 
difficult each quarter and therefore maintain our wait and see stance for 
now
