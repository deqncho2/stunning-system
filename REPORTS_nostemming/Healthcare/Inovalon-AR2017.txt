one the company most significant achievements 
was the introduction the inovalon 
one platform the inovalon one platform 
integrated cloud based platform more than 
individual proprietary technology toolsets 
components with each supporting critical healthcare 
functional needs throughout discussed our 
continuing investments areas like modularity cloudnative architecture real time transactional processing 
machine learning and natural language processing 
and other innovative capabilities and the inovalon 
one platform represents significant evolutionary 
advancement these investments with the inovalon 
one platform the company significantly enhanced 
existing offerings created new cloud native platformbased offerings and significantly enhanced the 
flexibility speed and breadth with which these 
offerings can deployed well the robustness 
efficiency and compute performance the cloudnative software and infrastructure that supports them 
the value delivery and market differentiation 
the inovalon one platform capabilities continues 
rapidly acknowledged and adopted the 
marketplace during inovalon signed multi year 
engagements with four the nation five largest

one platform representing significant growth 
opportunity for the company going forward 
important understanding inovalon understanding 
the capabilities needed support and succeed 
data driven value based healthcare the core 
value based initiatives the need aggregate and 
analyze data garner meaningful insight from the 
results and use these insights drive material change 
healthcare outcomes and economics achieve 
this four competencies are needed large scale data 
connectivity integration and validation capabilities 
advanced analytics and high speed compute 
toolsets translate resulting insights into real world 
impact and purpose built data visualization and 
reporting addition because value based healthcare 
measured relative performance basis these 
competencies require massive scale datasets 
perform relative comparisons and empower the 
training advanced analytical algorithms well 
extensive connectivity enable the application 
insight down the patient point care 
inovalon made significant progress all 
these areas and are seeing the market respond 
these competitive differentiators would like 
highlight two differentiators particular the first 
our massive data assets which continued see strong 
expansion and deepening the end the 
year inovalon registry dataset unique patient 
count expanded over million and the medical 
event count expanded nearly billion increases 
and respectively versus the end 
this data highly differentiated the market 
primary sourced longitudinally matched crosses all 
major healthcare programs and includes wide 
range patient and provider data elements beyond 
just claims data the company datasets are driving 
meaningful differentiation and growing translation into 
financial performance over time 
the second capability highlight inovalon 
healthcare ecosystem connectivity connectivity 
empowers our ability access data and drive 
impact with our analytical insights through cloudbased and direct connectivity can achieve this 
real time and autonomously providing highly 
differentiated capabilities for clients well highly 
efficient operations for the company the end 
inovalon had achieved electronic health 
record ehr system connectivity with more than 
physicians representing greater than 
compound annual growth rate cagr since 
expect see further expansion our connectivity 
finally worth highlighting important transaction 
that occurred subsequent the end april 
inovalon closed the acquisition ability 
network ability leading cloud based provider 
real time connectivity and analytics helping providers 
and payers simplify the complexities healthcare 
more than acute post acute and ambulatory 
provider sites the combination inovalon and ability 
creates the market largest vertically integrated cloudbased platform empowering the achievement realtime value based care from payers pharmaceutical 
companies device manufacturers and diagnostic 
companies all the way the patient point care 
the combination will both leverage and enhance the 
data assets inovalon will expand efficiencies gained 
through connectivity and will increase the company 
total addressable market and overall reach datadriven intervention capabilities 
the healthcare industry becomes increasingly valuebased and data driven and witnesses competitive 
dynamics such vertical integration and potential 
new entrants tremendous opportunities are being 
created for inovalon the company will continue 
invest drive increasing growth profitability 
innovation and competitive differentiation the 
marketplace enabling meaningful value creation for 
clients and stockholders the achievement our goals 
will measured years not quarters with our
