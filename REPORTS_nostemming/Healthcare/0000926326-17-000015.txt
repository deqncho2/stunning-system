deployed least some automation solutions but few have deployed them throughout the entire institution system the use manual and paper based 
systems many hospital departments today results highly complex and inefficient processes for tracking and delivering medications and supplies 
addition many existing healthcare information systems are unable support the modernization healthcare delivery processes address mandated patient 
safety initiatives these factors contribute medical errors and unnecessary process costs across the healthcare sector 
healthcare providers and facilities are affected significant economic pressures rising costs labor prescription drugs and new medical 
technology all contribute increased spending governmental pressures surrounding healthcare reform have led increased scrutiny the cost and 
efficiency with which healthcare providers deliver their services these factors combined with the continuing consolidation the healthcare industry have 
increased the need for the efficient delivery healthcare order control costs

capacity approximately acute care beds currently serve approximately hospitals and other facilities with total capacity more than 
approximately beds our customers include single location community hospitals government hospitals and regional and national hospital systems 
also sell our automation and analytics products directly non acute care providers which include all healthcare facilities that are not 
hospitals estimate there are facilities the united states that could use our automation and analytics products and few them use our solutions

valuation and impairment goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets 
business combination valuations when acquire businesses allocate the purchase price tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable 
intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price recorded goodwill the allocation the purchase price requires management make significant 
estimates determining the fair values assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect intangible assets these estimates are based 
information obtained from management the acquired companies and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited 
cash flows that asset expected generate the future 
the acquired company brand and competitive position well assumptions about the period time the acquired brand will continue 
used the combined company product portfolio 
cost savings expected derived from acquiring asset and 
discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could 
allocated the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that have made addition unanticipated events and circumstances may 
occur which may affect the accuracy validity such estimates and such events occur may required record charge against the value ascribed 
acquired asset increase the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 
goodwill impairment review goodwill for impairment annual basis the first day the fourth quarter each year the reporting unit

initially made determine whether necessary perform quantitative testing this initial assessment includes among others consideration past 
current and projected future earnings and equity recent trends and market conditions and iii valuation metrics involving similar companies that are 
publicly traded and acquisitions similar companies available this initial qualitative assessment indicates that more likely than not that 
impairment exists decide bypass this option proceed two step impairment test the first step step involves comparison between the 
estimated fair values our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill the methods for estimating reporting unit values 
include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques such discounted cash flows and multiples earnings revenues the carrying 
value exceeds estimated fair value there indication potential impairment and the second step performed measure the amount impairment the 
second step involves calculating implied fair value goodwill measuring the excess the estimated fair value the reporting units over the 
aggregate estimated fair values the individual assets less liabilities the carrying value goodwill exceeds the implied fair value goodwill 
impairment charge recorded for the excess 
the process estimating the fair value and carrying value our reporting units equity requires significant judgment many points during the 
analysis various assets and liabilities are not specifically allocated individual reporting unit and therefore apply judgment allocate the assets 
and liabilities and this allocation affects the carrying value the respective reporting units applying the income approach requires that make number 
important estimates and assumptions estimate the future cash flows each reporting unit based historical and forecasted revenue and operating 
costs this involves further estimates such estimates future revenue and expense growth rates addition apply discount rate the estimated 
future cash flows for the purpose the valuation this discount rate based the estimated weighted average cost capital for each reporting unit and 
may change from year year changes these key estimates and assumptions other assumptions used this process could materially affect our 
impairment analysis for given year 
performed step impairment analysis october for our medication adherence reporting unit determined that the fair value 
this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value more than and thus impairment was indicated additionally performed step impairment 
assessment analysis october for our automation and analytics reporting unit taking into consideration past current and projected future 
earnings recent trends and market conditions and valuation metrics involving similar companies that are publicly traded based the result our analysis
