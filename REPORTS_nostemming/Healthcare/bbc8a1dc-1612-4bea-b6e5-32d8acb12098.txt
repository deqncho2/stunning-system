first commercialized our inspire system certain european markets and the united states and therefore not have long history 
operating commercial company since our revenue has been derived and expect continue derived primarily from sales our inspire 
system because its recent commercial introduction our inspire system has limited product and brand recognition addition demand for our inspire system 
may decline may not increase quickly expect our ability generate revenue from sales our inspire system from any products may develop 
the future may not sufficient enable transition profitability and generate positive cash flows 
expect that our operating expenses will continue increase continue build our commercial infrastructure develop enhance and commercialize 
new products and incur additional operational costs associated with being public company result expect continue incur operating losses for the

ongoing basis not achieve sustain profitability will more difficult for finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives either 
which would have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations and cause the market price our common stock

currently derive primarily all our revenue from sales our inspire system and expect this continue for the foreseeable future the primary customers 
for our products are hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers ascs our customers typically bill various third party payors cover all portion the costs 
and fees associated with the procedures which our products are used and bill patients for any deductibles payments many third party payors not 
currently cover our products and the related procedures because they have determined that our products and the related procedures are experimental

treated the veterans health administration customers that perform the procedure may subject reimbursement claim denials upon submission the claim 
customers may also subject recovery overpayments payor makes payment for the claim and subsequently determines that the payor coding billing 
coverage policies were not followed our customers typically must directly bill patients enrolled with these third party payors for the costs and fees associated with

condition and results operations and impair our ability grow our business 
third party payors whether foreign domestic governmental commercial are developing increasingly sophisticated methods controlling healthcare 
costs addition uniform policy coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products exists among third party payors therefore coverage and 
reimbursement for procedures using our products can differ significantly from payor payor payors continually review new and existing technologies for

addition may experience difficulty growing the number physicians who complete our training program patient demand low the length time 
necessary train each physician longer than expected the capacity our sales representatives train physicians less than expected are unable

the fdca approval pre market approval application pma from the fda unless exemption applies the clearance process before 
device may marketed the fda must determine that proposed device substantially equivalent legally marketed predicate device which includes 
device that has been previously cleared through the process device that was legally marketed prior may pre amendments device device 
that was originally the market pursuant approved pma and later down classified exempt device substantially equivalent the 
proposed device must have the same intended use the predicate device and either have the same technological characteristics the predicate device have 
different technological characteristics and not raise different questions safety effectiveness than the predicate device clinical data are sometimes required 
support substantial equivalence the process obtaining pma approval which was required for our inspire system the fda must determine that proposed 
device safe and effective for its intended use based part extensive data including but not limited technical pre clinical clinical trial manufacturing 
and labeling data the pma process typically required for devices that are deemed pose the greatest risk such life sustaining life supporting 
implantable devices 
modifications products that are approved through pma application generally require fda approval similarly certain modifications made products 
cleared through may require new clearance both the pma approval and the clearance process can expensive lengthy and uncertain 
the fda clearance process usually takes from three months but can last longer the process obtaining pma much more costly and uncertain 
than the clearance process and generally takes from one three years even longer from the time the application filed with the fda addition 
pma generally requires the performance one more clinical trials despite the time effort and cost device may not approved cleared the fda any 
delay failure obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business furthermore even are granted regulatory clearances approvals they 
may include significant limitations the indicated uses for the device which may limit the market for the device 
the united states have obtained approval our inspire system through the pma pathway any modification the inspire system that has not been 
previously approved may require submit new pma pma supplement and obtain fda approval prior implementing the change the fda requires 
through lengthier more rigorous examination for future products modifications existing products than had expected product introductions 
modifications could delayed canceled which could adversely affect our ability grow our business 
the fda can delay limit deny clearance approval device for many reasons including 
our inability demonstrate the satisfaction the fda the applicable regulatory entity notified body that our products are safe effective 
for their intended uses 
the disagreement the fda the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design implementation our clinical trials the interpretation 
data from pre clinical studies clinical trials 
serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced participants our clinical trials 
the data from our pre clinical studies and clinical trials may insufficient support clearance approval where required 
our inability demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits the device outweigh the risks 
the manufacturing process facilities use may not meet applicable requirements and 
the potential for approval policies regulations the fda applicable foreign regulatory bodies change significantly manner rendering 
our clinical data regulatory filings insufficient for clearance approval

fdasia enacted congress reauthorized the medical device user fee amendments with various fda performance goal commitments and enacted 
several medical device regulatory improvements and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended clarify and improve medical device regulation both 
pre and post clearance and approval some these proposals and reforms could impose additional regulatory requirements upon that could delay our ability

assessment procedure conducted relation the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements this certificate entitles 
the manufacturer affix the mark its medical devices after having prepared and signed related declaration conformity 
general rule demonstration conformity medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must based among other things 
the evaluation clinical data supporting the safety and performance the products during normal conditions use specifically manufacturer must 
demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions use that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events are
