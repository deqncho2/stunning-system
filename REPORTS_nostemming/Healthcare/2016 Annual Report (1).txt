non licensed personnel these distinctions are generally found the health care industry although for medicaid 
reimbursement purposes some states which operate have additional classifications while other states the 
medicaid rate the same regardless patient classification rehabilitative services consist physical speech 
respiratory and occupational therapies which are designed aid the patient recovery and enable the patient 
resume normal activities 
each health care facility has licensed administrator responsible for supervising daily activities and larger 
facilities have assistant administrators all have medical directors director nurses and full time registered nurse

medicare health insurance program for the aged and certain other chronically disabled individuals

participation the federal government the states which operate currently use prospective cost based 
reimbursement systems under cost based reimbursement systems the skilled nursing facility reimbursed for the 
reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred base year providing routine resident care services

private pay managed care and other payment sources include commercial insurance individual patient 
funds managed care plans and the veterans administration although payment rates vary among these sources market 
forces and costs largely determine these rates private paying patients private insurance carriers and the veterans 
administration generally pay the basis the center charges specifically negotiated contracts 
contract with over managed care organizations mco and insurance carriers for the provision 
subacute and other medical specialty services our owned and managed facilities 
regulation and licenses 
health care area extensive regulatory oversight and frequent regulatory change the federal 
government and the states which operate regulate various aspects our business these regulatory bodies 
among other things require annually license our skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities some states 
and other health care businesses including home health particular operate nursing facilities and provide health 
care services must comply with federal state and local laws relating the delivery and adequacy medical care 
distribution pharmaceuticals equipment personnel operating policies fire prevention rate setting building codes 
and environmental protection 
governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities and home health 
agencies assure that continue comply with their various standards must pass these inspections continue 
our licensing under state law obtain certification under the medicare and medicaid programs and continue our 
participation the veterans administration program can only participate other third party programs our 
facilities pass these inspections addition these authorities inspect our record keeping and inventory control 
from time time like others the health care industry may receive notices from federal and state 
regulatory agencies alleging that failed comply with applicable standards these notices may require take 
corrective action and may impose civil money penalties and other operating restrictions our skilled nursing 
facilities and home health agencies fail comply with these directives otherwise fail comply substantially with 
licensure and certification laws rules and regulations could lose our certification medicare and medicaid 
provider and lose our licenses 
local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities specific their location 
regulate varying degrees our assisted living facilities although regulations and licensing requirements vary 
significantly from state state they typically address among other things personnel education training and records 
facility services including administration medication assistance with supervision medication management and 
limited nursing services physical plant specifications furnishing resident units food and housekeeping services 
emergency evacuation plans and resident rights and responsibilities assisted living facilities fail comply with 
licensing requirements these facilities could lose their licenses most states also subject assisted living facilities 
state local building codes fire codes and food service licensure certification requirements addition the 
manner and extent which the assisted living industry regulated federal and state levels are evolving 
changes the laws new interpretations existing laws applied the skilled nursing facilities 
the assisted living facilities other components our health care businesses may have significant impact 
our operations 
all states which operate before skilled nursing facility can make capital expenditure exceeding 
certain specified amounts construct any new skilled health care beds approval the state health care regulatory 
agency agencies must obtained and certificate need issued the appropriate state health planning agency 
must review the certificate need according state specific guidelines before certificate need can issued 
certificate need generally issued for specific maximum amount expenditure and the project must 
completed within specific time period there advance assurance that will able obtain certificate 
need any particular instance some states approval also necessary order purchase existing health care 
beds although the purchaser normally permitted avoid full scale certificate need application procedure 
giving advance written notice the acquisition and giving written assurance the state regulatory agency that 
the change ownership will not result change the number beds services offered and some cases 
reimbursement rates the facility 
while there are currently significant legislative proposals eliminate certificates need pertaining 
skilled nursing care the states which business deregulation the certificate need area would 
likely result increased competition and could adversely affect occupancy rates and the supply licensed and 
certified personnel 
medicare and medicaid participation 
all health care centers owned leased managed are certified participate medicare health care 
centers participating medicare are known snfs skilled nursing facilities all but seven our affiliated 
nursing centers participate medicaid all our homecares home health agencies participate medicare which 
comprises the majority their revenue homecares also participate medicaid 
during the fiscal years received payments from medicare and participating from medicaid record 
receivables the amounts ultimately expect receive under the medicare and medicaid programs and record into 
profit loss any differences amounts actually received the time interim final settlements adjustments have 
not had material adverse effect within the last three years 
certifications and participation requirements efforts impose reduced payments 
changes certification and participation requirements the medicare and medicaid programs have 
restricted and are likely continue restrict further eligibility for reimbursement under those programs failure 
obtain and maintain medicare and medicaid certification our nursing centers would result denial medicare and 
medicaid payments which would likely result significant loss revenue addition private payors including 
managed care payors increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting lost revenue 
for specific patients efforts impose reduced payments greater discounts and more stringent cost controls 
government and other payors are expected continue any reforms that significantly limit rates reimbursement 
under the medicare and medicaid programs could have material adverse effect our profitability and cash flows 
are unable predict what reform proposals reimbursement limitations will adopted the future the 
effect such changes will have our operations assurance can given that such reforms will not have material 
adverse effect 
medicare legislation and regulations 
federal health care reform

risks relating our company 
depend reimbursement from medicare medicaid and other third party payors and reimbursement 
rates from such payors may reduced derive substantial portion our revenue from third party payors 
including the medicare and medicaid programs third party payor programs are highly regulated and are subject 
frequent and substantial changes changes the reimbursement rate methods payment from third party payors 
including the medicare and medicaid programs the implementation other measures reduce reimbursements 
for our services has the past and could the future result substantial reduction our revenues and operating 
margins additionally net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and 
retroactive adjustment payors during the claims settlement processes result post payment audits payors 
may disallow requests for reimbursement based determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable reasonable 
because additional documentation necessary because certain services were not covered were not reasonable 
and medically necessary there also continue new legislative and regulatory proposals that could impose further 
limitations government and private payments health care providers some cases states have enacted are 
considering enacting measures designed reduce their medicaid expenditures and make changes private health 
care insurance cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue available for the services 
provided which are currently being reimbursed medicare medicaid private third party payors further 
limits the scope services reimbursed and reimbursement rates could have material adverse effect our 
liquidity financial condition and results operations possible that the effects further refinements pps that 
result lower payments cuts state medicaid funding could have material adverse effect our results 
operations see item business regulation and licenses and medicare legislation and regulations and 
medicaid legislation and regulations 
the affordable care act and its implementation could impact our business the affordable care act may 
continue alter the existing health care system for the delivery and financing health care significant goal 
federal health care reform transform the delivery health care changing reimbursement for health care 
services hold providers accountable for the cost and quality care provided medicare and many commercial third 
party payors are implementing aco models which groups providers share the benefit and risk providing 
care assigned group individuals lower cost other reimbursement methodology reforms include value based 
purchasing which portion provider reimbursement redistributed based relative performance designated 
economic clinical quality and patient satisfaction metrics addition cms implementing programs bundle 
acute care and post acute care reimbursement hold providers accountable for costs across broader continuum 
care these reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely continue and expand both public and 
commercial health plans providers who respond successfully these trends and are able deliver quality care 
lower cost are likely benefit financially the affordable care act and the programs implemented the law may 
reduce reimbursements for our services and may impact the demand for the company products addition various 
healthcare programs and regulations may ultimately implemented the federal state level failure respond 
successfully these trends could negatively impact our business results operations and financial condition 
cannot predict the effect that further healthcare reform the possible repeal and replacement the 
affordable care act and other changes government programs may have our business financial condition 
results operations since the adoption the affordable care act the law has been challenged before 
the supreme court and several bills have been and continue introduced congress delay defund 
repeal implementation amend significant provisions the affordable care act addition there continues 
ongoing litigation over the interpretation and implementation certain provisions the law furthermore 
january newly inaugurated president trump issued executive order that among other things stated 
that was the intent his administration repeal the affordable care act and pending that repeal instructed the 
executive branch the federal government defer delay the implementation any provision requirement 
the affordable care act that would impose fiscal burden any state cost fee tax penalty any individual 
family health care provider health insurer 
cannot predict whether the affordable care act will repealed replaced modified the impact that 
the president executive order will have the implementation and enforcement the provisions the affordable 
care act addition the affordable care act replaced modified cannot predict what the replacement plan 
modifications would when the replacement plan modifications would become effective whether any 
the existing provisions the affordable care act would remain place 
the net effect the affordable care act our business subject numerous variables including the law 
complexity lack complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the gradual implementation 
the numerous programs designed improve access and quality result are unable predict the effect

care programs providers with which they have ownership other financial arrangements many states have 
adopted are considering legislative proposals similar these laws some which extend beyond federal health 
care programs prohibit the payment receipt remuneration for the referral patients and physician referrals 
regardless the source the payment for the care these laws and regulations are complex and limited judicial 
regulatory interpretation exists cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with responsibility for 
enforcing the provisions these laws and regulations will not assert that one more our arrangements are 
violation the provisions such laws and regulations 
the regulatory environment surrounding the post acute and long term care industry has intensified 
particularly for larger for profit multi facility providers like the federal government has imposed extensive 
enforcement policies resulting significant increase the number inspections citations regulatory deficiencies 
and other regulatory sanctions including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs denials payment 
for new medicare and medicaid admissions and civil monetary penalties fail comply are perceived 
failing comply with the extensive laws and regulations applicable our business could become ineligible

fee splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed induce the referral patients 
particular provider for medical products and services possible sanctions for violation any these restrictions 
prohibitions include loss eligibility participate reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and other providers health 
care services many states prohibit business corporations from providing holding themselves out provider 
medical care from time time may seek guidance the interpretation these laws however there can 
assurance that such laws will ultimately interpreted manner consistent with our practices addition could 
forced expend considerable resources responding investigation other enforcement action under these 
laws regulations furthermore should lose licenses certifications for number our facilities result 
regulatory action otherwise could deemed default under some our agreements including agreements 
governing outstanding indebtedness also are subject potential lawsuits under federal whistle blower statute 
designed combat fraud and abuse the health care industry known the federal false claims act these lawsuits 
can involve significant monetary awards private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits when private party 
brings qui tam action under the false claims act files the complaint with the court under seal and the defendant 
will generally not aware the lawsuit until the government makes determination whether will intervene and

accrued risk reserves 
our accrued professional liability reserves workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves 
totaled and december and respectively and are primary area 
management focus have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities fund our professional liability and 
workers compensation reserves 
exposure for professional liability claims have developed for our centers performance certification 
criteria measure and bring focus the patient care issues most likely produce professional liability exposure including 
in house acquired pressure ulcers significant weight loss and numbers falls these programs for certification which 
regularly modify and improve have produced measurable improvements reducing these incidents our experience 
that achieving goals these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
application critical accounting policies 
the preparation financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the 
united states america requires make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets 
and liabilities and disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported 
amounts revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and 
cause our reported net income vary significantly from period period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important the portrayal our financial condition and results 
and require our most difficult subjective complex judgments are follows 
revenue recognition third party payors 
medicare and medicaid program revenues well certain managed care program revenues are subject 
audit and retroactive adjustment government representatives their agents our opinion adequate provision 
has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews any differences between our original estimates 
reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected operations the period which the revisions are made 
often due final determination the period payment longer being subject audit review have made 
provisions approximately and december and respectively for 
various medicare medicaid and managed care claims reviews and current and prior year cost reports 
revenue recognition private pay 
for private pay patients skilled nursing assisted living facilities bill room and board charges for 
the current month with payment being due upon receipt the statement the month the services are performed 
charges for ancillary pharmacy therapy and other services private patients are billed the month following the 
performance services however all billings are recognized revenue when the services are performed 
revenue recognition subordination fees and uncertain collections 
provide management services healthcare operators and others provide accounting and financial 
services generally charge net operating revenues for our management services and predetermined fixed 
rate per bed for the accounting and financial services our policy recognize revenues associated with both management 
services and accounting and financial services accrual basis the services are provided however under the terms 
our management contracts payments for our management services are subject subordination other expenditures 
the long term care center being managed furthermore for certain the third parties with whom have contracted 
provide services and which have determined based insufficient historical collections and the lack expected future 
collections that collection not reasonably assured our policy recognize revenues only the period which the 
amounts are realized may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees whole part the 
future only cash flows from the operating and investing activities the centers proceeds from the sale the centers are 
sufficient pay the fees there can assurance that such future cash flows will occur the realization such previously 
unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income vary significantly from period period 
agree subordinate our fees the other expenses managed center because believe know 
how improve the quality patient services and finances skilled nursing assisted living facility and because 
subordinating our fees demonstrates the owner and employees the managed center how confident are 
the impact can have making the center operations successful may continue provide services certain 
managed centers despite not being fully paid currently that may able collect unpaid fees the future from 
improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services center may small 
compared the potential benefit also may benefit from providing other ancillary services the managed center 
accrued risk reserves 
are self insured for risks related health insurance and have wholly owned limited purpose insurance 
companies that insure risks related workers compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims 
the accrued risk reserves include liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims our 
policy engage external independent actuary assist estimating our exposure for claims obligations for 
both asserted and unasserted claims reassess our accrued risk reserves quarterly basis 
professional liability remains area particular concern the long term care industry has seen 
increase personal injury wrongful death claims based alleged negligence skilled nursing facilities and their 
employees providing care residents december and our managed centers are defendants 
claims remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves 
which could have material adverse effect our consolidated financial position results operations and cash 
flows also possible that future events could cause make significant adjustments revisions these reserve 
estimates and cause our reported net income vary significantly from period period 
are principally self insured for incidents occurring all centers owned leased the coverages 
include both primary policies and excess policies all years settlements any excess available insurance 
policy limits and our own reserves would expensed 
government program financial changes 
cost containment will continue priority for federal and state governments for health care services 
including the types services provide government reimbursement programs such medicare and medicaid 
prescribe law the billing methods and amounts that health care providers may charge and reimbursed care 
for patients covered these programs congress has passed number laws that have effected major changes the 
medicare and medicaid programs the balanced budget act sought achieve balanced federal budget 
among other things reducing federal spending medicare and medicaid various providers the balanced budget 
act defined the medicare prospective payment system pps and this system has subsequently been refined 
and 
federal health care reform 
march president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca 
commonly aca and the health care and education reconciliation act hcera which represents 
significant changes the current health care system collectively the acts the primary goals the acts are 
expand coverage americans without health insurance reform the delivery system improve quality and drive 
efficiency and lower the overall costs providing health care the timeline the enacted provisions span over 
several years some the provisions were effective immediately and others will phased through 
since significant goal federal health care reform transform the delivery health care holding providers 
accountable for the cost and quality care provided medicare and many commercial third party payors are implementing 
accountable care organization aco models which groups providers share the benefit and risk providing 
care assigned group individuals other reimbursement methodology reforms which are participating expect 
participate include value based purchasing which portion provider reimbursement redistributed based

received under governmental programs and other third party contractual arrangements based contractual terms 
these revenues and receivables are stated amounts estimated management their net realizable value 
for private pay patients skilled nursing assisted living and independent living facilities the company bills 
for room and board charges with the remittance being due receipt the statement and generally the day 
the month the services are performed portion the episodic medicare payments for home health services are also 
received advance the services being rendered all advance billings are initially deferred and then are recognized 
revenue when the services are performed 
receive payments from the medicare program under prospective payment system pps for skilled 
nursing services medicare pays fixed fee per medicare patient per day based the acuity level the patient 
cover all post hospital extended care routine service costs ancillary costs and capital related costs 
medicaid program payments for long term care services are generally based fixed per diem rates subject

the expected payment for the initial episode the remaining balance due paid following the submission the final 
claim the end the episode revenues are recognized when services are provided based the number days 
service rendered the episode deferred revenue recorded for payments received for which the related services 
have not yet been provided 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject 
interpretation noncompliance with such laws and regulations can subject regulatory actions including fines 
penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs believe that are compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations 
medicare and medicaid program revenues well certain managed care program revenues are subject
