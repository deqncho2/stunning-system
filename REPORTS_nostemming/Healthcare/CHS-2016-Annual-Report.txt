pso was recertified through 
divestiture and acquisition strategy 
divestiture and acquisition criteria acquisitions have been core part our growth strategy historically 
have been implementing portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy divesting hospitals and nonhospital businesses that are attractive strategic and other buyers generally these businesses are not one 
our strategically beneficial service areas are less complementary our business strategy and have lower 
operating margins addition the spin off the facilities qhc which was completed april 
noted above divested two facilities and ownership interest our home care division which 
december owned and operated licensed home care agencies and licensed hospice agencies 
for additional information regarding potential additional dispositions see the executive overview 
management discussion and analysis financial condition and results operations under part item 
this form 
although are not actively pursuing hospital acquisition opportunities this time have continued 
invest capital strategically selected physician practice and ancillary service locations that will enhance the 
service lines and patient access points for our existing hospitals intend focus again hospital 
acquisitions once our portfolio rationalization has been sufficiently completed and that time return 
disciplined and targeted approach hospital acquisitions and seek opportunities that are complementary our 
existing markets represent new markets that fit our operating criteria that time may pursue acquisition 
candidates that 
are located market that has stable growing population base 
are the sole primary provider acute care services the community 
are located area with the potential for service expansion 
are not located area that dependent upon single employer industry and 
have financial performance that believe will benefit from our management operating skills 
acquired three hospitals located fayetteville arkansas porte indiana and knox indiana 
believe that our access capital reputation for providing quality care and ability recruit physicians makes 
attractive partner for these communities hospital acquisitions closed during 
january completed the merger with hma which the time acquisition owned leased 
hospitals addition the hma hospitals during acquired four other hospitals located ocala 
florida sharon pennsylvania natchez mississippi and gaffney south carolina 
acquisition efforts key part our strategy has involved establishing broader presence our states and 
markets operation and expanding and strengthening our regional networks where appropriate apart from our 
acquisition triad hospitals and hma most the hospitals that have acquired have been 
municipal other not for profit hospitals believe that our access capital ability recruit physicians and 
reputation for providing quality care make attractive partner for these communities addition have 
found that communities located states where already operate hospital are more receptive our acquiring 
their hospitals because they are aware our operating track record with respect our other hospitals within the 
state 
the time have acquired hospital may commit amount capital expenditures such 
replacement facility renovations equipment over specified period time 
pursuant hospital purchase agreement effect december have committed build 
replacement facilities both porte indiana and knox indiana march construction costs including 
equipment costs for the porte and knox replacement facilities are currently estimated approximately 
million and million respectively costs have been incurred date those facilities additionally 
are required build replacement facility york pennsylvania july estimated construction costs 
including equipment costs are approximately million for this replacement facility which approximately 
million has been incurred date under other purchase agreements effect december 
have committed spend million generally over five seven year period after acquisition for costs such 
capital improvements equipment selected leases and physician recruiting through december 
have incurred approximately million related these commitments 
industry overview 
according the centers for medicare medicaid services cms national healthcare expenditures 
are projected have grown approximately trillion addition these cms projections 
published indicate that total healthcare spending will grow average annual rate for 
through and average annually from through however these projections not 
take into account initiatives programs other developments that may result from the federal elections 
including any potential significant modifications repeal the affordable care act cms also projected that 
total healthcare annual expenditures will exceed trillion accounting for approximately 
the total gross domestic product cms expects healthcare spending largely influenced changes 
economic growth and population aging and anticipates faster growth medical prices 
hospital services the market within the healthcare industry which primarily operate the largest single 
category healthcare expenditures hospital care expenditures are projected have grown 
amounting over trillion cms estimates that the hospital services category will exceed trillion 
and projects growth this category average annually from through 
hospital industry the hospital industry broadly defined include acute care rehabilitation and 
psychiatric facilities that are either public government owned and operated not for profit private religious 
secular for profit institutions investor owned according the american hospital association there are 
community hospitals the which are not for profit owned investor owned state local 
government owned these hospitals nearly are located non urban communities believe that 
majority these hospitals are owned not for profit governmental entities these facilities offer broad 
range healthcare services including internal medicine general surgery cardiology oncology orthopedics 
gyn and emergency services addition hospitals offer other ancillary services including psychiatric 
diagnostic rehabilitation home care and outpatient surgery services 
urban non urban hospitals according the census bureau the population lives 
communities designated non urban these non urban communities hospitals are typically the primary 
source healthcare many cases single hospital the only provider general healthcare services these 
communities 
factors affecting performance among the many factors that can influence hospital financial and operating 
performance are 
facility size and location 
facility ownership structure tax exempt investor owned 
facility ability participate gpos and 
facility payor mix 
patients needing the most complex care are more often served the larger and more specialized urban 
hospitals believe opportunities exist selected urban markets create networks between urban hospitals 
and non urban hospitals order expand the breadth services offered the non urban hospitals while 
improving physician alignment those markets and making them more attractive managed care organizations 
hospital industry trends 
demographic trends according the census bureau there were approximately million 
americans aged older the comprising approximately the total population the year 
the number americans aged older expected climb million the total 
population due the increasing life expectancy americans the number people aged years and older 
also expected increase from million million the year this increase life expectancy 
will increase demand for healthcare services and importantly the demand for innovative more sophisticated 
means delivering those services hospitals the largest category care the healthcare market will 
among those impacted most directly this increase demand based data compiled for the populations 
the service areas where our hospitals are located grew from and are expected grow 
from the number people aged older these service areas grew from 
and expected grow from people aged older comprised the 
total population our service areas yet they could comprise the total population our service 
areas 
consolidation addition our own acquisitions recent years consolidation activity the hospital 
industry primarily through mergers and acquisitions involving both for profit and not for profit hospital systems 
continuing reasons for this activity include 
ample supply available capital 
valuation levels 
financial performance issues including challenges associated with changes reimbursement and 
collectability self pay revenue 
the desire enhance the local availability healthcare the community 
the need and ability recruit primary care physicians and specialists 
the need achieve general economies scale and gain access standardized and centralized 
functions including favorable supply agreements and access malpractice coverage 
changes healthcare payment models that emphasize cost effective delivery service and quality 
outcomes for the entire episode care and 
regulatory changes 
the payor industry also consolidating and acquiring health services providers effort offer more 
expansive competitive programs 
trends payment for healthcare services discussed more detail the government regulation section 
this form the impact healthcare reform legislation combined with the growing financial and 
economic pressures the healthcare industry has resulted challenges traditional reimbursement trends for 
example the patient protection and affordable care act amended the health care and education 
reconciliation act collectively the affordable care act has encouraged the adoption new payment 
models that emphasize cost effective delivery care and quality outcomes although health insurance 
coverage has expanded patients may face higher deductibles and increased payment requirements which may 
result greater write offs uncollectible amounts from those patients 
shift outpatient services because the growing availability stand alone outpatient healthcare facilities 
and the increase the services that are able provided these locations many individuals are seeking 
broader range services outpatient facilities this trend has contributed increase outpatient services 
while inhibiting the growth inpatient admissions

which not have insurance provider contracts workers compensation carriers and non patient service 
revenue such rental income and cafeteria sales the affordable care act has increased the number insured 
patients particularly states that have expanded medicaid which turn has reduced the percentage our 
revenues from self pay patients however the outcome the federal elections has cast considerable 
uncertainty the future the affordable care act and unclear whether the trend increased coverage 
will continue addition several private health insurers have withdrawn have announced their intent 
withdraw from the health insurance exchanges established pursuant the affordable care act which may 
threaten the stability those marketplaces legislation regulation resulting from the repeal replacement

healthcare all our hospitals are certified providers medicare and medicaid services amounts received 
under the medicare and medicaid programs are generally significantly less than hospital customary charges 
for the services provided further the affordable care act imposes significant reductions amounts the 
government pays healthcare providers and medicare managed care plans since substantial portion our 
revenue comes from patients under medicare and medicaid programs our ability operate our business 
successfully the future will depend large measure our ability adapt changes these programs the

recent years collection amounts due from individuals typically more difficult than collection amounts 
due from government business payors further reduce their healthcare costs increasing number 
insurance companies hmos ppos and other managed care companies negotiate discounted fee structures 
fixed amounts for hospital services performed rather than paying healthcare providers the amounts billed and 
utilize structures such narrow networks that restrict the providers that enrollees may utilize negotiate

government regulation 
overview the healthcare industry required comply with extensive government regulation the federal 
state and local levels under these regulations hospitals must meet requirements certified hospitals and 
qualified participate government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs these 
requirements include those relating the adequacy medical care equipment personnel operating policies and 
procedures billing and coding for services properly handling overpayments classifications levels care 
provided preparing and filing cost reports relationships with referral sources and referral recipients 
maintenance adequate records hospital use rate setting compliance with building codes environmental 
protection and privacy and security there are also extensive laws and regulations governing hospital 
participation these government programs fail comply with applicable laws and regulations may 
subject criminal penalties and civil sanctions our hospitals could lose their licenses and could lose our 
ability participate these government programs further government regulations may change that 
happens may have make changes our facilities equipment personnel and services that our hospitals 
remain certified hospitals and qualified participate these programs believe that our hospitals are 
currently substantial compliance with current federal state and local regulations and standards cannot 
certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws whistleblowers will not assert that 
are violation them that such statutes regulations will interpreted the courts manner 
consistent with our interpretation 
hospitals are subject periodic inspection federal state and local authorities determine their compliance 
with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing and certification all our hospitals are 
licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified participate medicare and medicaid programs 
addition most our hospitals are accredited the joint commission this accreditation indicates that 
hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards participate medicare and medicaid 
programs 
healthcare reform over the last decade the congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and 
passed large number proposals and legislation designed make major changes the healthcare system 
including changes that increased access health insurance the most prominent these recent efforts the 
affordable care act affects how healthcare services are covered delivered and reimbursed however the future 
the affordable care act uncertain following the federal elections the newly elected presidential 
administration and certain members congress have stated their intent repeal make significant changes 
the affordable care act its implementation interpretation but have not yet agreed upon specific proposals for 
replacement reforms addition presidential executive order has been signed that directs agencies minimize 
economic and regulatory burdens the affordable care act but unclear how this will implemented 
the impact and timing any potential repeal changes the affordable care act and any alternative 
provisions the healthcare industry unknown 
the affordable care act currently structured mandates that substantially all citizens maintain health 
insurance coverage and increases health insurance coverage through combination public program expansion 
and private sector health insurance reforms expansion public program coverage has been driven primarily 
adjusting eligibility requirements for medicaid coverage number states opted out the medicaid 
expansion provisions which they may without losing federal funding states that have opted out include 
florida tennessee and texas where operated significant number hospitals december 
some states that have opted out are evaluating options such waiver plans operate alternative medicaid 
expansion plan 
believe that the affordable care act has had positive impact net operating revenues and income from 
continuing operations the result the expansion private sector and medicaid coverage that has occurred 
however other provisions the affordable care act such requirements related employee health insurance 
coverage have increased our operating costs addition the affordable care act has made changes medicare 
and medicaid reimbursement that could adversely impact the reimbursement receive under these programs 
these changes include reductions the medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 
through productivity offset the medicare market basket update and reductions the medicare and 
medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments 
substantial uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing net effect the affordable care act due the results 
the federal elections the possibility repeal significant change the affordable care act following 
such elections and other factors including clarifications and modifications resulting from executive orders the 
rule making process the outcome court challenges the development agency guidance whether and how 
many states ultimately decide expand medicaid coverage the number uninsured who elect purchase 
health insurance coverage and budgetary issues federal and state levels 
fraud and abuse laws participation the medicare program heavily regulated federal statute and 
regulation hospital fails comply substantially with the requirements for participating the medicare

enforcement authorities 
the oig has identified the following incentive arrangements potential violations the anti kickback 
statute 
payment any incentive the hospital when physician refers patient the hospital 
use free significantly discounted office space equipment for physicians facilities usually 
located close the hospital 
provision free significantly discounted billing nursing other staff services 
free training for physician office staff including management and laboratory techniques but

purchasing goods services from physicians prices excess their fair market value 
rental space physician offices other than fair market value 
physician owned entities often referred physician owned distributorships pods that derive 
revenue from selling arranging for the sale implantable medical devices ordered their 
physician owners for use procedures that physician owners perform their own patients hospitals 
ascs

own interests number our facilities physicians may also own our stock also have contracts with 
physicians providing for variety financial arrangements including employment contracts leases 
management agreements and professional service agreements provide financial incentives recruit 
physicians relocate communities served our hospitals these incentives include relocation 
reimbursement for certain direct expenses income guarantees and some cases loans although strive 
comply with the anti kickback statute taking into account available guidance including the safe harbor 
regulations cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine otherwise that happens 
could subject criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participating medicare medicaid 
other government healthcare programs pursuant the bipartisan budget act civil monetary penalties 
increased substantially were further increased and will continue increase annually based

physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients healthcare entities which they any their

which the physician has ownership interest the entity located rural area defined the statute 
there are also exceptions for many the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers 
including employment contracts leases and recruitment agreements from time time the federal government 
has issued regulations which interpret the provisions included the stark law 
the affordable care act narrowed the whole hospital exception the stark law the affordable care act 
permitted existing physician investments whole hospital continue under grandfather clause the 
arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from the time the 
affordable care act became effective from increasing the aggregate percentage their ownership the 
hospital the affordable care act also restricts the ability existing physician owned hospitals expand the 
capacity their aggregate licensed beds operating rooms and procedure rooms the whole hospital exception 
also contains additional public disclosure requirements 
taking into account updates such penalties sanctions for violating the stark law include denial 
payment civil monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from federal healthcare 
programs and penalty for scheme intended circumvent the stark law prohibitions 
these civil monetary penalties will increase annually based updates the consumer price index 
addition the restrictions and disclosure requirements applicable physician owned hospitals under the

evolving interpretations current the adoption new federal state laws regulations could affect 
many the arrangements entered into each our hospitals addition law enforcement authorities 
including the oig the courts and congress are increasing scrutiny arrangements between healthcare providers 
and potential referral sources ensure that the arrangements are not designed mechanism improperly pay 
for patient referrals and other business investigators also have demonstrated willingness look behind the 
formalities business transaction determine the underlying purpose payments between healthcare 
providers and potential referral sources 
many states which operate have also adopted laws that prohibit payments physicians exchange for 
referrals similar the federal anti kickback statute that otherwise prohibit fraud and abuse activities many 
states have also passed self referral legislation similar the stark law prohibiting the referral patients 
entities with which the physician has financial relationship often these state laws are broad scope and may 
apply regardless the source payment for care these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties

federal false claims act and similar state laws another trend affecting the healthcare industry the 
increased use the federal false claims act fca which can used prosecute medicare and other 
government program fraud involving issues such coding errors billing for service not provided and submitting 
false cost reports further the fca covers payments involving federal funds connection with the health 
insurance exchanges created under the affordable care act those payments involve any federal funds 
liability under the fca often arises when entity knowingly submits false claim for reimbursement the 
federal government the fca broadly defines the term knowingly although simple negligence will not give 
rise liability under the fca submitting claim with reckless disregard its truth falsity may constitute 
knowingly submitting false claim and result liability among the many other potential bases for liability 
under the fca the knowing and improper failure report and refund amounts owed the government within 
days identifying overpayment overpayment deemed identified when person has should 
have through reasonable diligence determined that overpayment was received and quantified the 
overpayment submission claim for item service generated violation the anti kickback statute 
constitutes false fraudulent claim under the fca some cases whistleblowers the federal government and 
courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes such the stark law 
have thereby submitted false claims under the fca 
when defendant determined court law liable under the fca the defendant must pay three 
times the actual damages sustained the government plus mandatory civil penalties between and 
for each separate false claim after taking into account updates such penalties these civil 
monetary penalties will increase annually based updates the consumer price index settlements entered into 
prior litigation usually involve less severe calculation damages the fca also contains qui tam 
whistleblower provisions which allow private individuals bring actions behalf the government alleging 
that the defendant has defrauded the federal government the government intervenes the action and prevails 
the party filing the initial complaint may share any settlement judgment the government does not 
intervene the action the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and may receive larger 
share any settlement judgment when private party brings qui tam action under the fca the defendant 
generally will not made aware the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation 
determines whether will intervene every entity that receives least million annually medicaid payments 
must have written policies for all employees contractors and agents providing detailed information about false 
claims false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws including the fca and similar 
state laws 
number states including states which operate have adopted their own false claims provisions 
well their own whistleblower provisions whereby private party may file civil lawsuit state court federal 
law provides incentive states enact false claims laws that are comparable the fca from time time 
companies the healthcare industry including ours may subject actions under the fca similar state 
laws 
corporate practice medicine fee splitting some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons 
business entities including corporations from employing physicians some states also have adopted laws that 
prohibit direct indirect payments entering into fee splitting arrangements with physicians and 
unlicensed persons business entities possible sanctions for violations these restrictions include loss 
physician license civil and criminal penalties and rescission business arrangements these laws vary from 
state state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted the courts regulatory agencies structure 
our arrangements with healthcare providers comply with the relevant state law however cannot provide 
assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that transactions 
which are involved are violation these laws these laws may also interpreted the courts 
manner inconsistent with our interpretations 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act the emergency medical treatment and active labor 
act imposes requirements the care that must provided anyone who comes facilities providing 
emergency medical services seeking care before they may transferred another facility otherwise denied 
care sanctions for failing fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation medicare and

hipaa administrative simplification and privacy and security requirements the health insurance 
portability and accountability act hipaa requires the use uniform electronic data transmission 
standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted received electronically these provisions 
are intended encourage electronic commerce the healthcare industry hhs has established electronic data 
transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting receiving certain healthcare 
transactions electronically addition hipaa requires that each provider use national provider identifier all 
healthcare providers covered hipaa were required transition updated standard code sets for certain 
diagnoses and procedures known icd code sets october have transitioned all our 
hospitals the icd coding system the affordable care act requires the hhs adopt standards for 
additional electronic transactions and establish operating rules promote uniformity the implementation 
each standardized electronic transaction 
required hipaa hhs has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and

payment 
medicare under the medicare program are paid for inpatient and outpatient services performed our 
hospitals 
payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant prospective payment system 
commonly known pps under pps our hospitals are paid predetermined amount for each hospital 
discharge based the patient diagnosis specifically each discharge assigned diagnosis related group 
commonly known drg based upon the patient condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient 
stay each drg assigned payment rate using the national average cost per case and the 
severity adjusted drg weights drg payments are based national averages and not charges costs 
specific hospital severity adjusted drgs more accurately reflect the costs hospital incurs for caring for 
patient and account more fully for the severity each patient condition however drg payments are adjusted 
predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned the geographic area which the hospital located 
while hospital generally does not receive payment addition drg payment hospitals may qualify for 
outlier payment when the relevant patient treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed specified 
regulatory threshold 
the drg payment rates are adjusted update factor october each year the beginning the 
federal fiscal year the index used adjust the drg payment rates known the market basket index gives 
consideration the inflation experienced hospitals purchasing goods and services drg payment rates 
were increased the full market basket index for the federal fiscal years and and 
respectively subject certain reductions for federal fiscal year the drg payment rates were reduced 
for documentation and coding reduced for the multi factor productivity adjustment and reduced 
accordance with the affordable care act there was also downward adjustment offset 
projected spending increases associated with admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services 
commonly known the two midnight rule for federal fiscal year the drg payment rates were reduced 
for documentation and coding reduced for the multi factor productivity adjustment and 
reduced accordance with the affordable care act there also positive adjustment 
remove the effects prior adjustments intended offset projected spending increases associated with the two 
midnight rule under the rule services medicare beneficiaries are only payable inpatient hospital services 
when there reasonable expectation that the hospital care medically necessary and will required across 
two midnights absent unusual circumstances reduction the market basket index occurs patient 
quality data not submitted and reduction the market basket index update occurs for hospitals that 
fail demonstrate meaningful use certified electronic health records ehr technology without receiving 
hardship exception future legislation may decrease the rate increase for drg payments even decrease such 
payment rates but are unable predict the amount any reduction the effect that any reduction will have 
the drg payment rates are also adjusted promote value based purchasing linking payments quality and 
efficiency first hospitals that meet exceed certain quality performance standards will receive greater 
reimbursement under cms value based purchasing program while hospitals that not satisfy certain quality 
performance standards will receive reduced medicare inpatient hospital payments the amount collected from 
the reductions pooled and used fund the payments that reward hospitals based set quality measures 
that have been linked improved clinical processes care and patient satisfaction cms scores each hospital 
its achievement relative other hospitals and improvement relative that hospital own past performance 
second hospitals experiencing excess readmissions for conditions designated cms within days from the 
patient date discharge will receive inpatient payments reduced amount determined comparing that 
hospital readmission performance risk adjusted national average third the hospitals with the 
worst national risk adjusted hospital acquired condition hac rates the previous year will have their total 
inpatient operating medicare payments reduced hhs has indicated that will increase its efforts 
promote develop and use alternative payment models such accountable care organizations acos and 
bundled payment arrangements 
addition hospitals may qualify for medicare disproportionate share payments when their percentage low 
income patients exceeds specified regulatory thresholds majority our hospitals qualify receive medicare 
disproportionate share payments medicare disproportionate share payments are reduced and earmarked 
for uncompensated care payment pool accordance with the affordable care act the uncompensated care 
pool further reduced each year formula that reflects reductions the uninsured population that 
under years age thus the greater the level coverage for the uninsured the more the medicare 
uncompensated care pool will reduced each eligible hospital then paid out the uncompensated care 
pool amount based upon its estimated cost providing uncompensated care this time cannot predict 
impact for this change these medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments 
percentage operating revenues net contractual allowances and discounts but before the provision for bad 
debts were and for the years ended december and respectively hospitals may also 
qualify for medicaid disproportionate share payments when they qualify under the state established guidelines 
these medicaid disproportionate share payments percentage operating revenues net contractual

also receive medicare reimbursement for outpatient services through pps the outpatient conversion 
factor was increased effective january however there was downward adjustment 
accordance with the affordable care act downward productivity adjustment and downward 
adjustment address what cms views inflated payments for laboratory tests packaged with payments for 
hospital outpatient services the outpatient conversion factor was increased effective january 
however there was downward adjustment accordance with the affordable care act and 
downward productivity adjustment and other payment adjustments for estimated increase taking into 
account these and other payment adjustments cms estimates the update will result increase 
outpatient pps payments hospitals for fiscal year additional reduction applies hospitals that 
not submit required patient quality data are complying with this data submission requirement 
the medicare reimbursement discussed above was reduced beginning due the budget control act 
that required across the board spending cuts the federal budget also known sequestration these 
sequestration cuts included reductions payments for medicare and other federally funded healthcare programs 
including tricare the cuts began march with the sequester related medicare reimbursement cuts 
beginning april these reductions have been extended through 
payment under the medicare program for physician services based upon the medicare physician fee 
schedule mpfs under which cms has assigned national relative value unit rvu most medical 
procedures and services that reflects the resources required provide the services relative all other services 
each rvu calculated based combination the time and intensity work required overhead expense 
attributable the service and malpractice insurance expense these elements are each modified geographic 
adjustment factor account for local practice costs and are then aggregated macra provides for 
update the mpfs for each calendar year through macra also requires the establishment the quality 
payment program qpp payment methodology intended reward high quality patient care beginning 
physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians are required participate one two qpp tracks 
under both tracks performance data collected will affect medicare payments cms expects 
transition increasing financial risk providers qpp evolves under the advanced alternative payment 
model advanced apm track incentive payments are available based participation specific innovative 
payment models approved cms providers may earn medicare incentive payment and will exempt from 
the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the merit based incentive payment system 
mips the provider has sufficient participation advanced apm alternatively providers may 
participate the mips track under which physicians will receive performance based payment incentives 
payment reductions based their performance with respect clinical quality resource use clinical 
improvement activities and meaningful use ehr mips will consolidate components certain existing 
physician incentive programs 
addition changing medicare physician payment methodology macra extended the medicare inpatient 
low volume payment and medicare dependent hospital programs qualifying hospitals through 
september additional legislation not passed extend these medicare hospital payment programs 
could experience reduction future reimbursement 
medicaid most state medicaid payments are made under pps under programs which negotiate payment 
levels with individual hospitals medicaid funded jointly state and federal government the federal 
government and many states are currently considering significantly reducing medicaid funding while the 
same time expanding medicaid benefits currently several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs 
for the purpose providing reimbursement providers offset portion the cost providing care 
medicaid and indigent patients these programs are designed with input from cms and are funded with 
combination state and federal resources including certain instances fees taxes levied the providers 
similar programs are also being considered other states can provide assurance that reductions 
medicaid funding will not have material adverse effect our consolidated results operations further the 
affordable care act prohibits the use federal funds under the medicaid program reimburse providers for 
medical services provided treat hacs 
tricare tricare the department defense healthcare program for members the armed forces 
for inpatient services tricare generally reimburses hospitals based drg system modeled the 
medicare inpatient pps for outpatient services tricare reimburses hospitals based pps that similar 
that utilized for services furnished medicare beneficiaries 
annual cost reports hospitals participating the medicare and some medicaid programs whether paid 
reasonable cost basis under pps are required meet specified financial reporting requirements federal 
and where applicable state regulations require submission annual cost reports identifying medical costs and 
expenses associated with the services provided each hospital medicare beneficiaries and medicaid 
recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and some medicaid programs are subject routine 
governmental audits these audits may result adjustments the amounts ultimately determined due 
under these reimbursement programs finalization these audits often takes several years providers can appeal 
any final determination made connection with audit drg outlier payments have been and continue 
the subject cms audit and adjustment the oig also actively engaged audits and investigations into 
alleged abuses the drg outlier payment system 
commercial insurance and managed care companies our hospitals provide services individuals covered 
private healthcare insurance health plans administered managed care companies these payors pay 
our hospitals some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospital established charges and 
the coverage provided the insurance policy they try limit the costs hospital services negotiating 
discounts including pps which would reduce payments commercial insurers health plans our hospitals 
commercial insurers and managed care companies also seek reduce payments hospitals establishing 
payment rules that effect characterize the services ordered physicians for example some payors 
vigorously review each patient length stay the hospital and recharacterize outpatient all patient stays 
less than particular duration hours reductions payments for services provided our hospitals 
individuals covered these payors could adversely affect 
medicare administrative contractors cms competitively bids the medicare fiscal intermediary and medicare 
carrier functions medicare administrative contractors macs jurisdictions each mac 
geographically assigned and serves both part and part providers within given jurisdiction chain providers 
had the option having all hospitals use one home office mac and chose however cms has not 
converted all our hospitals one mac and currently does not have established date accomplish the 
conversion cms periodically solicits bids and the mac servicing geographic area can change result 
the bid competition mac transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow 
medicare integrity cms contracts with third parties promote the integrity the medicare program through 
review quality concerns and detection improper payments quality improvement organizations qios 
for example are groups physicians and other healthcare quality experts which work behalf cms 
ensure that medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided 
the most appropriate setting under the recovery audit contractor rac program cms contracts with racs 
nationwide conduct post payment reviews detect and correct improper payments the medicare program 
required statute racs review claims submitted medicare for billing compliance including correct

the rac program scope also includes medicaid claims states may coordinate with medicaid racs 
regarding recoupment overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse appropriate law enforcement 
agencies under the medicaid integrity program cms employs private contractors referred medicaid 
integrity contractors mics perform reviews and post payment audits medicaid claims and identify

resulting from rac reviews and denials are appealable and pursue reversal adverse determinations 
appropriate appeal levels currently there are significant delays the assignment new medicare appeals 
administrative law judges according the office medicare hearings and appeals the average processing 
time fiscal year was nearly two and half years hhs has finalized rules intended streamline the

significant delays appealing any rac payment denials ease the backlog appeals cms has made 
available administrative settlement process for disputed claims offering pay the net allowable

accountable care organizations with the aim reducing healthcare costs improving quality and 
operational efficiency acos are gaining traction both the public and private sectors aco network 
providers and suppliers including hospitals physicians and other designated professionals which work together 
invest infrastructure and redesign delivery processes achieve high quality and efficient delivery 
services acos are intended produce savings result improved quality and operational efficiency 
pursuant the affordable care act hhs established medicare shared savings program that seeks promote 
accountability and coordination care through the creation acos medicare approved acos that achieve

bundled payment initiatives the cms innovation center responsible for establishing demonstration 
projects and other initiatives order identify develop test and encourage the adoption new methods 
delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the medicare and medicaid programs while 
maintaining improving quality care for example providers participating bundled payment initiatives 
accept accountability for costs and quality care agreeing receive one payment for services provided 
medicare patients for certain medical conditions episodes care rewarding providers for increasing 
quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers costs exceed certain amount bundled payment models 
are intended lead higher quality more coordinated care lower cost the medicare program the cms 
innovation center has implemented voluntary bundled payment program known the bundled payment for 
care improvement bpci initiative are participating bpci initiatives eleven our markets more 
recently the cms innovation center has established mandatory bundled payment programs for hospitals 
selected geographic areas including some our hospitals these mandatory initiatives focus orthopedic and 
cardiac care 
supply contracts 
march began purchasing items primarily medical supplies medical equipment and 
pharmaceuticals under agreement with healthtrust gpo which are noncontrolling partner 
december had ownership interest healthtrust participating this organization 
are able procure items competitively priced rates for our hospitals there can assurance that our 
arrangement with healthtrust will continue provide the discounts that have historically received 
competition 
the hospital industry highly competitive important part our business strategy continue acquire 
hospitals non urban markets and selected urban markets however other for profit hospital companies and 
not for profit hospital systems generally attempt acquire the same type hospitals addition some 
hospitals are sold through auction process which may result higher purchase prices than believe are 
reasonable 
addition the competition face for acquisitions must also compete with other hospitals and 
healthcare providers for patients the competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients 
has intensified recent years the majority our hospitals are located non urban service areas which 
are the sole provider general acute care health services those hospitals non urban service areas face 
direct competition because there are other hospitals their primary service areas however these hospitals 
face competition from hospitals outside their primary service area including hospitals urban areas that 
provide more complex services patients those service areas may travel these other hospitals for variety 
reasons including the need for services not offer physician referrals patients who are required seek 
services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences those hospitals for services 
provide those hospitals selected urban service areas may face competition from hospitals that are more 
established than our hospitals certain these competing facilities offer services including extensive medical 
research and medical education programs which are not offered our facilities addition certain markets 
where operate there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities equipment and 
services that may not available our hospitals also face competition from other specialized care 
providers including outpatient surgery orthopedic oncology and diagnostic centers some competitors are 
implementing physician alignment strategies such employing physicians acquiring physician practice groups 
and participating acos other clinical integration models believe that will continue face 
increased competition outpatient service models that become more integrated through acquisitions 
partnerships between physicians specialized care providers and managed care payors 
most markets which are not the sole provider general acute care health services our primary 
competitor not for profit hospital these hospitals are owned tax supported governmental agencies notfor profit entities supported endowments and charitable contributions these hospitals not pay income 
property taxes and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax these financial advantages may 
better position such hospitals maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment 
and offer services more specialized than those available our hospitals 
the number and quality the physicians hospital staff important factor hospital competitive 
position physicians decide whether patient admitted the hospital and the procedures performed 
admitting physicians may the medical staffs other hospitals addition those our hospitals 
attempt attract our physicians patients our hospitals offering quality services and facilities convenient 
locations and state the art equipment addition cms publicizes its hospital compare website data that 
hospitals submit connection with medicare reimbursement claims including performance data related 
quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys federal law provides for the future expansion the number 
quality measures that must reported additional quality measures and other future trends toward clinical 
transparency may have potential impact our competitive position and patient volumes ways that are 
unable predict addition hospitals must either make public list their standard charges their policies 
for allowing the public view list these charges response inquiry

centralizing many support functions however cannot certain whether and what extent additional 
operating improvements and efficiencies connection with the hma merger will achieved the future 
addition operational improvement some the hma hospitals has been more difficult achieve than 
anticipated moreover costs associated with hma legal proceedings and other loss contingencies may 
greater than expected and could exceed the amount any reduction payment under the contingent value

the future there could adverse impact our financial position results operations and liquidity 
particular government investigations well qui tam lawsuits may lead significant fines penalties 
damages payments other sanctions including exclusion from government healthcare programs settlements 
lawsuits involving medicare and medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate 
integrity agreements each which could have adverse effect our business financial condition results 
operations and cash flows 
the impact past acquisitions well potential future acquisitions could have negative effect our 
operations 
our business strategy has historically included growth acquisitions however not for profit hospital 
systems and other for profit hospital companies generally attempt acquire the same type hospitals 
lifepoint health inc principal competitor for acquisitions other competitors include hca holdings inc 
universal health services inc other non public for profit hospitals and local market hospitals some the 
competitors for our acquisitions have greater financial resources than have furthermore some hospitals are 
sold through auction process which may result higher purchase prices than believe are reasonable 
therefore may not able acquire additional hospitals terms favorable 
addition many the hospitals have acquired have had lower operating margins than and 
operating losses incurred prior the time acquired them hospitals acquired the future may have similar 
financial performance issues the past have experienced delays improving the operating margins 
effectively integrating the operations certain acquired hospitals the future are unable improve the 
operating margins acquired hospitals operate them profitably effectively integrate their operations our 
results operations and business may adversely affected 
moreover hospitals that have acquired the future could acquire may have unknown contingent 
liabilities including liabilities for failure comply with healthcare laws and regulations although generally 
seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters may nevertheless have material liabilities for past 
activities acquired hospitals 
are unable complete divestitures that are currently contemplated our results operations and 
financial condition could adversely affected 
noted above have been implementing portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy divesting 
hospitals and non hospital businesses that are attractive strategic and other buyers generally these businesses 
are not one our strategically beneficial service areas are less complementary our business strategy and 
have lower operating margins however there assurance that these contemplated dispositions will 
completed will completed within our contemplated timeframe will completed terms favorable 
terms sufficient allow achieve our deleveraging strategy additionally the results operations for 
these hospitals plan divest and the potential gains losses the sales those businesses may adversely 
affect our profitability moreover may incur asset impairment charges related divestitures that reduce our 
profitability 
addition after entering into definitive agreement may subject the satisfaction pre closing 
conditions well necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which not satisfied obtained may 
prevent from completing the sale dispositions may also involve continued financial exposure related the 
divested business such through indemnities retained obligations that present risk 
our planned divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include 
diversion management attention from improving existing operations additional restructuring charges and the 
related impact from separating personnel renegotiating contracts and restructuring financial and other systems 
adverse effects existing business relationships with patients and third party payors and the potential that the 
collectability any patient accounts receivable retained from any divested hospital may adversely impacted 
any these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results operations 
state efforts regulate the construction acquisition expansion healthcare facilities could limit our 
ability build acquire additional healthcare facilities renovate our facilities expand the breadth 
services offer 
some states which operate require con other prior approval for the construction acquisition 
healthcare facilities capital expenditures exceeding prescribed amount changes bed capacity services and 
some other matters evaluating proposal these states consider the need for additional expanded healthcare 
facilities services are not able obtain required cons other prior approvals would not able 
acquire operate replace expand our facilities expand the breadth services offer furthermore 
con other prior approval upon which relied invest construction replacement expanded facility 
were revoked lost through appeal process may not able recover the value our investment 
state efforts regulate the sale hospitals operated municipal not for profit entities could prevent 
from acquiring these types hospitals 
many states have adopted legislation regarding the sale other disposition hospitals operated municipal 
not for profit entities some states that not have specific legislation the attorneys general have 
demonstrated interest these transactions under their general obligation protect the use charitable assets 
these legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily the appropriate valuation the assets divested 
and the use the proceeds the sale the non profit seller while these review and some instances 
approval processes can add additional time the closing hospital acquisition have not had any 
significant difficulties delays completing acquisitions however future state actions could seriously delay 
even prevent our ability acquire hospitals once return our acquisition strategy 
are unable effectively compete for patients local residents could use other hospitals and healthcare 
providers 
the healthcare industry highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients 
affiliations with physicians and acquisitions the competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for 
patients has intensified recent years however the majority our hospitals are located non urban service 
areas where believe are the sole provider general acute care health services result the most 
significant competition our hospitals face typically comes from hospitals outside our primary service areas 
including hospitals urban areas that provide more complex services patients our primary service areas may 
travel these other hospitals because physician referrals their need for services not offer among 
other reasons patients who receive services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences 
those hospitals for the services provide competition for patients also increasing among other healthcare 
providers including outpatient surgery orthopedic oncology and diagnostic centers our hospitals and our 
competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies such acquiring physician practice groups 
employing physicians and participating acos other clinical integration models which may impact our 
competitive position 
december our hospitals competed with more than one other hospital their respective 
primary service areas most markets which are not the sole provider general acute care health 
services our primary competitor municipal not for profit hospital these hospitals are owned taxsupported governmental agencies not for profit entities supported endowments and charitable 
contributions they not pay income property taxes and can make capital expenditures without paying sales 
tax these financial advantages may better position these hospitals maintain more modern and technologically 
upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available our hospitals our 
competitors are better able attract patients with these offerings may experience overall decline 
patient volume 
trends toward clinical transparency and value based purchasing may have unanticipated impact our 
competitive position and patient volumes the cms hospital compare website makes available the public 
certain data that hospitals submit connection with medicare reimbursement claims including performance data 
related quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys federal law provides for the future expansion the 
number quality measures that must reported further every hospital must establish and update annually 
public listing the hospital standard charges for items and services publish its policies for allowing the 
public view list these charges response inquiry any our hospitals achieve poor results 
results that are lower than our competitors these quality measures patient satisfaction surveys our 
standard charges are higher than our competitors may attract fewer patients 
expect these competitive trends continue are unable compete effectively with other hospitals 
and other healthcare providers local residents may seek healthcare services providers other than our hospitals 
and affiliated businesses 
the failure obtain our medical supplies favorable prices could cause our operating results decline 
have participation agreement with healthtrust gpo the current term this agreement expires 
january with automatic renewal terms one year unless either party terminates giving notice nonrenewal gpos attempt obtain favorable pricing medical supplies with manufacturers and vendors 
sometimes negotiating exclusive supply arrangements exchange for discounts the extent these exclusive 
supply arrangements are challenged deemed unenforceable could incur higher costs for our medical 
supplies obtained through healthtrust further costs supplies and drugs may continue increase due 
market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product releases higher costs could continue 
adversely impact our operating results also there can assurance that our arrangement with healthtrust

are unable predict the ultimate impact the affordable care act and our business may adversely 
affected the affordable care act repealed entirely provisions benefitting our operations are 
significantly modified 
recent years the congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed large number 
proposals and legislation designed make major changes the healthcare system including changes that 
increased access health insurance the most prominent these efforts the affordable care act affects how 
healthcare services are covered delivered and reimbursed currently structured the affordable care act 
mandates that substantially all citizens maintain health insurance coverage expands health insurance 
coverage through combination public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
reduces medicare reimbursement hospitals and promotes value based purchasing there are currently several 
public and private initiatives that aim transition payment models from passive volume based reimbursement 
models that are tied the quality and value services 
the federal elections resulted new administration that along with certain members congress 
have stated their intent repeal make significant changes the affordable care act its implementation and 
its interpretation there uncertainty regarding whether when and how the affordable care act will 
changed what alternative provisions any will enacted the timing enactment and implementation 
alternative provisions and the impact alternative provisions providers well other healthcare industry 
participants addition presidential executive order has been signed that directs agencies minimize 
economic and regulatory burdens the affordable care act but unclear how this will implemented 
further congress could eliminate alter provisions beneficial while leaving place provisions reducing 
our reimbursement government efforts repeal change the affordable care act may have adverse effect 
our business results operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity 
reimbursement rates paid federal state healthcare programs commercial payors are reduced 
are unable maintain favorable contract terms with payors comply with our payor contract obligations 
insured individuals move insurance plans with greater coverage exclusions narrower networks 
insurance coverage otherwise restricted our net operating revenues may decline 
our operating revenues net contractual allowances and discounts but before the 
provision for bad debts came from the medicare and medicaid programs federal healthcare expenditures 
continue increase and state governments continue face budgetary shortfalls result current economic 
conditions and increasing medicaid enrollment result such events and also pursuant the affordable 
care act federal and state governments have made and continue make significant changes the medicare 
and medicaid programs including reductions reimbursement levels and supplemental payment programs like 
disproportionate share payments some these changes have decreased could decrease the amount money 
receive for our services relating these programs 
addition government and commercial payors well other third parties from whom receive payment 
for our services attempt control healthcare costs for example requiring hospitals discount payments for 
their services exchange for exclusive preferred participation their benefit plans restricting coverage 
through utilization review reducing coverage inpatient services and shifting care outpatient settings 
requiring prior authorizations and implementing alternative payment models the ability commercial payors 
control healthcare costs using these measures may enhanced the increasing consolidation insurance 
and managed care companies 
our operating revenues net contractual allowances and discounts but before the 
provision for bad debts came from commercial payors our contracts with payors require comply with 
number terms related the provision services and billing for services are unable negotiate 
increased reimbursement rates maintain existing rates other favorable contract terms effectively respond 
payor cost controls comply with the terms our payor contracts the payments receive for our services 
may reduced may involved disputes with payors and experience payment denials both 
prospectively and retroactively addition some individuals may move from existing coverage under health 
insurance plans with higher reimbursement rates for our services and lower pays and deductibles plans 
such those purchased the health insurance exchanges that may provide for lower reimbursement for our 
services along with higher pays and deductibles even exclusion our hospitals and employed physicians 
from coverage 
the demand for services provided our hospitals can impacted factors beyond our control 
our admissions and adjusted admissions well acuity trends may impacted factors beyond our 
control for example seasonal fluctuations the severity influenza and other critical illnesses unplanned 
shutdowns unavailability our facilities due weather other unforeseen events decreases trends 
high acuity service offerings changes competition from outside service providers turnover physicians 
affiliated with our hospitals changes medical technology can have impact the demand for services 
our hospitals the impact these other factors beyond our control could have adverse effect our 
business financial position and results operations 
may adversely affected consolidation among health insurers 
recent years number health insurers have merged increased efforts consolidate with other payors 
well providers part result the insurance industry challenges resulting from the affordable care 
act our ability negotiate prices and favorable terms with health insurers certain markets could affected 
negatively result this consolidation also the shift toward value based payment models could 
accelerated larger insurers find these models financially beneficial cannot predict whether will 
able respond effectively the impact increased consolidation the payor industry 
fail comply with extensive laws and government regulations including fraud and abuse laws 
could suffer penalties required make significant changes our operations 
the healthcare industry governed laws and regulations the federal state and local government levels 
these laws and regulations include standards addressing among other issues the adequacy medical care

environmental protection and privacy and security examples these laws include but are not limited 
hipaa the stark law the federal anti kickback statute the fca the emergency medical treatment and active 
labor act and similar state laws fail comply with applicable laws and regulations could suffer civil 
sanctions and criminal penalties including the loss our operating licenses and our ability participate the 
medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
addition there are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts both federal and state 
government agencies relating the healthcare industry including the hospital segment recent enforcement 
actions have focused financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians billing for services without 
adequately documenting medical necessity and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such 
services specific our hospitals have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental 
agencies regarding these and other matters and are also subject various claims and lawsuits relating 
such matters for further discussion these matters see legal proceedings part item this

since the implementation the affordable care act our self pay revenues percentage total revenue 
have decreased primarily resulting from shift from self pay medicaid and private insurers for portion 
our patient population driven the insurance coverage expansion provisions the affordable care act 
however the outcome the federal elections has cast considerable uncertainty the future the 
affordable care act addition difficult predict the ultimate impact the affordable care act the 
uninsured population and the percentage our total revenue comprised self pay revenues because among 
other variables uncertainty regarding the number and identity states that ultimately choose expand 
medicaid and the number uninsured who elect purchase health insurance moreover may still 
adversely affected the growth patient responsibility accounts result increases the adoption plan 
structures including health savings accounts narrow networks and tiered networks which shift greater 
responsibility for care individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts further 
our ability collect patient responsibility accounts may limited statutory regulatory and investigatory 
initiatives including private lawsuits directed hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and 
underinsured patients addition deterioration economic conditions the united states could potentially 
lead higher levels uninsured patients result higher levels patients covered lower paying government

while the economy whole has improved improvement many the non urban communities 
which operate has lagged behind the larger urban communities addition the economies the non urban 
communities which our hospitals primarily operate are often dependent small number large employers 
especially manufacturing other facilities these employers often provide income and health insurance for 
disproportionately large number community residents who may depend our hospitals for care the failure 
one more large employers the closure substantial reduction the number individuals employed 
manufacturing other facilities located near many the non urban communities which our hospitals 
primarily operate could cause affected employees move elsewhere for employment lose insurance coverage

pandemic other public health crisis were affect our markets our business could adversely affected 
such crisis could diminish the public trust healthcare facilities especially hospitals that fail accurately 
timely diagnose that are treating have treated patients affected contagious diseases any our 
facilities were involved treating patients for such contagious disease other patients might cancel elective 
procedures fail seek needed care our facilities further pandemic might adversely impact our business 
causing temporary shutdown diversion patients disrupting delaying production and delivery 
materials and products the supply chain causing staffing shortages our facilities although have 
disaster plans place and operate pursuant infectious disease protocols the potential impact pandemic 
epidemic outbreak contagious disease with respect our markets our facilities difficult predict 
and could adversely impact our business 
our performance depends our ability recruit and retain quality physicians 
although employ some physicians physicians are often not employees our healthcare facilities which 
they practice the success our healthcare facilities depends part the number and quality the physicians 
the medical staffs our healthcare facilities our ability employ quality physicians the admitting and 
utilization practices employed and independent physicians maintaining good relations with those physicians 
and controlling costs related the employment physicians many the markets serve many physicians 
have admitting privileges other healthcare facilities addition our healthcare facilities such physicians 
may terminate their affiliation with employment our healthcare facilities any time are unable 
provide adequate support personnel technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs 
those physicians and their patients they may discouraged from referring patients our facilities admissions 
may decrease and our operating performance may decline 
our labor costs could adversely affected competition for staffing the shortage experienced nurses and 
labor union activity 
addition our physicians the operations our hospitals are dependent the efforts abilities and 
experience our management and medical support personnel such nurses pharmacists and lab technicians 
compete with other healthcare providers recruiting and retaining qualified management and support 
personnel responsible for the daily operations our hospitals including nurses and other non physician 
healthcare professionals some markets the availability nurses and other medical support personnel has 
been significant operating issue healthcare providers may required continue enhance wages and 
benefits recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel hire more expensive temporary 
contract personnel addition the states which operate could adopt mandatory nurse staffing ratios 
could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already place state mandated nurse staffing ratios could 
significantly affect labor costs and have adverse impact revenues are required limit admissions 
order meet the required ratios 
increased ongoing labor union activity another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs 
otherwise adversely impact the extent significant portion our employee base unionizes our labor costs 
could increase significantly addition when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions whether 
such agreements are renewals first contracts there the possibility that strikes could occur during the 
negotiation process and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs and otherwise 
adversely impact 
our labor costs increase may not able raise rates offset these increased costs because 
significant percentage our revenues consists fixed prospective payments our ability pass along increased 
labor costs constrained the event are not entirely effective recruiting and retaining qualified 
management nurses and other medical support personnel controlling labor costs this could have 
adverse effect our results operations 
the industry trend towards value based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues 
the trend toward value based purchasing healthcare services gaining momentum across the healthcare 
industry among both government and commercial payors generally value based purchasing initiatives tie 
payment the quality and efficiency care for example hospital payments may negatively impacted the 
occurrence hacs the hospitals with the worst national risk adjusted hac rates for all hospitals 
the previous year receive reduction their total medicare payments medicare does not reimburse for care 
related hacs addition federal funds may not used under the medicaid program reimburse providers 
for services provided treat hacs hospitals that experience excess readmissions for designated conditions 
receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges hhs also reduces medicare inpatient hospital payments 
for all discharges required percentage and pools the amount collected from these reductions fund 
payments reward hospitals that meet exceed certain quality performance standards further medicare and 
medicaid require hospitals report certain quality data receive full reimbursement updates 
hhs has indicated that particularly focused tying medicare payments quality value through 
alternative payment models which generally aim make providers attentive the quality and cost care they 
deliver patients examples alternative payment models include acos and bundled payment arrangements 
hhs currently requires hospitals certain geographic areas participate bundled payment program for 
specified joint replacement procedures and will implement mandatory program with cardiac focus 
hhs may increasingly establish similar mandatory programs unclear whether alternative payment models 
will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs whether they will decrease aggregate reimbursement 
several the nation largest commercial payors have also expressed intent increase reliance valuebased reimbursement arrangements further many large commercial payors require hospitals report quality 
data and several commercial payors not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events 
expect value based purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement patient 
outcome measures become more common and involve higher percentage reimbursement amounts 
are unable this time predict how this trend will affect our results operations but could negatively 
impact our revenues our cost operations both 
our revenues are somewhat concentrated small number states which will make particularly sensitive 
regulatory and economic changes those states 
our revenues are particularly sensitive regulatory and economic changes states which generate 
significant portion our revenues including florida pennsylvania texas indiana and tennessee accordingly 
any change the current demographic economic competitive regulatory conditions these states could have 
adverse effect our business financial condition results operations changes the medicaid programs 
these states could also have adverse effect our business financial condition results operations cash 
flows for example the texas medicaid waiver program provides funding for uncompensated care and delivery 
system reform initiatives and allows texas continue receiving supplemental medicaid reimbursement while 
expanding its medicaid managed care program cms has extended the waiver through december 
texas has submitted application extend its medicaid waiver program through september but 
cms has not yet issued decision cannot predict whether the texas medicaid waiver program will 
extended continue its current form guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease 
addition some our hospitals florida texas and other areas along the gulf coast are located 
hurricane prone areas the past hurricanes have had disruptive effect the operations our hospitals 
florida texas and other coastal states and the patient populations those states our business activities could 
harmed particularly active hurricane season even single storm and the property insurance obtain 
may not adequate cover losses from future hurricanes other natural disasters

the congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed large number proposals and 
legislation designed make major changes the healthcare system including changes that increased access 
health insurance the affordable care act currently structured mandates that substantially all citizens 
maintain health insurance and increases health insurance coverage through combination public program 
expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
this expansion medicaid coverage and private sector health insurance remains effect believe this 
expansion would over time result increase the number patients using our facilities who have health 
insurance coverage expect this would increase our reimbursement related providing services individuals 
who were previously uninsured which would reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable 
operate hospitals five the ten states that experienced the largest reductions uninsured rates among adult 
residents between and the states with the greatest reductions the number uninsured adult residents 
have expanded medicaid number states have opted out the medicaid coverage expansion provisions but 
could ultimately decide expand their programs later date the states which operated hospitals that 
were included continuing operations december states have taken action expand their 
medicaid programs including louisiana which initiated medicaid coverage expansion july this 
time the other states have not including florida tennessee and texas where operated significant number 
hospitals december some states that have opted out are evaluating options such waiver plans 
operate alternative medicaid expansion plan failure expand medicaid implement effective alternative 
these states will likely have negative impact the goal reducing the number uninsured individuals 
the affordable care act makes number changes medicare and medicaid such reductions the 
medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years through productivity offset the 
medicare market basket update and reduction the medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital 
payments each which could adversely impact the reimbursement received under these programs 
the affordable care act also includes provisions aimed reducing fraud waste and abuse the healthcare 
industry amends several existing federal laws including the anti kickback statute and the false claims act 
make easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs prevail lawsuits brought against healthcare 
providers and for potentially severe fines and penalties imposed healthcare providers that violate 
applicable laws and regulations 
the various provisions the affordable care act that directly indirectly affect reimbursement take effect 
over number years believe that the affordable care act has had positive impact net operating 
revenues and income from continuing operations the result the expansion private sector and medicaid 
coverage that has occurred however other provisions the affordable care act such requirements related 
employee health insurance coverage have increased our operating costs addition the affordable care act 
has made changes medicare and medicaid reimbursement that could adversely impact the reimbursement 
receive under these programs these changes include reductions the medicare annual market basket update for 
federal fiscal years through productivity offset the medicare market basket update and 
reductions the medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments each these changes could 
adversely impact the reimbursement 
while the affordable care act remains effect difficult predict the ultimate effect the statute due 
executive orders clarifications and modifications resulting from the rule making process future judicial 
interpretations resulting from court challenges its constitutionality and interpretation whether and how many 
states ultimately decide expand medicaid coverage the number uninsured who elect purchase health 
insurance coverage and budgetary issues federal and state levels may not able fully realize the 
positive impact the affordable care act may otherwise have our business results operations cash flow 
capital resources and liquidity furthermore cannot predict whether will able modify certain aspects 
our operations offset any potential adverse consequences from the affordable care act 
described herein the future the affordable care act uncertain following the federal elections 
the impact and timing any potential repeal changes the affordable care act and any alternative 
provisions our business unknown 
the federal government has implemented number regulations and programs designed promote the use 
electronic health records ehr technology and pursuant the health information technology for 
economic and clinical health act hitech established requirements for medicare and medicaid incentive 
payments program for eligible hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified ehr 
technology these payments are available for maximum period five six years depending the program 
our hospital facilities have been implementing ehr technology facility facility basis since 
recognize incentive reimbursement related the medicare medicaid incentives are able implement 
the certified ehr technology and meet the defined meaningful use criteria and information from completed 
cost report periods available from which calculate the incentive reimbursement the timing recognizing 
incentive reimbursement does not correlate with the timing recognizing operating expenses and incurring 
capital costs connection with the implementation ehr technology which may result material period toperiod changes our future results operations 
october eligible hospitals and january professionals that have not demonstrated 
meaningful use certified ehr technology and have not applied and qualified for hardship exception are 
subject payment adjustments eligible hospitals are subject reduced market basket update the inpatient 
prospective payment system standardized amount and for each subsequent fiscal year eligible 
professionals are subject per year cumulative reduction applied the medicare physician fee schedule 
amount for covered professional services subject cap payment adjustments for eligible professionals 
failing demonstrate meaningful use will longer applicable beginning when the program 
scheduled replaced mips 
although believe that our hospital facilities are currently compliance with the meaningful use standards 
there can assurance that all our facilities will remain compliance and therefore not subject the 
hitech payment reductions recognized approximately million million and million during 
the years ended december and respectively for hitech incentive reimbursements from 
medicare and medicaid related certain our hospitals and for certain our employed physicians which are 
presented reduction operating expenses our hospital facilities and affiliated professionals have 
achieved substantial compliance with the hitech standards and continue complete the maximum time period 
for receiving incentive payments the amount incentive reimbursements will continue decline 
result our current levels cash available borrowing capacity long term outlook our debt 
repayments the refinancing our term loans and our continued projection our ability generate cash flows 
anticipate that will able invest the necessary capital our business over the next twelve months 
believe there continues ample opportunity for growth substantially all our markets decreasing the 
need for patients travel outside their communities for healthcare services furthermore will continue 
strive improve operating efficiencies and procedures order improve our profitability all our

reimbursement legislative and regulatory changes 
ongoing legislative and regulatory efforts could reduce otherwise adversely affect the payments receive 
from medicare and medicaid within the statutory framework the medicare and medicaid programs including 
programs currently unaffected the affordable care act there are substantial areas subject administrative 
rulings interpretations and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs and the 
federal and state governments might the future reduce the funds available under those programs require 
more stringent utilization and quality reviews hospital facilities additionally there may continued rise 
managed care programs and additional restructuring the financing and delivery healthcare the united

contractual allowances are automatically calculated and recorded through our internally developed automated 
contractual allowance system within the automated system payors historical paid claims data are utilized 
calculate the contractual allowances this data automatically updated monthly basis all hospital 
contractual allowance calculations are subjected monthly review management ensure reasonableness and 
accuracy account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard

revenues net contractual allowances and discounts the process estimating contractual allowances 
requires estimate the amount expected received based payor contract provisions the key 
assumption this process the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage which based payor 
classification and historical paid claims data our automated contractual allowance system does not maintain the 
contractual allowance the patient account level estimates average contractual allowance payor 
classification due the complexities involved these estimates actual payments receive could different 
from the amounts estimate and record the actual contractual reimbursement percentage under government 
programs and managed care contracts differed december from our estimated reimbursement 
percentage net loss income for the year ended december would have changed approximately

goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess the fair value the consideration conveyed the acquisition over the fair 
value net assets acquired goodwill evaluated for impairment the same time every year and when event 
occurs circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value the reporting unit below its 
carrying value there two step method for determining goodwill impairment step one compare the fair 
value the reporting unit with the unit carrying amount including goodwill this test indicates the fair value 
less than the carrying value then step two required compare the implied fair value the reporting unit 
goodwill with the carrying value the reporting unit goodwill our most recent annual goodwill evaluation 
was performed during the fourth quarter 
during the year ended december allocated approximately million goodwill the spinoff qhc including approximately million goodwill related the former management services

while impairment was indicated this evaluation the reduction our fair value and the resulting 
goodwill impairment charge recorded during reduced the excess fair value calculated the step two 
analysis over the carrying value our hospital operations reporting unit amount less than our 
carrying value this minimal amount the excess fair value over carrying value our hospital operations

outside counsel and experts not accrue for costs that are part our corporate overhead such the costs 
our house legal and risk management departments the losses resulting from professional liability claims

our processes for obtaining and analyzing claims and incident data are standardized across all our hospitals 
and have been consistent for many years monitor the outcomes the medical care services that provide 
and for each reported claim obtain various information concerning the facts and circumstances related that 
claim addition routinely monitor current key statistics and volume indicators our assessment 
utilizing historical trends the average lag period between claim occurrence and payment final settlement 
between four and five years although the facts and circumstances individual claims could result the timing 
such payments being different from this average since claims are paid promptly after settlement with the 
claimant reached settled claims represent approximately the total liability the end any period 
for purposes estimating our individual claim accruals utilize specific claim information including the 
nature the claim the expected claim amount the year which the claim occurred and the laws the 
jurisdiction which the claim occurred once the case accruals for known claims are determined information 
stratified loss layers and retentions accident years reported years geography and claims relating the 
acquired hma hospitals versus claims relating our other hospitals several actuarial methods are used against 
this data produce estimates ultimate paid losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims each 
these methods uses our company specific historical claims data and other information this company specific 
data includes information regarding our business including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
historical and current case loss reserves actual and projected hospital statistical data variety hospital census 
information employed physician information professional liability retentions for each policy year geographic 
information and other data 
based these analyses determine our estimate the professional liability claims the determination 
management estimate including the preparation the reserve analysis that supports such estimate involves 
subjective judgment management changes reserving data the trends and factors that influence reserving 
data may signal fundamental shifts our future claim development patterns may simply reflect single period 
anomalies even change reflects fundamental shift the full extent the change may not become evident 
until years later moreover since our methods and models use different types data and select our liability 
from the results all these methods typically cannot quantify the precise impact such factors our

individual claims could result the timing such payments being different from this average since claims

information stratified loss layers and retentions accident years reported years geography and claims

estimate involves subjective judgment the management changes reserving data the trends and factors 
that influence reserving data may signal fundamental shifts the company future claim development patterns 
may simply reflect single period anomalies even change reflects fundamental shift the full extent the 
change may not become evident until years later moreover since the company methods and models use 
different types data and the company selects its liability from the results all these methods typically 
cannot quantify the precise impact such factors its estimates the liability due the company
