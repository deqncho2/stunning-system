models toward value based capitated payment models that are designed incentivize value and quality individual patient level the number 
americans covered capitated payment programs care programs wherein organization financially responsible for the healthcare population 
patients for which the total compensation fixed other than adjustments for factors including specifically how sick individual patients are how much 
resource needed applied spent each patient what the quality the clinical care and other demographic factors continues increase 
according industry sources and our internal estimates this increase expected further drive the critical importance accurately measure analyze 
report and improve patient disease and comorbidity conditions utilization rates and clinical quality outcomes further this shift from volume based

affordable health insurance together with ongoing statutory and budgetary policy developments federal level this health care reform legislation could 
include changes medicare and medicaid payment policies and other health care delivery administrative reforms that could potentially negatively impact

registry dataset metrics and trailing month pam each which presented the table are key operating metrics that management uses 
assess our level operational activity while believe that each these metrics indicative our overall level analytical activity and the 
underlying growth our business increases decreases these metrics not necessarily correlate proportional increases decreases revenue 
net income for instance although increased levels analytical activity historically have corresponded increases revenue over the long term 
differences fees charged for different analytical packages exist and differences how analytics trigger the applicability 
table contents 
our data driven intervention platforms may result increases analytical activity that not result proportional increases revenue net 
income and vice versa accordingly while believe the presentation these operating metrics helpful investors understanding our business 
these metrics have limitations and should not considered substitutes for analysis our financial results reported under generally accepted 
accounting principles gaap addition believe that other companies including companies our industry not present similar operating 
metrics and that there commonly accepted method calculating these metrics which may reduce their usefulness comparative measures 
unique patient count defined each unique longitudinally matched identified natural person represented our registry the end 
the period presented 
medical event count defined the total number discrete medical events the end the period presented for example discrete medical event 
typically results from the presentation patient physician for the diagnosis diabetes and congestive heart failure single visit the 
presentation patient emergency department for chest pain etc

used the metric analytical process distinct set data calculations undertaken which initiated and completed our analytical

the underlying data counts within our datasets the ongoing investment innovation and our level analytical activity additionally there are several 
factors that influence our growth and performance that are less quantitatively driven including seasonality macro economic forces and trends within 
healthcare such payment models incentivization and regulatory oversight that can driven changes federal and state laws and regulations

directly translate changes financial performance our business differences fees charged for different analytical packages exist and differences 
how analytics trigger the applicability our data driven intervention platforms may result increases analytical activity that not result 
proportional increases revenue net income and vice versa therefore situations which new engagement initiated for analytical processes that 
have higher than average fee rate revenue could expand disproportionately faster than the increase pam likewise engagements for analytical 
processes that have higher than average fee rate are concluded then such conclusions can negatively affect revenue disproportionately more than pam
