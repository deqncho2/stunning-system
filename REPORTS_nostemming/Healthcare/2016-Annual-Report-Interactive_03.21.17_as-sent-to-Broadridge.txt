section the internal revenue code amended generally limits the tax deductibility 
compensation paid certain highly compensated executive officers excess million the year the compensation 
otherwise would deductible the company there exception the limit deductibility for performance based 
compensation that meets certain requirements the committee considers the impact this rule when developing and 
implementing our executive compensation program light the overall compensation philosophy and objectives the 
committee seeks balance the tax accounting eps and dilutive impact executive compensation practices with the need 
attract retain and motivate highly qualified executives although the committee does design certain components its 
executive compensation program seek full deductibility the committee believes the interests stockholders are best 
served not restricting the committee discretion and flexibility crafting compensation programs even though such 
programs may result certain nondeductible compensation expenses accordingly have not adopted policy that all 
compensation must qualify deductible under section the code amounts paid under any our compensation 
programs including salaries bonuses and awards options restricted stock and other equity based compensation may

competition 
inpatient rehabilitation the inpatient rehabilitation industry outside our leading position highly fragmented our 
inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units many which are within acute care hospitals 
the markets serve for list our markets state see the table item properties there are some smaller privately 
held companies that compete with primarily select geographic markets texas and the west addition there are two 
public companies that are primarily focused other post acute care services but also own operate between and 
inpatient rehabilitation facilities each one which also manages the operations inpatient rehabilitation facilities part 
its business model other providers post acute care services may attempt become competitors the future for example 
over the past few years the number nursing homes marketing themselves offering certain rehabilitation services has 
increased even though nursing homes are not required offer the same level care licensed hospitals also acute 
care hospitals including those owned operated large public companies not for profits that have dominant positions 
specific markets may choose expand their post acute rehabilitation services the primary competitive factors any given 
market include the quality care and service provided the treatment outcomes achieved and the relationship and reputation

providers likely become increasingly important factor competition see the regulation relationships with 
physicians and other providers section below for further discussion additionally for discussion regarding the effects 
certificate need requirements competition some states see the regulation certificates need section below

fragmented there are more than home health agencies and approximately hospice agencies nationwide certified 
participate medicare encompass the fourth largest provider medicare certified skilled home health services the 
united states for list the encompass home health markets state see the table item properties encompass 
primary competition comes from locally owned private home health companies acute care hospitals with adjunct home 
health services and typically varies from market market providers home health and hospice services include both not forprofit and for profit organizations there are six public companies including with significant presences the home health 
industry the largest which operates long term acute care hospitals inpatient rehabilitation facilities nursing centers and 
assisted living facilities the primary competitive factors any given market include the quality care and service provided 
the treatment outcomes achieved and the relationship and reputation with the acute care hospitals physicians other referral 
sources the market the ability work part integrated care delivery model with other providers likely become 
increasingly important factor competition for example encompass currently the exclusive preferred home health 
provider aco serving approximately patients competing companies may also offer varying home care services 
home health providers with scale which include the other public companies may have competitive advantages including 
professional management efficient operations sophisticated information systems brand recognition and large referral bases 
regulatory and reimbursement challenges 
healthcare has always been highly regulated industry currently the industry facing many well publicized 
regulatory and reimbursement challenges the industry also facing uncertainty associated with the efforts primarily arising 
from initiatives included the patient protection and affordable care act subsequently amended the healthcare 
reform laws identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models january

models such acos bundled payment arrangements the end hhs also set goal tying percent 
traditional medicare payments quality value the end through programs such those that include financial 
incentives for reducing acute care hospital readmissions while not expect the drive toward integrated delivery payment 
models value based purchasing and post acute site neutrality medicare reimbursement reverse there remains significant 
uncertainty around the future healthcare regulation general 
the election president donald trump along with republican majorities the united states senate and house 
representatives increase the likelihood changes repeal provisions the healthcare reform laws through both 
legislative and regulatory action january president trump issued his first executive order titled minimizing the 
economic burden the patient protection and affordable care act pending repeal that directs federal regulators begin 
dismantling those laws through regulatory and policy making processes and procedures the maximum extent permitted 
law any changes may ultimately affect among other things reimbursement healthcare providers and consumers access 
coverage health services including among non medicare aged population segments within commercial insurance markets 
and medicaid enrollees changes may also affect the delivery healthcare services patients providers and the regulatory 
compliance obligations associated with those services 
successful healthcare providers are those who provide high quality cost effective care and have the ability adjust 
changes the regulatory and operating environments believe have the necessary capabilities scale infrastructure 
balance sheet and management adapt and succeed highly regulated industry and have proven track record

healthcare providers sequestration took effect april and will continue through unless congress and the president 
take further action result the elections the future the healthcare reform laws well the nature and

the ordinary course medicare reimbursement claims made healthcare providers including inpatient rehabilitation 
hospitals well home health and hospice agencies are subject audit from time time governmental payors and their 
agents such the medicare administrative contractors macs that act fiscal intermediaries for all medicare billings and 
insurance carriers well the united states department health and human services office inspector general the hhsoig cms and state medicaid programs addition those audits conducted existing macs cms has developed and 
instituted various medicare audit programs under which cms contracts with private companies conduct claims and medical 
record audits some contractors are paid percentage the overpayments recovered one type audit contractor the recovery 
audit contractors racs began post payment audit processes late for providers general the racs receive claims 
data directly from macs monthly quarterly basis rac audits irfs initially focused coding errors but cms 
subsequently expanded the program include medical necessity and billing accuracy reviews 
cms has also established contractors known the zone program integrity contractors zpics these contractors 
are successors the program safeguard contractors and conduct audits with focus potential fraud and abuse issues like 
the racs the zpics conduct audits and have the ability refer matters the hhs oig the united states department

coding and medical necessity coverage rules however despite our belief that our coding and assessment patients are 
accurate audits may lead assertions that have been underpaid overpaid medicare submitted improper claims 
some instances require incur additional costs respond requests for records and defend the validity payments and

basic summary current medicare reimbursement our business segments follows 
inpatient rehabilitation discussed above our hospitals receive fixed payment reimbursement amount per 
discharge under irf pps based the patient rehabilitation impairment category established hhs and other 
characteristics and conditions identified the attending clinicians order qualify for reimbursement under irf pps our 
hospitals must comply with various medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements 
specifications what conditions must met qualify for reimbursement these requirements relate among other 
things pre admission screening post admission evaluations and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role 
physicians ordering and overseeing patient care for example physician must admit each patient and doing determine 
form 
likewise medicare providers like can negatively affected the adoption coverage policies either the 
national local level that determine whether item service covered and under what clinical circumstances 
considered reasonable and necessary for example current cms coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services 
ordered physician and coordinated interdisciplinary team the interdisciplinary team must meet weekly 
review patient status and make any needed adjustments the individualized plan care qualified personnel must provide the 
rehabilitation nursing physical therapy occupational therapy speech language pathology social services psychological 
services and prosthetic and orthotic services that may needed for individual claims medicare contractors make coverage 
determinations regarding medical necessity which can represent more restrictive interpretations the cms coverage rules 
cannot predict how future cms coverage rule interpretations any new local coverage determinations will affect 
that the patient irf treatment reasonable and necessary also each patient admitted irf must able tolerate 
minimum three hours therapy per day once irf patients must have nursing care available hours each day the 
week 
under irf pps cms required adjust the payment rates based market basket index beginning fiscal year 
cms began implementing inpatient irf specific market basket the annual market basket update designed 
reflect changes over time the prices mix goods and services provided rehabilitation hospitals and hospital based 
inpatient rehabilitation units setting annual market basket updates cms uses data furnished the bureau labor 
statistics for price proxy purposes primarily three categories producer price indexes consumer price indexes and 
employment cost indexes with irf pps our hospitals retain the difference any between the fixed payment from medicare 
and their operating costs thus our hospitals benefit from being cost effective providers 
over the last several years changes regulations governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created 
challenges for inpatient rehabilitation providers many these changes have resulted limitations and some cases 
reductions the levels payments healthcare providers for example cms narrowed its rule known the 
rule stipulating that qualify inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the medicare program facility must show that 
certain percentage its patients are treated for least one specified and limited list medical conditions under the 
rule any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed meet its requirements would subject prospective reclassification 
acute care hospital with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services december the medicare 
medicaid and state children health insurance program schip extension act the medicare act was 
signed setting the compliance threshold instead and allowing hospitals continue using patient secondary 
medical conditions comorbidities determine whether patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule 
the modification the compliance threshold significantly reduced the total number medicare irf discharges but 
since setting the threshold the number discharges has grown another example the medicare act included 
elimination the irf pps market basket adjustment for the period from april through september causing 
reduction the pricing services eligible for medicare reimbursement medicare pricing roll back which resulted 
decrease actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases costs 
july cms released its notice final rulemaking for the fiscal year irf pps this rule was

typically have terms between one and three years although have number managed care contracts that automatically 
renew each year with pre defined rate increases unless party elects terminate the contract typical rate increases 
for our inpatient rehabilitation contracts ranged from and for our home health and hospice contracts ranged from 
cannot provide any assurance will continue receive increases the future our managed care staff focuses 
establishing and negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided 
medicaid reimbursement 
medicaid jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits 
qualifying individuals who are deemed unable afford healthcare the medicaid program administered the individual 
states under the oversight cms accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines there are substantial 
differences reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state state many states have experienced shortfalls 
their medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts medicaid reimbursement rates additionally certain states 
control medicaid expenditures through restricting eliminating coverage certain services continuing downward pressure 
medicaid payment rates could cause decline that portion our net operating revenues however for the year ended 
december medicaid payments represented only our consolidated net operating revenues certain states 
which operate are experiencing increase medicaid patients likely the result expanded coverage consistent with 
the intent the healthcare reform laws changes these laws and regulations implemented congress the trump 
administration both could impact expanded medicaid coverage including the number medicaid patients with access

could adversely impact our revenues our profitability 
cost reports 
because our participation medicare medicaid and certain blue cross and blue shield plans are required 
meet certain financial reporting requirements federal and where applicable state regulations require the submission annual 
cost reports covering the revenue costs and expenses associated with the services provided inpatient hospital home health 
and hospice providers medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients these annual cost reports are subject routine audits 
which may result adjustments the amounts ultimately determined due under these reimbursement programs 
these audits are used for determining any under over payments were made these programs and set payment levels 
for future years medicare also makes retroactive adjustments payments for certain low income patients after comparing 
subsequently published statistical data from cms the cost report data cannot predict what retroactive adjustments any 
will made but not anticipate such adjustments would have material impact

licensure and certification 
addition hospitals must certified cms participate the medicare program and generally must certified 
medicaid state agencies participate medicaid programs certification and participation these programs involve 
numerous regulatory obligations for example hospitals must treat least patients free charge prior certification and

failure comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals and agencies the case may 
ineligible for medicare medicaid reimbursement addition medicare medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from 
noncompliant providers otherwise impose sanctions for noncompliance non governmental payors often have the right 
terminate provider contracts the provider loses its medicare medicaid certification 
the healthcare reform laws added new screening requirements and associated fees for all medicare providers 
the screening must include licensure check and may include other procedures such fingerprinting criminal background 
checks unscheduled and unannounced site visits database checks and other screening procedures prescribed cms 
have developed operational systems oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements the

summary certain material risk factors more detailed information concerning other risk factors well those described 
below contained other sections this annual report 
reductions changes reimbursement from government third party payors could adversely affect our net operating 
revenues and other operating results 
derive substantial portion our net operating revenues from the medicare program see item business 
sources revenues for table identifying the sources and relative payor mix our revenues addition many ordinary 
course reimbursement rate changes that the united states department health and human services centers for medicare and 
medicaid services cms adopts each year part its annual rulemaking process for various healthcare provider 
categories congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes laws and regulations 
governing the healthcare system many these changes have resulted limitations the increases and some cases 
significant roll backs reductions the levels payments healthcare providers for services under many government 
reimbursement programs there can assurance that future governmental initiatives will not result pricing roll backs 
freezes reimbursement reductions 
many provisions within the healthcare reform laws have impacted could the future impact our business 
including medicare reimbursement reductions such reductions annual market basket updates providers and 
reimbursement rate rebasing adjustments the promotion bundling initiatives for medicare reimbursement episodes 
care implementation accountable care organizations acos and creation the independent payment advisory 
board 
for our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals these laws include reductions cms annual adjustments medicare 
reimbursement rates what commonly known market basket update accordance with medicare laws and statutes 
cms makes market basket updates provider type there will reduction the annual market basket update for 
our hospitals each the cms fiscal years beginning october and the medicare access and chip 
children health insurance program reauthorization act macra eliminated the mandated annual reduction for 
favor fixing market basket update that year for inpatient rehabilitation home health and hospice 
providers 
addition the healthcare reform laws require the market basket update for our hospitals reduced 
productivity adjustment annual basis except because the changes mandated macra the productivity 
adjustment equals the trailing year average changes annual economy wide private nonfarm business multi factor 
productivity the productivity adjustment effect for fiscal year october september decrease the market 
basket update basis points 
for home health agencies the healthcare reform laws directed cms improve home health payment accuracy 
through rebasing home health payments over four years starting the rebasing adjustment for calendar year the 
final year the phase offset the annual market basket update with reduction cms also implementing 
case mix coding intensity reduction basis points addition the healthcare reform laws also require 
annual home health productivity adjustment for calendar year that adjustment decrease the market basket update 
basis points 
for hospice agencies the healthcare reform laws require addition annual productivity adjustment 
further reduction the annual market basket update basis points for fiscal years and the hospice productivity 
adjustment for the fiscal year beginning october was decrease the market basket update basis points 
other federal legislation can also have significant direct impact our medicare reimbursement august 
president obama signed into law the budget control act which provided for automatic reduction medicare 
program payments this automatic reduction known sequestration which began affecting payments received after april 
form 
march president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act subsequently 
amended the healthcare reform laws the election president donald trump along with republican majorities 
the united states senate and house representatives increase the likelihood changes repeal provisions the 
healthcare reform laws through both legislative and regulatory action january president trump issued his first 
executive order titled minimizing the economic burden the patient protection and affordable care act pending repeal 
that directs federal regulators begin dismantling those laws through regulatory and policy making processes and procedures 
the maximum extent permitted law any changes may ultimately impact the provisions the healthcare reform 
laws discussed below other laws regulations that either currently affect may the future affect our business 
reduced the payments receive under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system the irf pps 
resulting net year over year decrease our net operating revenues approximately million the effect 
sequestration year over year comparisons net operating revenues ceased april however each year through 
the reimbursement receive from medicare after first taking into account all annual payment adjustments including the 
market basket update will reduced sequestration unless repealed before then 
additionally concerns held federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result 
enactment further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program and 
further reductions provider payments for example april the president signed macra into law which 
repealed the statutory mechanism providing for annual automatic adjustments the medicare physician fee schedule using 
sustainable growth rate formula that has historically resulted annual deep cuts physician reimbursement rates 
consequence which has been the called doc fixes passed congress annually since override those automatic 
adjustments the primary impact this act mandated market basket update for rehabilitation 
hospitals well home health and hospice agencies 
october the president signed into law the improving medicare post acute care transformation act 
the impact act the impact act was developed partisan basis the house ways and means and senate 
finance committees and incorporated feedback from healthcare providers and provider organizations that responded the 
committees solicitation post acute payment reform ideas and proposals directs the united states department health 
and human services hhs consultation with healthcare stakeholders implement standardized data collection 
processes for post acute quality and outcome measures although the impact act does not specifically call for the 
development new post acute payment system believe this act will lay the foundation for possible future post acute 
payment policies that would based patients medical conditions and other clinical factors rather than the setting where the 
care provided also referred site neutral reimbursement will also create additional data reporting requirements for 
our hospitals and home health and hospice agencies the precise details these new reporting requirements including timing 
and content will developed and implemented cms through the regulatory process that expect will take place over the 
next several years cannot quantify the potential effects the impact act 
each year the medicare payment advisory commission medpac independent agency advises congress 
issues affecting medicare and makes payment policy recommendations congress for variety medicare payment systems 
including among others the irf pps the home health prospective payment system pps and the hospice prospective 
payment system hospice pps medpac also provides comments cms proposed rules including the prospective 
payment system rules congress not obligated adopt medpac recommendations and based outcomes previous 
years there can assurance congress will adopt medpac recommendations given year however medpac 
recommendations have and could the future become the basis for subsequent legislative regulatory action 
connection with cms final rulemaking for the pps medpac recommended among other things 
legislative changes make the rebasing cuts larger size further reduce margins and the overhaul the pps pay 
providers based patient characteristics lieu the number therapy services furnished medpac also recommended that 
cms not provide for market basket update the irf pps march medpac recommended eliminating the 
market basket update for each the irf pps the pps and the hospice pps for june report mandated 
the impact act medpac set out its evaluation unified payment system for all post acute care pac pps lieu 
separate systems for irfs skilled nursing facilities long term acute care hospitals and home health agencies medpac found 
pac pps feasible and desirable but also suggested many existing regulatory requirements including the irf rule 
discussed below and the requirement for minimum three hours therapy per day should waived part 
implementing pac pps medpac also suggested that ultimately medicare should move from fee for service reimbursement 
more integrated delivery payment models december medpac suggested would recommend reduction 
both inpatient rehabilitation and home health reimbursement for and two year rebasing home health reimbursement 
rates beginning medpac also reiterated increase the outlier payment pool funded reductions base 
medicare payments rates under the irf pps this proposal would adversely affect have relatively low percentage 
outlier patients compared other inpatient rehabilitation providers 
cannot predict what alternative additional deficit reduction initiatives medicare payment reductions postacute care reforms any will ultimately enacted into law the timing effect any initiatives reductions those 
initiatives reductions would addition many ordinary course reimbursement rate changes that cms adopts each year 
part the market basket update rulemaking process for various provider categories even more significantly the future 
healthcare reform generally and the healthcare reform laws specifically uncertain given the results the 
elections the united states while not expect the drive toward integrated delivery payment models value based 
purchasing and post acute site neutrality medicare reimbursement reverse there are well publicized efforts repeal 
various provisions the healthcare reform laws and substitute yet determined healthcare reforms cannot 
predict the nature timing any changes the healthcare reform laws other laws regulations that either 
currently affect may the future affect our business 
there can assurance future governmental action will not result substantial changes material reductions 
our reimbursements similarly may experience material increases our operating costs any given year the net effect 
regulatory changes may result decrease our reimbursement rate and that decrease may occur time when our 
expenses are increasing result there could material adverse effect our business financial position results 
operations and cash flows for additional discussion how are reimbursed medicare see item business regulatory 
and reimbursement challenges and sources revenues medicare reimbursement 
the ongoing evolution the healthcare delivery system including alternative payment models and value based purchasing 
initiatives the united states may significantly affect our business and results operations 
the healthcare industry general facing uncertainty associated with the efforts primarily arising from initiatives 
such payment bundling and acos included the healthcare reform laws identify and implement workable 
coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models integrated delivery payment model hospitals physicians and 
other care providers are reimbursed fashion meant encourage the provision coordinated healthcare more efficient 
patient centered basis these providers are then paid based the overall value and quality determined outcomes the 
services they provide patient rather than the number services they provide while this consistent with our goal and 
proven track record being high quality cost effective provider broad based implementation new delivery payment 
model would represent significant evolution transformation the healthcare industry which may have significant impact 
our business and results operations 
the healthcare reform laws directed hhs examine the feasibility bundling including conducting 
voluntary multi year bundling pilot program test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies there are four project 
types models acute care only acute post acute model post acute only model and acute and physician services 
the initial non risk bearing stage the bundling program phase pilot participants received data from cms care patterns 
and engaged shared learning how improve care the second phase phase requires participants pending contract 
finalization and completion the standard cms program integrity reviews take financial risk for episodes care 
eight our hospitals began participating phase the risk phase model cms voluntary bundled 
payments for care improvement bpci initiative also have several hospitals that have signed participation 
agreements with acute care providers participating model the bpci initiative ten encompass home health agencies 
began participating phase model december home health agencies participate phase 
similarly cms has established per the healthcare reform laws several separate aco programs the largest 
which the medicare shared savings program mssp voluntary aco program which hospitals physicians and other 
care providers pursue the delivery coordinated healthcare more efficient patient centered basis conceptually acos 
receive portion any savings generated above certain threshold from care coordination long benchmarks for the 
quality care are maintained under the mssp there are two different aco tracks from which participants can choose the 
first track allows acos share only the savings the second track requires acos share any savings and losses but 
offers acos greater share any savings realized than the first track offers the aco rules adopted cms are extremely 
complex and remain subject further refinement cms according cms acos will serving patients 
continue evaluate case case basis appropriate aco participation opportunities for our hospitals home health 
agencies and patients date have signed two aco participation agreements for our hospitals encompass has also 
partnered the exclusive preferred home health provider with premier phc aco serving approximately 
medicare patients 
january hhs announced set various goals with respect tying medicare reimbursements alternative 
payment models and value based purchasing specifically hhs set goals tying percent traditional fee for service 
medicare payments quality value through alternative payment models such acos bundled payment arrangements 
the end and tying percent payments those models the end hhs also set goals tying and 
form 
addition there are increasing pressures including result the healthcare reform laws from many 
third party payors control healthcare costs and reduce limit increases reimbursement rates for medical services our 
relationships with managed care and nongovernmental third party payors such health maintenance organizations and 
preferred provider organizations are generally governed negotiated agreements these agreements set forth the amounts 
are entitled receive for our services could adversely affected some the markets where operate are 
unable negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third party payors 
percent traditional medicare payments quality value the end and respectively through programs such 
those that include financial incentives for reducing acute care hospital readmissions given the results the elections 
the united states the future these goals and the means which cms attempts achieve them such continued 
proliferation mandatory bundled payment models are uncertain 
november cms published its final rule establishing the comprehensive care for joint replacement 
cjr payment model this mandatory model holds acute care hospitals accountable for the quality care they deliver 
medicare fee for service beneficiaries for lower extremity joint replacements knees and hips from surgery through 
recovery during the cjr model five year term healthcare providers geographic areas which operate irfs 
will continue paid under existing medicare payment systems however the hospital where the joint replacement takes 
place will held accountable for the quality and costs care for the entire episode care from the time the original 
admission through days after discharge depending the quality and cost performance during the entire episode the 
hospital may receive additional payment required repay medicare portion the episode costs under this model 
hospitals had repayment responsibility downside financial risk for however they have downside risk beginning 
result cms believes acute care hospitals are incented work with physicians and post acute care providers 
ensure beneficiaries receive the coordinated care they need efficient manner acute care hospitals participating the cjr 
model may enter into risk sharing financial arrangements with post acute providers including irfs and home health agencies 
january cms published its final rule providing for the creation and testing three new episode payment 
models epms well modification the cjr model the three new medicare epms are acute myocardial infarction 
model coronary artery bypass graft cabg model and surgical hip femur fracture treatment excluding lower 
extremity joint replacement shfft model most relevant are the mandatory cabg and shfft models which are set 
begin july and continue through the end under these models with the cjr model acute care hospitals 
are financially accountable for the quality and cost episode care which intended incentivize increased 
coordination care among hospitals physicians and post acute care providers 
the shfft model covers the same markets the cjr model and the cabg model covers markets 
which include least one our irfs hospitals subject these models will earn composite quality care score based 
performance comparison that other hospitals following completion model performance year hospitals that achieve 
actual episode spending below the target cost and achieve acceptable better quality score will eligible earn 
incentive payment for the difference between the target and actual cost specified limit hospitals will have downside 
financial risk for the first year optional downside risk the second year and mandatory downside risk beginning the third 
year 
the bundling and aco initiatives have served motivating factors for regulators and healthcare industry participants 
identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models broad based implementation 
new delivery payment model would represent significant transformation for and the healthcare industry generally the 
nature and timing the evolution transformation the current healthcare system coordinated care delivery and 
integrated delivery payment models and value based purchasing are uncertain and will likely remain for some time the 
development new delivery and payment systems will almost certainly take significant time and expense many the 
alternative approaches including those discussed above and the new home health value based purchasing model discussed 
below being explored may not work could change substantially prior nationwide implementation while only small 
percentage our business currently anticipated subject the alternative payment models discussed above 
cannot certain these models will not expanded made standard 
additionally the number and types bundling and aco models increase the number medicare beneficiaries 
who are treated one the models increases our willingness and ability participate integrated delivery payment and 
other alternative payment models and the referral patterns other providers participating those models may limit our access 
medicare patients who would benefit from treatment inpatient rehabilitation hospitals from the services encompass 
offers the extent that acute care hospitals participating those models not perceive our quality care cost efficiency 
favorably compared alternative post acute providers may experience decrease volumes and net operating revenues 
which could adversely affect our financial position results operations and cash flows for further discussion new 
coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models and value based purchasing initiatives the associated challenges and 
our efforts respond them see the executive overview key challenges changes our operating environment 
resulting from healthcare reform section item management discussion and analysis financial condition and 
results operations 
other legislative and regulatory initiatives and changes affecting the industry could adversely affect our business and results 
operations 
the healthcare reform laws include other provisions that could adversely affect well they include the 
expansion the federal anti kickback law and the false claims act that when combined with other recent federal initiatives 
are likely increase investigation and enforcement efforts the healthcare industry generally changes include increased 
resources for enforcement lowered burden proof for the government healthcare fraud matters expanded definition 
claims under the false claims act enhanced penalties and increased rewards for relators successful prosecutions cms may 
also suspend payment for claims prospectively its opinion credible allegations fraud exist the initial suspension 
period may days however the payment suspension period can extended almost indefinitely the matter 
under investigation the hhs office inspector general the hhs oig the united states department justice the 
doj any such suspension would adversely affect our financial position results operations and cash flows 
some states which operate have also undertaken are considering healthcare reform initiatives that address 
similar issues while many the stated goals other federal and state reform initiatives are consistent with our own goal 
provide care that high quality and cost effective legislation and regulatory proposals may lower reimbursements increase 
the cost compliance decrease patient volumes promote frivolous baseless litigation and otherwise adversely affect our 
business cannot predict what healthcare initiatives any will enacted implemented amended the effect any 
future legislation regulation will have 
october cms issued proposed rule relating requirements for discharge planning for hospitals and 
home health agencies called for the impact act the proposed rule would revise the discharge planning requirements 
applicable our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and encompass home health agencies cms proposes require hospitals 
including inpatient rehabilitation facilities irfs have discharge planning process that focuses patients goals and 
preferences and preparing them and appropriate their caregivers active partners their post discharge care for 
our hospitals the proposed rule would require standardized procedures pertaining the development and finalization unique 
discharge plans for all patients cms proposes that discharge instructions must provided the time discharge patients 
the patient caregiver both who are discharged home who are referred other post acute care services and that any 
post discharge practitioners providers must receive the patient discharge instructions the time discharge including the 
patient discharge summary within hours discharge and any test results within hours availability 
for home health agencies the proposed rule includes several new requirements the discharge planning process would 
require the regular evaluation patients identify changes requiring modification the discharge plan the physician 
responsible for patient plan care would have involved the ongoing establishment the discharge plan home 
health agencies must also send certain specified medical and other information the post discharge facility health care 
practitioner the proposed rule would likely require the modification existing discharge forms and reports and patient visits 
may need extended order accommodate patient education adopted proposed would expect incur 
additional one time and recurring expenses comply but this time cannot predict what the final requirements will 
the timing effect those requirements 
accordance with requirements adopted pursuant the impact act cms implemented the new medicare spending 
per beneficiary measures for each inpatient rehabilitation hospital october and each home health agency january 
the intent tracking and publishing this data evaluate given provider payment efficiency relative the 
efficiency the national median provider that provider post acute segment cms believes this measure will encourage 
form 
addition the legislative and regulatory actions that directly affect our reimbursement rates further the evolution 
the current healthcare delivery system other legislative and regulatory changes including result ongoing healthcare 
reform affect healthcare providers like from time time the healthcare reform laws establish the independent 
payment advisory board appointed the president that charged with presenting proposals congress reduce medicare 
expenditures upon the occurrence medicare expenditures exceeding certain level medicare spending projected 
exceed target levels this board will have broad authority develop new medicare policies including changes provider 
reimbursement however due the market basket reductions that are also part these laws certain healthcare providers 
such our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and hospice agencies will not subject payment reduction proposals 
developed this board and presented congress until while most our operations may not subject its payment 
reduction proposals for period time based the scope this board directive reduce medicare expenditures and the 
significance medicare payor other decisions made this board could adversely affect our results operations 
including reductions the payment for home health services december the independent payment advisory 
board members have not been appointed given the results the elections the united states and the controversial 
nature this board its future remains uncertain 
improved efficiency and coordination care the post acute setting holding providers accountable for medicare resource 
use during episode care however the measures not take into account patient outcomes cms has not proposed 
compare payment efficiency across provider segments 
july cms extended and expanded temporary moratorium the enrollment new home health agencies 
and branch locations cms established the moratorium july and now applies the entire states illinois and 
michigan well florida and texas both states where encompass has number agencies january cms 
extended the moratorium through july 
june cms published notice detailing new demonstration project under which would require home health 
providers seek prior authorization before submitting claims for services florida texas illinois michigan and 
massachusetts encompass operates three these states florida texas and massachusetts the pre claim review 
demonstration project cms proposes have medicare contractors collect additional information from home health providers 
submitting claims order determine proper payment there suspicion fraud the project began illinois 
august because difficulties encountered administering the project the start date florida was delayed 
april the start dates for the other states have not been announced approximately encompass medicare 
claims are submitted agencies these three states primarily texas and florida this pre claim demonstration project will 
require incur additional administrative and staffing costs and may impact the timeliness claims payment given that 
fiscal intermediaries illinois have had difficulty processing pre claim reviews timely basis accordingly the roll out 
project not delayed canceled may experience temporary increases the provision for doubtful accounts and decreases 
cash flow may incur costs associated with patient care the medicare claim for which subsequently denied each 
which could have adverse effect our financial position results operations and liquidity 
discussed above medpac makes healthcare policy recommendations congress and provides comments cms 
medicare payment related issues congress not obligated adopt medpac recommendations and based outcomes 
previous years there can assurance congress will adopt any given medpac recommendation for example january 
medpac released materials discussing several possible changes some which medpac has advocated previously 
various post acute payment systems one possible change reported was increase outlier payments funded 
reductions non outlier payments rates under the irf pps 
cannot predict what legislative regulatory reforms changes any will ultimately enacted the timing 
effect any those changes reforms will have enacted they may challenging for all providers and have the effect 
limiting medicare beneficiaries access healthcare services and could have material adverse impact our net operating 
revenues financial position results operations and cash flows for additional discussion healthcare reform and other 
factors affecting reimbursement for our services see item business regulatory and reimbursement challenges and 
sources revenues medicare reimbursement 
quality reporting requirements may negatively affect the medicare reimbursement receive 
the focus alternative payment models and value based purchasing healthcare services has turn led more 
extensive quality care reporting requirements many cases the new reporting requirements are linked reimbursement 
incentives for example under the healthcare reform laws cms established new quality data reporting effective 
october for all irfs facility failure submit the required quality data results two percentage point reduction 
that facility annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges the subsequent medicare fiscal year 
hospitals began submitting quality data cms october all our hospitals have met the reporting deadlines date 
resulting corresponding reimbursement reductions similarly home health and hospice agencies are also required 
submit quality data cms each year and the failure accordance with the rules will result two percentage point 
reduction their market basket updates date none encompass home health and hospice agencies have incurred 
reduction their reimbursement rates 
noted above the impact act mandated that cms adopt several new quality reporting measures for the various 
post acute provider types each the last two years cms adopted additional irf quality reporting measures the reporting 
which will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement the future healthcare generally the 
burdens associated with collecting recording and reporting quality data are increasing currently cms requires irf and home 
health providers track and report and cms sanctioned quality reporting measures respectively 
the rule established five year home health value based purchasing model nine states test whether 
incentives for better care can improve outcomes the delivery home health services the model which began 
applies reduction increase current medicare certified home health agency payments depending quality performance 
made agencies massachusetts maryland north carolina florida washington arizona iowa nebraska and tennessee 
december encompass has agencies those states which account for encompass medicare 
revenue performance will assessed based several process outcome and care satisfaction measures and the payment 
adjustments applied annual basis are set forth the table below 
calendar year for 
payment adjustment 
maximum payment 
adjustment 
there can assurance all our hospitals and agencies will continue meet quality reporting requirements the 
future which may result one more our hospitals agencies seeing reduction its medicare reimbursements 
regardless like other healthcare providers are likely incur additional expenses effort comply with additional 
and changing quality reporting requirements 
compliance with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable healthcare providers requires substantial 
time effort and expense and fail comply with them could suffer penalties required make significant 
changes our operations 
healthcare providers are required comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations the federal state and 
local government levels these laws and regulations relate among other things 
licensure certification and accreditation 
policies either the national local level delineating what conditions must met qualify for reimbursement 
under medicare also referred coverage requirements 
coding and billing for services 
requirements the compliance threshold under the medicare act 
relationships with physicians and other referral sources including physician self referral and anti kickback laws 
quality medical care 
use and maintenance medical supplies and equipment 
maintenance and security patient information and medical records 
acquisition and dispensing pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and 
disposal medical and hazardous waste 
the future changes these laws regulations the manner which they are enforced could subject our current 
past practices allegations impropriety illegality could require make changes our hospitals equipment 
personnel services capital expenditure programs operating procedures and contractual arrangements well the way 
which deliver home health and hospice services those changes could also affect reimbursements well future training 
and staffing costs 
addition specific compliance related laws and regulations examples regulatory changes that can affect our 
business beyond direct changes medicare reimbursement rates can found from time time cms annual rulemaking 
for example the final rule for the fiscal year irf pps implemented new coverage requirements which provided part 
that patient medical record must document reasonable expectation that the time admission irf the patient 
form 
performance 
year 
generally required and was able participate the intensive rehabilitation therapy services uniquely provided irfs cms 
has also taken the position that patient medical file must appropriately document the rationale for the use group therapies 
opposed one one therapy beginning october cms instituted new data collection requirement pursuant 
which irfs must capture the minutes and mode individual group concurrent treatment therapy specialty cms 
plans use this data potentially support future rulemaking this area additionally the final rules for the fiscal years 
and irf pps included reduction the number medical conditions that will presumptively count toward the 
compliance threshold qualify for reimbursement inpatient rehabilitation hospital 
note the hhs oig each year releases work plan that identifies areas compliance focus for the coming year 
recent years hhs oig work plans for irfs have focused among other items the appropriate utilization concurrent and 
group therapy and adverse and temporary harm events occurring irfs the work plan indicates hhs oig will focus 
appropriate documentation support claims irfs and home health and hospice agencies the work plan also provides 
hhs oig will conduct medical reviews irf patient files determine the patients were suited for the intensive therapy 
required irfs and will determine hospice patients are receiving the required visits registered nurses december 
hhs oig also announced that expects complete nationwide audit assess the frequency inpatient 
rehabilitation stays that not comply with all medicare documentation and coverage requirements the work plan the audit 
similar future efforts could result denials medicare claims for patients notwithstanding the referring physicians judgment 
that treatment appropriate 
the recent hhs oig work plans demonstrate the clarity and completeness each patient medical file some 
which the work product physician not employed are essential demonstrating our compliance with various 
regulatory and reimbursement requirements for example support the determination that patient irf treatment was 
reasonable and necessary the file must contain among other things admitting physician assessment the patient well 
post admission assessment the treating physician and other information from clinicians relating the plan care and 
the therapies being provided these physicians exercise their independent medical judgment and our hospital medical 
directors who are independent contractors provide training regular basis the physicians work with regarding 
appropriate documentation however ultimately not and cannot control the physicians medical judgment connection 
with subsequent payment audits and investigations there can assurance what opinion third party may take 
regarding the status patient files the physicians medical judgment evidenced those files 
march received document subpoenas from office the hhs oig addressed four our 
hospitals those subpoenas also requested complete copies medical records for patients treated each those hospitals 
between september and june the investigation being conducted the doj april received 
document subpoenas relating additional seven our hospitals the new subpoenas reference substantially similar 
investigation subject matter the original subpoenas and request materials from the period january through december 
two the four hospitals addressed the original set subpoenas have received supplemental subpoenas cover this 
new time period the most recent subpoenas not include requests for specific patient files however february the 
doj requested the voluntary production the medical records additional patients some whom were treated 
hospitals not subject the subpoenas and provided these records have not received any subsequent requests for 
medical records from the doj 
all the subpoenas are connection with investigation alleged improper fraudulent claims submitted 
medicare and medicaid and request documents and materials relating practices procedures protocols and policies certain 
pre and post admissions activities these hospitals including among other things marketing functions pre admission 
screening post admission physician evaluations patient assessment instruments individualized patient plans care and 
compliance with the medicare rule under the medicare rule commonly referred the rule more the 
patients inpatient rehabilitation hospital must have least one specified list medical conditions order 
reimbursed the inpatient rehabilitation hospital payment rates rather than the lower acute care hospital payment rates 
are currently unable predict the timing outcome these investigations 
although have invested and will continue invest substantial time effort and expense implementing and 
maintaining training programs well internal controls and procedures designed ensure regulatory compliance could 
required return portions reimbursements for discharges alleged after the fact have not been appropriate under the 
applicable reimbursement rules could also subjected other liabilities including criminal penalties civil 
penalties including monetary penalties and the loss our licenses operate one more our hospitals and exclusion 
suspension one more our hospitals from participation the medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare 
programs which lengthy duration and material could potentially trigger default under our credit agreement 
because medicare comprises significant portion our net operating revenues important for remain 
compliant with the laws and regulations governing the medicare program and related matters including anti kickback and 
fraud requirements discussed above connection with the healthcare reform laws the federal government has 
the last couple years made compliance enforcement and fighting healthcare fraud top priorities the past few years the 
doj and hhs well federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts ensure strict compliance with various 
reimbursement related regulations well combat healthcare fraud the doj has pursued and recovered record amount 
taxpayer dollars based alleged healthcare fraud the increased enforcement efforts have frequently included aggressive 
arguments and interpretations laws and regulations that pose risks for all providers for example the federal government has 
increasingly asserted that incidents erroneous billing record keeping represent violations the false claims act human 
error and oversight record keeping and documentation particularly where those activities are the responsibility nonemployees are always risk business and healthcare providers and independent physicians are different additionally 
the federal government has been willing challenge the medical judgment independent physicians arguing that 
reimbursement claims were fraudulent 
reductions reimbursements substantial damages and other remedies assessed against could have material 
adverse effect our business financial position results operations and cash flows even the assertion violation 
depending its nature could have material adverse effect upon our stock price reputation 
receive substantial portion our revenues from the medicare program medicare reimbursement claims made 
healthcare providers including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals well home health and hospice agencies are subject 
audit from time time governmental payors and their agents such the medicare administrative contractors macs 
that act fiscal intermediaries for all medicare billings auditors contracted cms and insurance carriers well hhsoig cms and state medicaid programs noted above the clarity and completeness each patient medical file some 
which the work product physician not employed essential successfully challenging any payment denials 
the physicians working with our patients not adequately document among other things their diagnoses and plans care 
our risks related audits and payment denials general are greater depending the nature the conduct found such 
audits and whether the underlying conduct could considered systemic the resolution these audits could have material 
adverse effect our financial position results operation and liquidity 
the context our inpatient rehabilitation business one the prevalent grounds for denying claim challenging 
previously paid claim audit that the patient treatment hospital was not medically necessary the medical record 
must support that both the documentation and coverage criteria requirements are met for the hospital stay considered 
medically reasonable and necessary medical necessity assessment independent physician patient ability 
tolerate and benefit from intensive multi disciplinary therapy provided irf setting medicare claim may denied 
challenged based opinion the auditor that the record did not evidence medical necessity for treatment irf 
lacked sufficient documentation support the conclusion some cases believe the reviewing party not merely 
challenging the sufficiency the medical record but substituting its judgment medical necessity for that the attending 
physician imposing documentation other requirements which are not set out the regulations argue that doing 
inappropriate and has basis law however when the government its contractors reject the medical judgment 
physicians impose documentation other requirements beyond the language the statutes and regulations would 
expect that both patient access inpatient rehabilitation well our medicare reimbursement from the related claims will 
adversely affected 
macs under programs known widespread probes have conducted pre payment claim reviews our medicare 
billings and some cases denied payment for certain diagnosis codes majority the denials have encountered these 
probes derive from one mac connection with recent probes this mac has made determinations regarding medical 
necessity which represent its uniquely restrictive interpretations the cms coverage rules impose otherwise arbitrary 
conditions not set out the related rules continue discuss our objections those interpretations with both the mac and 
cms cannot predict what any changes will result from those discussions 
cms has developed and instituted various audit programs under which cms contracts with private companies 
conduct claims and medical record audits these audits are addition those conducted existing macs some contractors 
are paid percentage the overpayments recovered one type audit contractor the recovery audit contractors racs 
receive claims data directly from macs monthly quarterly basis and are authorized review previously paid claims 
beginning may cms limited the recovery auditor look back period six months from the date service cases 
where the hospital submits the claim within three months the date service cms has previously operated demonstration 
project that expanded the rac program include prepayment review medicare fee for service claims from primarily acute 
care hospitals unclear whether cms intends conduct rac prepayment reviews the future and what providers 
and claims would the focus those reviews 
form 
reimbursement claims are subject various audits from time time and such audits may negatively affect our operations 
and our cash flows from operations 
rac audits irfs initially focused coding errors but subsequently expanded medical necessity and billing 
accuracy reviews date the medicare payments subject rac audit requests represent less than our medicare 
patient discharges from have appealed substantially all rac denials arising from these audits using the same 
process follow for appealing pre payment denials macs 
cms has also established contractors known the zone program integrity contractors zpics these contractors 
are successors the program safeguard contractors and conduct audits with focus potential fraud and abuse issues like 
the racs the zpics conduct audits and have the ability refer matters the hhs oig the doj unlike racs however 
zpics not receive specific financial incentive based the amount the error

face intense competition for patients from other healthcare providers 
operate highly competitive fragmented inpatient rehabilitation and home health and hospice industries 
although are the nation largest owner and operator inpatient rehabilitation hospitals terms patients treated and 
discharged revenues and number hospitals any particular market may encounter competition from local national 
entities with longer operating histories other competitive advantages for example acute care hospitals including those 
owned and operated large public companies may choose expand begin offering post acute rehabilitation services 
given that approximately our hospitals referrals come from acute care hospitals that increase competition could 
materially and adversely affect our admission referrals the related markets there are also large acute care systems that may 
have more resources available compete than have other providers post acute care services may attempt become 
competitors the future for example over the past few years the number nursing homes marketing themselves offering 
certain rehabilitation services has increased even though nursing homes are not required offer the same level care 
licensed hospitals 
the home health and hospice services industry our primary competition comes from locally owned private home 
health companies acute care hospitals with adjunct home health services and typically varies from market market 
compete with variety other companies providing home health and hospice services some which including several 
large public companies may have greater financial and other resources and may more established their respective 
communities competing companies may offer newer different services from those offer have better relationships with 
referring physicians and may thereby attract patients who are presently would candidates for receiving encompass home 
health hospice services the other public companies have may obtain significantly greater marketing and financial 
resources than have may obtain relatively few barriers entry exist most our local markets accordingly other 
companies including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing competing services may 
expand their services include home health services hospice care community care services similar services additionally 
nursing homes compete for referrals some instances when the patients may suitable for home based care 
there can assurance this competition other competition which may encounter the future will not 
adversely affect our business financial position results operations cash flows addition from time time there are

financial condition and results operations the expansion and growth medicaid and insurance exchanges resulting from 
provisions the healthcare reform laws have increased the number those patients coming medicaid 
reimbursement rates are almost always the lowest among those our payors and frequently medicaid patients come with 
other complicating conditions that make treatment more difficult and costly similarly the insurance coverages offered the 
exchanges typically reimburse rates lower than receive under other managed care contracts not anticipate that 
medicaid and insurance exchanges will continue grow the rate they have recent years previously noted potential 
changes repeal the provisions the healthcare reform laws targeted medicaid expansion may impact the

business outlook 
believe our business outlook remains positive for two primary reasons first demographic trends such 
population aging should increase long term demand for facility based and home based post acute services while treat 
patients all ages most our patients are and older and the number medicare enrollees expected grow 
approximately per year for the foreseeable future believe the demand for facility based and home based post acute 
services will continue increase the population ages and life expectancies increase 
second are industry leader the growing post acute sector the nation largest owner and operator 
inpatient rehabilitation hospitals terms patients treated and discharged revenues and number hospitals believe 
differentiate ourselves from our competitors based our broad platform clinical expertise the quality our clinical 
outcomes the sustainability best practices and the application rehabilitative technology the fourth largest provider 
medicare certified skilled home health services terms revenues believe differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors virtue our scale and density the markets serve the application highly integrated technology 
platform our ability manage variety care pathways and proven track record consummating and integrating 
acquisitions 
have invested considerable resources into clinical and management systems and protocols that have allowed 
consistently produce high quality outcomes for our patients while continuing contain cost growth our proprietary hospital 
management reporting system aggregates data from each our key business systems into comprehensive reporting package 
used the management teams our hospitals well executive management and allows them analyze data and trends 
and create custom reports timely basis our commitment technology also includes the going implementation aceit december had installed this system our hospitals and expect complete installation 
substantially all our existing hospitals the end believe this system will improve patient care and safety 
enhance staff recruitment and retention and set the stage for connectivity with other providers and health information 
exchanges our home health and hospice segment also uses information technology enhance patient care and manage the 
business utilizing homecare homebasesm comprehensive information platform that allows home health providers 
process clinical compliance and marketing information well analyze data and trends for management purposes using 
custom reports timely basis this allows our home health segment manage the entire patient work flow and provide 
valuable data for health systems payors and aco partners are currently the home health provider one aco serving 
approximately patients and are exploring several other participation opportunities 
believe these factors align with our strengths and focus post acute services addition believe can 
address the demand for facility based and home based post acute services markets where currently not have 
presence constructing acquiring new hospitals and acquiring home health and hospice agencies that highly 
fragmented industry 
for these and other reasons believe will able adapt changes reimbursement sustain our business 
model and grow through acquisition and consolidation opportunities they arise 
key challenges 
the healthcare industry facing many well publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges the industry also 
facing uncertainty associated with the efforts primarily arising from initiatives included the healthcare reform laws 
defined item business regulatory and reimbursement challenges identify and implement workable coordinated 
care and integrated delivery payment models successful healthcare providers are those who provide high quality cost effective 
care and have the ability adjust changes the regulatory and operating environments believe have the necessary 
capabilities scale infrastructure balance sheet and management adapt changes and continue succeed highly 
regulated industry and have proven track record doing 
continue execute our business plan the following are some the challenges face 
operating highly regulated industry are required comply with extensive and complex laws and 
regulations the federal state and local government levels these rules and regulations have affected could 
the future affect our business activities having impact the reimbursement receive for services 
provided the costs compliance mandating new documentation standards requiring additional licensure 
certification regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources regulating the use our 
properties and limiting our ability enter new markets add new capacity existing hospitals and agencies 
ensuring continuous compliance with extensive laws and regulations operating requirement for all 
healthcare providers 
have invested and will continue invest substantial time effort and expense implementing and 
maintaining training programs well internal controls and procedures designed ensure regulatory 
compliance and are committed continued adherence these guidelines more specifically because 
medicare comprises significant portion our net operating revenues particularly important for 
remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the medicare program and related matters including 
anti kickback and anti fraud requirements were unable remain compliant with these regulations our 
financial position results operations and cash flows could materially adversely impacted 
concerns held federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result enactment 
further federal spending reductions further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program 
both and beyond additionally many legislators the united states house representatives and the 
united states senate continue express the policy objective modifying repealing the healthcare 
reform laws the election president donald trump along with republican majorities the united states 
senate and house representatives increase the likelihood changes repeal provisions the 
healthcare reform laws through both legislative and regulatory action this time unclear what any 
form 
longer term the nature and timing the transformation the current healthcare system coordinated care delivery 
and payment models uncertain and will likely remain for some time the development new delivery and payment 
systems will almost certainly require significant time and resources furthermore many the alternative approaches being 
explored may not work intended however outlined the key challenges changes our operating environment 
resulting from healthcare reform section below our goal position the company prudent manner responsive 
industry shifts have invested our core business and created infrastructure that enables provide high quality care 
cost effective basis have been disciplined creating capital structure that flexible with significant debt 
maturities prior our balance sheet remains strong and includes substantial portfolio owned real estate have 
significant availability under our revolving credit facility and continue generate strong cash flows from operations 
importantly have flexibility with how choose deploy our cash and create value for shareholders including bed 
expansions existing inpatient rehabilitation hospital and novos acquisition and novo construction inpatient 
rehabilitation hospitals home health agencies and hospice agencies repayments long term debt common stock dividends 
and repurchases our common stock while our financial leverage increased result the acquisions note business 
combinations the accompanying consolidated financial statements anticipate the longer term reducing our financial 
leverage based growth adjusted ebitda and allocation portion our free cash flow debt reduction 
the medicare related changes may ultimately enacted and signed into law the president but possible 
that any reductions medicare spending will have material impact reimbursements for healthcare providers 
generally and post acute providers specifically cannot predict what any changes medicare spending 
modifications the healthcare laws and regulations will result from future budget and other legislative initiatives 
april president obama signed into law the medicare access and chip children health insurance 
program reauthorization act which repealed the statutory mechanism providing for annual automatic 
adjustments the medicare physician fee schedule using sustainable growth rate formula that had historically 
resulted annual deep cuts physician reimbursement rates consequence which has been the called 
doc fixes passed congress annually since override those automatic adjustments the primary impact 
this act post acute care providers mandated market basket update for rehabilitation 
hospitals well home health and hospice agencies 
another challenge relates reduced medicare reimbursement which also discussed item risk factors 
unless the united states congress acts change eliminate sequestration which began affecting payments 
received after april will continue result decrease reimbursements otherwise due from 
medicare after taking into consideration other changes reimbursement rates such market basket updates 
the medicare payment advisory commission medpac independent agency that advises congress 
issues affecting medicare and makes payment policy recommendations congress and cms for variety 
medicare payment systems including among others the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment 
system the irf pps the home health prospective payment system the pps and the hospice 
prospective payment system the hospice pps congress and cms are not obligated adopt medpac 
recommendations and based outcomes previous years there can assurance those recommendations 
will adopted however medpac recommendations have and may the future become the basis for 
subsequent legislative regulatory action 
march medpac released recommendations eliminate the market basket update for each the irfpps the pps and the hospice pps for another recommendation affecting irfs medpac suggested 
increasing the irf pps outlier payment pool the final rule for the irf pps discussed below did not follow 
medpac recommendations eliminate the market basket update increase the outlier pool june 
report mandated the impact act medpac set out its evaluation unified payment system for all postacute care pac pps lieu separate systems for irfs skilled nursing facilities long term acute care 
hospitals and home health agencies medpac found pac pps feasible and desireable but also suggested 
many existing regulatory requirements including the irf rule defined item risk factors and the 
requirement for minimum three hours therapy per day should waived part implementing pacpps medpac also suggested that ultimately medicare should move from fee for service reimbursement more 
integrated delivery payment models december medpac recommended reduction both inpatient 
rehabilitation and home health reimbursement for and two year rebasing home health reimbursement 
rates beginning medpac also reiterated increase the outlier payment pool funded 
reductions base medicare payments rates under the irf pps this proposal would adversely affect 
have relatively low percentage outlier payments compared other inpatient rehabilitation providers 
july cms released its notice final rulemaking for fiscal year for irfs under the irf pps 
the irf rule the final rule will implement net market basket increase effective for discharges 
between october and september calculated follows 
market basket update 
healthcare reform reduction 
productivity adjustment 
basis points 
basis points 
the final rule also includes other changes that impact our hospital hospital base rate for medicare 
reimbursement such changes include but are not limited revisions the wage index values changes 
designations between rural and urban facilities and updates the outlier fixed loss threshold the final rule also 
continues the freeze the update the irf pps facility level rural adjustment factor low income patient factor 
and teaching status adjustment factors based our analysis which utilizes among other things the acuity our 
patients over the month period prior the final rule release and incorporates other adjustments included 
the final rule believe the irf rule will result net increase our medicare payment rates 
approximately effective october prior the impact sequestration 
additionally the irf rule contains changes that could affect future years for example cms adopted 
five additional quality reporting measures the reporting which may require additional time and expense and 
could affect reimbursement beginning october 
november cms published its final rule establishing the comprehensive care for joint replacement 
cjr bundled payment model this mandatory model holds acute care hospitals accountable for the quality 
care they deliver medicare fee for service beneficiaries for lower extremity joint replacements knees and 
hips from surgery through recovery during the cjr model five year term which began april 
healthcare providers geographic areas msas will continue paid under existing medicare payment 
systems however the hospital where the joint replacement takes place will held accountable for the quality 
and costs care for the entire episode care from the time the original admission through days after 
discharge depending the quality and cost performance during the entire episode the hospital may receive 
additional payment required repay medicare for portion the episode costs under this model 
hospitals had repayment responsibility downside financial risk for however they have downside 
risk beginning result cms believes acute care hospitals would incented work with physicians 
and post acute care providers ensure beneficiaries receive the coordinated care they need efficient manner 
acute care hospitals participating the cjr model may enter into risk sharing financial arrangements with postacute providers including irfs and home health agencies believe its impact will positive for healthsouth 
should favor high quality low cost providers like who have made significant commitments information 
systems that enable and enhance connectivity also believe the rule further validates our movement into home 
health via the acquisition encompass currently lower extremity joint replacement patients represent less than 
our total annual discharges due our required compliance with the rule given the msas included 
the cjr model our patients potentially subject this model represent approximately our annual 
medicare discharges the lower extremity joint replacement patients treat are generally higher acuity and 
possess significant comorbidities these cases and any risk bearing bundling initiative quality outcomes 
critical achieving targeted financial results 
january cms published its final rule providing for the creation and testing three new episode 
payment models epms well modification the cjr model the three new medicare epms are 
acute myocardial infarction model coronary artery bypass graft cabg model and surgical hip 
femur fracture treatment excluding lower extremity joint replacement shfft model most relevant are 
the mandatory cabg and shfft models which are set begin july and continue through the end 
form 
reimbursement claims made healthcare providers including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals well home 
health and hospice agencies are subject audit from time time governmental payors and their agents such 
the medicare administrative contractors macs fiscal intermediaries and carriers well the office 
inspector general cms and state medicaid programs under programs designated widespread probes 
certain our macs have conducted pre payment claim reviews our billings and denied payment for certain 
diagnosis codes dispute appeal most these denials and for claims choose take administrative 
law judge hearings have historically experienced approximate success rate the appeals process 
established cms has encountered significant delays recent years the resolution these disputes can take 
excess three years currently have appeals being heard that have been pending for five years the 
majority the denials have encountered these probes derive from one mac connection with recent 
probes this mac has made determinations regarding medical necessity which represent its uniquely restrictive 
interpretations the cms coverage rules continue discuss our objections those interpretations with both 
the mac and cms cannot predict what any changes will result from those discussions the mac 
continues deny significant number claims for certain diagnosis codes may experience increases the 
provision for doubtful accounts decreases cash flow result increasing accounts receivable and shift 
the patients and conditions treat any which could have adverse effect our financial position results 
operations and liquidity december the presiding federal district court judge the lawsuit ordered 
hhs reduce the backlog appeals the end the end the end 
and completely the end hhs has appealed the federal district court decision january 
cms published rule implementing procedural and administrative changes the appeals process but 
unclear what any impact these changes will have the backlog this new rule may subject legal 
challenge healthcare providers well cannot predict what any further action cms will take reduce 
the backlog 
under these models with the cjr model acute care hospitals are financially accountable for the quality 
and cost episode care which intended incentivize increased coordination care among hospitals 
physicians and post acute care providers the shfft model covers the same msas the cjr model 
healthsouth located these msas and the cabg model covers msas healthsouth located 
these msas our patients potentially subject the cabg model represent approximately our 
annual medicare discharges our patients potentially subject the shfft model represent approximately 
our annual medicare discharges incremental the above cjr program 
october cms released its notice final rulemaking for calendar year for home health 
agencies under the pps the rule specifically while the final rule provides for market basket 
update that update offset rebasing adjustment reduction the last year four year phasein productivity adjustment reduction basis points outlier fixed dollar loss adjustment and 
coding intensity reduction the second year three year phase believe the rule will 
result net decrease encompass medicare payment rates approximately effective for episodes 
ending calendar year the net decrease encompass medicare payment rates primarily due 
case mix weighting and for the change the outlier calculation methodology the rule had 
approximate million negative impact revenues the fourth quarter applicable episodes that 
began and ended additionally the rule requires report four new quality 
measures the reporting which will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement 
beginning 
june cms implemented new pre claim review demonstration home health services five states 
for period three years encompass operates three these states florida texas and massachusetts the 
pre claim review demonstration project cms proposes have medicare contractors collect additional 
information from home health providers submitting claims order determine proper payment there 
suspicion fraud the project began illinois august because difficulties encountered 
administering the project the start date florida was delayed april the start dates for the other states 
have not been announced approximately encompass medicare claims are submitted agencies these 
three states primarily texas and florida this pre claim demonstration project will require incur additional 
administrative and staffing costs and may impact the timeliness claims payment given that fiscal intermediaries 
illinois have had difficulty processing pre claim reviews timely basis accordingly the roll out project 
not delayed canceled may experience temporary increases the provision for doubtful accounts and 
decreases cash flow may incur costs associated with patient care the medicare claim for which 
subsequently denied each which could have adverse effect our financial position results operations 
and liquidity 
see also item business sources revenues and regulation and item risk factors this report and 
note contingencies and other commitments governmental inquiries and investigations the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements 
changes our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform our challenges related healthcare 
reform are discussed item business sources revenues and item risk factors many provisions 
within the healthcare reform laws have impacted could the future impact our business most notably 
for are the reductions our hospitals annual market basket updates including productivity adjustments 
mandated reductions home health and hospice medicare reimbursements and future payment reforms such 
acos and bundled payments 
while the change administrations has added regulatory uncertainty the healthcare industry general has 
been facing uncertainty associated with the efforts identify and implement workable coordinated care and 
integrated delivery payment models these models hospitals physicians and other care providers work 
together provide coordinated healthcare more efficient patient centered basis these providers are then 
paid based the overall value and quality the services they provide patient rather than the number 
services they provide while this consistent with our goal and proven track record being high quality costeffective provider broad based implementation new delivery model would represent significant 
transformation for the healthcare industry the industry and its regulators explore this transformation are 
positioning the company preparation for whatever changes are ultimately made the delivery system 
have track record successful partnerships with acute care providers thirty seven our hospitals 
already operate joint ventures with acute care hospitals and continue pursue joint ventures one 
our growth initiatives these joint ventures create immediate link acute care system and position 
quickly and efficiently integrate our services coordinated care model 
our commitment coordinated care demonstrated and enhanced the utilization technology our 
hospital electronic clinical information system capable interfaces with all major acute care electronic 
medical record systems and health information exchanges making communication easier across the 
continuum healthcare providers our home health and hospice clinical information system utilizes 
leading home care technology that manages the entire patient work flow importantly have the ability 
use data from both systems develop clinical protocol best practices 
our balance sheet strong and have consistently strong free cash flows have significant debt 
maturities prior and have significant liquidity under our revolving credit facility addition 
own the real estate associated with approximately our hospitals 
have proven track record being high quality cost effective provider the fim gains tool based 
point assessment used measure functional independence from admission discharge our 
inpatient rehabilitation hospitals consistently exceed industry results and the day readmission rates our 
home health agencies are lower than the national average addition have the scale and operating 
leverage generate low cost per discharge visit 
the combination home health and hospice with our existing inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services 
provides with increased opportunity succeed value based purchasing programs and participate 
more coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models such acos and bundled payment 
arrangements believe enhanced clinical collaboration between our hospitals and home health agencies 
offers excellent means deliver the quality care and the cost effectiveness that these new models 
require successful since partnering with encompass have focused and will continue focus 
increasing this collaboration are currently participating several coordinated care delivery model 
initiatives and are exploring aco participation several others eight our irfs began participating 
phase the risk phase model cms bundled payments for care improvement bpci 
initiative also have several irfs that have signed participation agreements with acute care 
providers participating model the bpci initiative ten our home health agencies began participating 
phase model the bpci initiative december home health agencies 
participate phase addition have partnered the home health provider with premier phc 
aco serving approximately medicare patients 
given the complexity and the number changes the healthcare reform laws and other pending 
regulatory initiatives cannot predict their ultimate impact furthermore the election president donald 
trump along with republican majorities the united states senate and house representatives increase the 
likelihood changes repeal provisions the healthcare reform laws through both legislative and 
regulatory action therefore the ultimate nature and timing the transformation the healthcare delivery 
system uncertain and will likely remain for some time will continue evaluate these laws and position 
the company for this industry shift based our track record believe can adapt these regulatory and 
industry changes further have engaged and will continue engage actively discussions with key 
legislators and regulators attempt ensure any healthcare laws regulations adopted amended promote our 
goal high quality cost effective care 
additionally october president obama signed into law the impact act the impact act was 
developed partisan basis the house ways and means and senate finance committees and incorporated 
feedback from healthcare providers and provider organizations that responded the committees solicitation 
post acute payment reform ideas and proposals directs the united states department health and human 
services hhs consultation with healthcare stakeholders implement standardized data collection 
processes for post acute quality and outcome measures although the impact act does not specifically call for 
the development new post acute payment system believe this act will lay the foundation for possible 
future post acute payment policies that would based patients medical conditions and other clinical factors 
rather than the setting where the care provided also referred site neutral reimbursement will also 
create additional data reporting requirements for our hospitals and home health agencies and expect fully 
comply with these requirements the precise details these new reporting requirements including timing and 
content will developed and implemented cms through the regulatory process that expect will take 
place over the next several years while cannot quantify the potential financial effects the impact act 
healthsouth believe any post acute payment system that data driven and focuses the needs and 
form 
underlying medical conditions post acute patients ultimately will net positive for providers who offer highquality cost effective care however will likely take years for the related quality measures established
