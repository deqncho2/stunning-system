regulation and healthcare reform 
numerous federal state and local regulations regulate healthcare services and those who provide them 
some states into which may expand have laws requiring facilities employing health professionals and 
providing health related services licensed and some cases obtain certificate need that 
demonstrating state regulatory authority the need for and financial feasibility new facilities the 
commencement new healthcare services only one the states which currently operate requires 
certificate need for the operation our physical therapy business functions our therapists and clinics 
however are required licensed determined the state which they provide services failure obtain 
maintain any required certificates approvals licenses could have material adverse effect our business 
financial condition and results operations 
regulations controlling fraud and abuse various federal and state laws regulate financial relationships 
involving providers healthcare services these laws include section the social security act 
the fraud and abuse law under which civil and criminal penalties can imposed 
upon persons who among other things offer solicit pay receive remuneration return for the referral 
patients for the rendering any item service for which payment may made whole part 
federal health care program including medicare and medicaid purchasing leasing ordering 
arranging for recommending purchasing leasing ordering any good facility service item for which 
payment may made whole part federal health care program including medicare and medicaid 
believe that our business procedures and business arrangements are compliance with these provisions 
however the provisions are broadly written and the full extent their specific application specific facts and 
arrangements which are party uncertain and difficult predict addition several states have enacted 
state laws similar the fraud and abuse law which may more restrictive than the federal fraud and abuse 
law 
the office the inspector general oig hhs has issued regulations describing compensation 
financial arrangements that fall within safe harbor and therefore are not viewed illegal remuneration 
under the fraud and abuse law failure fall within safe harbor does not mean that the fraud and abuse 
law has been violated however the oig has indicated that failure fall within safe harbor may subject 
arrangement increased scrutiny under facts and circumstances test 
the oig also has issued special fraud alerts and special advisory bulletins remind the provider 
community the importance and application certain aspects the fraud and abuse law one the oig 
special fraud alerts related the rental space physician offices persons entities which the 
physicians refer patients the oig stated concern these arrangements that rental payments may 
disguised kickbacks the physician landlords induce referrals rent clinic space for few our clinics 
from referring physicians and have taken the steps that believe are necessary ensure that all leases comply 
the extent possible and applicable with the space rental safe harbor the fraud and abuse law 
one the oig special advisory bulletins addressed certain complex contractual arrangements for the 
provision items and services this special advisory bulletin identified several characteristics commonly 
exhibited suspect arrangements the existence one more which could indicate prohibited 
arrangement the oig generally the indicia suspect contractual joint venture identified the special 
advisory bulletin and associated oig advisory opinion include the following 
new line business provider one line business owner expands into new line 
business that can provided the owner existing patients with another party who currently 
provides the same similar item service the new business manager supplier 
captive referral base the arrangement predominantly exclusively serves the owner existing 
patient base patients under the control influence the owner 
little bona fide business risk the owner primary contribution the venture referrals 
makes little financial other investment the business delegating the entire operation the 
manager supplier while retaining profits generated from its captive referral base 
status the manager supplier the manager supplier would competitor the owner new 
line business and would normally compete for the captive referrals has the capacity provide 
virtually identical services its own right and bill insurers and patients for them its own name 
scope services provided the manager supplier the manager supplier provides all many 
the new business key services 
remuneration the practical effect the arrangement viewed its entirety provide the owner 
the opportunity bill insurers and patients for business otherwise provided the manager supplier 
the remuneration from the venture the owner the profits the venture takes into account the 
value and volume business the owner generates 
exclusivity the arrangement bars the owner from providing items services any patients other 
than those coming from owner and bars the manager supplier from providing services its own 
right the owner patients 
due the nature our business operations many our management service arrangements exhibit one 
more these characteristics however the believe have taken steps regarding the structure such 
arrangements necessary sufficiently distinguish them from these suspect ventures and comply with the 
requirements the fraud and abuse law however the oig believes have entered into prohibited 
contractual joint venture could have adverse effect our business financial condition and results 
operations 
although the business managing physician owned physical therapy facilities regulated the fraud 
and abuse law the manner which contract with such facilities often falls outside the complete scope 
available safe harbors believe our arrangements comply with the fraud and abuse law even though federal 
courts provide limited guidance the application the fraud and abuse law these arrangements our 
management contracts are held violate the fraud and abuse law could have adverse effect our 
business financial condition and results operations 
stark law provisions the omnibus budget reconciliation act the stark 
law prohibit referrals physician designated health services which are payable whole part 
medicare medicaid entity which the physician the physician immediate family member has 
investment interest other financial relationship subject several exceptions unlike the fraud and abuse 
law the stark law strict liability statute proof intent violate the stark law not required physical 
therapy services are among the designated health services further the stark law has application our 
management contracts with individual physicians and physician groups well any other financial 
relationship between and referring physicians including medical advisor arrangements and any financial 
transaction resulting from clinic acquisition the stark law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant 
prohibited referral several states have enacted laws similar the stark law these state laws may cover all 
not just medicare and medicaid patients with the fraud and abuse law consider the stark law 
planning our clinics establishing contractual and other arrangements with physicians marketing and other 
activities and believe that our operations are substantial compliance with the stark law violate the 
stark law any similar state laws our financial results and operations could adversely affected penalties for 
violations include denial payment for the services significant civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the 
medicare and medicaid programs 
hipaa effort further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentially congress included 
several anti fraud measures the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 
hipaa created source funding for fraud control coordinate federal state and local healthcare law 
enforcement programs conduct investigations provide guidance the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent 
healthcare practices and establish national data bank receive and report final adverse actions hipaa also 
criminalized certain forms health fraud against all public and private payors additionally hipaa mandates 
the adoption standards regarding the exchange healthcare information effort ensure the privacy and 
electronic security patient information and standards relating the privacy health information sanctions 
for failing comply with hipaa include criminal penalties and civil sanctions february the 
american recovery and reinvestment act arra was signed into law title xiii arra the 
health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech provided for substantial 
medicare and medicaid incentives for providers adopt electronic health records ehrs and grants for the 
development health information exchange hie recognizing that hie and ehr systems will not 
implemented unless the public can assured that the privacy and security patient information such 
systems protected hitech also significantly expanded the scope the privacy and security requirements 
under hipaa most notable are the mandatory breach notification requirements and heightened enforcement 
scheme that includes increased penalties and which now apply business associates well covered 
entities addition hipaa number states have adopted laws and regulations applicable the use and 
disclosure individually identifiable health information that can more stringent than comparable provisions 
under hipaa 
believe that our operations comply with applicable standards for privacy and security protected 
healthcare information cannot predict what negative effect any hipaa hitech any applicable state 
law regulation will have our business 
other regulatory factors political economic and regulatory influences are fundamentally changing the 
healthcare industry the united states congress state legislatures and the private sector continue review and 
assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems potential alternative approaches could include 
mandated basic healthcare benefits controls healthcare spending through limitations the growth private 
health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid spending the creation large insurance purchasing 
groups and price controls legislative debate expected continue the future and market forces are 
expected demand only modest increases reduced costs for instance managed care entities are demanding 
lower reimbursement rates from healthcare providers and some cases are requiring encouraging providers 
accept capitated payments that may not allow providers cover their full costs realize traditional levels 
profitability cannot reasonably predict what impact the adoption federal state healthcare reform 
measures future private sector reform may have our business 
competition 
the healthcare industry including the physical therapy business highly competitive the physical therapy 
business highly fragmented with company having significant market share nationally believe that 
are currently the fourth largest national outpatient rehabilitation provider 
competitive factors affecting our business include quality care cost treatment outcomes convenience 
location and relationships with and ability meet the needs referral and payor sources our clinics compete 
directly indirectly with many types healthcare providers including the physical therapy departments 
hospitals private therapy clinics physician owned therapy clinics and chiropractors may face more intense 
competition consolidation the therapy industry continues 
believe that our strategy providing key therapists community with opportunity participate 
ownership clinic profitability provides with competitive advantage helping ensure the commitment 
local management the success the clinic 
also believe that our competitive position enhanced our strategy locating our clinics when 
possible the ground floor buildings and shopping centers with nearby parking thereby making the clinics 
more easily accessible patients offer convenient hours also attempt make the decor our clinics 
less institutional and more aesthetically pleasing than traditional hospital clinics 
enforcement environment 
recent years federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed uncovering 
behavior that violates the federal civil and criminal laws regarding false claims and fraudulent billing and coding 
practices such laws require providers adhere complex reimbursement requirements regarding proper billing 
and coding order compensated for their services government payors our compliance program 
requires adherence applicable law and promotes reimbursement education and training however 
determination that our clinics billing and coding practices are false fraudulent could have material adverse 
effect 
result our participation the medicare and medicaid programs are subject various 
governmental inspections reviews audits and investigations verify our compliance with these programs and 
applicable laws and regulations addition our corporate integrity agreement requires annual audits 
performed independent review organization small sample our clinics the results which are 
reported the federal government see compliance program corporate integrity agreement managed care 
payors may also reserve the right conduct audits adverse inspection review audit investigation could 
result refunding amounts have been paid fines penalties and revocation billing privileges for the 
affected clinics expansion the scope our corporate integrity agreement exclusion from participation the 
medicare medicaid programs one more managed care payor network damage our reputation 
and our clinics are subject federal and state laws prohibiting entities and individuals from knowingly 
and willfully making claims medicare medicaid and other governmental programs and third party payors that 
contain false fraudulent information the federal false claims act encourages private individuals file suits 
behalf the government against healthcare providers such such suits are generally filed under seal

december had physician hospital owned facilities under management 
recent restatement our historical financial statements connection with the preparation our 
annual financial statements determined that our historical accounting for redeemable non controlling interests 
acquired partnerships was incorrect this error was the result incorrect interpretation technical 
accounting guidance concerning the classification instruments liabilities equity specifically recently 
determined that under applicable accounting guidance the redemption feature included the partnership 
agreements should considered mandatorily redeemable financial instrument accordingly such interests 
should accounted for liability and not temporary equity this error did not affect any our 
partnership agreements for novo clinics those agreements not contain redemption feature 
result the restatement determined that material weakness existed our internal control over 
financial reporting have taken steps remediate the material weakness which relates our accounting for 
and reporting non controlling interests engaging further analysis the applicable technical 
accounting requirements and developing specific policies and procedures evaluate our compliance with such 
requirements when acquire future partnerships see item controls and procedures for further 
discussion 
although the accounting error caused technical violation our amended credit agreement 
dated december were able obtain the necessary waivers and amendments applicable the 
date the filing this annual report are compliance with all our covenants thereunder 
critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that have significant impact our results operations and 
financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment our critical accounting policies are 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized the period which services are rendered net patient 
revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported the estimated net realizable 
amounts from insurance companies third party payors patients and others for services rendered the company 
has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments the company contracted amounts different 
from its established rates the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments based terms payor 
contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for 
services performed and expected reimbursements both insurance companies and government sponsored 
healthcare programs for such services medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care 
contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services 
provided our clinics estimate contractual allowances based our interpretation the applicable 
regulations payor contracts and historical calculations each month the company estimates its contractual 
allowance for each clinic based payor contracts and the historical collection experience the clinic and 
applies appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage the gross accounts receivable balances for 
each payor the clinic based our historical experience calculating the contractual allowance reserve 
percentage the payor level sufficient allow provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our 
collectability estimates however the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject 
interpretation that could result payments that differ from our estimates payor terms are periodically revised 
necessitating continual review and assessment the estimates made management our billing system may not 
capture the exact change our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period period therefore order 
assess the accuracy our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves our management regularly 
compares its cash collections corresponding net revenues measured both the aggregate and 
clinic clinic basis the aggregate the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash 
collections has generally reflected difference within approximately net revenues additionally analysis 
subsequent period contractual write offs payor basis reflects difference within approximately 
between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage compared the estimated contractual allowance 
reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance result believe that reasonable likely 
change the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not more than december for 
purposes demonstrating the sensitivity this estimate the company financial condition one percent 
increase decrease our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease increase 
respectively net patient revenue approximately for the year ended december management 
believes the changes the estimate the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december

the medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based the medicare physician fee 
schedule mpfs the mpfs rates have historically been subject automatic annual update based 
formula called the sustainable growth rate sgr formula the use the sgr formula would have resulted 
calculated automatic reductions rates every year since however for each year through 
september centers for medicare medicaid services cms congress has taken action 
prevent the implementation sgr formula reductions april the medicare access and chip 
reauthorization act macra was signed into law eliminating the sgr formula and the associated 
annual automatic rate reductions for services provided between january and june 
payment update was applied the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates for services provided 
between july and december increase was applied the fee schedule payment rates for 
services provided decrease being applied the fee schedule payment rates and for 
through increase will applied each year the fee schedule payment rates unless further 
adjusted cms the payment adjustments proposed cms for reduction addition the 
macra promotes the development new payment models that focus quality and outcomes 
the budget control act increased the federal debt ceiling connection with deficit reductions over 
the next ten years and requires automatic reductions federal spending approximately trillion 
payments medicare providers are subject these automatic spending reductions subject cap

result the balanced budget act the formula for determining the total amount paid 
medicare any one year for outpatient physical therapy occupational therapy and speech language pathology 
services provided any medicare beneficiary the therapy cap limit was established based 
the statutory definitions which constrained how the therapy cap would applied there one limit for 
physical therapy and speech language pathology services combined and one limit for occupational therapy 
for the annual limit outpatient therapy services for physical and speech language pathology 
services combined and for occupational therapy services historically these therapy caps applied 
outpatient therapy services provided all settings except for services provided departments hospitals 
however the protecting access medicare act and prior legislation extended the therapy caps 
services furnished hospital outpatient department settings the application these annual limits hospital 
outpatient department settings will sunset december unless congress extends 
the deficit reduction act congress implemented exceptions process the annual limit for 
therapy expenses for therapy services above the annual limit therapy services above the annual limit that are 
medically necessary satisfy exception the annual limit and such claims are payable the medicare 
program the macra extended the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through december 
unless congress extends the exceptions process further the therapy caps will apply all outpatient therapy 
services beginning january except those services furnished and billed outpatient hospital departments 
for any claim above the annual limit the claim must contain modifier indicating that the services are 
medically necessary and justified appropriate documentation the medical record 
furthermore under the middle class tax relief and job creation act mctra since 
october patients who met exceeded therapy expenditures during calendar year have been 
subject manual medical review determine whether applicable payment criteria are satisfied the 
threshold applied physical therapy and speech language pathology services separate threshold 
applied the occupational therapy the macra directed cms modify the manual medical review process 
such that those reviews will longer apply all claims exceeding the threshold and instead will 
determined targeted basis based variety factors that cms considers appropriate the new factors 
apply exception requests for which cms did not conduct medical review july 
cms adopted multiple procedure payment reduction mppr for therapy services the final update 
the mpfs for calendar year the mppr applied all outpatient therapy services paid under medicare part 
occupational therapy physical therapy and speech language pathology under the policy the medicare 
program pays the practice expense component the relative value unit rvu for the therapy 
procedure with the highest practice expense rvu then reduces the payment for the practice expense component 
for the second and subsequent therapy procedures units service furnished during the same day for the same 
patient regardless whether those therapy services are furnished separate sessions since the practice 
expense component for the second and subsequent therapy service furnished during the same day for the same 
patient was reduced addition the mctra directed cms implement claims based data collection 
program gather additional data patient function during the course therapy order better understand 
patient conditions and outcomes all practice settings that provide outpatient therapy services are required 
include this data the claim form since therapists have been required report new codes and modifiers 
the claim form that reflect patient functional limitations and goals initial evaluation periodically 
throughout care and discharge cms has rejected claims the required data not included the claim 
the physician quality reporting system pqrs cms reporting program that uses combination 
incentive payments and payment reductions promote reporting quality information eligible 
professionals although physical therapists occupational therapists and qualified speech language therapists are 
generally able participate the pqrs program therapy professionals for whose services bill through our 
certified rehabilitation agencies cannot participate because the medicare claims processing systems currently 
cannot accommodate institutional providers such certified rehabilitation agencies eligible professionals such 
those our therapy professionals for whose services bill using their individual medicare provider 
numbers who not satisfactorily report data quality measures will subject reduction their 
medicare payment and required under the macra the pqrs program will replaced with 
the merit based incentive payment system mips january physical therapists and occupational 
therapists are not required participate the mips program until january later determined 
cms 
statutes regulations and payment rules governing the delivery therapy services medicare beneficiaries 
are complex and subject interpretation the company believes that compliance all material respects 
with all applicable laws and regulations and not aware any pending threatened investigations involving 
allegations potential wrongdoing that would have material effect the company financial statements 
september compliance with such laws and regulations can subject future government review 
and interpretation well significant regulatory action including fines penalties and exclusion from the 
medicare program for the year ended december net revenue from medicare accounts for 
approximately million 
management contract revenues 
management contract revenues are derived from contractual arrangements whereby the company manages 
clinic for third party owners the company does not have any ownership interest these clinics typically 
revenues are determined based the number visits conducted the clinic and recognized when services are 
performed costs typically salaries for the company employees are recorded when incurred management 
contract revenues are included other revenues the accompanying consolidated statements net income 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and 
expected reimbursements both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such 
services medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex 
and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided company clinics the 
company estimates contractual allowances based its interpretation the applicable regulations payor 
contracts and historical calculations each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic 
based payor contracts and the historical collection experience the clinic and applies appropriate 
contractual allowance reserve percentage the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor the clinic 
based the company historical experience calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage the 
payor level sufficient allow the company provide the necessary detail and accuracy with its collectability 
estimates however the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject interpretation 
that could result payments that differ from the company estimates payor terms are periodically revised 
necessitating continual review and assessment the estimates made management the company billing 
system does not capture the exact change its contractual allowance reserve estimate from period period 
order assess the accuracy its revenues and hence its contractual allowance reserves management regularly 
compares its cash collections corresponding net revenues measured both the aggregate and 
clinic clinic basis the aggregate historically the difference between net revenues and corresponding cash 
collections has generally reflected difference within approximately net revenues additionally analysis 
subsequent period contractual write offs payor basis reflects difference within approximately 
between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage compared the estimated contractual allowance 
reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance result the company believes that change 
the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely more than december 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit 
carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected apply 
taxable income the years which those temporary differences are expected recovered settled the 
effect deferred tax assets and liabilities change tax rates recognized income the period that 
includes the enactment date 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit tax position only after determining that the 
relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following audit for tax positions 
meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized the financial statements the largest 
benefit that has greater than percent likelihood being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant 
tax authority 
the company did not have any accrued interest penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits 
nor was any interest expense recognized during the twelve months ended december and the

seller entity owned one more individuals the selling shareholders most whom are 
physical therapists that work the therapy practice and provide physical therapy services patients 
conjunction with the acquisition the seller entity contributes the therapy practice into 
newly formed limited partnership newco exchange for one hundred percent the 
limited and general partnership interests newco therefore this step newco becomes 
wholly owned subsidiary the seller entity 
the company enters into agreement the purchase agreement acquire from the seller entity 
majority ranges from the limited partnership interest and all cases the 
general partnership interest newco the company does not purchase the limited 
partnership interest because the selling shareholders through the seller entity want maintain 
ownership percentage the consideration for the acquisition primarily payable the form cash 
closing and small two year note lieu escrow the purchase price the purchase 
agreement does not contain any future earn out other contingent consideration that payable the 
seller entity the selling shareholders 
the company and the seller entity also execute partnership agreement the partnership 
agreement for newco that sets forth the rights and obligations the limited and general partners 
newco after the acquisition the company the general partner newco 
noted above the company does not purchase the limited partnership interests newco 
and the seller entity retains portion the limited partnership interest newco seller entity 
interest 
most cases some all the selling shareholders enter into employment agreement the 
employment agreement with newco with initial term that ranges from three five years the 
employment term with automatic one year renewals unless employment terminated prior the 
end the employment term result selling shareholder becomes employee employed 
selling shareholder newco the employment employed selling shareholder can 
terminated the employed selling shareholder newco with without cause any time 
few situations selling shareholder does not become employed newco and not involved with 
newco following the closing those situations such selling shareholders sell their entire ownership 
interest the seller entity the closing the acquisition 
the compensation each employed selling shareholder specified the employment agreement 
and customary and commensurate with his her responsibilities based other employees 
similar capacities within newco the company and the industry 
the company and the selling shareholder including both employed selling shareholders and selling 
shareholders not employed newco execute non compete agreement the non compete 
agreement which restricts the selling shareholder from engaging competing business activities for 
specified period time the non compete term non compete agreement executed with 
the selling shareholders all cases that even the selling shareholder does not become 
employed selling shareholder the selling shareholder restricted from engaging competing 
business during the non compete term 
the non compete term commences the date the acquisition and expires the later 
two years after the date employed selling shareholders employment terminated the 
selling shareholder becomes employed selling shareholder 
five six years from the date the acquisition defined the non compete agreement 
regardless whether the selling shareholder employed newco 
the non compete agreement applies restricted region which defined mile radius from 
the therapy practice that employed selling shareholder permitted engage competing 
businesses activities outside the mile radius after such employed selling shareholder longer 
employed newco and selling shareholder who not employed newco immediately

seller entity and the seller entity obligated sell the company the allocable portion 
the seller entity interest based the terminated selling shareholder pro rata ownership 
interest the seller entity the allocable portion required redemption triggered 
when both the following events have occurred 
termination employed selling shareholder employment with newco regardless 
the reason for such termination and 
the expiration agreed upon period time typically three five years set 
forth the relevant partnership agreement the holding period 
the event employed selling shareholder employment terminates prior the 
expiration the holding period the required redemption would occur only upon expiration 
the holding period 
call option 
the event that employed selling shareholder employment terminates prior 
expiration the holding period the company has the contractual right but not the 
obligation acquire the employed selling shareholder allocable portion the seller 
entity interest from the seller entity through exercise the call option 
for the required redemption and the call option the purchase price derived from formula 
based specified multiple newco trailing twelve months earnings before interest taxes 
depreciation amortization and the company internal management fee plus allocable portion 
any undistributed earnings newco the redemption amount newco earnings are 
distributed monthly based available cash within newco therefore the undistributed earnings 
amount small any 
the purchase price for the initial equity interest purchased the company also based the 
same specified multiple the trailing twelve month earnings that used the required 
redemption noted above 
although the required redemption and the call option not have expiration date the seller 
entity interest eventually will purchased the company 
the required redemption and the call option never apply selling shareholders who not 
become employed newco since the company requires that such selling shareholders sell their 
entire ownership interest the seller entity the closing the acquisition

employed selling shareholder does not forfeit his her right his her full equity interest the 
seller entity and the seller entity does not forfeit its right any portion the seller entity interest 
the company only recourse against the employed selling shareholder for breach either the
