principal elements compensation 
the compensation our neos for fiscal consisted base salary and stock options including 
stock options granted prior fiscal years that continued vesting during fiscal and with respect 
certain neos rsus and variable cash compensation the relative proportion these components 
have not been dictated any particular formula and the mix and amount compensation elements 
has been and will continue within the discretion and business judgment our compensation 
committee 
with respect our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer well additional 
executive officer and founder who not neo for fiscal our compensation committee 
purposefully emphasized long term incentive compensation the form stock options align the 
officers long term interests with those our stockholders prior completing our ipo october 
our compensation committee determined maintain through the ipo and for some time 
thereafter straight forward executive compensation program for these executives that would continue 
foster ownership mentality emphasizing long term equity compensation the form stock 
options over cash compensation not currently provide these executive officers any form 
compensation other than base salary which the same for each these executives and the stock 
options granted prior our ipo date our compensation committee the view that this 
compensation approach appropriate for these most senior executive officers 
compensation for our other neos consists base salary stock options and with respect certain 
neos rsus our senior vice president global customer services was also eligible receive cash 
bonus based the achievement profitability goals our compensation committee has structured 
these compensation programs attract new senior executives provide competitive levels more 
liquid and less volatile compensation through base salary and rsus continue foster ownership 
mentality and alignment with the long term interests stockholders through the use rsus and 
stock options and encourage the achievement key operational goals 
base salary provide base salaries our neos compensate them for services rendered 
day day basis and provide sufficient fixed cash compensation allow them fund their personal 
and household expenses while remaining focused their responsibilities veeva 
since our ipo veeva has maintained largely flat annual base salary structure for our executive 
officers for fiscal year our compensation committee increased the base salary level for most 
our executive officers from this action was taken after observing that the total

available the time compensia evaluation for fiscal they were included our peer group for fiscal 
determinations 
executive compensation 
cash compensation for most our neos fell below the percentile our peer group even after 
factoring the likely cash equivalent impact rsus vesting during the year the one exception 
this policy was lequient due the variable cash incentive bonus associated with his role 
senior vice president global customer services lequient received base salary 
march our compensation committee increased lequient annual base salary from 
and eliminated his variable cash incentive bonus order standardize the 
base salaries all our executive officers therefore all our current neos have annual base 
salary for the remainder fiscal 
base salaries paid our neos for fiscal are reflected the summary compensation table 
below expect that our compensation committee will continue review base salary levels 
annually and may review them more frequently for example connection with promotion 
annual cash incentive bonuses with one exception have not offered short term cash 
incentive bonus program our neos since our ipo and our compensation committee again 
determined for fiscal not offer such program rather our board and compensation 
committee continue believe that our reliance equity compensation adequately facilitates the 
achievement corporate operational goals and aligns each neo with long term stockholder interest 
accordingly except described below none our neos were paid any cash incentive bonus for 
fiscal 
the one exception our policy not offering short term cash incentive bonuses has been for the 
executive officer the role senior vice president global customer services our compensation 
committee believed that competitive and provide appropriate incentive maintain profitable 
professional services business was advisable offer annual variable compensation the executive 
this role for fiscal defesche who held this position until was succeeded 
lequient march was paid aggregate variable cash compensation which 
equal global professional services profit for the first quarter fiscal pro rated for his 
time the role during the quarter global professional services profit for purposes this variable 
compensation calculation non gaap professional services net income which calculated 
excluding professional services income associated with certain new product lines from gaap 
professional services net income lequient who replaced defesche the role senior vice 
president global customer services was paid aggregate cash variable incentive bonuses totaling 
for fiscal which equal global professional services profit for the first 
quarter fiscal pro rated for his time the role during the quarter and global 
professional services profit for the remainder fiscal the global professional services profit for 
lequient variable compensation was calculated the same basis described above for 
defesche information about the variable cash compensation paid the senior vice president 
global customer services for fiscal included the summary compensation table below 
march our compensation committee consultation with our management determined that 
the executive the senior vice president global customer services role could adequately 
incentivized through stock options and rsus similar our other neos therefore starting fiscal 
the short term cash incentive bonus for our senior vice president global customer services 
currently lequient was suspended 
equity awards grant stock options and rsus from time time employees including our 
neos under our stock plans stock options allow our executive officers purchase shares our 
common stock price per share equal the fair market value our common stock the date 
grant our options typically have five year vesting schedule our compensation committee believes 
that options are inherently performance based because the holder benefits only our stock price 
veeva systems inc proxy statement 
executive compensation 
increases following the option grant date aligning the option holder interest closely with those our 
stockholders addition our rsu awards provide shares that will issued upon satisfaction 
service period vesting conditions typically over four year vesting schedule our compensation 
committee believes that grant rsu awards serves effective retention tool for our executive 
officers because unvested awards are forfeited executive officer voluntarily leaves before the 
awards have vested and because they have more readily ascertainable cash value and provide 
greater liquidity than stock options believe that the combination stock options and rsus our 
long term equity program emphasizes ownership culture and rewards our executives for growing 
our business 
fiscal our compensation committee granted rsus all our neos other than our chief 
executive officer and chief financial officer order provide competitive compensation using 
more liquid and less volatile means compared stock option grants fiscal and 
connection with joining veeva our compensation committee granted lequient stock options and 
rsus details regarding fiscal equity awards our neos set forth the summary 
compensation table and fiscal grants plan based awards table below 
perquisites retirement and other benefits generally not provide perquisites other 
benefits our neos other than those available employees generally have established 
tax deferred savings plan which permits participants including our neos make contributions 
salary deduction pursuant section the internal revenue code amended the

other compensation related policies 
executive officer recoupment policy 
have not adopted policy whether will make retroactive adjustments any cash equitybased incentive compensation paid our neos others where the payment was predicated upon 
the achievement financial results that were subsequently the subject restatement while 
not currently offer variable compensation based upon achievement financial results our 
compensation committee continues evaluate the adoption recoupment policy pending final

respectively information about these stock options can found the outstanding equity awards

executive compensation 
stock ownership guidelines trading and hedging policies 
our corporate governance principles encourage our executive officers own veeva stock 
not however have stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers that require ownership 
specific amount veeva stock because our compensation committee believes that the stock and 
option holdings our executive officers are sufficient this time align their interests with those 
our stockholders however continue evaluate the usefulness and appropriateness such 
guidelines from time time our executive officers are subject our insider trading policy that 
prohibits among other things hedging transactions veeva stock pledging veeva stock and holding 
veeva stock margin account among other restrictions 
compensation policies and practices they relate risk management 
our compensation committee has reviewed our compensation related risks and does not believe that 
our compensation policies and practices encourage undue inappropriate risk taking create risks 
that are reasonably likely have material adverse effect veeva since our straight forward 
executive compensation program continues foster ownership mentality emphasizing long term 
equity compensation over cash compensation 
tax and accounting considerations 
deductibility executive compensation 
section the code will limit the amount that may deduct from our federal income taxes for 
remuneration paid our executive officers one million dollars per executive officer per year unless 
certain requirements are met section provides exception from this deduction limitation for 
certain forms performance based compensation well for the gain recognized executive 
officers upon the exercise qualifying compensatory stock options gain from settlement restricted 
stock units and bonus payments executives may not tax deductible while our compensation 
committee mindful the benefit the full deductibility compensation and will consider 
deductibility when analyzing potential compensation alternatives our compensation committee 
believes that should not constrained the requirements section where those 
requirements would impair flexibility compensating our executive officers manner that can best 
promote our corporate objectives therefore our compensation committee has not adopted policy 
that requires that all compensation deductible fiscal there was limitation the 
deductibility compensation our executive officers under section 
gross ups parachute payments and deferred compensation 
did not provide any executive officer including any neo with gross up other reimbursement 
payment for any tax liability that she might owe result the application sections 
the code during fiscal and have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated 
provide any neos with such gross up other reimbursement 
accounting treatment

our subscription orders are generally billed beginning the subscription commencement date 
annual quarterly increments many our customers including many our large customers are

requires that the source data for russian nationals collected russian territory must 
stored russia 
anniversary date the initial order for related solution the terms such orders for additional end 
users solutions can for relatively short periods time often less than one year and payment 
terms may also quarterly therefore the annualized value such orders that enter into with our 
customers will not completely reflected deferred revenue any single point time have 
also agreed from time time and may agree the future allow customers change the renewal 
dates their orders for example align more closely with customer annual budget process 
align with the renewal dates other orders placed other entities within the same corporate control 
group change payment terms from annual quarterly vice versa such changes typically 
result order less than one year necessary align all orders the desired renewal date 
and thus may result lesser increase deferred revenue than the renewal date adjustment had 
not occurred additionally coterminus order less than one year renews the same fiscal year 
which was originally signed and has annual billing terms the order will generate more deferred 
revenue that fiscal year than the annual contract value that order accordingly not believe 
that change deferred revenue calculated billings metric commonly cited financial analysts 
that the sum the change deferred revenue plus revenue are accurate indicators future 
revenues for any given period time however many companies that provide cloud based software

overview 
veeva leading provider industry cloud solutions for the global life sciences industry 
were founded the premise that industry specific cloud solutions could best address the 
operating challenges and regulatory requirements the life sciences industry our products are 
designed meet the unique needs life sciences companies for their most strategic business 
functions from research and development commercialization our products are designed help 
life sciences companies bring products market faster and more efficiently market and sell more 
effectively and maintain compliance with government regulations 
veeva commercial cloud and particular veeva crm has made the vast majority our 
revenue historically our fiscal year ended january derived approximately our 
subscription services revenues and our total revenues from our veeva commercial cloud 
solutions the contribution subscription services revenues and total revenues associated with our 
veeva vault solutions are expected increase percentage subscription services revenues and 
total revenues going forward however compared veeva crm have less experience selling 
veeva vault and certain applications within veeva commercial cloud including veeva network our 
data offerings and our newer multichannel customer relationship management applications are 
now extending our solutions adjacent industries north america and europe including 
manufacturing both process and discrete and highly regulated services all types although certain 
our veeva vault applications have begun achieve meaningful market acceptance within the life 
sciences industry the extent that our more recently introduced solutions not continue achieve 
significant market acceptance our business and results operations may adversely affected

services revenues decline future periods generated net income million million 
and million for our fiscal years ended january and respectively 
january and served and customers respectively our customer 
totals for each our major solutions january were for veeva crm for veeva 
vault for veeva opendata and for veeva network single customer may counted more 
than one solution category the customer has purchased multiple solutions many our veeva vault 
applications are used smaller earlier stage pre commercial companies some which may not 
reach the commercialization stage thus the potential number veeva vault customers 
significantly higher than the potential number customers that use our commercial solutions 
additionally september completed our acquisition the companies referred 
zinc ahead all cash transaction are incorporating functionality from the zinc ahead 
products into our veeva vault promomats application have begun and will seek continue 
convert the end users the zinc ahead solutions our vault promomats application over time 
however may not retain and convert existing zinc ahead customers our vault promomats 
application the extent previously planned which could adversely affect our business customers 
who elect use zinc ahead zinc maps product will supported through least 
for further description our business and products see business above 
key factors affecting our performance 
adoption our solutions existing and new customers most our customers initially 
deploy our solutions limited number end users within division geography and may only 
initially deploy limited set our available solutions our future growth dependent upon our existing 
customers continued success and their renewals subscriptions our solutions expanded 
deployment our solutions within their organizations and their purchase subscriptions additional 
solutions our growth also dependent the adoption our solutions new customers 
subscription services revenue retention rate key factor our success the renewal 
and expansion our existing subscription agreements with our customers calculate our annual 
subscription services revenue retention rate for particular fiscal year dividing annualized 
subscription revenue the last day that fiscal year from those customers that were also 
customers the last day the prior fiscal year the annualized subscription revenue from all 
customers the last day the prior fiscal year annualized subscription revenue calculated 
multiplying the daily subscription revenue recognized the last day the fiscal year this 
calculation includes the impact our revenues from customer non renewals expanded deployment 
our solutions within their organizations deployments additional solutions discontinued use 
solutions our customers and price changes for our solutions historically the impact price 
changes our subscription services revenue retention rate has been minimal for our fiscal years 
ended january and our subscription services revenue retention rate was

investment growth have invested and intend continue invest aggressively 
expanding the breadth and depth our product portfolio expect continue invest research 
and development expand existing solutions and build new solutions sales and marketing 
promote our solutions new and existing customers and existing and expanded geographies and 
industries professional services ensure the success our customers implementations our 
solutions and other operational and administrative functions support our expected growth 
anticipate that our headcount will increase result these investments also expect our total 
operating expenses will continue increase over time which could have negative impact our 
operating margin 
mix subscription and professional services revenues believe our investments 
professional services have driven customer success and facilitated the further adoption our solutions 
our customers during the initial period deployment customer generally provide greater 
amount configuration implementation and training than later the deployment the same time 
many our customers have historically purchased subscriptions for limited set their total potential 
end users less than full adoption during their initial deployments result these factors the 
proportion total revenues for customer associated with professional services relatively high 
during the initial deployment period over time have observed and continue expect the mix 
total revenues shift more toward subscription services revenues result expect the 
proportion our total revenues from subscription services increase over time 
components results operations 
revenues 
derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees and professional services fees 
subscription services revenues consist fees from customers accessing our cloud based software 
solutions and subscription license fees for our data solutions addition our acquired zinc ahead 
business had limited number perpetual license agreements with accompanying maintenance and 
hosting fees have included such going maintenance and hosting fees our subscription 
services revenues professional services and other revenues consist primarily fees from 
implementation services configuration data services training and managed services related our 
solutions for our fiscal year ended january subscription services revenues constituted 
total revenues and professional services and other revenues constituted total revenues 
enter into master subscription agreements with our customers and count each distinct master 
subscription agreement that has not terminated expired and that has orders for which have 
recognized revenue quarter distinct customer for purposes determining our total number 
current customers the end that quarter generally enter into single master subscription 
agreement with each customer although some instances affiliated legal entities within the same 
corporate family may enter into separate master subscription agreements divisions subsidiaries and 
operating units our customers often place distinct orders for our subscription services under the 
same master subscription agreement and not count such distinct orders new customers for 
purposes determining our total customer count with respect data services customers that have 
not purchased one our software solutions count distinct customer the party each 
agreement that has known and recurring payment obligation for purposes determining our total 
customer count count each entity that uses legacy zinc ahead product distinct customer 
such entity not otherwise customer ours 
new subscription orders typically have one year term and automatically renew unless notice 
cancellation provided advance customer adds end users solutions existing order 
such additional orders will generally coterminus with the anniversary date the initial order and 
result orders for additional end users solutions will commonly have initial term less than one 
year subscription orders are generally billed the beginning the subscription commencement date 
annual quarterly increments because the term orders for additional end users solutions 
commonly less than one year and payment terms may also quarterly the annualized value such 
orders that enter into with our customers will not completely reflected deferred revenue any 
single point time have also agreed from time time and may agree the future allow 
customers change the renewal dates their orders for example align more closely with 
customer annual budget process align with the renewal dates other orders placed other 
entities within the same corporate control group change payment terms from annual quarterly 
vice versa such changes typically result order less than one year necessary align all 
orders the desired renewal date and thus may result lesser increase deferred revenue than 
veeva systems inc form 
the adjustment had not occurred additionally coterminus order less than one year renews 
the same fiscal year which was originally signed and has annual billing terms the order will 
generate more deferred revenue that fiscal year than the annual contract value that order 
accordingly not believe that change deferred revenue calculated billings metric 
commonly cited financial analysts that the sum the change deferred revenue plus revenue 
are accurate indicators future revenues for any given period time more recently and with respect 
solutions other than our core sales automation solution have begun enter into orders with 
terms five years such multi year orders are billed annual quarterly increments 
subscription services revenues are recognized ratably over the order term beginning when the 
solution has been provisioned the customer our subscription services agreements are generally 
non cancelable during the term although customers typically have the right terminate their 
agreements for cause the event material breach subscription services revenues are affected 
primarily the number customers the number end users other subscription usage metric 
each customer that uses our solutions and the number solutions subscribed each customer 
utilize our own professional services personnel and certain cases third party 
subcontractors perform our professional services engagements with customers our professional 
services engagements are primarily billed time and materials basis and revenues are typically 
recognized the services are rendered certain professional services revenues are based fixed 
fee arrangements and revenues are recognized based the proportional performance method 
some cases the terms our time and materials and fixed fee arrangements may require that defer 
the recognition revenue until contractual conditions are met those circumstances revenue 
recognition may sporadic based upon the achievement such contractual conditions professional 
services revenues are affected primarily our customers demands for implementation services

non gaap financial measures 
our public disclosures have provided non gaap measures which define financial 
information that has not been prepared accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the united states gaap addition our gaap measures use these non gaap measures 
internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and analyzing our financial results 
for the reasons set forth below believe that excluding the following items from our non gaap 
metrics provides information that helpful understanding our operating results evaluating our future 
prospects comparing our financial results across accounting periods and comparing our financial 
results our peers many which provide similar non gaap financial measures 
stock based compensation expenses exclude stock based compensation expenses from 
our non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that exclude from 
our internal management reporting processes also find useful exclude these expenses 
when assess the appropriate level various operating expenses and resource allocations 
when budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because varying 
available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety award types that 
veeva systems inc form 
companies can use under fasb asc topic believe excluding stock based 
compensation expenses allows investors make meaningful comparisons between our 
recurring core business operating results and those other companies 
amortization purchased intangibles incur amortization expense for purchased intangible 
assets connection with acquisitions certain businesses and technologies amortization 
intangible assets non cash expense and inconsistent amount and frequency because 
significantly affected the timing size acquisitions and the inherent subjective nature 
purchase price allocations because these costs have already been incurred and cannot 
recovered and are non cash expenses exclude these expenses for internal management 
reporting processes also find useful exclude these charges when assessing the 
appropriate level various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting 
planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use intangible assets 
contributed our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute our future 
period revenues well 
capitalization internal use software development expenses and the subsequent amortization 
the capitalized expenses capitalize certain costs incurred for the development 
computer software for internal use and then amortize those costs over the estimated useful life 
capitalization and amortization software development costs can vary significantly depending 
the timing products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
our internal management reporting processes exclude both the capitalization software which 
would otherwise result reduction net research and development operating expenses and 
the amortization capitalized software which would otherwise result increase cost 
subscription revenues when preparing budgets plans and reviewing internal performance 
moreover because the variety approaches taken and the subjective assumptions made 
other companies this area believe that excluding the effects capitalized software costs 
allows investors make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and 
those other companies 
income tax effects the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses the 
income tax effects that are excluded from the non gaap measures relate the imputed tax 
impact the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses due stockbased compensation purchased intangibles capitalized internal use software and deferred 
compensation associated with the zinc ahead business acquisition for gaap and non gaap 
measures 
limitations the use non gaap financial measures 
there are limitations using non gaap financial measures because non gaap financial 
measures are not prepared accordance with gaap and may different from non gaap financial 
measures provided other companies 
veeva systems inc form 
form 
deferred compensation associated with the zinc ahead business acquisition the zinc ahead 
share purchase agreement revised called for share purchase consideration deferred 
and paid rate one third the deferred consideration amount per year certain former 
zinc ahead employee shareholders and option holders who remain employed with each 
deferred consideration payment date accordance with gaap these payments are being 
accounted for deferred compensation and the expense recognized over the requisite 
service period view this deferred compensation expense unusual acquisition cost 
associated with the zinc ahead acquisition and find useful exclude order assess the 
appropriate level various operating expenses assist budgeting planning and forecasting 
future periods believe excluding this deferred compensation expense from our non gaap 
measures may allow investors make more meaningful comparisons between our recurring 
operating results and those other companies 
the non gaap financial measures are limited value because they exclude certain items that 
may have material impact upon our reported financial results addition they are subject inherent 
limitations they reflect the exercise judgments management about which items are adjusted 
calculate our non gaap financial measures compensate for these limitations analyzing current 
and future results gaap basis well non gaap basis and also providing gaap 
measures our public disclosures 
non gaap financial measures should not considered isolation from substitute for 
financial information prepared accordance with gaap encourage investors and others review 
our financial information its entirety not rely any single financial measure evaluate our 
business and view our non gaap financial measures conjunction with the most directly

the amounts the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally 
binding which specify significant terms including payment terms related services and the approximate 
timing the transaction obligations under agreements that can cancel without significant 
penalty are not included the table 
believe that our significant accounting policies which are described note the notes 
our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve greater degree 
judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies believe are the most critical aid 
fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results operations 
revenue recognition 
consider revenue recognition significant accounting policy for description our

consider compensation expense related stock based transactions including the 
assumptions used the determination the fair value option awards significant accounting 
policy for description our assumptions used for our stock based compensation policy see note

addition assumptions used determining the fair value each option award must also 
estimate forfeiture rate calculate the stock based compensation expense for our option awards 
our forfeiture rate based analysis our actual forfeitures will continue evaluate the 
appropriateness the forfeiture rate based actual forfeiture experience analysis employee 
turnover and other factors changes the estimated forfeiture rate can have significant impact 
our stock based compensation expense the cumulative effect adjusting the rate recognized 
the period the forfeiture rate revised revised forfeiture rate higher than the previously 
estimated forfeiture rate adjustment made that will result decrease the stock based 
compensation expense recognized the consolidated financial statements revised forfeiture rate 
lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate adjustment made that will result 
increase the stock based compensation expense recognized the consolidated financial 
statements 
will continue use judgment evaluating the assumptions related our stock based 
compensation expense prospective basis continue accumulate additional data related 
our common stock may have refinements our estimates which could materially impact our 
future stock based compensation expense 
valuation goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets when acquire businesses allocate the purchase price 
the tangible assets liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price 
recorded goodwill the allocation the purchase price requires management make significant 
estimates determining the fair value acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with 
respect intangible assets these estimates are based information obtained from management 
the acquired companies market participant data and historical experience these estimates can 
include but are not limited 
the time and expenses that would necessary recreate the asset 
the profit margin market participant would receive 
cash flows that asset expected generate the future and 
discount rates 
veeva systems inc form 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable change these estimates could 
impact our allocation purchase price the acquired assets and assumed liabilities during the 
measurement period which not exceed one year from the acquisition date may record 
adjustments the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset goodwill 
based updated estimate information facts and circumstances existing the acquisition date 
following the earlier receipt all necessary information determine the fair value assets
