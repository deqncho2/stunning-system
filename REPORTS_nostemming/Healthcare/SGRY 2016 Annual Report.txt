industry overview 
surgical facilities 
for many years government programs private insurance companies managed care organizations and self insured employers have 
implemented cost containment measures intended limit the growth healthcare expenditures these cost containment measures together 
with technological advances have contributed the significant shift the delivery healthcare services away from traditional inpatient 
hospital settings more cost effective surgical facilities including ascs and surgical hospitals ascs have been viewed successful way 
increase efficiency improving the quality and access healthcare and increasing patient satisfaction while simultaneously 
reducing costs surgical hospitals are larger than typical asc and include inpatient hospital rooms and some cases limited scope 
emergency department the offerings surgical hospital also include acute care services such diagnostic imaging pharmacy 
laboratory obstetrics physical therapy oncology and wound care the focus containing healthcare expenditures grows response 
the affordable care act surgical procedures are expected continue shift dramatically from inpatient outpatient settings 
increasing demand for surgical procedures outpatient settings 
according the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the percentage share outpatient surgery has increased from 
this shift has occurred for variety reasons including increase the number procedures that can 
performed safely outpatient environment the high quality outcomes lower cost the outpatient setting relative the inpatient 
setting patient preference due increased convenience physician preference due increased efficiency patient and payor preference due 
the lower cost setting 
advancements medical technology 
new technologies faster acting and more effective anesthesia and less invasive surgical techniques have increased the number 
procedures that can performed asc lasers arthroscopy enhanced endoscopic techniques and fiber optics have reduced the trauma 
and recovery time for patients advances the use anesthesia have shortened recovery time minimizing postoperative side effects 
such nausea and drowsiness procedures that only few years ago required major incisions long acting anesthetics and extended 
convalescence can now performed through closed techniques utilizing short acting anesthetics and with minimal recovery time these 
new techniques and technologies more complex surgical procedures that previously were performed only inpatient basis can now 
performed asc medicare often the benchmark for other insurance plans has approved approximately procedures 
performed surgery center believe that ascs are likely receive continued regulatory support more cost effective alternative 
surgical procedures can performed the asc setting compared the traditional inpatient hospital setting 
improved outcomes and convenience for patients lower costs 
ascs provide outstanding patient safety and superior clinical outcomes due the focus and specialization center professional 
staff ascs have lower rates inpatient hospital admission hospital acquired infections and mortality than hospital based outpatient 
surgery departments finally ascs often offer patients greater convenience than hospital outpatient departments with more convenient 
locations and ability schedule surgery 
compelling value proposition for physicians 
many physicians prefer surgical facilities over general acute care hospitals because greater scheduling flexibility more consistent 
nurse staffing and faster turnaround times between cases which allows physicians increase the number surgical procedures they can 
perform given period time due the non emergency elective nature most asc procedures physicians schedules are rarely 
interrupted enabling physicians more efficiently secure preferred blocks time the operating room this contrast acute care 
hospitals where medical emergencies often demand the unplanned use operating rooms and result the postponement delay 
scheduled surgical procedures disrupting physicians practices and inconveniencing patients physicians are also increasingly interested 
pursuing partnerships with other physicians order gain greater stability access scaled clinical and operating systems and pathway 
participating new payment models these partnerships help relieve physicians the financial and administrative burdens resulting from 
uncertainty regarding reimbursement and healthcare legislation addition our ancillary services provide support for our surgical 
specialists who are then relieved from the additional burden coordinating third party support services 
reduced costs for payors 
there has been increased focus controlling the growth healthcare expenditures and result cost containment measures have 
contributed the significant shift the delivery healthcare services away from traditional inpatient hospitals more cost effective 
alternate sites including ascs government programs private insurance companies managed care organizations and self insured employers 
have implemented these cost containment measures limit increases healthcare expenditures including procedure reimbursement 
addition patients are facing increased financial responsibility through higher pays and deductibles there increased consumerism 
patients are encouraged find more cost effective options for their healthcare surgery performed asc generally less expensive than 
hospital based outpatient surgery because lower facility development costs more efficient staffing and space utilization specialized 
operating environment focused quality care and aligned incentives for physicians and ascs control costs and improve efficiency 
procedure asc costs average approximately what the same procedure costs when performed hospital surgery 
department according ambulatory surgery center association analysis medicare fee schedules these cost savings will 
continue incentivize constituents across the healthcare continuum shift the delivery surgical procedures ascs 
ancillary services 
broad market ancillary and related services facilitates operational efficiencies for physicians the areas specialty where our 
physicians are focused the associated ancillary services include diagnostic laboratory multi specialty physician practices urgent care 
facilities anesthesia services optical services and specialty pharmacy services these industries represent approximately billion

acquisition program employ dedicated acquisition team with experience healthcare services our team seeks acquire surgical 
facilities that meet our criteria including prominence and quality physician partners specialty mix opportunities for growth level 
competition the local market level managed care penetration and our ability access managed care organization contracts our team 
utilizes its extensive industry contacts well referrals from current physician partners and other sources identify contact and develop 
potential acquisition candidates 
believe there are numerous acquisition opportunities that would pass our general screening criteria carefully evaluate each our 
acquisition opportunities through extensive due diligence process determine which facilities have the greatest potential for growth and 
profitability improvements under our operating structure many cases the acquisition team identifies specific opportunities enhance 
facility productivity post acquisition for example may renovate construct additional operating treatment rooms existing facilities 
meet anticipated demand for procedures based analysis local market characteristics our team may also identify opportunities 
attract additional physicians increase the acquired facility revenues and profitability 
development program develop surgical facilities markets which identify substantial interest physicians and payors 
have experience developing both single and multi specialty surgical facilities when develop new surgical facility generally provide 
all the services necessary complete the project offer house capabilities for structuring partnerships and financing facilities and work 
with architects and construction firms the design and development surgical facilities before and during the development phase new 
surgical facility analyze the competitive environment the local market review market data identify appropriate services provide 
prepare and analyze financial forecasts evaluate regulatory and licensing issues and assist designing the surgical facility and identifying 
appropriate equipment purchase lease after the surgical facility developed generally provide startup operational support including 
information systems equipment procurement and financing 
information systems and controls

the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra provides for medicare and medicaid incentive payments for eligible 
hospitals and professionals that implement and achieve meaningful use certified electronic health records ehr technology our surgical 
hospitals have implemented systems comply with the ehr meaningful use requirements the health information technology for economic 
and clinical health act the hitech act time qualify for the maximum available incentive payments compliance with the meaningful 
use requirements has and will continue result significant costs including business process changes professional services focused 
successfully designing and implementing ehr solutions along with costs associated with the hardware and software components the project 
calculate net revenues through combination manual and system generated processes our operating systems include insurance 
modules that allow establish profiles insurance plans and their respective payment rates the systems then match the charges with the 
insurance plan rates and compute contractual adjustment estimate for each patient account then manually review the reasonableness 
the systems contractual adjustment estimate using the insurance profiles this estimate adjusted needed when the insurance payment 
received and posted the account net revenues are computed and reported the systems result this activity 
our policy collect payments and deductibles prior providing services also our policy verify patient insurance 
hours prior the patient procedure because our services are primarily non emergency our surgical facilities have the ability control 
these processes not track exceptions these policies but believe that they occur infrequently and involve insignificant amounts 
when exceptions occur require patients whose insurance coverage not verified assume full responsibility for the fees prior services 
being rendered and seek prompt payment payments and deductibles and verification insurance following the procedure 
claims are submitted electronically the payor accepts electronic claims use clearinghouses for electronic claims which then forward 
the claims the respective payors payments are manually input the respective patient accounts 
have developed proprietary measurement tools track key operating statistics each our surgical facilities integrating data 
from our local operating systems and our financial reporting systems management uses these tools measure operating results against target 
thresholds and identify monitor and adjust areas such specialty mix staffing operating costs employee expenses and accounts receivable

revenue growth and improving operating income 
marketing 
primarily direct our sales and marketing efforts physicians who would utilize our surgical facilities marketing activities directed 
physicians and other healthcare providers are coordinated locally the individual surgical facility and are supplemented dedicated corporate 
personnel these activities generally emphasize the benefits offered our surgical facilities compared other facilities the market such 
the proximity our surgical facilities physicians offices the ability schedule consecutive cases without preemption inpatient 
emergency procedures the efficient turnaround time between cases our advanced surgical equipment and our simplified administrative 
procedures although the facility administrator the primary point contact physicians who utilize our surgical facilities are important sources 
recommendations other physicians regarding the benefits using our surgical facilities recruiting teams develop target list physicians 
and continually review our progress successfully recruiting additional local physicians 
also market our surgical facilities directly payors such health maintenance organizations hmos preferred provider 
organizations ppos and other managed care organizations and employers payor marketing activities conducted our corporate office 
management and facility administrators emphasize the high quality care cost advantages and convenience our surgical facilities and are 
focused making each surgical facility approved provider under local managed care plans 
competition 
each market which operate surgical facility compete with hospitals and operators other surgical facilities attract 
physicians and patients believe that the competitive factors that affect our surgical facilities ability compete for physicians are convenience 
location the surgical facilities access capital and participation managed care programs addition believe the national prominence 
scale and reputation our company are instrumental attracting physicians believe that our surgical facilities attract patients based upon 
our quality care the specialties and reputations the physicians who operate our surgical facilities participation managed care programs 
ease access and convenient scheduling and registration procedures 
developing acquiring existing surgical facilities compete with other public and private surgical facility and hospital companies 
several large national companies own and manage surgical facilities some cases connection with other lines business with which 
not compete including hca holdings inc surgical care affiliates inc envision healthcare corporation and tenet healthcare 
corporation also face competition from local hospitals physicians and other providers who may compete with the ownership and 
operation surgical facilities well the trend physicians choosing perform procedures office based setting rather than 
surgical facility 
seasonality 
our net revenue fluctuates based the number business days each calendar quarter because the majority services provided 
physicians our surgical facilities consist scheduled procedures and office visits that occur during business hours revenue the fourth 
quarter could also impacted increased utilization services due annual deductibles which are not usually met until later the 
year and also patients utilize their healthcare benefits before they expire year end

outpatient hospital surgical services hospital inpatient surgical services and outpatient surgical services provided our ascs 
medicare reimbursement hospital outpatient departments 
surgical services that are provided hospital outpatient departments hopds are generally reimbursed medicare the outpatient 
prospective payment system the opps the opps system established the secretary the department health and human services 
hhs that determines payment amounts prospectively for various categories medical services performed hopds november 
cms published its opps final rule for among other things the final rule provides for payment rate increase the 
rate increase based hospital market basket increase which reduced multi factor productivity adjustment and 
additional reduction required the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act and the health care and 
education reconciliation act together with the affordable care act the healthcare reform acts hospitals that not meet the 
reporting requirements the medicare hospital outpatient quality reporting program will subject additional payment rate 
decrease

most services under the opps instead beginning january these facilities will paid under the medicare physician fee schedule 
mpfs which will typically result lower reimbursements services provided dedicated emergency department will continue 
paid under the opps not expect this change impact reimbursement any our hopds but cannot assure you that our hopds 
will not impacted the future 
medicare reimbursement ascs 
payments under the medicare program ascs are also made based the opps however the payment received from the medicare

the inpatient prospective payment system ipps under the ipps hospital receives fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based 
each patient final assigned medicare severity diagnosis related group drg each drg assigned payment rate that 
prospectively set using national average resources used per case for treating patient with particular diagnosis this drg assignment

readmissions reduction program and hospital acquired conditions reduction programs that have been implemented hhs 
annual cost reports 
hospitals participating the medicare and some medicaid programs whether paid reasonable cost basis under prospective 
payment system are required meet certain financial reporting requirements federal and where applicable state regulations require submission 
annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided each hospital medicare beneficiaries 
and medicaid recipients annual cost reports required under the medicare and some medicaid programs are subject routine governmental 
audits these audits may result adjustments the amounts ultimately determined payable under these reimbursement programs 
finalization these audits often takes several years providers may appeal any final determination made connection with audit 
sources revenue ancillary and optical services 
our ancillary services segment derives revenue from the provision physician services and laboratory services the fees charged for 
ancillary and optical services depend the type service provided the location which the service provider and the provider the

private third party payors 
most third party payors reimburse for surgical and ancillary services pursuant written contract these contracts generally require 
that offer discounts from our established charges some our payments come from third party payors with which not have 
written contracts those situations commonly known out network services generally charge the patients the same payment 
other patient responsibility amounts that would have charged had had contract with the third party payor also submit claim

governmental regulation 
general 
the healthcare industry highly regulated and cannot provide any assurance that the regulatory environment which operate 
will not significantly change the future that will able successfully address any such changes 
every state imposes licensing requirements individual physicians and healthcare facilities addition federal and state laws 
regulate hmos and other managed care organizations many states require regulatory approval including licensure and accreditation and 
some cases certificates need before establishing certain types healthcare facilities including surgical hospitals and ascs offering 
certain services including the services offer making expenditures excess certain amounts for healthcare equipment facilities 
programs our ability operate profitably will depend part upon our surgical facilities obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses 
accreditation certificates need and other approvals and operating compliance with applicable healthcare regulations failure 
could have material adverse effect our business 
our surgical facilities are subject federal state and local laws dealing with issues such occupational safety employment medical 
leave insurance regulations civil rights discrimination building codes and medical waste and other environmental issues federal state and 
local governments are expanding the regulatory requirements businesses like ours the imposition these regulatory requirements may 
have the effect increasing operating costs and reducing the profitability our operations 
believe that hospital outpatient surgery physician laboratory and other diagnostic and healthcare services will continue 
subject intense regulation the federal and state levels are unable predict what additional government regulations any affecting 
our business may enacted the future how existing future laws and regulations might interpreted any our surgical 
facilities fail comply with applicable laws might have material adverse effect our business 
certificates need and licensure 
capital expenditures for the construction new healthcare facilities the addition beds new healthcare services the acquisition 
existing healthcare facilities may reviewable state regulators under statutory schemes that are sometimes referred certificate 
need laws states with certificate need laws place limits the construction and acquisition healthcare facilities and the expansion 
existing facilities and services these states approvals generally known certificates need are required for capital expenditures 
exceeding certain preset monetary thresholds for the development acquisition and expansion certain facilities services including 
surgical facilities have concentration surgical facilities certificate need states believe the regulations present 
competitive advantage existing operators 
our healthcare facilities also are subject state licensing requirements for medical providers our asc facilities have licenses 
operate the states which they operate and must meet all applicable requirements for ascs addition even though our surgical 
facilities that are licensed hospitals primarily provide surgical services they must meet all applicable requirements for general hospital 
licensure assure continued compliance with these regulations governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our surgical 
facilities the failure comply with these regulations could result the suspension revocation facility license addition based

healthcare reform 
the affordable care act has been subject number challenges its constitutionality june the united states 
supreme court upheld challenges the constitutionality the individual mandate provision which generally requires all individuals 
purchase healthcare insurance pay penalty but struck down unconstitutional the provision that would have allowed the federal 
government revoke all federal medicaid funding any state that did not expand its medicaid program result many states have 
refused extend medicaid eligibility more individuals envisioned the law 
june the united states supreme court upheld the legality premium subsidies made available the federal government 
individuals residing the states that have federally run health insurance exchanges the subsidies are provided low income individuals 
assist with the cost purchasing health insurance through federally run health insurance exchanges other legal challenges the affordable 
care act are pending 
initiatives repeal the affordable care act whole part delay elements implementation funding and offer 
amendments supplements modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase result the election the ultimate 
outcomes legislative attempts repeal amend the affordable care act and legal challenges the affordable care act are unknown 
results recent congressional elections and the change presidential administrations beginning could create political 
environment which substantial portions the affordable care act are repealed revised specifically president donald trump 
day action plan calls for full repeal the affordable care act and its replacement with health savings accounts cross states sales health 
insurance and modifications state managed medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment radical change the 
health care regulatory landscape are not clear and president trump has indicated that certain provisions the affordable care act such 
provisions restraining the ability insurers deny limit coverage based pre existing conditions mandating that parents have the 
ability extend insurance coverage their children until they turn should preserved march republican leadership the 
house representatives introduced legislation that would repeal substantial portions the affordable care act including the individual 
mandate the legislation would eliminate health care exchanges and would replace means tested insurance premium subsidies with ageadjusted tax credits the legislation would also limit federal funding available for the affordable care act medicaid expansion and 
transition federal medicaid funding per capita cap basis remains unclear what portions the affordable care act may 
remain what any replacement alternative programs may created any future legislation any such future repeal replacement 
may have significant impact the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may create reimbursement for services competing 
with the services offered the company accordingly there can assurance that the adoption any future federal state healthcare 
reform legislation will not have negative financial impact the company 
moreover other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted august 
the budget control act among other things created measures for spending reductions congress joint select committee 
deficit reduction tasked with recommending targeted deficit reduction least trillion for the years through was 
unable reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation automatic reduction several government programs this included 
aggregate reductions medicare payments providers per fiscal year which went into effect april and due 
subsequent legislative amendments will remain effect through unless additional congressional action taken january 
president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act which among other things further reduced medicare payments 
several providers including hospitals and increased the statute limitations period for the government recover overpayments 
providers from three five years these and other similar new laws may result additional reductions medicare and other health care 
funding which could have material adverse effect our financial operations 
medicare and medicaid private contractor audits 
cms has implemented number programs that use private contractors that contract with cms identify overpayments and 
underpayments and other potential sources billing fraud these contractors known recovery audit contractors racs and zone 
program integrity contractors zpics conduct both post payment and pre payment review claims submitted medicare providers 
addition cms employs medicaid integrity contractors mics perform post payment audits medicaid claims and identify 
overpayments our facilities and providers continue receive letters from auditors such racs and zpics requesting repayment 
alleged overpayments for services and incur expenses associated with responding and appealing these determinations well the costs 
repaying any overpayments moreover recent years the increase medicare payment appeals has created backlog such that 
resolving appeals often takes multiple years 
for instance recently received the results mic audit that resulted overpayment obligation hms federal solutions 
mic completed the audit one our surgical hospitals for the period july through may and determined overpayment 
obligation the amount approximately million based its extrapolation statistical sampling claims well civil 
monetary penalty the amount for total amount owed idaho department health and welfare medicaid program 
integrity unit approximately million for failure comply with medicaid rules billing for non covered services services 
provided non eligible providers iii services not provided and unauthorized services have appealed the audit and are currently 
awaiting the result 
although all other repayments requested date result rac mic and zpic audits have not been material our company 
are unable quantify the aggregate financial impact these audits our facilities given the pending appeals and uncertainty about the 
extent future audits 
quality improvement 
the medicare program presently requires hospitals and ascs report performance data variety quality metrics facilities that 
fail report are penalized with reduced medicare payments additionally payments hospitals are adjusted based the hospital 
performance these quality measures substantial portion hospital payment risk depending its individual performance relative 
benchmarks and other hospitals performance there substantial risk that our medicare payments could reduced our hospitals fail 
perform adequately these measures additionally there risk that medicare payments could reduced our facilities hospitals and 
ascs fail adequate report data required cms asc payments are not yet adjusted based performance against quality measures 
but there substantial risk that congress may soon link asc medicare payments actual performance addition reporting 
the public performance data becomes primary factor determining where patients choose receive care and competing 
hospitals and ascs have better results than our facilities those measures would expect that our patient volumes could decline 
medicare and medicaid participation 
the majority our revenue expected continue received from third party payors including federal and state programs such 
medicare and medicaid and commercial payors participate the medicare program and receive medicare payment our surgical 
facilities must comply with regulations promulgated the department health and human services hhs among other things these 
regulations known conditions for coverage conditions participation impose numerous requirements our facilities their

april cms issued policy memorandum that reaffirmed its prior interpretation its conditions participation that all 
hospitals other than critical access hospitals participating the medicare program are required provide basic emergency care 
interventions regardless whether not the hospital maintains emergency department our five facilities licensed hospitals are 
required meet this requirement maintain their participating provider status the medicare program december two 
our hospitals which not have emergency room maintain protocol for the transfer patients requiring emergency treatment which 
protocol may interpreted inconsistent with the cms policy memorandum our surgical facilities must also satisfy the conditions

medicaid are subject change and order remain qualified for these programs may have make changes from time time our 
facilities equipment personnel services although intend continue participate these reimbursement programs cannot 
assure you that our surgical facilities will continue qualify for participation 
the affordable care act and its implementing regulations require hospital provide written disclosure physician ownership 
interests the hospital patients and the hospital website and any advertising along with annual reports the government detailing 
such interests additionally hospitals that not have physician coverage are required inform patients this fact and receive signed 
acknowledgment from the patients the disclosure hospital provider agreement may terminated fails provide the required

providers intend for all our facilities meet their disclosure obligations 
survey and accreditation 
hospitals and healthcare facilities are subject periodic inspection federal state and local authorities determine their compliance 
with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing certification and accreditation all our hospitals and surgical 
facilities currently are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified participate the medicare and medicaid programs

federal anti kickback statute and medicare fraud and abuse laws 
the social security act includes provisions addressing false statements illegal remuneration and other instances fraud and abuse 
federal health care programs these provisions include the statute commonly known the federal anti kickback statute the antikickback statute the anti kickback statute prohibits providers and others from among other things soliciting receiving offering 
paying directly indirectly any remuneration return for either making referral for ordering arranging for recommending the 
order any item service covered federal healthcare program including but not limited the medicare and medicaid 
programs violations the anti kickback statute are criminal offenses punishable imprisonment and fines for each 
violation civil violations are punishable fines for each violation well damages three times the total 
amount remuneration received from the government for healthcare claims 
because physician investors our surgical facilities are position generate referrals the facilities the distribution available 
cash those investors could come under scrutiny under the anti kickback statute some courts have held that the anti kickback statute 
violated one purpose opposed primary the sole purpose payment provider induce referrals further section 
the affordable care act amends the anti kickback statute adding provision clarify that person need not have actual 
knowledge such section specific intent commit violation the anti kickback statute because none these cases involved joint 
venture such those owning and operating our surgical facilities not clear how court would apply these holdings our activities 
clear however that physician investment income from surgical facility may not vary with the number his her referrals the 
surgical facility and believe that comply with this prohibition 
under regulations issued the oig certain categories activities are deemed not violate the anti kickback statute commonly 
referred the safe harbors according the preamble these safe harbor regulations the failure particular business arrangement 
comply with the regulations does not determine whether the arrangement violates the anti kickback statute the safe harbor regulations 
not make conduct illegal but instead outline standards that complied with protect conduct that might otherwise deemed violation 
the anti kickback statute failure meet safe harbor does not indicate that the arrangement violates the anti kickback statute although 
may subject additional scrutiny 
believe the ownership and operations our surgery centers and hospitals not fit wholly within any the safe harbors but 
attempt structure our ascs fit closely possible within the safe harbor designed protect distributions physician investors 
ascs who directly refer patients the asc and personally perform the procedures the center extension their practice the asc 
safe harbor the asc safe harbor protects four categories investors including ascs owned general surgeons singlespecialty physicians multi specialty physicians and hospital physician joint ventures provided that certain requirements are 
satisfied these requirements include the following 
the asc must certified participate the medicare program and its operating and recovery room space must 
dedicated exclusively the center and not part hospital although such space may leased from hospital such 
lease meets the requirements the safe harbor for space rental 
each investor must either physician who derived least one third his her medical practice income for the 
previous fiscal year month period from performing procedures the list medicare covered procedures for ascs 
hospital person entity not position make influence referrals the center nor provide items 
services the center nor employed the center any investor 
unless all physician investors are members single specialty each physician investor must perform least one third 
his her procedures the asc each year this requirement addition the requirement that the physician investor has 
derived least one third his her medical practice income for the past year from performing procedures 
physician investors must have fully informed their referred patients the physician investment 
the terms which investment interest offered investor are not related the previous expected volume 
referrals services furnished the amount business otherwise generated from that investor the entity 
neither the asc nor any other investor nor any person acting their behalf may loan funds guarantee loan for 
investor the investor uses any part such loan obtain the investment interest 
the amount payment investor return for the investment interest directly proportional the amount the capital 
investment including the fair market value any pre operational services rendered that investor 
all physician investors any hospital investor and the center agree treat patients receiving benefits assistance under 
federal healthcare program non discriminatory manner 
all ancillary services performed the asc for beneficiaries federal healthcare programs must directly and integrally 
related primary procedures performed the center and may not billed separately 
hospital investor may include its cost report any claim for payment from federal healthcare program any costs 
associated with the asc 
the asc may not use equipment owned services provided hospital investor unless such equipment leased 
accordance with lease that complies with the anti kickback statute equipment rental safe harbor and such services are 
provided accordance with contract that complies with the anti kickback statute personal services and management 
contract safe harbor 
hospital investor may position make influence referrals directly indirectly any other investor the 
center 
believe that the ownership and operations our surgical centers will not satisfy this asc safe harbor for investment interests 
ascs because among other things one our subsidiaries will generally investor and provide management services each 
asc cannot assure you that the oig would view our activities favorably even though strive achieve compliance with the 
remaining elements this safe harbor 
addition although expect each physician investor utilize our ascs extension his her practice and ask each 
physician investor certify this practice cannot assure you that all physician investors will derive least one third their medical 
practice income from performing medicare covered asc procedures perform one third their procedures the centers inform their 
referred patients their investment interests interests our joint venture ascs are purchased what believe fair market 
value investors who purchase later time generally pay more for given percentage interest than founding investors the result that 
while all investors are paid distributions accordance with their ownership interests for ascs where there are later purchases cannot 
meet the safe harbor requirement that return investment directly proportional the amount capital investment the oig has 
several occasions reviewed investments relating ascs and advisory opinion raised concerns that purchases interests 
from physicians might yield gains investment rather than capital infusion the ascs such purchases could meant reward 
influence the selling physicians referrals the asc the hospital and such returns might not directly proportional the amount 
capital invested nonetheless believe our fair market value purchase requirements and distribution policies comply with the antikickback statute 
oig advisory opinion july the oig concluded that arrangement involving asc joint venture between 
hospital and physicians involving the combination their two ascs into single larger center presented minimal risk fraud abuse 
despite the fact that did not fit within any applicable anti kickback safe harbors additionally the oig stated that fair market value should 
determined based only the tangible assets each facility since the physician investors are referral sources for the asc the oig 
stated that cash flow based valuation the business contributed the physician investors potentially would include the value the 
physician investors referrals over the time that their asc was existence prior the merger with the hospital asc the oig went 
note that valuation involving intangible assets would not necessarily result violation the anti kickback statute but would require 
review all the facts and circumstances not clear whether the oig concerned about using cash flow based valuation most 
healthcare transactions involving referral sources just transactions similar this one where the parties contributions would valued 
differently for contributing the same assets only one party contribution valued going concern based cash flow also the oig 
appears focused historical cash flow rather than projected discounted cash flow which commonly used valuation 
methodology what clear that for the first time the oig addressed valuation methodologies which could lead increased scrutiny 
all transactions involving physicians 
our hospital investments not fit wholly within the safe harbor for investments small entities because more than the 
investment interests are held investors who are either position refer the hospital who provide services the hospital and 
more than the hospital gross revenue last year were derived from referrals generated investors however believe 
comply with the remaining elements the safe harbor 
addition the physician ownership our surgical facilities other financial relationships ours with potential referral sources could 
potentially scrutinized under the anti kickback statute have entered into management agreements manage the majority our 
surgical facilities most these agreements call for our subsidiary paid percentage based management fee although there safe 
harbor for personal services and management contracts the personal services and management safe harbor the personal services and 
management safe harbor requires among other things that the amount the aggregate compensation paid the manager over the term 
the agreement set advance because our management fees are generally based percentage revenue our management agreements 
not typically meet this requirement however believe that our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements the 
personal services and management safe harbor for personal services and management contracts the oig has taken the position several 
advisory opinions that percentage based management agreements are not protected safe harbor and consequently may violate the antikickback statute have implemented formal compliance programs designed safeguard against overbilling and believe that our 
management agreements comply with the requirements the anti kickback statute however cannot assure you that the oig would 
find our compliance programs adequate that our management agreements would found comply with the anti kickback statute 
certain our ascs have entered into arrangements for professional services including arrangements for anesthesia services 
special advisory bulletin issued april the oig focused questionable contractual arrangements where health care provider 
one line business the owner expands into related health care business contracting with existing provider related item 
service the manager supplier provide the new item service the owner existing patient population including federal health care 
program patients called suspect contractual joint ventures the manager supplier not only manages the new line business but 
may also supply with inventory employees space billing and other services other words the owner contracts out substantially the 
entire operation the related line business the manager supplier otherwise potential competitor receiving return the profits the 
business remuneration for its referrals through advisory opinion the oig extended this suspect contractual joint venture analysis 
arrangements between anesthesiologists and physician owners ascs advisory opinion the oig concluded that certain 
proposed arrangements between anesthesia groups and physician owned ascs could result prohibited remuneration under the federal 
anti kickback statute believe our arrangements for anesthesia services are distinguishable from those described advisory opinion 
may and are compliance with the requirements the federal anti kickback statute however cannot assure you 
that regulatory authorities would agree with that position 
also may guarantee surgical facility third party debt financing and certain lease obligations part our obligations under 
management agreement physician investors are generally not required enter into similar guarantees the oig might take the position that 
the failure the physician investors enter into similar guarantees represents special benefit the physician investors given induce 
patient referrals and that such failure constitutes violation the anti kickback statute believe that the management fees and some 
cases guarantee fees are adequate compensation for the credit risk associated with the guarantees and that the failure the physician 
investors enter into similar guarantees does not create material risk violating the anti kickback statute however the oig has not 
issued any guidance this regard 
the oig authorized issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability the anti kickback statute including 
whether activity constitutes grounds for the imposition civil criminal sanctions have not however sought such opinion 
regarding any our arrangements were determined that our activities those our surgical facilities hospitals violate the antikickback statute our subsidiaries our officers our directors and each surgical facility and hospital investor could subject 
individually substantial monetary liability prison sentences and exclusion from participation any healthcare program funded 
whole part the government including medicare medicaid tricare state healthcare programs 
evolving interpretations current the adoption new federal state laws regulations could affect many our 
arrangements law enforcement authorities including the oig the courts and congress are increasing their scrutiny arrangements 
between healthcare providers and potential referral sources ensure that the arrangements are not designed mechanism exchange 
remuneration for patient care referrals opportunities investigators have also demonstrated willingness look behind the formalities 
business transaction determine the underlying purposes payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
federal physician self referral law 
congress has enacted the federal physician self referral law stark law that prohibits certain self referrals for healthcare services 
currently enacted the stark law prohibits practitioner including physician dentist podiatrist from referring patients entity with 
which the practitioner member his her immediate family has financial relationship for the provision certain designated 
health services that are paid for whole part medicare medicaid unless exception applies the term financial relationship 
broadly defined and includes most types ownership and compensation relationships the stark law also prohibits the entity from 
seeking payment from medicare medicaid for services that are rendered through prohibited referral entity paid for services 
provided through prohibited referral may required refund the payments violations the stark law may also result the 
imposition damages equal three times the amount improperly claimed and civil monetary penalties per prohibited 
claim and per prohibited circumvention scheme and exclusion from participation the medicare and medicaid programs for the 
purposes the stark law the term designated health services defined include 
clinical laboratory services 
physical therapy services 
occupational therapy services 
radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging computerized axial tomography scan and ultrasound services 
radiation therapy services and supplies 
durable medical equipment and supplies 
parenteral and enteral nutrients equipment and supplies 
prosthetics orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies 
home health services 
outpatient prescription drugs and 
inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
the list designated health services does not however include surgical services that are provided ascs furthermore final stark 
law regulations published hhs january the term designated health services was specifically defined not include services 
that are reimbursed medicare part composite rate such services that are provided ascs however designated health 
services are provided asc and separately billed referrals the asc physician investor would prohibited the stark 
law because our facilities that are licensed ascs not have independent laboratories and not provide designated health services 
apart from surgical services not believe referrals these facilities physician investors are prohibited legislation regulations 
are implemented that prohibit physicians from referring patients surgical facilities which the physician has beneficial interest our 
business and financial results would materially adversely affected 
five our facilities are licensed hospitals december the stark law currently includes the whole hospital 
exception which applies physician ownership hospital provided such ownership the whole hospital and the physician 
authorized perform services the hospital believe that physician investments our facilities licensed hospitals meet this 
requirement however changes the whole hospital exception have been the subject recent regulatory action and legislation changes 
the affordable care act include 
prohibition hospitals from having any physician ownership unless the hospital already had physician ownership and 
medicare provider agreement effect december 
limitation the percentage total physician ownership investment interests the hospital entity whose assets 
include the hospital the percentage physician ownership investment march 
prohibition from expanding the number beds operating rooms and procedure rooms for which licensed after 
march unless the hospital obtains exception from the secretary 
requirement that return investment proportionate the investment each investor 
restrictions preferential treatment physician versus non physician investors 
requirement for written disclosures physician ownership interests the hospital patients and the hospital website 
and any advertising along with annual reports the government detailing such interests 
prohibition the hospital other investors from providing financing physician investors 
requirement that any hospital that does not have physician coverage inform patients this fact and receive signed 
acknowledgments from the patients the disclosure and 
prohibition grandfathered status for any physician owned hospital that converted from asc hospital after 
march 
the affordable care act also requires that each hospital with physician ownership submit annual report ownership and 
investment interest our hospitals have submitted their first reports cms has delayed the collection the second report and publication 
the first annual report cannot predict whether other proposed amendments the whole hospital exception will included any 
future legislation including repeal the affordable care act congress will adopt any similar provisions that would prohibit 
otherwise restrict physicians from holding ownership interests hospitals any such changes could have adverse effect our financial 
condition and results operations 
addition the physician ownership our surgical facilities have other financial relationships with potential referral sources that 
potentially could scrutinized under the stark law have entered into personal service agreements such medical director 
agreements with physicians our hospitals believe that our agreements with referral sources satisfy the requirements the personal 
service arrangements exception the stark law and have implemented formal compliance programs designed ensure continued 
compliance however cannot assure you that the oig cms would find our compliance programs adequate that our 
agreements with referral sources would found comply with the stark law 
false and other improper claims 
the government authorized impose criminal civil and administrative penalties any person entity that files false claim 
for payment from the medicare medicaid programs other federal and state healthcare programs claims filed with private insurers can 
also lead criminal and civil penalties including but not limited penalties relating violations federal mail and wire fraud statutes 
well penalties under the anti fraud provisions hipaa while the criminal statutes are generally reserved for instances fraudulent 
intent the government applying its criminal civil and administrative penalty statutes ever expanding range 
circumstances for example the government has taken the position that pattern claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services 
violates these statutes the claimant merely should have known the services were unnecessary even the government cannot demonstrate 
actual knowledge the government has also taken the position that claiming payment for low quality services violation these 
statutes the claimant should have known that the care being provided was substandard 
over the past several years the government has investigated increasing number healthcare providers for potential violations 
the federal false claims act the federal false claims act prohibits person from knowingly presenting causing presented 
false fraudulent claim the government the statute defines knowingly include not only actual knowledge claim falsity 
but also reckless disregard for intentional ignorance the truth falsity claim the fraud enforcement and recovery act 
further expanded the scope the false claims act among other things creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding 
decreasing obligation pay money the federal government the affordable care act also created federal false claims act liability for 
the knowing failure report and return overpayment within days the identification the overpayment the date which 
corresponding cost report due whichever later this requirement has led increasing use the self disclosure protocols that have 
been implemented cms the oig and other governmental agencies the healthcare industry the affordable care act also provided that 
claims submitted connection with patient referrals that result from violations the anti kickback statute constitute false claims for the 
purposes the federal false claims act and some courts have held that violation the stark law can result false claims act liability 
well because our surgical facilities perform hundreds similar procedures year for which they are paid medicare and other 
government health care programs and there relatively long statute limitations billing error cost reporting error could result 
significant civil criminal penalties 
under the qui tam whistleblower provisions the false claims act private parties may bring actions behalf the 
government these private parties often referred relators are entitled share any amounts recovered the government through 
trial settlement both whistleblower lawsuits and direct enforcement activity the government have increased significantly recent 
years and have increased the risk that healthcare company like will have defend false claims action pay fines excluded from 
the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs result investigation resulting from 
whistleblower case although believe that our operations materially comply with both federal and state laws they may nevertheless 
the subject whistleblower lawsuit may otherwise challenged scrutinized governmental authorities providers found liable for 
false claims act violations are subject damages three times the actual damage sustained the government plus mandatory civil 
monetary penalties between and for each separate false claim determination that have violated these laws could have 
material adverse effect 
other fraud and abuse laws 
the medicare patient and program protection act amended the health insurance portability and accountability act 
hipaa and the balanced budget act impose civil monetary penalties and exclusion from state and federal healthcare 
programs providers who commit violations fraud and abuse laws hipaa authorizes the secretary the department health 
human services secretary and some cases requires the secretary exclude individuals and entities that the secretary determines 
have committed act violation applicable fraud and abuse laws improperly filed claims violation such laws from 
participating any federal healthcare program hipaa also expanded the secretary authority exclude person involved fraudulent 
activity from participating program providing health benefits whether directly indirectly whole part the government 
additionally under hipaa individuals who hold direct indirect ownership controlling interest entity that found violate 
these laws may also excluded from medicare and medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the individual knew 
should have known acted with deliberate ignorance reckless disregard the truth falsity the information the activity leading 
the conviction exclusion the entity where the individual officer managing employee such entity this standard does not 
require that specific intent defraud proven oig under hipaa also crime defraud any commercial healthcare benefit

federal and state privacy and security requirements 
january cms published its edition international statistical classification diseases and related health 
problems icd and related changes the formats used for certain electronic transactions icd contains significantly more 
diagnostic and procedural codes than the existing icd coding system and result the coding for the services provided our surgical 
facilities and hospitals require much greater specificity icd has required significant investment technology and training met 
cms october deadline for icd implementation 
are subject hipaa including the hitech act which was enacted part the american recovery and reinvestment act 
the hitech act strengthened the requirements and significantly increased the penalties for violations the hipaa privacy and 
security regulations january hhs issued the hipaa omnibus rule which became effective march prior the 
hipaa omnibus rule the hitech act required notify patients any unauthorized access acquisition disclosure their 
unsecured protected health information that poses significant risk financial reputational other harm patient the hipaa omnibus 
rule eliminated this harm threshold standard and instead are now required notify patients any unauthorized access acquisition 
disclosure their unsecured protected health information all situations except those which can demonstrate that there low 
probability that the protected health information has been compromised now have the burden demonstrating through risk 
assessment that breach protected health information has not occurred this new more objective standard may lead increased 
number occurrences that require breach notifications addition the hipaa omnibus rule also modified the following aspects the 
hipaa privacy and security regulations 
makes our facilities business associates directly liable for compliance with certain hipaa requirements 
makes our facilities liable for violations their business associates hhs determines agency relationship exists between 
the facility and the business associate under federal agency law 
adds limitations the use and disclosure health information for marketing and fund raising purposes and prohibits the

although the security standards not reference advocate specific technology and covered healthcare providers plans and 
clearinghouses have the flexibility choose their own technical solutions the security standards have required implement significant 
new systems business procedures and training programs 
violations the hipaa privacy and security regulations may result civil and criminal penalties the hitech act strengthened the 
requirements the hipaa privacy and security regulations and significantly increased the penalties for violations introducing tiered 
penalty system with penalties per violation with maximum civil penalty million calendar year for violations 
the same requirement however single breach incident can result violations multiple requirements resulting possible penalties 
well excess million under the hitech act hhs required conduct periodic compliance audits covered entities and their

program that concluded december the first phase hhs implementation the hitech act requirements periodic audits 
covered entities and business associates ensure their compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations hhs has allocated 
increased funding towards hipaa enforcement activity and such enforcement activity has seen marked increase over recent years 
cannot predict whether our surgical facilities will able comply with the final rules and the financial impact our surgical facilities 
implementing the requirements under the final rules when they take effect whether our hospitals will selected for audit the 
results such audit 
our facilities also remain subject any state laws that relate privacy the reporting data breaches that are more restrictive than

hipaa administrative simplification requirements 
the hipaa transaction regulations were issued encourage electronic commerce the healthcare industry these regulations include 
standards that healthcare providers must follow when electronically transmitting certain healthcare transactions such healthcare claims 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
our hospitals are subject the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala this federal law requires any 
hospital that participates the medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every person who presents 
the hospital emergency department for treatment and the patient suffering from emergency medical condition either stabilize 
that condition make appropriate transfer the patient facility that can handle the condition the obligation screen and stabilize 
emergency medical conditions transfer exists regardless patient ability pay for treatment off campus facilities such surgery 
centers that lack emergency departments otherwise not treat emergency medical conditions generally are not subject emtala 
they must however have policies place that explain how the location should proceed emergency situation such transferring the 
patient the closest hospital with emergency department there are severe penalties under emtala hospital fails screen 
appropriately stabilize transfer patient the hospital delays appropriate treatment order first inquire about the patient ability 
pay including civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation the government health care programs addition injured 
patient the patient family medical facility that suffers financial loss direct result another hospital violation the law can 
bring civil suit against that other hospital cms has actively enforced emtala and has indicated that will continue the 
future although believe that our hospitals comply with emtala cannot predict whether cms will implement new requirements 
the future and whether our hospitals will comply with any new requirements 
state regulation 
many the states which our surgical facilities operate have adopted statutes and regulations that prohibit the payment 
kickbacks any type remuneration exchange for patient referrals and that prohibit healthcare providers from certain circumstances 
referring patient healthcare facility which the provider has ownership investment interest while these statutes generally 
mirror the federal anti kickback statute and stark law they vary widely their scope and application some are specifically limited 
healthcare services that are paid for whole part the medicaid program others apply all healthcare services regardless payor 
and others apply only state defined designated services which may differ from the designated health services under the stark law 
addition many states have adopted statutes that mirror the false claims act and that prohibit the filing false fraudulent claim with 
state governmental agency intend comply with all applicable state healthcare laws rules and regulations however these laws 
rules and regulations have typically been the subject limited judicial and regulatory interpretation result cannot assure you that 
our surgical facilities will not investigated scrutinized the governmental authorities empowered challenged that their 
activities would found lawful determination non compliance with the applicable state healthcare laws rules and regulations 
could subject our surgical facilities civil and criminal penalties and could have material adverse effect our operations 
are also subject various state insurance statutes and regulations that prohibit from submitting inaccurate incorrect 
misleading claims many state insurance laws and regulations are broadly worded and could implicated for example our surgical 
facilities were adjust out network payment other patient responsibility amounts without fully disclosing the adjustment the 
claim submitted the payor while some our surgical facilities adjust the out network costs patient payment and deductible 
amounts reflect network payment costs when providing services patients whose health insurance covered payor with 
which the surgical facilities are not contracted our policy fully disclose adjustments the claims submitted the payors believe 
that our surgical facilities are compliance with all applicable state insurance laws and regulations regarding the submission claims 
cannot assure you however that none our surgical facilities insurance claims will ever challenged were found violation 
state insurance laws regulations could forced discontinue the violative practice which could have adverse effect our 
financial position and results operations and could subject fines and criminal penalties 
fee splitting corporate practice medicine 
the laws many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non physicians sharing percentage professional fees 
prohibit non physician entities such from practicing medicine and exercising control over employing physicians and prohibit 
referrals facilities which physicians have financial interest the existence interpretation and enforcement these laws vary 
significantly from state state light these restrictions certain states facilitate the provision physician services maintaining 
long term management services agreements through our subsidiaries with affiliated professional contractors which employ contract with 
physicians and other healthcare professionals provide physician professional services under these arrangements our subsidiaries perform 
only non medical administrative services not represent that they offer medical services and not exercise influence control over the 
practice medicine the physicians employed the affiliated professional contractors although believe that the fees receive 
from affiliated professional contractors have been structured manner that compliant with applicable fee splitting laws possible 
that government regulator could interpret such fee arrangements violation certain fee splitting laws future interpretations 
changes these laws might require structural and organizational modifications our existing relationships and cannot assure you that 
would able appropriately modify such relationships addition statutes some states could restrict our expansion into those 
states 
clinical laboratory regulation 
our clinical laboratories are subject federal oversight under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia 
which extends federal oversight virtually all clinical laboratories requiring that they certified the federal government 
federally approved accreditation agency clia requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance quality control and personnel 
standards laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject inspections standards for testing under clia are based 
the complexity the tests performed the laboratory with tests classified high complexity moderate complexity waived 
laboratories performing high complexity testing are required meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories 
laboratories performing only waived tests which are tests determined the food and drug administration have low potential for error 
and requiring little oversight may apply for certificate waiver exempting them from most the requirements clia our operations 
also subject state and local laboratory regulation clia provides that state may adopt laboratory regulations different from more 
stringent than those under federal law and number states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements state laws 
may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications specify certain quality controls require maintenance certain records 
believe that are material compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements but assurances can given that our 
laboratories will pass all future licensure certification inspections 
regulatory compliance program 
our policy conduct our business with integrity and compliance with the law have place and continue enhance 
company wide compliance program that focuses all areas regulatory compliance including billing reimbursement cost reporting 
practices and contractual arrangements with referral sources 
this regulatory compliance program intended help ensure that high standards conduct are maintained the operation our

these risks and uncertainties are discussed below any the following risks other risks and uncertainties actually occurred our 
business financial condition and operating results could suffer 
risks related our business and industry 
depend payments from third party payors including government healthcare programs and managed care organizations 
these payments are reduced eliminated our revenue and profitability could materially and adversely affected 
depend upon private and governmental third party sources payment for the services provided physicians our physician 
network patients our surgical facilities and our laboratory and diagnostic services the amount that receive payment for our 
services may adversely affected market and cost factors that not control including medicare medicaid and state regulation 
changes cost containment decisions and changes reimbursement schedules payors legislative changes refinements the medicare 
ambulatory surgery center payment system and refinements made cms medicare reimbursement policies for instance cuts the 
federal budget caused reduction medicare provider payments starting similarly third party payors may successful 
negotiating reduced reimbursement schedules with our facilities fixed fee schedules capitation payment arrangements exclusion from 
participation inability reach agreements with managed care programs reduction elimination payments increase the 
payments rate that less than the increase our costs other factors affecting payments for healthcare services over which have 
control could have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
are unable negotiate and enter into favorable contracts maintain satisfactory relationships and renew existing contracts 
favorable terms with managed care organizations other private third party payors our revenue and profitability may 
decrease 
payments from private third party payors including state workers compensation programs and managed care organizations 
represented approximately and our patient service revenue for the years ended december and 
respectively most these payments came from third party payors with which our facilities have contracts managed care companies such 
hmos and ppos which offer prepaid and discounted medical service packages represent growing segment private third party 
payors fail enter into favorable contracts maintain satisfactory relationships with managed care organizations our revenue may 
decrease our competitive position has been and will continue affected initiatives undertaken during the past several years 
major purchasers healthcare services including insurance companies and employers revise payment methods and monitor healthcare 
expenditures effort contain healthcare costs for instance managed care payors may lower reimbursement rates response 
increased obligations payors imposed the affordable care act future reductions medicare reimbursement rates further managed 
care payors may narrow their provider networks response the need negotiate lower reimbursement rates with providers are 
unable maintain strong relationships with payors may not able ensure participation these narrow provider networks cost 
containment measures such fixed fee schedules capitation payment arrangements reductions reimbursement schedules third party 
payors and closed provider networks could also cause reduction our revenue the future 
some our payments from third party payors come from third party payors with which our surgical facilities physicians 
subsidiaries that provide diagnostic services not have contract those cases where provide services patient that does not use 
third party payor with which have contracted commonly known out network services generally charge the patients the same 
payment other patient responsibility amounts that would have charged had our surgical facilities had contract with the payor 
accordance with insurance laws and regulations submit claim for the services the payor along with full disclosure that our surgical 
facility has charged the patient network patient responsibility amount historically those third party payors who not have contracts 
with our surgical facilities typically have paid our claims higher than comparable contracted rates however over the past five years 
have observed increase third party payors adopting out network fee schedules that are more comparable our contracted rates 
take other steps discourage their enrollees from seeking treatment out network surgical facilities these cases seek enter into 
contracts with the payors 
payments from workers compensation payors represented approximately our patient service revenue for the year ended 
december majority states have implemented workers compensation provider fee schedules some cases the fee schedule 
rates contain lower rates than the rates our surgical facilities have historically been paid for the same services states reduce the amounts 
paid providers under the workers compensation fee schedules could have material adverse effect our financial condition and 
results operations 
significant changes our payor mix surgical case mix resulting from fluctuations the types cases performed our facilities 
could have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
our results may change from period period due fluctuations payor mix surgical case mix other factors relating the type 
cases performed physicians our facilities payor mix refers the relative share total cases provided patients with insurance 
commercial insurance medicare coverage medicaid coverage and workers compensation insurance respectively since generally 
speaking receive relatively higher payment rates from commercial and workers compensation insurers than medicare medicaid and 
other government funded programs significant shift our payor mix toward higher percentage medicare and medicaid cases which 
could occur for reasons beyond our control could have adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial 
condition 
surgical case mix refers the relative share total cases performed specialty such general surgery ophthalmology 
orthopedic and pain management generally speaking certain types our cases such orthopedic cases generate relatively higher 
revenue than other types cases such pain management and cases therefore significant shift our surgical case mix toward 
higher percentage lower revenue cases which could occur for reasons beyond our control could result material adverse effect our 
business prospects results operations and financial condition 
operate multiple markets each with different competitive landscape shifts within our payor mix surgical case mix may 
not uniform across all our affiliated facilities rather these shifts may concentrated within certain markets due local competitive 
factors therefore the results our individual affiliated facilities including facilities that are material our results may volatile which 
could result material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
have history net losses and may not achieve sustain profitability the future 
although have net income and million and million respectively have historically incurred periods 
net losses including net losses approximately million which includes million loss attributable one time 
transaction cost associated with the acquisition symbion and loss debt extinguishment million cannot assure you that 
our revenue will grow that will achieve maintain profitability the future growth our revenue may slow revenue may 
decline and expenses may increase for number possible reasons including reduced demand for our services regulatory shifts failure 
successfully continue integrate the operations surgery partners and symbion and other risks and uncertainties even have 
achieved profitability during and may not sustain increase profitability quarterly annual basis the future our 
ability achieve profitability will affected the other risks and uncertainties described this section and management discussion 
and analysis financial condition and results operations all these factors could contribute future net losses and are 
unable meet these risks and challenges encounter them our business may suffer are not able achieve sustain increase 
profitability our business will adversely affected and our stock price may decline 
depend physician utilization our surgical facilities which could decrease fail maintain good relationships with 
affiliated physicians our ability provide medical services our facilities would impaired and our revenue reduced are 
not able maintain these relationships 
our business depends among other things upon the efforts and success affiliated physicians who provide medical services our 
surgical facilities and the strength our relationships with these physicians most physicians are not employees our surgical facilities and 
are not contractually required use our facilities generally not enter into contracts with physicians who use our surgical facilities 
other than partnership and operating agreements with physicians who own interests our surgical facilities provider agreements with 
anesthesiology groups that provide anesthesiology services our surgical facilities medical director agreements among others physicians 
who use our surgical facilities also use other facilities hospitals and may choose perform procedures office based setting that 
might otherwise performed our surgical facilities recent years pain management and gastrointestinal procedures have been 
performed increasingly office based setting because potential cost savings better access although physicians who own interests 
our surgical facilities are subject agreements restricting ownership competing facilities these agreements may not restrict procedures 
performed physician office other unrelated facilities also these agreements restricting ownership competing facilities are 
difficult enforce and may unsuccessful preventing physicians who own interests our surgical facilities from acquiring interests 
competing facilities 
the financial success our facilities part dependent upon the volume procedures performed the physicians who use our 
facilities which affected the economy healthcare reform increases patient payments and deductibles and other factors outside 
our their control the physicians who use our surgical facilities may choose not accept patients who pay for services through certain 
third party payors which could reduce our revenue from time time may have disputes with physicians who use our surgical facilities 
and own interests our surgical facilities our company our revenue and profitability could significantly reduced lost our 
relationship with one more key physicians groups physicians such physicians groups reduce their use any our surgical 
facilities addition any damage the reputation key physician group physicians the failure these physicians provide 
quality medical care adhere professional guidelines our surgical facilities could damage our reputation subject liability and 
significantly reduce our revenue 
physician treatment methodologies and governmental commercial health insurance controls designed reduce the number 
surgical procedures may reduce our revenue and profitability 
controls imposed medicare and medicaid employer sponsored healthcare plans and commercial health insurance payors designed 
reduce surgical volumes some instances referred utilization review could adversely affect our facilities although are 
unable predict the effect these changes will have our operations significant limits the scope services reimbursed and 
reimbursement rates and fees may reduce our revenue and profitability additionally trends physician treatment protocols and commercial 
health insurance plan design such plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care patients could reduce our surgical 
volumes favor lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies each which could turn have material adverse effect 
our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
our growth strategy depends part our ability integrate operations acquired surgical facilities attract new physician 
partners and acquire and develop additional surgical facilities favorable terms are unable achieve any these goals 
our future growth could limited and our operating results could adversely affected 
believe that important component our financial performance and growth our ability provide physicians who use our 
facilities with the opportunity purchase ownership interests our facilities may not successful attracting new physician 
investment our surgical facilities and that failure could result reduction the quality efficiency and profitability our facilities 
based competitive factors and market conditions physicians may able negotiate relatively higher levels equity ownership our 
facilities consequently limiting reducing our share the profits from these facilities addition physician ownership our facilities 
subject certain regulatory restrictions 
addition our growth strategy includes the acquisition and development existing surgical facilities and the development new 
surgical facilities jointly with local physicians and some cases healthcare systems and other strategic partners have acquired interests 
developed all our surgical facilities since our inception and expect continue expand our operations the future are 
currently evaluating potential acquisitions and development projects and expect continue evaluate acquisitions and development 
projects the foreseeable future are unable successfully execute this strategy the future our future growth could limited 
may unable identify suitable acquisition and development opportunities complete acquisitions and new projects timely 
manner and favorable terms further the companies assets acquire the future may not ultimately produce returns that justify our 
related investment 
our acquisition activities and our limited development activities require substantial capital resources and may need obtain 
additional capital financing from time time fund these activities historically have funded acquisition and development 
activities through our credit facilities result may take actions that could have material adverse effect our business prospects 
results operations and financial condition including incurring substantial debt with certain restrictive terms further sufficient capital 
financing may not available satisfactory terms all addition our ability acquire and develop additional surgical 
facilities may limited state certificate need programs licensure requirements antitrust laws and other regulatory restrictions

pursuing attractive acquisition candidates the limited number surgical facilities develop typically incur losses their early months 
operation more the case surgical hospitals and until their case loads grow they generally experience lower total revenue and 
operating margins than established surgical facilities and expect this trend continue 
are not successful integrating newly acquired surgical facilities may not realize the potential benefits such acquisitions 
likewise are not able integrate acquired facilities operations and personnel with ours timely and efficient manner then the 
potential benefits the transaction may not realized further any delays unexpected costs incurred connection with integration

addition although conduct extensive due diligence prior the acquisition surgical facilities and seek indemnification from 
prospective sellers covering unknown contingent liabilities may acquire facilities with unknown contingent liabilities including 
liabilities for failure comply with healthcare laws and regulations although maintain professional liability insurance that provides

operations and financial condition 
face competition for patients physicians and commercial payor contracts 
the healthcare business highly competitive and each the individual geographic areas which operate has different 
competitive landscape each our markets compete with other healthcare providers for patients and contracting with commercial 
payors addition because the number physicians available utilize and invest our facilities finite face intense competition 
from other surgery centers hospitals health systems and other healthcare providers recruiting physicians utilize and invest our 
facilities are competition with other surgery centers hospitals and healthcare systems the communities serve attract patients 
and provide them with the care they need 
there are also unaffiliated hospitals each market which operate these hospitals have established relationships with physicians 
and payors addition other companies either currently are the same similar business developing acquiring and operating surgical 
facilities may decide enter our business many these companies have greater resources than including financial marketing 
staff and capital resources also may compete with some these companies for entry into strategic relationships with healthcare systems 
and healthcare professionals addition many physician groups develop surgical facilities without corporate partner recent years 
more physicians are choosing perform procedures including pain management and gastrointestinal procedures office based setting 
rather than surgical facility are unable compete effectively with any these entities groups may unable implement 
our business strategies successfully and our financial position and results operations could adversely affected 
competition for physicians and nurses shortages qualified personnel other factors could increase our labor costs and adversely 
affect our revenue profitability and cash flows

depend the available labor pool semi skilled and unskilled workers each the markets which operate 
our labor costs increase may not able raise rates offset these increased costs because significant percentage our 
revenue consist fixed prospective payments our ability pass along increased labor costs limited particular labor costs rise 
annual rate greater than our net annual consumer price index basket update from medicare our results operations and cash flows will 
likely adversely affected any union activity our facilities that may occur the future could contribute increased labor costs certain 
proposed changes federal labor laws and the national labor relations board modification its election procedures could increase the 
likelihood employee unionization attempts although none our employees are currently represented collective bargaining 
agreement the extent significant portion our employee base unionizes possible our labor costs could increase materially our 
failure recruit and retain qualified management and medical personnel control our labor costs could have material adverse effect 
our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
some jurisdictions preclude from entering into non compete agreements with our physicians and other non compete agreements 
and restrictive covenants applicable certain physicians and other clinical employees may not enforceable 
have contracts with physicians and other health professionals many states some our physician services contracts well 
many our physician services contracts with hospitals include provisions preventing these physicians and other health professionals from 
competing with both during and after the term our contract with them the law governing non compete agreements and other forms 
restrictive covenants varies from state state some jurisdictions prohibit from entering into non compete agreements with our 
professional staff other states are reluctant strictly enforce non compete agreements and restrictive covenants against physicians and 
other healthcare professionals therefore there can assurance that our non compete agreements related employed otherwise 
contracted physicians and other health professionals will enforceable challenged certain states such event would unable 
prevent former employed otherwise contracted physicians and other health professionals from competing with potentially resulting 
the loss some our hospital contracts and other business additionally certain facilities have the right employ engage our providers 
after the termination expiration our contract with those facilities and cause not enforce our non compete provisions related 
those providers 
may become involved litigation which could negatively impact the value our business 
from time time are involved lawsuits claims audits and investigations including those arising out services provided 
personal injury claims professional liability claims billing and marketing practices employment disputes and contractual claims may 
become subject future lawsuits claims audits and investigations that could result substantial costs and divert our attention and 
resources and adversely affect our business condition addition since our current growth strategy includes acquisitions among other 
things may become exposed legal claims for the activities acquired business prior the acquisition these lawsuits claims 
audits investigations regardless their merit outcome may also adversely affect our reputation and ability expand our business 
addition from time time have received and expect continue receive correspondence from former employees terminated 
who threaten bring claims against alleging that have violated one more labor and employment regulations certain 
instances former employees have brought claims against and expect that will encounter similar actions against the future 
adverse outcome any such litigation could require pay contractual damages compensatory damages punitive damages attorneys 
fees and costs 
become subject large malpractice other legal claims could required pay significant damages which may not 
covered insurance 
recent years physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject increasing number legal actions 
alleging malpractice product liability related legal theories many these actions involve large monetary claims and significant defense 
costs also owe certain defense and indemnity obligations our officers and directors 
maintain liability insurance amounts that believe are customary for the industry currently maintain professional liability 
insurance that provides coverage claims made basis million per occurrence with retention per occurrence and 
million annual aggregate coverage per surgical facility including the facility and employed staff maintain general liability 
insurance that provides coverage occurrence basis million per occurrence with retention per occurrence and 
million annual aggregate coverage per surgical facility also maintain business interruption insurance and property damage insurance 
well additional umbrella liability insurance policy the aggregate amount million coverage under certain these 
policies contingent upon the policy being effect when claim made regardless when the events which caused the claim occurred 
addition physicians who provide professional services our surgical facilities are required maintain separate malpractice coverage 
with similar minimum coverage limits also maintain directors and officers insurance policy which insures our directors and officers 
against unindemnified losses arising from certain wrongful acts their capacities directors and officers and reimburses for those losses 
for which have lawfully indemnified the directors and officers 
this insurance coverage may not cover all claims against insurance coverage may not continue available cost allowing 
maintain adequate levels insurance one more successful claims against were not covered exceeded the coverage our

could suffer face negative publicity pay damages defense costs connection with claim that outside the scope limits 
coverage any applicable insurance coverage including claims related adverse patient events contractual disputes professional and 
general liability and directors and officers duties 
addition our costs insurance and claims increase then our earnings could decline market rates for insurance premiums and 
deductibles have been steadily increasing our earnings and cash flows could materially and adversely affected any the following

further increases premiums and deductibles 
increases the number liability claims against the cost settling trying cases related those claims 
inability obtain one more types insurance acceptable terms all 
financial pressures patients and current and future economic condition may adversely affect our volume and surgical case mix 
even the economy shows signs sustained modest growth many individuals throughout the country continue experience 
difficult financial conditions our case volume and surgical case mix may adversely affected patients unwillingness pay for 
procedures our facilities higher numbers unemployed individuals generally translates into more individuals without healthcare 
insurance help pay for procedures thereby increasing the potential for persons elect not have procedures performed even 
procedures normally thought non elective may delayed may not performed the patient cannot afford the procedure due 
lack insurance money pay their portion our facilities fee although have taken steps minimize the impact these 
conditions difficult predict the degree which our business will continue impacted such conditions the course the 
economy the future 
addition the difficult conditions the economy have adversely affected and could continue adversely affect the budgets 
individual states and the federal government which has resulted and could continue result attempts reduce payments made 
federal and state government healthcare programs including medicare military services medicaid and workers compensation programs 
reduction the scope services covered those programs and increase taxes and assessments our activities additionally even 
though the supreme court upheld irs rule extending tax credits individuals purchasing health insurance under the affordable care act

the patient protection and affordable care act amended the health care and education reconciliation act 
collectively the affordable care act dramatically alter the united states healthcare system and are intended decrease the number 
uninsured americans and reduce overall healthcare costs the affordable care act attempts achieve these goals among other things 
requiring most americans obtain health insurance expanding medicare and medicaid eligibility reducing medicare and medicaid 
payments expanding the medicare program use value based purchasing programs tying hospital payments the satisfaction certain 
quality criteria and bundling payments hospitals and other providers the affordable care act also contains number measures that 
are intended reduce fraud and abuse the medicare and medicaid programs such requiring the use recovery audit contractors 
racs the medicaid program expanding the scope the federal false claims act and generally prohibiting physician owned 
hospitals from adding new physician owners increasing the number beds and operating rooms for which they are licensed the 
affordable care act provides for additional enforcement tools cooperation between agencies and funding for enforcement since their 
enactment the affordable care act has been subject number challenges its constitutionality june the united states 
supreme court upheld challenges the constitutionality the individual mandate provision which generally requires all individuals 
purchase healthcare insurance pay penalty but struck down unconstitutional the provision that would have allowed the federal 
government revoke all federal medicaid funding any state that did not expand its medicaid program result many states have 
refused extend medicaid eligibility more individuals envisioned the law other legal challenges are pending 
initiatives repeal the affordable care act whole part delay elements implementation funding and offer 
amendments supplements modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase result the election the ultimate 
outcomes legislative attempts repeal amend the affordable care act and legal challenges the affordable care act are unknown 
results recent congressional elections and the change presidential administrations beginning could create political 
environment which substantial portions the affordable care act are repealed revised specifically president donald trump 
day action plan calls for full repeal the affordable care act and its replacement with health savings accounts cross states sales health 
insurance and modifications state managed medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment radical change the 
health care regulatory landscape are not clear and president trump has indicated that certain provisions the affordable care act such 
provisions restraining the ability insurers deny limit coverage based pre existing conditions mandating that parents have the 
ability extend insurance coverage their children until they turn should preserved march republican leadership 
the house representatives introduced legislation that would repeal substantial portions the affordable care act including the 
individual mandate the legislation would eliminate health care exchanges and would replace means tested insurance premium subsidies 
with age adjusted tax credits the legislation would also limit federal funding available for the affordable care act medicaid expansion 
and transition federal medicaid funding per capita cap basis remains unclear what portions the affordable care act may 
remain what any replacement alternative programs may created any future legislation any such future repeal replacement 
may have significant impact the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may create reimbursement for services competing 
with the services offered the company accordingly there can assurance that the adoption any future federal state healthcare 
reform legislation will not have negative financial impact the company 
moreover other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted august 
the budget control act among other things created measures for spending reductions congress joint select committee 
deficit reduction tasked with recommending targeted deficit reduction least trillion for the years through was 
unable reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation automatic reduction several government programs this included 
aggregate reductions medicare payments providers per fiscal year which went into effect april and due 
subsequent legislative amendments will remain effect through unless additional congressional action taken january 
president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act which among other things further reduced medicare payments 
several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute limitations period for the 
government recover overpayments providers from three five years these new laws may result additional reductions medicare

significant loss revenue and divert other resources 
regulations change may obligated purchase some all the ownership our physician partners renegotiate some 
our partnership and operating agreements with our physician partners and management agreements with surgical facilities 
upon the occurrence various fundamental regulatory changes changes the interpretation existing regulations may 
obligated purchase all the ownership the physician investors most the partnerships limited liability companies that own and 
operate our surgical facilities the purchase price that would required pay for the ownership typically based either multiple 
the surgical facility ebitda defined our partnership and operating agreements with these surgical facilities the fair market

the agreements upon the occurrence various fundamental regulatory changes changes the interpretation existing regulations and 
provide for termination the agreements renegotiations are not successful 
regulatory changes that could create purchase renegotiation obligations include changes that 
make illegal the referral medicare other patients our surgical facilities physician investors

possible termination our partnership and management agreements would have material adverse effect our financial condition and 
results operations 
our revenue will decline federal state programs reduce our medicare medicaid payments managed care companies 
reduce reimbursement amounts addition the financial condition payors and healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit 
our revenue and profitability 
for the years ended december and derived approximately and our revenue respectively 
from government payors including medicare and medicaid programs the medicare and medicaid programs are subject statutory and 
regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements funding levels and 
the method calculating payments reimbursements among other things requirements for utilization review and federal and state 
funding restrictions any which could materially increase decrease payments from these government programs the future well 
affect the timing payments our facilities 
additionally the budget control act requires that medicare reimbursement rates reduced which went into effect 
april and due subsequent legislative amendments the statute will remain effect through unless additional congressional 
action taken 
cannot predict whether these automatic spending reductions will rescinded extended increased future legislative action 
these automatic spending reductions are increased extended such action could adversely affect our business results operations and 
financial condition 
are unable predict the effect future government healthcare funding policy changes our operations the rates paid 
governmental payors are reduced the scope services covered governmental payors limited one more our surgical 
facilities are excluded from participation the medicare medicaid other government sponsored healthcare programs there could 
material adverse effect our business financial condition results operations cash flows 
during the past several years healthcare payors such federal and state governments insurance companies and employers have 
undertaken initiatives revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare costs part their efforts contain healthcare costs 
payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures the assumption healthcare providers all portion the financial 
risk relating paying for care provided often exchange for exclusive preferred participation their benefit plans expect efforts 
impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls government and other payors continue thereby reducing the payments 
receive for our services 
way example under the medicare program physician payments are updated annual basis according statutory formula 
because application the statutory formula for the update factor would have resulted decrease total physician payments for the past 
several years congress has intervened with interim legislation prevent the reductions april however the medicare access and 
chip reauthorization act macra was signed into law which repealed and replaced the statutory formula for medicare 
payment adjustments physicians macra provides permanent end the annual interim legislative updates that had previously been 
necessary delay prevent significant reductions payments under the medicare physician fee schedule macra extended previous 
payment rates through june with update for july through december and for each calendar year through 
after which there will annual update each year through addition macra requires the establishment the meritbased incentive payment system mips beginning under which physicians may receive performance based payment incentives 
payment reductions based their performance with respect clinical quality resource use clinical improvement activities and 
meaningful use electronic health records macra also requires centers for medicare medicaid services cms beginning 
provide incentive payments for physicians and other eligible professionals that participate alternative payment models such 
accountable care organizations that emphasize quality and value over the traditional volume based fee for service model unclear what 
impact any macra will have our business and operating results but any resulting decrease payment may result reduced 
demand for our services 
the amount our provision for doubtful accounts based our assessments historical collection trends business and economic 
conditions trends federal and state governmental and private employer health coverage and other collection indicators continuation 
trends that results increasing the proportion accounts receivable being comprised uninsured accounts and deterioration the 
collectability these accounts could adversely affect our collections accounts receivable results operations and cash flows 
enacted the affordable care act seeks decrease over time the number uninsured individuals specifically the affordable care act 
expands medicaid eligibility and provides incentives employers offer and individuals purchase health insurance difficult 
predict the full impact the affordable care act due pending court challenges legislative threats implementation uncertainty and its 
complexity 
our surgical facilities not satisfy the requirements for any the safe harbors under the federal anti kickback statute 
federal state agency asserts different position enacts new laws this regard could subject criminal and civil 
penalties loss licenses and exclusion from governmental programs which may result substantial loss revenue 
the statute commonly known the federal anti kickback statute the anti kickback statute prohibits the offer payment 
solicitation receipt any form remuneration return for referrals for items services payable medicare medicaid any other 
federally funded healthcare program additionally the anti kickback statute prohibits any form remuneration return for purchasing 
leasing ordering arranging for recommending the purchasing leasing ordering items services payable medicare 
medicaid any other federally funded healthcare program the anti kickback statute very broad scope and many its provisions 
have not been uniformly definitively interpreted existing case law regulations moreover several federal courts have held that the 
anti kickback statute can violated only one purpose not necessarily the primary purpose transaction induce reward 
referral business notwithstanding other legitimate purposes addition person entity does not need have actual knowledge the 
statute specific intent violate order have committed violation moreover the government may assert that claim including 
items services resulting from violation the federal anti kickback statute constitutes false fraudulent claim for purposes the 
false claims act discussed below violations the anti kickback statute may result substantial civil criminal penalties including 
five years imprisonment and criminal fines and civil penalties for each violation plus three times the 
remuneration involved the amount claimed and exclusion from participation all federally funded healthcare programs our exclusion 
from participation such programs would have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial 
condition addition many the states which operate have also adopted laws similar the anti kickback statute that prohibit 
payments physicians exchange for referrals some which apply regardless the source payment for care these statutes typically 
impose criminal and civil penalties including the loss license business the state 
july the department health and human services hhs issued final regulations defining various safe harbors 
under the anti kickback statute business arrangements that meet the requirements the safe harbors are not treated criminal violations 
under the anti kickback statute business arrangements that not meet the safe harbor requirements not necessarily violate the antikickback statute but may subject scrutiny the federal government determine compliance two the original safe harbors issued 
apply business arrangements similar those used connection with our surgical facilities the investment interest safe harbor 
and the personal services and management contracts safe harbor however the structure the partnerships and limited liability companies 
operating our surgery centers and surgical hospitals well our various business arrangements involving physician group practices 
not satisfy all the requirements either safe harbor 
november hhs promulgated final regulations creating additional safe harbor provisions including safe harbor that 
applies physician ownership investment interests surgery centers the surgery center safe harbor protects four types investment 
arrangements surgeon owned surgery centers single specialty surgery centers multi specialty surgery centers and hospital 
physician surgery centers each category has its own requirements with regard what type physician may investor the surgery 
center addition the physician investor the categories permit unrelated investor who person entity that not position 
provide items services related the surgery center its investors our business arrangements with our surgical facilities typically consist 
one our subsidiaries being investor each partnership limited liability company that owns the facility addition providing 
management and other services the facility therefore our business arrangements with our surgery centers surgical hospitals and 
physician groups not qualify for safe harbor protection from government review prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
however attempt otherwise structure our surgery centers fit closely possible within the safe harbor when transaction 
relationship does not fit within safe harbor does not mean that anti kickback statute violation has occurred rather means that the 
facts and circumstances well the intent the parties related specific transaction relationship must examined determine 
whether not any illegal conduct has occurred 
employ dedicated marketing personnel whose job functions include the recruitment physicians perform surgery our facilities 
these employees are paid base salary plus productivity bonus believe our employment arrangements with these employees are 
consistent with safe harbor provision designed protect payments made employees however government agency private party 
may assert contrary position 
also enter into lease agreements with physicians from time time for the rental space for our surgical facilities seek 
structure these lease agreements that they are compliance with the anti kickback statute safe harbor provision regarding real estate 
leases however government agency private party may assert contrary position 
any our business arrangements with physicians sales and marketing personnel were alleged deemed violate the antikickback statute similar laws new federal state laws were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal could have material 
adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
fail comply with physician self referral laws they are currently interpreted may interpreted the future other 
legislative restrictions are issued could incur substantial monetary penalties and significant loss revenue 
the federal physician self referral law commonly referred the stark law prohibits physician from making medicare 
medicaid reimbursed referral for designated health service entity the physician member the physician immediate family 
has financial relationship with the entity unless exception applies the list designated health services under the stark law does 
not generally include ambulatory surgery services but does include services such clinical laboratory services and certain imaging 
services that may provided and separately billed asc under the current stark law and related regulations services provided 
asc are not covered the statute even those services include imaging laboratory services other stark designated health services 
provided that the asc does not bill for these services separately the center permitted bill separately for these services they 
are specifically exempted from stark law prohibitions these are generally radiology and other imaging services integral performance 
surgical procedures that meet certain requirements and certain outpatient prescription drugs believe that services provided our 
facilities licensed hospitals are covered the stark law but referrals for such services are exempt from the stark law under its whole 
hospital exception which was significantly amended the affordable care act also believe that certain services provided our 
managed physician network are covered the stark law but referrals for those services are exempt from the stark law under its office 
ancillary services exception among others our diagnostic laboratory also subject the stark law but believe that have 
structured our agreements with physicians not violate the stark law and related regulations 
the stark law and similar state statutes are subject different interpretations with respect many important provisions violations 
these self referral laws may result substantial civil criminal penalties including treble damages for amounts improperly claimed civil 
monetary penalties per prohibited service billed per prohibited circumvention scheme and exclusion from 
participation the medicare and medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs violations the stark law will also create 
liability under the federal false claims act exclusion our ascs hospitals from these programs through judicial agency 
interpretation existing laws additional legislative restrictions physician ownership investments healthcare entities could result 
significant loss reimbursement revenue cannot provide assurances that cms will not undertake other rulemaking address 
additional revisions interpretations the stark law regulations future rules modify the provisions the stark law regulations that 
are applicable our business our revenue and profitability could materially adversely affected and could require modify our 
relationships with our physician and healthcare system partners 
federal law restricts the ability our surgical hospitals expand surgical capacity 
the stark law includes exception that permits physicians refer medicare and medicaid patients hospitals which they have 
ownership interest certain requirements are met however the affordable care act dramatically curtailed this exception and prohibits 
physician ownership hospitals that did not have medicare provider agreement december this prohibition does not apply 
any our five surgical hospitals each which had medicare provider agreement place prior december and are therefore 
able continue operating with their pre ipo ownership structure however the affordable care act prohibits grandfathered hospitals 
from increasing their percentage physician ownership and limits certain extent their ability grow because prohibits such 
hospitals from increasing the aggregate number inpatient beds operating rooms and procedure rooms 
companies within the healthcare industry continue the subject federal and state audits and investigations and may 
subject such audits and investigations including actions for false and other improper claims 
federal and state government agencies well commercial payors have increased their auditing and administrative civil and 
criminal enforcement efforts part numerous ongoing investigations healthcare organizations these audits and investigations relate 
wide variety topics including the following cost reporting and billing practices quality care financial reporting financial 
relationships with referral sources and medical necessity services provided addition the office the inspector general the 
department health and human services the oig and the department justice doj have from time time undertaken 
national enforcement initiatives that focus specific billing practices other suspected areas abuse its work plan the oig 
stated its intention review the safety and quality care for medicare beneficiaries having surgeries and procedures ascs and hospital 
outpatient departments have not received any material related audit letters date 
the federal government authorized impose criminal civil and administrative penalties any person entity that files false 
claim for payment from the medicare medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs claims filed with private 
insurers can also lead criminal and civil penalties including but not limited penalties relating violations federal mail and wire 
fraud statutes well penalties under the anti fraud provisions the hipaa defined below while the criminal statutes are generally 
reserved for instances fraudulent intent the federal government applying its criminal civil and administrative penalty statutes 
ever expanding range circumstances including claiming payment for unnecessary services the claimant merely should have known the 
services were unnecessary and claiming payment for low quality services the claimant should have known that the care was substandard 
addition violation the stark law the anti kickback statute can result liability under the false claims act fca 
over the past several years the federal government has investigated increasing number healthcare providers for potential fca 
violations which among other things prohibits person from knowingly presenting causing presented false fraudulent claim 
the federal government the statute defines knowingly include not only actual knowledge claim falsity but also reckless 
disregard for intentional ignorance the truth falsity claim violators the fca are subject severe financial penalties 
including treble damages and per claim penalties excess because our facilities perform hundreds thousands similar 
procedures each year for which they are paid medicare and since the statute limitations for such claims extends for six years under 
normal circumstances and possibly long ten years the event failure discover material facts repetitive billing error cost 
reporting error could result significant material repayments and civil criminal penalties 
moreover another trend impacting healthcare providers the increased use the fca particularly individuals who bring actions 
under that law under the qui tam whistleblower provisions the fca private parties may bring actions behalf the federal 
government the government intervenes and prevails the action the defendant may required pay three times the actual damages 
sustained the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties between and for each false claim submitted the 
government these private parties often referred relators are entitled share any amounts recovered the government through 
trial settlement these qui tam cases are sealed the court the time filing the only parties privy the information contained the 
complaint are the relator the federal government and the presiding court possible that qui tam lawsuits have been filed against and 
that are unaware such filings both direct enforcement activity the government and whistleblower lawsuits under the fca have 
increased significantly recent years thus the risk that will have defend false claims action pay significant fines excluded 
from the medicare and medicaid programs has increased 
addition the fraud enforcement and recovery act fera further expanded the scope the fca create liability for 
knowingly and improperly avoiding decreasing obligation pay money the federal government and fera along with statutory 
provisions found the acts created federal false claims act liability for the knowing failure report and return overpayment within 
days the identification the overpayment certain cases the date which corresponding cost report due whichever later 
governmental authorities may challenge scrutinize our operations may the subject whistleblower lawsuit any time 
determination that have violated these laws could have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and 
financial condition 
the health insurance portability and accountability act amended the health information technology for economic and 
clinical health act the hitech act and their implementing regulations collectively referred hipaa also created new 
federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing attempting execute scheme defraud 
any healthcare benefit program including private third party payors knowingly and willfully embezzling stealing from healthcare 
benefit program willfully obstructing criminal investigation healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing 
covering material fact making any materially false fictitious fraudulent statement connection with the delivery payment 
for healthcare benefits items services similar the federal anti kickback statute person entity does not need have actual 
knowledge the statute specific intent violate order have committed violation 
addition person who offers transfers medicare medicaid beneficiary any remuneration including waivers copayments and deductible amounts any part thereof that the person knows should know likely influence the beneficiary 
selection particular provider practitioner supplier medicare medicaid payable items services may liable for civil monetary 
penalties for each wrongful act moreover certain cases providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for 
medicare and medicaid beneficiaries can also held liable under the anti kickback statute and civil false claims act which can impose 
additional penalties associated with the wrongful act although this prohibition applies only federal healthcare program beneficiaries the 
routine waivers copayments and deductibles offered patients covered commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related 
among other things unlawful schemes defraud excessive fees for services tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory 
common law fraud the extent our patient assistance programs other discount policies are found inconsistent with applicable 
laws may required restructure discontinue such programs subject other significant penalties 
enforce compliance with the federal laws the doj has recently increased its scrutiny interactions between health care companies 
and health care providers which has led number investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements the health care industry 
dealing with investigations can time and resource consuming and can divert management attention from the business addition 
settlements with the doj other law enforcement agencies have forced healthcare providers agree additional compliance and 
reporting requirements part consent decree corporate integrity agreement any such investigation settlement could increase our 
costs otherwise have adverse effect our business 
are also subject various state laws and regulations well contractual provisions with commercial payors that prohibit from 
submitting inaccurate incorrect misleading claims cannot sure that none our surgical facilities claims will ever challenged 
were found violation state laws regulations commercial payor contract could forced discontinue the 
violative practice and subject recoupment actions fines and criminal penalties which could have material adverse effect our 
business prospects results operations and financial condition 
all payors are increasingly conducting post payment audits for example cms has implemented the rac program involving 
medicare claims audits nationwide under the program cms contracts with racs contingency fee basis conduct post payment 
reviews detect and correct improper payments the fee for service medicare program the affordable care act expanded the rac 
program scope include managed medicare plans and include medicaid claims addition cms employs medicaid integrity 
contractors mics perform post payment audits medicaid claims and identify overpayments the affordable care act increases 
federal funding for the mic program addition racs and mics the state medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their 
review activities are regularly subject these external audits and also perform both internal and third party audits and monitoring 
for instance recently hms federal solutions mic completed audit one our surgical hospitals for the period july 
through may and determined overpayment obligation the amount approximately million based its extrapolation 
statistical sampling claims well civil monetary penalty the amount for total amount owed idaho 
department health and welfare medicaid program integrity unit approximately million for failure comply with medicaid 
rules billing for non covered services services provided non eligible providers iii services not provided and unauthorized 
services have appealed the audit and are currently awaiting the result 
although all other repayments requested date result rac mic and zpic audits have not been material our company 
are unable quantify the aggregate financial impact these audits our facilities given the pending appeals and uncertainty about the 
extent future audits and whether the underlying conduct could considered systemic such the resolution these audits could have 
material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
failure comply with medicare conditions for coverage and conditions participation may result loss program payment 
other governmental sanctions 
participate and receive payment from the medicare program our facilities must comply with regulations promulgated cms 
these regulations known conditions for coverage for ascs and conditions participation for hospitals set forth specific 
requirements with respect among other things the facility physical plant equipment personnel and standards medical care all 
our surgery centers and surgical hospitals are certified participate the medicare program such these facilities are subject site 
unannounced surveys state survey agencies working behalf cms under the asc survey process the surveyors are becoming more 
familiar with expanded interpretive guidance and the updated asc conditions for coverage which may lead increased number 
deficiency citations requiring remedy with appropriate action plans failure comply with medicare conditions for coverage conditions 
participation may result loss payment other governmental sanctions including termination from participation the medicare 
program have established ongoing quality assurance activities monitor our facilities compliance with these conditions and respond 
surveys but cannot sure that our facilities are will always remain full compliance with the requirements 
our use and disclosure personally identifiable information including health information subject federal and state privacy

systems causing information security breach loss protected health information other data subject privacy laws material 
disruption our operational systems could result material adverse impact our business along with potentially substantial fines and

hipaa also requires our surgical facilities use standard transaction code sets and identifiers for certain standardized healthcare 
transactions including billing and other claim transactions have undertaken significant efforts involving substantial time and expense 
implement these requirements and anticipate that continual time and expense will required submit standardized transactions and 
ensure that any newly acquired facilities can submit hipaa compliant transactions 
hipaa requires covered entities report breaches unsecured protected health information affected individuals without
