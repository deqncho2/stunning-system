uncollectible amounts from those patients 
shift outpatient services because the growing availability stand alone outpatient healthcare facilities 
and the increase the services that can provided these locations many individuals are seeking broader 
range services outpatient facilities this trend has contributed increase outpatient services while 
inhibiting the growth inpatient admissions however recent changes medicare policy affecting the

further reduce their healthcare costs increasing number insurance companies hmos ppos and other 
managed care companies negotiate discounted fee structures fixed amounts for hospital services performed 
rather than paying healthcare providers the amounts billed and utilize structures such narrow networks that 
restrict the providers that enrollees may utilize increasing consolidation within the payor industry including 
vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers and cost reduction strategies large 
employer groups and their affiliates may intensify competitive pressure negotiate discounts with managed 
care companies which are typically smaller than discounts under government programs increased number 
insurance companies hmos ppos and other managed care companies succeed negotiating discounted fee 
structures fixed amounts are unable participate managed care networks serving our markets our

government regulation 
overview the healthcare industry required comply with extensive government regulation the federal 
state and local levels fail comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject criminal 
penalties and civil sanctions our hospitals could lose their licenses and could lose our ability participate 
medicare medicaid and other government programs hospitals must meet requirements certified 
hospitals and qualified participate government programs including those relating the adequacy 
medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures billing and coding for services properly 
handling overpayments classifications levels care provided preparing and filing cost reports 
relationships with referral sources and referral recipients maintenance adequate records hospital use ratesetting building codes environmental protection and privacy and security 
hospitals are subject periodic inspection federal state and local authorities determine their compliance 
with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing and certification all our hospitals are 
licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified participate medicare and medicaid programs 
addition most our hospitals are accredited the joint commission this accreditation indicates that 
hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards participate medicare and medicaid 
programs 
government regulations may change that happens may have make changes our facilities 
equipment personnel and services that our hospitals remain certified hospitals and qualified participate 
these programs believe that our hospitals are substantial compliance with current federal state and 
local regulations and standards cannot certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these 
laws whistleblowers will not assert that are violation them that such statutes regulations will 
interpreted the courts manner consistent with our interpretation 
healthcare reform over the last decade the congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and 
passed large number proposals and legislation designed make major changes the healthcare system 
including changes intended increase access health insurance the most prominent these recent efforts the 
affordable care act affects how healthcare services are covered delivered and reimbursed the affordable 
care act mandates that substantially all citizens maintain health insurance coverage and increases health 
insurance coverage through combination public program expansion and private sector health insurance 
reforms however the future the affordable care act uncertain the presidential administration and 
certain members congress have stated their intent repeal make significant changes the affordable care 
act its implementation interpretation part the tax reform legislation which was enacted 
december congress eliminated the financial penalty for individuals that fail maintain health insurance 
coverage associated with the individual mandate effective january which may impact the number 
individuals who elect purchase health insurance addition presidential executive order has been signed 
that directs agencies minimize economic and regulatory burdens the affordable care act 
believe that the affordable care act has had positive impact net operating revenues and income from 
continuing operations the result the expansion private sector and medicaid coverage that has occurred 
however other provisions the affordable care act such requirements related employee health insurance 
coverage have increased our operating costs addition the affordable care act has made changes medicare 
and medicaid reimbursement that could adversely impact the reimbursement receive under these programs 
these changes include reductions the medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 
through productivity offset the medicare market basket update and reductions the medicare and 
medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments 
substantial uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing net effect the affordable care act due the 
possibility repeal significant changes the law clarifications and modifications resulting from executive 
orders the rule making process the outcome court challenges and the development agency guidance 
whether and how many states ultimately decide expand medicaid coverage and what terms the number 
individuals who elect purchase health insurance coverage and budgetary issues federal and state levels the 
impact the healthcare industry and timing any potential repeal changes the affordable care act and 
any alternative provisions unknown difficult predict the nature and success future financial 
delivery system reforms 
fraud and abuse laws participation the medicare and medicaid programs heavily regulated federal 
statute and regulation hospital fails comply substantially with the requirements for participating the 
programs the hospital participation may terminated and civil criminal penalties may imposed for 
example hospital may lose its ability participate the medicare program engages any the

section the social security act known the anti kickback statute prohibits some business practices 
and relationships under medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs these practices include the 
payment receipt offer solicitation remuneration any kind exchange for items services that are 
reimbursed under most federal state healthcare programs 
the office inspector general the department health and human services oig responsible for 
identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities federal healthcare programs part its duties the 
oig provides guidance healthcare providers identifying types activities that could violate the antikickback statute the oig also publishes regulations outlining activities and business relationships that would 
deemed not violate the anti kickback statute these regulations are known safe harbor regulations 
the failure particular activity comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the 
activity violates the anti kickback statute however such failure may lead increased scrutiny government 
enforcement authorities 
the oig has identified the following incentive arrangements potential violations the anti kickback 
statute 
payment any incentive the hospital when physician refers patient the hospital 
use free significantly discounted office space equipment for physicians facilities usually 
located close the hospital 
provision free significantly discounted billing nursing other staff services 
free training for physician office staff including management and laboratory techniques but 
excluding compliance training 
guarantees which provide that the physician income fails reach predetermined level the 
hospital will pay any portion the remainder 
low interest interest free loans loans which may forgiven physician refers patients the 
hospital 
payment the costs physician travel and expenses for conferences 
payment services which require few any substantive duties the physician payment for 
services excess the fair market value the services rendered 
coverage the hospital group health insurance plans inappropriately low cost the physician 
purchasing goods services from physicians prices excess their fair market value 
rental space physician offices other than fair market value 
physician owned entities often referred physician owned distributorships pods that derive 
revenue from selling arranging for the sale implantable medical devices ordered their 
physician owners for use procedures that physician owners perform their own patients hospitals 
ascs 
have variety financial relationships with physicians who refer patients our hospitals physicians 
own interests number our facilities physicians may also own our stock also have contracts with 
physicians providing for variety financial arrangements including employment contracts leases 
management agreements and professional service agreements provide financial incentives recruit 
physicians relocate communities served our hospitals these incentives include relocation 
reimbursement for certain direct expenses income guarantees and some cases loans although strive 
comply with the anti kickback statute taking into account available guidance including the safe harbor 
regulations cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine otherwise that happens 
could subject criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participating medicare medicaid 
other government healthcare programs civil monetary penalties are increased annually based updates the 
consumer price index and were recently increased under the bipartisan budget act 
the social security act also includes provision commonly known the stark law this law prohibits 
physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients healthcare entities which they any their 
immediate family members have ownership interests other financial arrangements these types referrals are 
commonly known self referrals sanctions for violating the stark law include denial payment civil 
monetary penalties that are increased annually based updates the consumer price index and exclusion from 
federal healthcare programs 
there are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions the self referral prohibition one exception 
known the whole hospital exception allows physician make referral hospital the physician 
owns interest the entire hospital opposed ownership interest department the hospital 
another exception allows physician refer patients healthcare entity which the physician has 
ownership interest the entity located rural area defined the statute there are also exceptions for 
many the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers including employment 
contracts leases and recruitment agreements from time time the federal government has issued regulations 
that interpret the provisions included the stark law 
the affordable care act narrowed the whole hospital exception the stark law the affordable care act 
permitted existing physician investments whole hospital continue under grandfather clause the 
arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from the time the 
affordable care act became effective from increasing the aggregate percentage their ownership the 
hospital the affordable care act also restricts the ability existing physician owned hospitals expand the 
capacity their aggregate licensed beds operating rooms and procedure rooms the whole hospital exception 
also contains additional public disclosure requirements 
addition the restrictions and disclosure requirements applicable physician owned hospitals under the 
stark law cms regulations require physician owned hospitals and their physician owners disclose certain 
ownership information patients physician owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership writing 
patients and must make list their physician owners available upon request additionally each physician 
owner who member physician owned hospital medical staff must agree condition continued 
medical staff membership admitting privileges disclose writing all patients whom they refer the 
hospital their immediate family member ownership interest the hospital hospital considered 
physician owned any physician immediate family member physician holds debt stock other 
types investment the hospital any owner the hospital excluding physician ownership through 
publicly traded securities that meet certain conditions hospital fails comply with these regulations the 
hospital could lose its medicare provider agreement and unable participate medicare 
evolving interpretations current the adoption new federal state laws regulations could affect 
many the arrangements entered into each our hospitals addition law enforcement authorities 
including the oig the courts and congress have recent years increased scrutiny arrangements between 
healthcare providers and potential referral sources ensure that the arrangements are not designed 
mechanism improperly pay for patient referrals and other business investigators also have demonstrated 
willingness look behind the formalities business transaction determine the underlying purpose 
payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
many states which operate have also adopted laws that prohibit payments physicians exchange for 
referrals similar the federal anti kickback statute that otherwise prohibit fraud and abuse activities many 
states have also passed self referral legislation similar the stark law prohibiting the referral patients 
entities with which the physician has financial relationship often these state laws are broad scope and may 
apply regardless the source payment for care these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties 
well loss licensure little precedent exists for the interpretation enforcement these state laws 
our operations could adversely affected the failure our arrangements comply with the antikickback statute the stark law billing laws and regulations current state laws other legislation 
regulations these areas adopted the future are unable predict whether other legislation regulations 
the federal state level any these areas will adopted what form such legislation regulations may 
take how they may affect our operations are continuing enter into new financial arrangements with 
physicians and other providers manner structured comply all material respects with these laws 
strive comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws cannot assure you however that governmental 
officials responsible for enforcing these laws whistleblowers will not assert that are violation them 
that such statutes regulations ultimately will interpreted the courts manner consistent with our 
interpretation 
federal false claims act and similar state laws another significant enforcement mechanism used within the 
healthcare industry the federal false claims act fca which can used prosecute medicare and other 
government program fraud involving issues such coding errors billing for service not provided and submitting 
false cost reports further the fca covers payments involving federal funds connection with the health 
insurance exchanges created under the affordable care act those payments involve any federal funds 
liability under the fca often arises when entity knowingly submits false claim for reimbursement the 
federal government the fca broadly defines the term knowingly although simple negligence will not give 
rise liability under the fca submitting claim with reckless disregard its truth falsity may constitute 
knowingly submitting false claim and result liability among the many other potential bases for liability 
under the fca the knowing and improper failure report and refund amounts owed the government within 
days identifying overpayment overpayment deemed identified when person has should 
have through reasonable diligence determined that overpayment was received and quantified the 
overpayment submission claim for item service generated violation the anti kickback statute 
constitutes false fraudulent claim under the fca some cases whistleblowers the federal government and 
courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes such the stark law 
have thereby submitted false claims under the fca 
when defendant determined court law liable under the fca the defendant must pay three 
times the actual damages sustained the government plus substantial civil penalties for each separate false 
claim these civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based updates the consumer price index 
settlements entered into prior litigation usually involve less severe calculation damages the fca also 
contains qui tam whistleblower provisions which allow private individuals bring actions behalf the 
government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government the government intervenes 
the action and prevails the party filing the initial complaint may share any settlement judgment the 
government does not intervene the action the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and 
may receive larger share any settlement judgment when private party brings qui tam action under the 
fca the defendant generally will not made aware the lawsuit until the government commences its own 
investigation determines whether will intervene every entity that receives least million annually 
medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees contractors and agents providing detailed 
information about false claims false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws 
including the fca and similar state laws 
number states including states which operate have adopted their own false claims provisions 
well their own whistleblower provisions whereby private party may file civil lawsuit state court federal 
law provides incentive states enact false claims laws that are comparable the fca from time time 
companies the healthcare industry including ours may subject actions under the fca similar state 
laws 
corporate practice medicine fee splitting some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons 
business entities including corporations from employing physicians some states also have adopted laws that 
prohibit direct indirect payments entering into fee splitting arrangements with physicians and 
unlicensed persons business entities possible sanctions for violations these restrictions include loss 
physician license civil and criminal penalties and rescission business arrangements these laws vary from 
state state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted the courts regulatory agencies structure 
our arrangements with healthcare providers comply with the relevant state law however cannot provide 
assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that transactions 
which are involved are violation these laws these laws may also interpreted the courts 
manner inconsistent with our interpretations 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act the emergency medical treatment and active labor 
act imposes requirements the care that must provided anyone who comes facilities providing 
emergency medical services seeking care before they may transferred another facility otherwise denied 
care sanctions for failing fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation medicare and 
medicaid programs and civil money penalties which are increased annually based updates the consumer 
price index addition the law creates private civil remedies that enable individual who suffers personal 
harm direct result violation the law sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief 
medical facility that suffers financial loss direct result another participating hospital violation the 
law also has similar right although believe that our practices are compliance with the law can give 
assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law will not assert are violation 
this law 
conversion legislation many states including some where have hospitals and others where may the 
future acquire hospitals have adopted legislation regarding the sale other disposition hospitals operated 
not for profit entities other states that not have specific legislation the attorneys general have 
demonstrated interest these transactions under their general obligations protect charitable assets from 
waste these legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus the appropriate valuation the assets 
divested and the use the proceeds the sale the not for profit seller while these reviews and some 
instances approval processes can add additional time the closing hospital acquisition have not had 
any significant difficulties delays completing the process there can assurance however that future 
actions the state level will not seriously delay even prevent our ability acquire hospitals these 
activities are widespread they could limit our ability acquire hospitals 
certificates need the construction new facilities the acquisition existing facilities and the addition 
new services our facilities may subject state laws that require prior approval state regulatory agencies 
these con laws generally require that state agency determine the public need and give approval prior the 
construction acquisition facilities the addition new services december operated 
hospitals states that have adopted con laws for acute care facilities fail obtain necessary state 
approval will not able expand our facilities complete acquisitions add new services these states 
violation these state laws may result the imposition civil sanctions the revocation hospital 
licenses 
hipaa administrative simplification and privacy and security requirements the health insurance 
portability and accountability act hipaa requires the use uniform electronic data transmission 
standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted received electronically these provisions 
are intended encourage electronic commerce the healthcare industry hhs has established electronic data 
transmission standards and code sets that all healthcare providers must use when submitting receiving certain 
healthcare transactions electronically addition hipaa requires that each provider use national provider 
identifier the affordable care act requires the hhs adopt standards for additional electronic transactions 
and establish operating rules promote uniformity the implementation each standardized electronic 
transaction 
required hipaa hhs has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and 
disclosure individually identifiable health related information and require covered entities including health 
plans and most healthcare providers implement administrative physical and technical practices protect the 
security individually identifiable health information that electronically maintained transmitted business 
associates entities that handle identifiable health related information behalf covered entities are subject 
direct liability for violation applicable provisions the regulations addition covered entity may 
subject penalties result business associate violating hipaa the business associate found 
agent the covered entity have developed and utilize hipaa compliance plan part our effort 
comply with hipaa privacy and security requirements the privacy regulations and security regulations have 
and will continue impose significant costs order comply with these standards 
covered entities must report breaches unsecured protected health information affected individuals 
without unreasonable delay but not exceed days discovery the breach the covered entity its 
agents notification must also made hhs and certain situations involving large breaches the media 
hhs required publish its website list all covered entities that report breach involving more than

medicare under the medicare program are paid for inpatient and outpatient services performed our 
hospitals 
payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant prospective payment system 
commonly known pps under pps our hospitals are paid predetermined amount for each hospital 
discharge based the patient diagnosis specifically each discharge assigned diagnosis related group 
commonly known drg based upon the patient condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient 
stay each drg assigned payment rate using the national average cost per case and the

the drg payment rates are adjusted update factor october each year the beginning the 
federal fiscal year the index used adjust the drg payment rates known the market basket index gives

the drg payment rates are also adjusted promote value based purchasing linking payments quality and 
efficiency first hospitals that meet exceed certain quality performance standards will receive greater

the medicare reimbursement discussed above was reduced beginning due the budget control act 
that required across the board spending cuts the federal budget also known sequestration these

several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs intended offset portion the costs providers

commercial insurance and managed care companies our hospitals provide services individuals covered 
private healthcare insurance health plans administered managed care companies these payors pay 
our hospitals some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospital established charges and 
the coverage provided the insurance policy they try limit the costs hospital services negotiating 
discounts including pps which would reduce payments commercial insurers health plans our hospitals 
commercial insurers and managed care companies also seek reduce payments hospitals establishing 
payment rules that effect characterize the services ordered physicians for example some payors 
vigorously review each patient length stay the hospital and recharacterize outpatient all inpatient stays 
less than particular duration hours reductions payments for services provided our hospitals 
individuals covered these payors could adversely affect 
under the managed medicare program also known medicare part medicare advantage the federal 
government contracts with private health plans provide members with medicare benefits the plans may 
choose offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and cost sharing obligations similarly 
managed medicaid programs enable states contract with private entities handle program responsibilities like 
care management and claims adjudication enrollment managed medicare and managed medicaid programs 
has increased recent years the federal and state governments seek control healthcare costs 
medicare administrative contractors cms competitively bids the medicare fiscal intermediary and medicare 
carrier functions medicare administrative contractors macs jurisdictions each mac 
geographically assigned and serves both part and part providers within given jurisdiction chain providers 
had the option having all hospitals use one home office mac and chose however cms has not 
converted all our hospitals one mac and currently does not have established date accomplish the

the bid competition mac transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow 
medicare integrity cms contracts with third parties promote the integrity the medicare program through

limiting the number records that racs may request from hospitals based each provider claim denial rate 
for the previous year 
the rac program scope also includes medicaid claims states may coordinate with medicaid racs

resulting from rac reviews and denials are appealable and pursue reversal adverse determinations 
appropriate appeal levels currently there are significant delays the assignment new medicare appeals 
administrative law judges according the office medicare hearings and appeals the average processing

bundled payment initiatives the cms innovation center responsible for establishing demonstration 
projects and other initiatives order identify develop test and encourage the adoption new methods 
delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the medicare and medicaid programs while 
maintaining improving quality care for example providers participating bundled payment initiatives 
accept accountability for costs and quality care agreeing receive one payment for services provided 
medicare patients for certain medical conditions episodes care rewarding providers for increasing 
quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers costs exceed certain amount bundled payment models 
are intended lead higher quality more coordinated care lower cost the medicare program the cms 
innovation center has implemented voluntary bundled payment program known the bundled payment for 
care improvement bpci initiative are participating bpci initiatives four our markets 
participation bundled payment programs generally voluntary but cms requires hospitals located certain 
geographic areas participate bundling programs for specified orthopedic procedures cms has indicated that 
developing more bundled payment models expect value based purchasing programs including models 
that condition reimbursement patient outcome measures become more common with both governmental 
and non governmental payors 
supply contracts 
purchase items primarily medical supplies medical equipment and pharmaceuticals under agreement 
with healthtrust gpo which are noncontrolling partner december had 
ownership interest healthtrust participating this organization are able procure items 
competitively priced rates for our hospitals there can assurance that our arrangement with healthtrust 
will continue provide the discounts that have historically received 
competition 
the hospital industry highly competitive the competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers 
for patients has intensified patients have become more conscious rising costs and quality care the 
healthcare decision making process certain our hospitals are located non urban service areas which 
are the sole provider general acute care health services those hospitals non urban service areas face 
direct competition because there are other hospitals their primary service areas however these hospitals 
face competition from hospitals outside their primary service area including hospitals urban areas that 
provide more complex services patients those service areas may travel these other hospitals for variety 
reasons including the need for services not offer physician referrals patients who are required seek 
services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences those hospitals for services 
provide our other hospitals selected urban service areas may face competition from hospitals that are more 
established than our hospitals certain these competing facilities offer services including extensive medical 
research and medical education programs which are not offered our facilities addition certain markets 
where operate there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities equipment and 
services that may not available our hospitals also face competition from other specialized care 
providers including outpatient surgery orthopedic oncology and diagnostic centers some competitors are 
implementing physician alignment strategies such employing physicians acquiring physician practice groups 
and participating acos other clinical integration models cost reduction strategies large employer 
groups and their affiliates may increase this competition believe that will continue face increased 
competition outpatient service models that become more integrated through acquisitions partnerships 
between physicians specialized care providers and managed care payors 
most markets which are not the sole provider general acute care health services our primary 
competitor not for profit hospital these hospitals are owned tax supported governmental agencies 
not for profit entities supported endowments and charitable contributions these hospitals not pay income 
property taxes and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax these financial advantages may 
better position such hospitals maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment 
and offer services more specialized than those available our hospitals recent consolidations not for profit 
hospitals may intensify competitive pressures 
the number and quality the physicians hospital staff important factor hospital competitive 
position physicians decide whether patient admitted the hospital and the procedures performed 
admitting physicians may the medical staffs other hospitals addition those our hospitals 
attempt attract our physicians patients our hospitals offering quality services and facilities convenient

hospitals submit connection with medicare reimbursement claims including performance data related 
quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys federal law provides for the future expansion the number 
quality measures that must reported additional quality measures and other future trends toward clinical 
transparency may have potential impact our competitive position and patient volumes ways that are

have been implementing portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy divesting hospitals and 
non hospital businesses that are attractive strategic and other buyers generally these businesses are not one 
our strategically beneficial service areas are less complementary our business strategy and have lower 
operating margins addition connection with our announced divestiture initiative strategic and other buyers 
have made offers buy certain our assets through consideration these offers have divested may 
divest hospitals and non hospital businesses when find such offers attractive and line with our 
operating strategy however there assurance that these contemplated divestitures will completed will 
completed within our contemplated timeframe will completed terms favorable terms 
sufficient allow achieve our deleveraging strategy additionally the results operations for these 
hospitals plan divest and the potential gains losses the sales those businesses may adversely affect 
our profitability moreover may incur asset impairment charges related divestitures that reduce our 
profitability 
addition after entering into definitive agreement may subject the satisfaction pre closing 
conditions well necessary regulatory and governmental approvals which not satisfied obtained may 
prevent from completing the sale divestitures may also involve continued financial exposure related the 
divested business such through indemnities retained obligations that present risk 
our planned divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include 
diversion management attention from improving existing operations additional restructuring charges and the 
related impact from separating personnel renegotiating contracts and restructuring financial and other systems 
adverse effects existing business relationships with patients and third party payors and the potential that the 
collectability any patient accounts receivable retained from any divested hospital may adversely impacted 
any these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results operations 
are the subject various legal regulatory and governmental proceedings that resolved unfavorably 
could have adverse effect and may subject other loss contingencies both known and 
unknown 
are party various legal regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters those 
proceedings include among other things government investigations addition are and may become subject 
other loss contingencies both known and unknown which may relate past present and future facts events 
circumstances and occurrences should unfavorable outcome occur connection with our legal regulatory 
governmental proceedings other loss contingencies become subject any such loss contingencies 
the future there could adverse impact our financial position results operations and liquidity 
moreover costs associated with hma legal proceedings and other loss contingencies may greater than 
expected and could exceed the amount any reduction payment under the contingent value rights cvrs 
issued the hma merger hma stockholders 
particular government investigations well qui tam lawsuits may lead significant fines penalties 
damages payments other sanctions including exclusion from government healthcare programs settlements 
lawsuits involving medicare and medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate 
integrity agreements each which could have adverse effect our business financial condition results 
operations and cash flows 
the impact past acquisitions well potential future acquisitions could have negative effect our 
operations 
our business strategy has historically included growth acquisitions however not for profit hospital 
systems and other for profit hospital companies generally attempt acquire the same type hospitals 
lifepoint health inc principal competitor for acquisitions other competitors include hca holdings inc 
hca uhs other non public for profit hospitals and local market hospitals some the competitors for our 
acquisitions have greater financial resources than have furthermore some hospitals are sold through 
auction process which may result higher purchase prices than believe are reasonable therefore may 
not able acquire additional hospitals terms favorable 
addition many the hospitals have acquired have had lower operating margins than and 
operating losses incurred prior the time acquired them hospitals acquired the future may have similar 
financial performance issues the past have experienced delays improving the operating margins 
effectively integrating the operations certain acquired hospitals including some hospitals acquired 
connection with the hma merger the future are unable improve the operating margins acquired 
hospitals operate them profitably effectively integrate their operations our results operations and business 
may adversely affected 
moreover hospitals that have acquired the future could acquire may have unknown contingent 
liabilities including liabilities associated with ongoing legal proceedings for failure comply with healthcare 
laws and regulations although generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters may 
nevertheless have material liabilities for past activities acquired hospitals 
state efforts regulate the construction acquisition expansion healthcare facilities could limit our 
ability build acquire additional healthcare facilities renovate our facilities expand the breadth 
services offer 
some states which operate require con other prior approval for the construction acquisition 
healthcare facilities capital expenditures exceeding prescribed amount changes bed capacity services and 
some other matters evaluating proposal these states consider the need for additional expanded healthcare 
facilities services are not able obtain required cons other prior approvals will not able 
acquire operate replace expand our facilities expand the breadth services offer furthermore 
con other prior approval upon which relied invest construction replacement expanded facility 
were revoked lost through appeal process may not able recover the value our investment 
state efforts regulate the sale hospitals operated municipal not for profit entities could prevent 
from acquiring these types hospitals 
many states have adopted legislation regarding the sale other disposition hospitals operated municipal 
not for profit entities some states that not have specific legislation the attorneys general have 
demonstrated interest these transactions under their general obligation protect the use charitable assets 
these legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily the appropriate valuation the assets divested 
and the use the proceeds the sale the non profit seller while these review and some instances 
approval processes can add additional time the closing hospital acquisition have not had any 
significant difficulties delays completing acquisitions however future state actions could delay even 
prevent our ability acquire hospitals once return our acquisition strategy 
are unable effectively compete for patients local residents could use other hospitals and healthcare 
providers 
the healthcare industry highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients 
affiliations with physicians and acquisitions however the majority our hospitals are located non urban 
service areas where believe are the sole provider general acute care health services result the 
most significant competition our hospitals face comes from hospitals outside our primary service areas 
typically hospitals urban areas that provide more complex services patients our primary service areas may 
travel other hospitals because physician referrals their need for services not offer among other 
reasons patients who receive services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences 
those hospitals for the services provide other healthcare providers including outpatient surgery orthopedic 
oncology and diagnostic centers also compete for patients our hospitals our competitors and other healthcare 
industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies such acquiring physician 
practice groups employing physicians and participating acos other clinical integration models which may 
impact our competitive position addition increasing consolidation within the payor industry vertical 
integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers and cost reduction strategies large employer 
groups and their affiliates may impact our ability contract with payors favorable terms and otherwise affect 
our competitive position 
december our hospitals competed with more than one other hospital their respective 
primary service areas most markets which are not the sole provider general acute care health 
services our primary competitor municipal not for profit hospital these hospitals are owned 
tax supported governmental agencies not for profit entities supported endowments and charitable 
contributions they not pay income property taxes and can make capital expenditures without paying sales 
tax these financial advantages may better position these hospitals maintain more modern and technologically 
upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available our hospitals our 
competitors are better able attract patients with these offerings may experience overall decline 
patient volume 
trends toward clinical transparency and value based purchasing may have unanticipated impact our 
competitive position and patient volumes the cms hospital compare website makes available the public 
certain data that hospitals submit connection with medicare reimbursement claims including performance data 
related quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys further every hospital must establish and update 
annually public listing the hospital standard charges for items and services publish its policies for 
allowing the public view list these charges response inquiry any our hospitals achieve poor 
results results that are lower than our competitors these quality measures patient satisfaction 
surveys our standard charges are higher than our competitors may attract fewer patients 
expect these competitive trends continue are unable compete effectively with other hospitals 
and other healthcare providers local residents may seek healthcare services providers other than our hospitals 
and affiliated businesses 
the failure obtain our medical supplies favorable prices could cause our operating results decline 
have participation agreement with healthtrust gpo the current term this agreement expires 
january with automatic renewal terms one year unless either party terminates giving notice 
non renewal gpos attempt obtain favorable pricing medical supplies with manufacturers and vendors 
sometimes negotiating exclusive supply arrangements exchange for discounts the extent these exclusive 
supply arrangements are challenged deemed unenforceable could incur higher costs for our medical 
supplies obtained through healthtrust further costs supplies and drugs may continue increase due 
market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product releases higher costs could continue 
adversely impact our operating results also there can assurance that our arrangement with healthtrust 
will provide the discounts expect achieve

are unable predict the ultimate impact health reform initiatives including the affordable care act 
and our business may adversely affected the affordable care act repealed entirely provisions 
benefitting our operations are significantly modified 
recent years the congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed large number 
proposals and legislation designed make major changes the healthcare system including changes intended 
increase access health insurance the most prominent these efforts the affordable care act affects how 
healthcare services are covered delivered and reimbursed the affordable care act mandates that substantially 
all citizens maintain health insurance coverage expands health insurance coverage through combination 
public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms reduces medicare reimbursement 
hospitals and promotes value based purchasing however december tax reform legislation was enacted 
that eliminates the financial penalty for individuals that fail maintain insurance coverage associated with the 
individual mandate effective january are unable determine the impact this change but could 
have adverse effect 
further efforts the presidential administration and certain members congress repeal make 
significant changes the affordable care act its implementation and its interpretation have cast 
considerable uncertainty the future the law for example presidential executive order has been signed 
that directs agencies minimize economic and regulatory burdens the affordable care act addition 
cms administrators have indicated that they intend grant states additional flexibility the administration 
state medicaid programs including expanding the scope waivers under which states may impose different 
eligibility enrollment restrictions otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards there 
uncertainty regarding whether when and how the affordable care act will further changed what alternative 
provisions any will enacted the timing enactment and implementation alternative provisions the 
impact alternative provisions providers well other healthcare industry participants and how the law 
will interpreted and implemented changes congress government agencies could eliminate alter 
provisions beneficial while leaving place provisions reducing our reimbursement government efforts 
repeal change the affordable care act implement other reform initiatives may have adverse effect 
our business results operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity other industry participants such 
private payors and large employer groups and their affiliates may also introduce financial delivery system 
reforms are unable predict the nature and success such initiatives 
reimbursement rates paid federal state healthcare programs commercial payors are reduced 
are unable maintain favorable contract terms with payors comply with our payor contract obligations 
insured individuals move insurance plans with greater coverage exclusions narrower networks 
insurance coverage otherwise restricted reduced our net operating revenues may decline 
our operating revenues net contractual allowances and discounts but before the 
provision for bad debts came from the medicare and medicaid programs however federal healthcare 
expenditures continue increase and state governments continue face budgetary shortfalls federal and state 
governments have made and continue make significant changes the medicare and medicaid programs 
these changes include reductions reimbursement levels and supplemental payment programs like 
disproportionate share hospital programs well new modified demonstration projects authorized pursuant 
medicaid waivers some these changes have decreased could decrease the amount money receive 
for our services relating these programs 
addition government and commercial payors well other third parties from whom receive payment 
for our services attempt control healthcare costs for example requiring hospitals discount payments for 
their services exchange for exclusive preferred participation their benefit plans restricting coverage 
through utilization review reducing coverage inpatient services and shifting care outpatient settings 
requiring prior authorizations and implementing alternative payment models the ability commercial payors 
control healthcare costs using these measures may enhanced the increasing consolidation insurance 
and managed care companies and vertical integration health insurers with healthcare providers 
our operating revenues net contractual allowances and discounts but before the 
provision for bad debts came from commercial payors our contracts with payors require comply with 
number terms related the provision services and billing for services are unable negotiate 
increased reimbursement rates maintain existing rates other favorable contract terms effectively respond 
payor cost controls comply with the terms our payor contracts the payments receive for our services 
may reduced may involved disputes with payors and experience payment denials both 
prospectively and retroactively addition individuals have been increasingly enrolling high deductible 
health plans which tend have lower reimbursement rates for providers along with higher pays and 
deductibles due from the patient comparison traditional health plans these plans sometimes referred 
consumer directed plans may even exclude our hospitals and employed physicians from coverage 
the demand for services provided our hospitals can impacted factors beyond our control 
our admissions and adjusted admissions well acuity trends may impacted factors beyond our 
control for example seasonal fluctuations the severity influenza and other critical illnesses unplanned 
shutdowns unavailability our facilities due weather other unforeseen events decreases trends 
high acuity service offerings changes competition from outside service providers turnover physicians 
affiliated with our hospitals changes medical technology can have impact the demand for services 
our hospitals the impact these other factors beyond our control could have adverse effect our 
business financial position and results operations 
may adversely affected consolidation among health insurers and other industry participants 
recent years number health insurers have merged increased efforts consolidate with other 
non governmental payors insurers are also increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives with healthcare providers 
consolidation within the health insurance industry may result insurers having increased negotiating leverage 
and competitive advantages such greater access performance and pricing data our ability negotiate 
prices and favorable terms with health insurers certain markets could affected negatively result this 
consolidation also the shift toward value based payment models could accelerated larger insurers 
including those engaging consolidation activities find these models financially beneficial cannot 
predict whether will able negotiate favorable terms with payors and otherwise respond effectively the 
impact increased consolidation the payor industry vertical integration efforts 
fail comply with extensive laws and government regulations including fraud and abuse laws 
could suffer penalties required make significant changes our operations 
the healthcare industry governed laws and regulations the federal state and local government levels 
these laws and regulations include standards addressing among other issues the adequacy medical care 
equipment personnel operating policies and procedures billing and coding for services properly handling 
overpayments classification levels care provided preparing and filing cost reports relationships with 
referral sources and referral recipients maintenance adequate records compliance with building codes 
environmental protection privacy and security debt collection and communications with patients and 
consumers examples these laws include but are not limited hipaa the stark law the federal antikickback statute the fca the emergency medical treatment and active labor act and similar state laws 
fail comply with applicable laws and regulations could suffer civil sanctions and criminal penalties 
including the loss our operating licenses and our ability participate the medicare medicaid and other 
federal and state healthcare programs 
addition there are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts both federal and state 
government agencies relating the healthcare industry including the hospital segment recent enforcement 
actions have focused financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians billing for services without 
adequately documenting medical necessity and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such 
services specific our hospitals have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental 
agencies regarding these and other matters and are also subject various claims and lawsuits relating 
such matters for further discussion these matters see legal proceedings part item this form

operations and financial position 
december the federal government passed comprehensive federal tax reform through the 
enactment the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act makes changes the corporate tax 
rate and business related deductions among others that will generally effective for taxable years beginning 
after december these changes could have adverse impact the value our deferred tax assets 
which would result significant charges the current future taxable years and increase our future tax 
expense are continuing evaluate the tax act and its requirements well its application our 
business and its impact our effective tax rate this stage unclear how many states will incorporate 
these federal law changes portions thereof into their tax codes due the timing the enactment and the 
complexity involved applying the provisions the tax act the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 
which provides registrants measurement period report the impact the tax act the extent 
were able determine reasonable estimate the effects the tax act recorded provisional amounts 
our financial statements for the year ended december complete our analysis the tax act 
collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance from standard setting bodies may 
make adjustments provisional amounts that have recorded that may materially impact our provision for 
income taxes the period which the adjustments are made 
could subject substantial uninsured liabilities increased insurance costs result significant 
legal actions 
physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject increasing number legal 
actions alleging malpractice product liability related legal theories even states that have imposed caps 
damages litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories liability that might not subject the caps 
damages many these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs protect from the cost 
these claims maintain claims made professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance 
coverage excess those amounts for which are self insured this insurance coverage amounts that 
believe sufficient for our operations however our insurance coverage may not continue available 
reasonable cost for maintain adequate levels insurance additionally our insurance coverage does not 
cover all claims against such fines penalties other damage and legal expense payments resulting from 
qui tam lawsuits cannot predict the outcome current future legal actions against the effect that 
judgments settlements such matters may have our insurance costs additionally all professional 
and general liability insurance purchase subject policy limitations the aggregate limit any our 
professional and general liability policies exhausted whole part could deplete reduce the limits 
available pay any other material claims applicable that policy period furthermore one more our 
insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable fulfill its their obligations defend pay reimburse 
when those obligations become due that case payments claims exceed our estimates are not 
covered our insurance could have adverse effect our business financial condition results

could subject increased monetary penalties and other sanctions including exclusion from federal 
healthcare programs fail comply with the terms the corporate integrity agreement 
august announced that had entered into civil settlement with the department 
justice other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and 
litigation related short stay admissions through emergency departments certain our affiliated hospitals 
see our discussion this matter under the section business community health systems inc part 
item this form and legal proceedings part item our quarterly report form for 
the quarterly period ended september for further discussion the background this matter and details 
the settlement addition the amounts paid the settlement executed the cia with the oig that has

our primary collection risks relate uninsured patients and outstanding patient balances for which the 
primary insurance payor has paid some but not all the outstanding balance with the remaining outstanding 
balance generally deductibles and payments owed the patient collections are impacted the economic 
ability patients pay and the effectiveness our collection efforts significant changes payor mix 
business office operations economic conditions trends federal and state governmental healthcare coverage 
may affect our collection accounts receivable and are considered our estimates accounts receivable 
collectability 
efforts repeal revise the affordable care act have cast considerable uncertainty the future the law 
and its effects the size the uninsured population for example part the tax act adopted 
congress eliminated effective january the financial penalty associated with the affordable care act 
mandate that individuals enroll insurance plan which may impact the number individuals who elect 
purchase health insurance addition the number and identity states that choose expand otherwise 
modify medicaid programs and the terms those changes continues evolve these variables among others 
make difficult predict the number uninsured individuals and what percentage our total revenue will 
comprised self pay revenues 
moreover may still adversely affected the growth patient responsibility accounts result 
increases the adoption plan structures including health savings accounts narrow networks and tiered 
networks which shift greater responsibility for care individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and 
deductible amounts further our ability collect patient responsibility accounts may limited statutory 
regulatory and investigatory initiatives including private lawsuits directed hospital charges and collection 
practices for uninsured and underinsured patients addition deterioration economic conditions the 
united states could potentially lead higher levels uninsured patients result higher levels patients 
covered lower paying government programs result fiscal uncertainties both government payors and 
private insurers and limit the economic ability patients make payments for which they are responsible 
experience growth self pay volume deterioration collectability patient responsibility accounts our 
financial condition results operations could adversely affected 
many the non urban communities which operate continue face challenging economic conditions 
and the failure certain employers the closure certain manufacturing and other facilities our 
markets could have disproportionate impact our hospitals 
many the non urban communities which operate continue face challenging economic conditions 
including higher levels unemployment than other regions the united states addition the economies 
the non urban communities which our hospitals primarily operate are often dependent small number 
large employers especially manufacturing similar facilities these employers often provide income and health 
insurance for disproportionately large number community residents who may depend our hospitals for 
care the failure one more large employers the closure substantial reduction the number 
individuals employed manufacturing other facilities located near many the non urban communities 
which our hospitals primarily operate could cause affected employees move elsewhere for employment 
lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available them when patients are experiencing personal financial 
difficulties have concerns about general economic conditions they may 
delay forgo elective procedures 
purchase high deductible insurance plan insurance all which increases hospital 
dependence self pay revenue 
choose seek care emergency rooms 
the occurrence these events may cause reduction our revenues and adversely impact our results 
operations 
there are delays regulatory updates governmental entities federal and state healthcare programs 
may experience increased volatility our operating results such delays may result timing difference 
between when such program revenues are earned and when they become known estimable for purposes 
accounting recognition 
derive significant amount our net operating revenues from governmental healthcare programs 
primarily medicare and medicaid the reimbursements due from those programs are subject legislative 
and regulatory changes that can have significant impact our operating results when delays occur the 
implementation regulations passage legislation there the potential for material increases decreases 
operating revenues recognized periods subsequent when such related services were performed 
resulting the potential for adverse effect our consolidated financial position and consolidated results 
operations 
our adoption and utilization electronic health record systems fails satisfy hhs standards our 
consolidated results operations could adversely affected 
under the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech and other laws 
hhs has established medicare and medicaid incentive programs encourage hospitals and healthcare 
professionals adopt ehr technology eligible hospitals can receive medicaid incentive payments for their 
adoption and meaningful use certified ehr technology medicare incentive payments are longer available 
eligible hospitals that fail demonstrate meaningful use certified ehr technology and have not applied and 
qualified for hardship exception are subject reduced reimbursement from medicare eligible healthcare 
professionals are also subject positive negative payment adjustments based part their use ehr 
technology thus our hospitals and employed professionals are unable properly adopt maintain and utilize 
certified ehr systems will not eligible receive incentive payments the extent incentive payments 
remain available and could subject penalties and lawsuits that may have adverse effect our 
consolidated financial position and consolidated results operations 
our operations could significantly impacted interruptions restrictions access our information

our operations depend heavily effective information systems process clinical operational and financial 
information information systems require ongoing commitment significant resources maintain and

pandemic epidemic outbreak infectious disease the markets which operate that 
otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business 
pandemic epidemic outbreak infectious disease other public health crisis were affect our 
markets our business could adversely affected such crisis could diminish the public trust healthcare 
facilities especially hospitals that fail accurately timely diagnose that are treating have treated 
patients affected contagious diseases any our facilities were involved treating patients for such 
contagious disease other patients might cancel elective procedures fail seek needed care our facilities 
further pandemic might adversely impact our business causing temporary shutdown diversion 
patients disrupting delaying production and delivery materials and products the supply chain 
causing staffing shortages our facilities although have disaster plans place and operate pursuant 
infectious disease protocols the potential impact pandemic epidemic outbreak infectious disease 
with respect our markets our facilities difficult predict and could adversely impact our business 
our performance depends our ability recruit and retain quality physicians 
the success our healthcare facilities depends part the number and quality the physicians the 
medical staffs our healthcare facilities our ability employ quality physicians the admitting and utilization 
practices employed and independent physicians maintaining good relations with those physicians and 
controlling costs related the employment physicians although employ some physicians physicians are 
often not employees our healthcare facilities which they practice many the markets serve many 
physicians have admitting privileges other healthcare facilities addition our healthcare facilities such 
physicians may terminate their affiliation with employment our healthcare facilities any time 
addition may face increased challenges this area the physician population reaches retirement age 
especially there shortage physicians willing and able provide comparable services moreover 
are unable provide adequate support personnel technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet 
the needs those physicians and their patients they may discouraged from referring patients our facilities 
admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline 
our labor costs could adversely affected competition for staffing the shortage experienced nurses and 
labor union activity 
addition our physicians the operations our healthcare facilities are dependent the efforts abilities 
and experience our management and medical support personnel such nurses pharmacists and lab 
technicians compete with other healthcare providers recruiting and retaining qualified management and 
support personnel responsible for the daily operations our healthcare facilities including nurses and other 
non physician healthcare professionals some markets the availability nurses and other medical support 
personnel has been significant operating issue healthcare providers may required continue 
enhance wages and benefits recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel hire more 
expensive temporary contract personnel addition the states which operate could adopt mandatory 
nurse staffing ratios could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already place state mandated nursestaffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have adverse impact revenues are required 
limit admissions order meet the required ratios 
increased ongoing labor union activity another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs 
otherwise adversely impact the extent significant portion our employee base unionizes our labor costs 
could increase significantly addition when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions whether 
such agreements are renewals first contracts there the possibility that strikes could occur during the 
negotiation process and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs and otherwise 
adversely impact 
our labor costs increase may not able raise rates offset these increased costs because 
significant percentage our revenues consists fixed prospective payments our ability pass along increased 
labor costs constrained the event are not entirely effective recruiting and retaining qualified 
management nurses and other medical support personnel controlling labor costs this could have 
adverse effect our results operations 
the industry trend towards value based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues 
the trend toward value based purchasing healthcare services gaining momentum across the healthcare 
industry among both government and commercial payors generally value based purchasing initiatives tie 
payment the quality and efficiency care for example hospital payments may negatively impacted the 
occurrence hacs the hospitals with the worst national risk adjusted hac rates for all hospitals 
the previous year receive reduction their total medicare payments medicare does not reimburse for care 
related hacs addition federal funds may not used under the medicaid program reimburse providers 
for services provided treat hacs hospitals that experience excess readmissions for designated conditions 
receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges hhs also reduces medicare inpatient hospital payments 
for all discharges required percentage and pools the amount collected from these reductions fund 
payments reward hospitals that meet exceed certain quality performance standards further medicare and 
medicaid require hospitals report certain quality data receive full reimbursement updates 
hhs has indicated that particularly focused tying medicare payments quality value through 
alternative payment models which generally aim make providers attentive the quality and cost care they 
deliver patients examples alternative payment models include acos and bundled payment arrangements 
generally participation bundled payment programs voluntary but cms requires hospitals located certain 
geographic areas participate programs for specified orthopedic procedures cms has indicated that 
developing more bundled payment models although unclear whether these and other alternative payment 
models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs whether they will decrease aggregate 
reimbursement several the nation largest commercial payors have also expressed intent increase 
reliance value based reimbursement arrangements further many large commercial payors require hospitals 
report quality data and several commercial payors not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse 
events 
expect value based purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement patient 
outcome measures become more common and involve higher percentage reimbursement amounts 
are unable this time predict how this trend will affect our results operations but could negatively 
impact our revenues our cost operations both 
our revenues are somewhat concentrated small number states which will make particularly sensitive 
regulatory and economic changes those states 
our revenues are particularly sensitive regulatory and economic changes states which generate 
significant portion our revenues including florida pennsylvania texas indiana and tennessee accordingly 
any change the current demographic economic competitive regulatory conditions these states could have 
adverse effect our business financial condition results operations changes the medicaid programs 
these states could also have adverse effect our business financial condition results operations cash 
flows december cms announced that will phase out federal matching funds for designated state 
health programs under waivers granted pursuant section the social security act currently the texas 
healthcare transformation and quality improvement program the texas waiver program which provides 
funding for uncompensated care and delivery system reform initiatives operated under such waiver 
december cms approved extension this waiver through september addition effective 
october cms will require texas revise the disbursement methodology for uncompensated care pool 
funding align with federal policies texas will not receive any federal financial participation for 
uncompensated care pool payments for the demonstration years after october until cms approves 
uncompensated care protocol addendum cannot predict whether the texas waiver program will further 
extended changed guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease 
addition some our hospitals florida texas and other areas along the gulf coast are located 
hurricane prone areas the past hurricanes have had disruptive effect the operations our hospitals 
florida texas and other coastal states and the patient populations those states our business activities could 
harmed particularly active hurricane season even single storm and the property insurance obtain

legislative overview 
the congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed large number proposals and 
legislation designed make major changes the healthcare system including changes that have increased 
access health insurance the most prominent these recent efforts the affordable care act affects how 
healthcare services are covered delivered and reimbursed mandates that substantially all citizens 
maintain health insurance and increases health insurance coverage through combination public program 
expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
however the future the affordable care act uncertain the presidential administration and certain 
members congress have stated their intent repeal make significant changes the affordable care act 
its implementation its interpretation for example part the tax reform legislation which was enacted 
december congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate effective 
january which may result fewer individuals electing purchase health insurance addition the 
president signed executive order directing agencies relax limits certain health plans potentially 
permitting the sale short term health insurance plans and coverage that does not meet the affordable care 
act minimum requirements critical importance will the potential impact any changes specific 
the medicaid funding and expansion provisions the affordable care act operate hospitals five the 
ten states that experienced the largest reductions uninsured rates among adult residents between and 
general the states with the greatest reductions the number uninsured adult residents have expanded 
medicaid number states have opted out the medicaid coverage expansion provisions but could 
ultimately decide expand their programs later date the states which operated hospitals that 
were included continuing operations december states have taken action expand their 
medicaid programs this time the other states have not including florida tennessee and texas where 
operated significant number hospitals december some states use have applied use 
waivers granted cms implement expansion impose different eligibility enrollment restrictions 
otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards cms administrators have indicated that they are 
increasing state flexibility the administration medicaid programs for example cms has granted limited 
number state applications for waivers that allow state condition medicaid enrollment work other 
community engagement several states have similar applications pending 
the affordable care act makes number changes medicare and medicaid such reductions the 
medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years through productivity offset the 
medicare market basket update and reduction the medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital 
payments each which could adversely impact the reimbursement received under these programs the 
affordable care act also includes provisions aimed reducing fraud waste and abuse the healthcare industry 
believe that the affordable care act has had positive impact net operating revenues and income from 
continuing operations the result the expansion private sector and medicaid coverage that has occurred 
however legislative and executive branch efforts related healthcare reform could result increased prices for 
consumers purchasing health insurance coverage the sale insurance plans that contain gaps coverage 
which could destabilize insurance markets and impact the rates uninsured underinsured adults other 
provisions the affordable care act such requirements related employee health insurance coverage and 
changes medicare and medicaid reimbursement have increased our operating costs adversely impacted the 
reimbursement receive 
difficult predict the ongoing effect the affordable care act due executive orders changes the 
law implementation clarifications and modifications resulting from the rule making process judicial 
interpretations resulting from court challenges its constitutionality and interpretation whether and how many 
states ultimately decide expand medicaid coverage the number uninsured who elect purchase health 
insurance coverage budgetary issues federal and state levels and efforts change repeal the statute 
may not able fully realize the positive impact the affordable care act may otherwise have our business 
results operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity cannot predict whether will able 
modify certain aspects our operations offset any potential adverse consequences from the affordable care 
act the impact any alternative provisions that may adopted 
recent years number laws including the affordable care act and macra have promoted shifting 
from traditional fee for service reimbursement models alternative payment models that tie reimbursement 
quality and cost care cms currently administers various acos and bundled payment demonstration projects 
and has indicated that will continue pursue similar initiatives 
the federal government has implemented number regulations and programs designed promote the use 
ehr technology and pursuant the health information technology for economic and clinical health act 
hitech established requirements for medicare and medicaid incentive payments program for eligible 
hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified ehr technology these payments are 
available for maximum period five six years depending the program our hospital facilities have been 
implementing ehr technology facility facility basis since recognize incentive reimbursement 
related the medicare medicaid incentives are able implement the certified ehr technology and 
meet the defined meaningful use criteria and information from completed cost report periods available from 
which calculate the incentive reimbursement the timing recognizing incentive reimbursement does not 
correlate with the timing recognizing operating expenses and incurring capital costs connection with the 
implementation ehr technology which may result material period period changes our future results 
operations 
eligible hospitals and professionals that have not demonstrated meaningful use certified ehr technology 
and have not applied and qualified for hardship exception are subject payment adjustments eligible 
hospitals are subject reduced market basket update the inpatient prospective payment system standardized 
amount and for each subsequent fiscal year eligible professionals are subject per year 
cumulative reduction applied the mpfs amount for covered professional services subject cap 
payment adjustments for eligible professionals failing demonstrate meaningful use will longer 
applicable beginning when the program scheduled replaced mips 
although believe that our hospital facilities are currently compliance with the meaningful use standards 
there can assurance that all our facilities will remain compliance and therefore not subject the 
hitech payment reductions recognized approximately million million and million during 
the years ended december and respectively for hitech incentive reimbursements from 
medicare and medicaid related certain our hospitals and for certain our employed physicians which are 
presented reduction operating expenses our hospital facilities and affiliated professionals have 
achieved substantial compliance with the hitech standards and the majority have completed the maximum 
time period for receiving incentive payments the amount incentive reimbursements will continue decline 
the future 
result our current levels cash available borrowing capacity long term outlook our debt 
repayments the refinancing our term loans and our continued projection our ability generate cash flows 
anticipate that will able invest the necessary capital our business over the next twelve months

included managed care and other third party payors operating revenues from insurance companies with 
which have insurance provider contracts medicare managed care insurance companies for which not 
have insurance provider contracts workers compensation carriers and non patient service revenue such 
rental income and cafeteria sales the future generally expect revenues received from the medicare and 
medicaid programs increase due the general aging the population addition the affordable care act 
has increased the number insured patients states that have expanded medicaid which turn has reduced 
the percentage revenues from self pay patients however unclear whether the trend increased coverage 
will continue due part the elimination the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate 
effective january further the affordable care act imposes significant reductions amounts the 
government pays medicare managed care plans the trend toward increased enrollment medicare managed 
care may adversely affect our operating revenue growth other provisions the affordable care act impose 
minimum medical loss ratios and require insurers meet specific benefit requirements furthermore the 
normal course business managed care programs insurance companies and employers actively negotiate the 
amounts paid hospitals the trend toward increased enrollment managed care may adversely affect our 
operating revenue growth there can assurance that will retain our existing reimbursement 
arrangements that these third party payors will not attempt further reduce the rates they pay for our services 
net operating revenues include amounts estimated management reimbursable medicare and 
medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions cost based reimbursement and other payment 
methods addition are reimbursed non governmental payors using variety payment methodologies 
amounts receive for the treatment patients covered medicare medicaid and non governmental payors 
are generally less than the standard billing rates account for the differences between the estimated program 
reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates contractual allowance adjustments which deduct from 
gross revenues arrive net operating revenues final settlements under some these programs are subject 
adjustment based administrative review and audit third parties account for adjustments previous 
program reimbursement estimates contractual allowance adjustments and report them the periods that such

reimbursement estimates impacted net operating revenues and net loss income insignificant amount 
each the years ended december and 
the payment rates under the medicare program for hospital inpatient and outpatient acute care services are 
based prospective payment system depending upon the diagnosis patient condition these rates are 
indexed for inflation annually although increases have historically been less than actual inflation august 
cms issued the final rule increase this index for hospital inpatient acute care services that are 
reimbursed under the prospective payment system beginning october the final rule provides for 
multifactor productivity reduction and reduction hospital inpatient rates implemented pursuant the 
affordable care act which together with other payment adjustments will yield estimated net increase 
reimbursement for hospitals additional reduction applies hospitals that not submit required patient 
quality data are complying with this data submission requirement further cms has indicated that medicare 
disproportionate share payments and changes additional uncompensated care payments will increase overall 
inpatient hospital payment rates approximately payments may also affected admission and 
medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known the two midnight rule under the rule for 
admissions after october services medicare beneficiaries are only payable inpatient hospital 
services when there reasonable expectation that the hospital care medically necessary and will required 
across two midnights absent unusual circumstances stays expected need less than two midnights hospital 
care are subject medical review case case basis reductions the rate increase overall 
reductions medicare reimbursement may cause decline the growth our net operating revenues 
currently several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs for the purpose providing 
reimbursement providers offset portion the cost providing care medicaid and indigent patients 
these programs are designed with input from cms and are funded with combination state and federal 
resources including certain instances fees taxes levied the providers similar programs are also being 
considered other states the programs are generally authorized for specified period time and require 
cms approval extended cms has indicated that will take into account state status with respect 
expanding its medicaid program considering whether extend these supplemental programs are unable 
predict whether what terms cms will extend the supplemental programs the states which 
operate result existing supplemental programs recognize revenue and related expenses the period 
which the fixed and determinable amounts are estimable and collection reasonably assured reimbursement

reimbursement legislative and regulatory changes 
ongoing legislative and regulatory efforts could reduce otherwise adversely affect the payments receive 
from medicare and medicaid and other payors within the statutory framework the medicare and medicaid 
programs there are substantial areas subject administrative rulings interpretations and discretion which may 
further affect payments made under those programs and the federal and state governments might the future 
reduce the funds available under those programs require more stringent utilization and quality reviews 
hospital facilities additionally there may continued rise managed care programs and additional 
restructuring the financing and delivery healthcare the united states these events could cause our future 
financial results decline cannot estimate the impact medicare and medicaid reimbursement changes

critical accounting policies 
the discussion and analysis our financial condition and results operations are based upon our

these financial statements requires make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount assets 
and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date our 
consolidated financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined those that are reflective significant judgments and uncertainties 
and potentially result materially different results under different assumptions and conditions believe that 
our critical accounting policies are limited those described below 
third party reimbursement 
net operating revenues include amounts estimated management reimbursable medicare and 
medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
addition are reimbursed non governmental payors using variety payment methodologies amounts 
receive for treatment patients covered these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
contractual allowances are calculated and recorded through internally developed data collection and analysis 
tools automate the monthly estimation required contractual allowances within this automated system 
payors historical paid claims data are utilized calculate the contractual allowances this data automatically 
updated monthly basis all hospital contractual allowance calculations are subjected monthly review 
management ensure reasonableness and accuracy account for the differences between the estimated 
program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates contractual allowance adjustments which 
deduct from gross revenues arrive operating revenues net contractual allowances and discounts the 
process estimating contractual allowances requires estimate the amount expected received based 
payor contract provisions the key assumption this process the estimated contractual reimbursement 
percentage which based payor classification and historical paid claims data 
throughout and culminating with the financial close process december developed new 
accounting methodologies and processes implement the new accounting standard for revenue recognition that 
adopted effective january implementing new data extraction techniques and updated hindsight 
information historical collection data are able better estimate the net amount after contractual 
allowances owed the third party payor and what will owed the patient based historical experience 
such updated information included portfolio level data related historical collection amounts individual 
hospital and patient level that previously had not been readily available using this information created new 
accounting process which can estimate contractual allowances per patient basis addition this 
new accounting methodology also revised our methods estimating contractual allowances expand 
the hindsight period over which analyze payors historical paid claims data estimate contractual 
allowances expand the basis for payor denied claims refine the hindsight reserve for such denials and 
adjust the contractual allowances for certain categories commercial payors using more precise historical 
experience based recent patterns account reimbursement this analysis also included evaluation 
patient accounts receivable retained after the divestiture hospitals throughout and certain other 
revenues based these new accounting processes and methodologies recorded change estimate during 
the three months ended december increase contractual allowances approximately million 
due the complexities involved these estimates actual payments receive could different from the 
amounts estimate and record the actual contractual reimbursement percentage under government programs 
and managed care contracts differed december from our estimated reimbursement percentage 
net loss for the year ended december would have changed approximately million and net 
accounts receivable december would have changed million final settlements under some 
these programs are subject adjustment based administrative review and audit third parties account 
for adjustments previous program reimbursement estimates contractual allowance adjustments and report 
them the periods that such adjustments become known contractual allowance adjustments related final 
settlements and previous program reimbursement estimates impacted net operating revenues and net loss 
insignificant amount each the years ended december and 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all our accounts receivable are related providing healthcare services patients our 
hospitals and affiliated businesses collection these accounts receivable our primary source cash and 
critical our operating performance our primary collection risks relate uninsured patients and outstanding 
patient balances for which the primary insurance payor has paid some but not all the outstanding balance with 
the remaining outstanding balance generally deductibles and payments owed the patient for all 
procedures scheduled advance our policy verify insurance coverage prior the date the procedure

anticipated changes trends our ability estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts not impacted not 
utilizing aging our net accounts receivable believe that substantially all the risk exists the point 
time such accounts are identified self pay 
discussed above with respect our accounting policy for third party reimbursement our historical 
accounting systems and processes estimate net operating revenues from third party payors did not have the 
ability specifically identify the portion insured patient account that was due from the patient 
deductibles and payments and did not have portfolio level data related historical collection amounts 
individual hospital patient level part the new accounting methodologies and processes developed 
implement the new accounting standard revenue recognition which was required adopted 
january changed our methodology for estimating those amounts that are recorded part the 
receivable with the primary insurance payor but will ultimately due from the patient while our historical 
estimation process for the allowance for doubtful accounts utilized historical write off and collection information 
consolidated basis the new processes and related data obtained from the hindsight analysis provided 
updated information the ultimate collectability all patient accounts for the amount the date service that 
will ultimately due from the patient such information was evaluated portfolio level payor and 
hospital rather than consolidated basis this analysis also included evaluation patient accounts

goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess the fair value the consideration conveyed the acquisition over the fair 
value net assets acquired goodwill evaluated for impairment the same time every year and when event 
occurs circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value the reporting unit below its 
carrying value prior the adoption asu that further discussed below there was two step 
method for determining goodwill impairment step one was compare the fair value the reporting unit with 
the unit carrying amount including goodwill this test indicated the fair value was less than the carrying 
value then step two was required compare the implied fair value the reporting unit goodwill with the 
carrying value the reporting unit goodwill our most recent annual goodwill evaluation was performed 
during the fourth quarter 
during the year ended december allocated approximately million goodwill the 
spin off qhc including approximately million goodwill related the former management services 
reporting unit and approximately million goodwill allocated from the hospital operations reporting unit 
based relative fair value calculation the hospitals that were included the qhc distribution 
allocated approximately million goodwill hospitals held for sale based calculation the relative 
fair value those hospitals compared the total hospital reporting unit goodwill additionally allocated 
approximately million goodwill related the sale the majority ownership interest the home care 
operations reporting unit december december had approximately billion 
goodwill recorded all which resides our hospital operations reporting unit 
during the three months ended june identified certain indicators impairment requiring 
interim goodwill impairment evaluation those indicators were primarily the decline our market capitalization 
and fair value long term debt during the three months ended june and decline our projected 
future earnings performed estimated calculation fair value step one the impairment test 
june which indicated that the carrying value our hospital operations reporting unit exceeded its fair 
value initial step two calculation was performed determine the implied value goodwill hypothetical 
purchase price allocation recorded estimated non cash impairment charge billion goodwill 
june based these analyses and adjusted the estimated impairment charge based the final step two

during the three months ended december connection with the preparation the financial 
statements included this form identified certain indicators impairment and performed interim 
goodwill impairment evaluation november those indicators were primarily further decline 
our market capitalization and fair value our long term debt during november performed 
estimated calculation fair value step one the impairment test november which indicated that 
the carrying value our hospital operations reporting unit exceeded its fair value further discussed the 
footnotes the consolidated financial statements during the three months ended december early 
adopted the accounting guidance asu which eliminates the step two calculation determine the 
implied value goodwill and instead requires impairment goodwill equal the difference between the 
carrying value and estimated fair value the reporting unit determined step one result this evaluation 
and the early adoption asu recorded non cash impairment charge billion goodwill 
during the three months ended december 
the reduction our fair value and the resulting goodwill impairment charges recorded during and 
reduced the carrying value our hospital operations reporting unit amount equal our estimated fair 
value this increases the risk that future declines fair value could result goodwill impairment the 
determination fair value step one our goodwill impairment analysis based estimate fair value 
for the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs the evaluation date some 
those inputs include but are not limited the most recent price our common stock fair value our longterm debt estimates future revenue and expense growth estimated market multiples expected capital 
expenditures income tax rates and costs invested capital future estimates fair value could adversely 
affected the actual outcome one more these assumptions changes materially the future including 
further decline our stock price fair value our long term debt lower than expected hospital volumes 
higher market interest rates increased operating costs such changes impacting the calculation our fair value 
could result material impairment charge the future the next annual goodwill evaluation will performed

level our hospital operations and actuarially determined projections the actuarially determined projections 
are based our actual claim data including historic reporting and payment patterns which have been gathered 
over approximately year period discussed below since purchase excess insurance claims made 
basis that transfers risk third party insurers the liability accrue does include amount for the losses 
covered our excess insurance also record receivable for the expected reimbursement losses covered 
our excess insurance since believe that the amount and timing our future claims payments are reliably 
determinable discount the amount accrue for losses resulting from professional liability claims using the 
risk free interest rate corresponding the timing our expected payments 
the net present value the projected payments was discounted using weighted average risk free rate 
and and respectively this liability adjusted for new claims information 
the period such information becomes known professional malpractice expense includes the losses 
resulting from professional liability claims and loss adjustment expense well paid excess insurance 
premiums and presented within other operating expenses the accompanying consolidated statements

our processes for obtaining and analyzing claims and incident data are standardized across all our hospitals 
and have been consistent for many years monitor the outcomes the medical care services that provide 
and for each reported claim obtain various information concerning the facts and circumstances related that 
claim addition routinely monitor current key statistics and volume indicators our assessment 
utilizing historical trends the average lag period between claim occurrence and payment final settlement 
between three and four years although the facts and circumstances individual claims could result the timing 
such payments being different from this average since claims are paid promptly after settlement with the 
claimant reached settled claims represent approximately the total liability the end any period 
for purposes estimating our individual claim accruals utilize specific claim information including the 
nature the claim the expected claim amount the year which the claim occurred and the laws the 
jurisdiction which the claim occurred once the case accruals for known claims are determined information 
stratified loss layers and retentions accident years reported years geography and claims relating the 
acquired hma hospitals versus claims relating our other hospitals several actuarial methods are used against 
this data produce estimates ultimate paid losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims each 
these methods uses our company specific historical claims data and other information this company specific 
data includes information regarding our business including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
historical and current case loss reserves actual and projected hospital statistical data variety hospital census 
information employed physician information professional liability retentions for each policy year geographic 
information and other data 
based these analyses determine our estimate the professional liability claims the determination 
management estimate including the preparation the reserve analysis that supports such estimate involves 
subjective judgment management changes reserving data the trends and factors that influence reserving 
data may signal fundamental shifts our future claim development patterns may simply reflect single period 
anomalies even change reflects fundamental shift the full extent the change may not become evident 
until years later moreover since our methods and models use different types data and select our liability 
from the results all these methods typically cannot quantify the precise impact such factors our 
estimates the liability due our standardized and consistent processes for handling claims and the long 
history and depth our company specific data our methodologies have produced reliably determinable

the company processes for obtaining and analyzing claims and incident data are standardized across all 
its hospitals and have been consistent for many years the company monitors the outcomes the medical care 
services that provides and for each reported claim the company obtains various information concerning the

occurrence and payment final settlement between three and four years although the facts and 
community health systems inc and subsidiaries 
notes consolidated financial statements continued 
circumstances individual claims could result the timing such payments being different from this average 
since claims are paid promptly after settlement with the claimant reached settled claims represent 
approximately the total liability the end any period 
for purposes estimating its individual claim accruals the company utilizes specific claim information 
including the nature the claim the expected claim amount the year which the claim occurred and the laws 
the jurisdiction which the claim occurred once the case accruals for known claims are determined 
information stratified loss layers and retentions accident years reported years geography and claims 
relating the acquired hma hospitals versus claims relating the company other hospitals several actuarial 
methods are used against this data produce estimates ultimate paid losses and reserves for incurred but not 
reported claims each these methods uses company specific historical claims data and other information this 
company specific data includes information regarding the company business including historical paid losses 
and loss adjustment expenses historical and current case loss reserves actual and projected hospital statistical 
data variety hospital census information employed physician information professional liability retentions 
for each policy year geographic information and other data 
based these analyses the company determines its estimate the professional liability claims the 
determination management estimate including the preparation the reserve analysis that supports such 
estimate involves subjective judgment the management changes reserving data the trends and factors 
that influence reserving data may signal fundamental shifts the company future claim development patterns 
may simply reflect single period anomalies even change reflects fundamental shift the full extent the 
change may not become evident until years later moreover since the company methods and models use 
different types data and the company selects its liability from the results all these methods typically 
cannot quantify the precise impact such factors its estimates the liability due the company 
standardized and consistent processes for handling claims and the long history and depth company specific 
data the company methodologies have produced reliably determinable estimates ultimate paid losses
