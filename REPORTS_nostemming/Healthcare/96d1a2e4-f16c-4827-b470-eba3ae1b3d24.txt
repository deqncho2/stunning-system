industry challenges and our opportunity 
barriers and inefficiencies the current healthcare system present market participants with three major challenges 
consumers lack sufficient access high quality cost effective healthcare appropriate sites care while bearing 
increasing share costs employers and health plans lack effective solution that reduces costs while enhancing healthcare 
access for beneficiaries and iii providers lack flexibility increase productivity delivering care their own terms market 
participants are therefore increasingly unable effectively and efficiently receive deliver administer healthcare the same 
time the emergence technology platforms solving massive structural challenges other industries has highlighted the need for 
similar solution healthcare believe there significant opportunity solve these challenges through trusted solution 
such ours that matches consumer demand and physician supply real time while offering health plans and employers 
attractive cost effective healthcare alternative for their beneficiaries 
growing healthcare access crisis for consumers 
consumers the united states are experiencing challenges obtaining access affordable high quality healthcare 
appropriate sites care study from ihs markit prepared for the association american medical colleges found that 
physician demand continues grow faster than supply resulting projected total physician shortfall 
physicians including shortage approximately primary care physicians believe provider supply 
projected further contract evidenced the survey america physicians where physicians describe 
themselves either over extended full capacity according merritt hawkins study the average lead time see 
primary care physician across various metro areas was days given expected population growth and aging the united states 
the supply and demand gap for access healthcare services expected further widen placing additional pressure 
already overburdened healthcare system that lacks physician capacity and diagnoses appropriate access points 
this access crisis has resulted consumers either seeking care inappropriate more costly settings such 
hospital emergency rooms foregoing needed care entirely survey from the american college emergency 
physicians found that almost physicians polled stated that demands for care coordination including emergency department 
visits are increasing due increased difficulty finding arranging timely follow with primary care physicians and 
specialists the same survey physicians polled also noted that they believe their emergency department not 
adequately prepared for potentially substantial increases patient volume 
healthcare cost burden and lack viable options for health plans and employers 
the healthcare system burdened significant waste and extreme variations access cost and quality care 
recent study published the journal the american medical association estimates that approximately billion 
all healthcare spending was wasted due factors such the provision unnecessary services inefficient delivery 
care and inflated prices when consumers are forced seek care inappropriate and more costly sites care those cost 
inefficiencies impact not only the consumer but also the health plans and employers that ultimately bear all portion these 
costs 
the costs and associated burdens health plans employers and consumers are only expected increase centers for 
medicare and medicaid services cms forecasted national health expenditures reached trillion approximately 
the gdp and will reach approximately gdp survey from milliman noted that 
healthcare costs for average american family four exceeded and have tripled since survey 
the national business group health and towers watson indicated that employers bear average approximately 
two thirds their employees healthcare costs and cms forecasted employers spent approximately billion 
healthcare despite the significant amount dollars spent healthcare outcomes remain inferior relative those 
many other countries 
the unsustainable levels spending healthcare and extreme inefficiencies the system have driven increased 
focus employers and health plans control healthcare expenditures governments private insurance companies and 
self insured employers are implementing meaningful cost containment measures including shifting 
table contents 
financial responsibility patients through higher co pays and deductibles and delivering healthcare through alternative more 
cost effective methods the increasing shift financial responsibility patients coupled with increased pricing transparency 
has turn heightened beneficiary focus healthcare alternatives according survey for prudential insurance 
mrops inc and oxygen research inc employers are extremely very likely eventually offer only high deductible 
health plans consumers take responsibility for larger share their healthcare costs and spend more healthcare services 
they are also demanding higher quality care greater control how and where they receive care increased convenience and more 
service for every dollar spent 
challenging environment for physicians constraining supply 
physicians face declining compensation paired with diminishing productivity due combination reimbursement 
cuts and increasing administrative burden these factors have contributed physician dissatisfaction and negatively impacted 
their desire practice medicine medscape physician compensation report shows that all physicians not feel 
fairly compensated and would not choose medicine their career today 
response this growing dissatisfaction physicians are reducing access healthcare number different ways 
the survey america physicians indicated that physicians plan take steps limit access their practices 
including cutting back the number patients seen working part time closing their practices new members seeking 
non clinical jobs retiring notably surveyed physicians indicated they plan accelerate retirement given changes 
the healthcare environment study physicians for national health program showed medical billing paperwork and 
insurance related red tape cost the united states economy approximately billion which was wasted due 
inefficiency these constraints have driven physicians seek more control over the way they deliver care new and existing 
patients increase their income and reduce the amount time they spend administration 
physicians have responded these challenges shifting payment models and patient mix medscape physician 
compensation report showed increase from the percent physicians transitioning cash only models 
longer accepting insurance merritt hawkins study found that physicians the united states largest 
cities are not accepting new medicaid patients believe there significant opportunity for single source solution that 
addresses these physician needs 
opportunity remove barriers through innovative platform that benefits all participants 
believe have significant opportunity solve access cost and quality care challenges through platform that 
matches consumer demand and physician availability real time and various modalities such video web mobile and 
telephone while offering health plans and employers attractive cost effective alternative for their beneficiaries through our 
platform consumerism healthcare increases and consumers and providers become accustomed on demand services 
other industries they are similarly demanding technology powered solutions for their healthcare needs the emergence and

regulation the loss these affiliations could impair our ability provide services our members and could have material 
adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations addition the arrangement which have 
entered comply with state corporate practice medicine doctrines could subject additional scrutiny federal and state

the states which operate believe are compliance with all applicable regulations but due the 
uncertain regulatory environment certain states may determine that are violation their laws and regulations the event 
that must remedy such violations may required modify our services and products such states manner that

ebitda should not considered alternative net loss before taxes net loss loss per share any other performance 
measures derived accordance with gaap measures performance 
adjusted ebitda has important limitation analytical tool and you should not consider isolation 
substitute for analysis our results reported under gaap some these limitations are 
adjusted ebitda 
does not reflect the significant interest expense our debt and 
does not reflect the significant non cash stock compensation expense which should viewed component 
recurring operating costs and 
does not reflect the significant non recurring charge associated with the amortization warrants and loss 
extinguishment debt and 
does not reflect the significant acquisition related costs related mergers and acquisitions and 
eliminates the impact income taxes our results operations and 
although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often 
have replaced the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any expenditures for such replacements 
and 
other companies our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than limiting the usefulness 
adjusted ebitda comparative measures 
compensate for these limitations using adjusted ebitda along with other comparative tools together with
