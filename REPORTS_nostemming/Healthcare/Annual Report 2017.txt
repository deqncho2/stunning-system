health care and health care industry 
health care expenditures continue consume increasing portion most economies the health care spending 
increased percent trillion growing percent the gross domestic product gdp the 
centers for medicare and medicaid services cms estimates annual health care spending will trillion 
percent gdp believe this trajectory unsustainable and that health care can play important role 
facilitating shift from high cost health care system that incents volume proactive system that incents health quality 
and efficiency 
for this change occur believe traditional fee for service ffs reimbursement models must continue shift valuebased approaches that are more aligned with quality outcomes and efficiency signal this shift occurred january 
when the department health human services laid out plan shift percent medicare payments 
value based payment models the end and tie percent the remaining traditional ffs payments quality 
measures 
the shift away from traditional ffs also evident growth lives covered under accountable care organizations acos 
acos are groups hospitals and providers that focus providing coordinated high quality care medicare medicaid 
commercially insured populations and then share savings created lowering the cost care according the leavitt 
partners publication projected growth accountable care organizations december lives covered under acos grew 
from approximately million more than million and are projected more than million 
another step towards value based model occurred with the passage the medicare access and chip reauthorization 
act macra which enacts significant reforms the payment programs under the medicare physician fee schedule and 
consolidated three current value based programs into one 
while each the different approaches aligning reimbursement with value has faced challenges implementation and 
will continue evolve believe the trend away from traditional ffs will continue believe this growth government 
and private models aligning payment with value quality and outcomes will drive major changes the way health care 
provided the next decade and expect much greater focus patient engagement wellness and prevention health 
care providers become accountable for proactively managing the health the populations they serve expect them 
need ongoing investment sophisticated information technology solutions that will enable them predict when intervention 
needed they can improve outcomes and lower the cost providing care 
the increasingly complex and more clinical outcomes based reimbursement environment also contributing heightened 
demand for revenue cycle solutions and services and desire for these solutions and services closely aligned with 
clinical solutions believe this trend positive for cerner because our cerner millennium revenue cycle solutions and 
services are integrated with our clinical solutions creating clinically driven revenue cycle solution that has had significant 
adoption recent years 
table contents 
over the past several years have also seen shift the marketplace towards preference for single platform 
across inpatient and ambulatory settings the number physicians employed hospitals has increased hospitals have 
acquired physician groups and health systems are recognizing the benefit having single patient record the hospital 
and the physician office are benefiting from this trend due our unified cerner millennium platform which spans multiple 
venues and ongoing enhancements have made our physician solutions 
while health care providers are showing preference for single platform across multiple venues there also increased 
push for interoperability across disparate systems address the reality that patient record will only have information 
from single health care system believe health information should shareable and accessible among primary care 
physicians specialists and hospital physicians 
result cerner has led been key participant nearly every major industry effort advance interoperability and 
system openness one example cerner role founding member the commonwell health alliance open notfor profit industry consortium that brought health care firms together for the purpose enabling safe nationwide 
interoperability the vision commonwell for patient able visit new doctor give their consent and within 
moments have his her lifetime record available from all the prior places she has visited 
commonwell members represent about percent the acute care market and about percent the ambulatory market 
commonwell membership also spans diverse range clinical care settings beyond acute and ambulatory including health 
market leaders imaging perinatal emergency department laboratory retail pharmacy oncology care management 
patient portal post acute care and state and federal government agencies commonwell and carequality another 
national interoperability framework announced agreement work together and leverage the respective strengths each 
organization create level interoperability playing field for all provider organizations that wish share clinical information 
using standards based queries this agreement expected create near universal connectivity that establishes baseline 
query capability for all providers regardless their ehr supplier

care expenditures growing faster than their economies which leading focus controlling costs while also improving 
quality care

our solution footprint with existing clients for example only about percent our cerner millennium ehr clients have 
implemented cerner revenue cycle solutions this penetration has been growing recent years and expect continue 
because the preference for having ehr and revenue cycle systems provided the same platform there also opportunity 
expand penetration other solutions such women health anesthesiology imaging clinical process optimization

critical accounting policies 
believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical understanding our historical and future performance 
these policies affect the reported amount revenue and other significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate revenue recognition software development and income taxes these 
accounting policies and our procedures related these accounting policies are described detail below and under specific 
areas within this addition note the notes consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion 
our accounting policies 
revenue recognition through 
recognized revenue within our multiple element arrangements including software and software related services using 
the residual method key factors our revenue recognition model were our assessments that implementation services are 
not essential the functionality our software can establish vendor specific objective evidence vsoe fair value 
for any undelivered elements and the length time takes for achieve the delivery and implementation milestones 
for our licensed software such implementation services were deemed essential the functionality our software 
the period time over which our licensed software revenue would recognized would have lengthened vsoe fair 
value could not established for both the implementation services and the support services the entire arrangement fee 
would have been recognized ratably over the period during which the implementation services were expected performed 
the support period whichever was longer beginning with delivery the software provided that all other revenue recognition 
criteria were met 
revenue recognition forward 
the first quarter will adopt accounting standards update asu revenue from contracts with 
customers topic asu amended will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance gaap 
table contents 
this new guidance will require significant amount judgments and estimates implementing its five step process 
followed determining the amount and timing revenue recognition and related disclosures refer note the notes 
consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our status adoption implementation 
software development costs 
costs incurred internally creating computer software solutions and enhancements those solutions are expensed until 
completion detailed program design which when determine that technological feasibility has been established 
thereafter all software development costs are capitalized until such time the software solutions and enhancements are 
available for general release and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported the lower amortized cost net 
realizable value 
net realizable value computed the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount 
estimated future costs completing and disposing that product because the development projected net future revenues 
related our software solutions used our net realizable value computation based estimates significant reduction 
our future revenues could impact the recovery our capitalized software development costs missed our estimates 
net future revenues the amount our capitalized software development costs would not impaired 
capitalized costs are amortized based current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum 
annual amortization equal the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life the software solution are 
amortizing capitalized costs over five years the five year period over which capitalized software development costs are 
amortized estimate based upon our forecast reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs historically use our 
software programs our clients has exceeded five years and capable being used decade more 
expect that major software information systems companies large information technology consulting service providers 
and systems integrators and others specializing the health care industry may offer competitive products services the 
pace change the hcit market rapid and there are frequent new product introductions product enhancements and 
evolving industry standards and requirements result the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable 
obsolete and could subject impairment 
income taxes 
make number assumptions and estimates determining the appropriate amount expense record for income 
taxes these assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdictions which operate well current tax 
regulations accruals are established for estimates tax effects for certain transactions business structures and future 
projected profitability our businesses based our interpretation existing facts and circumstances these assumptions

each element for the group software and software related elements revenue recognized under the guidance applicable 
software transactions 
since not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe fair value software licenses within our multiple 
element arrangements recognize revenue our software and software related elements using the residual method 
under the residual method license revenue recognized multiple element arrangement when vendor specific objective 
evidence fair value exists for all the undelivered elements the arrangement when software delivered installed and

generally are not deemed essential the functionality the software and thus not impact the timing the software 
license recognition however software license fees are tied implementation milestones then the portion the software 
license fee tied implementation milestones deferred until the related milestone accomplished and related fees become 
due and payable and non forfeitable implementation fees for which vsoe fair value can determined are recognized 
over the service period which may extend from nine months several years for multi phased projects 
remote hosting and managed services are marketed under long term arrangements generally over periods five 
years these services are typically provided clients that have acquired perpetual license for licensed software and have
