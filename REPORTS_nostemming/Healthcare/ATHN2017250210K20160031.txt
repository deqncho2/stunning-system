operate highly competitive industry and are not able compete effectively our business and operating results will harmed 
the provision third parties medical billing and practice management services medical practices has historically been dominated small service 
providers who offer highly individualized services and high degree specialized knowledge applicable many cases limited medical specialty 
limited set payers limited geographical area anticipate that the software statistical and database tools that are available such service providers 
will continue become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could adversely affected 
electronic health records ehr and practice management software for health systems and medical groups has historically been dominated large 
well financed and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused software solutions some these entities are now offering hosted services 
software service models under which software centrally administered and these vendors may also provide administrative and billing services the 
size financial strength and breadth offerings the larger entities are increasing result continued consolidation both the information technology 
and healthcare industries expect large integrated technology companies continue become more active our markets both through acquisition and 
internal investment costs fall and technology improves increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape favor competitors with 
greater scale than possess addition few smaller companies have started providing single instance internet based software using model similar 
ours the offerings these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage our services and impact our market share further while 
the market for patient engagement population health and care coordination services growing and not yet dominated small group vendors with 
significant resources our patient engagement population health and care coordination services face competition from wide variety market participants 
for example certain health systems have 
table contents 
developed their own patient portals population health and care coordination systems fail distinguish our patient engagement population health 
and care coordination offerings from the other options available healthcare providers the demand for and market share those offerings may decrease 
regard our epocrates branded services compete with other companies for users the types drug and clinical reference tools that offer and 
for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical managed care and market research clients compete within broad industry healthcare content providers 
for the attention healthcare professionals who can choose use mobile online print media reference clinical information companies providing 
clinical content include medscape division webmd llc and uptodate inc division wolters kluwer health competition from each these 
sources clinical reference content may lead loss our existing network members and reduction the rate which attract new members for our

business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians participate surveys variety formats well the recruitment arms market 
research companies that have assembled their own survey panels healthcare professionals the extent competing channels are available access 
healthcare professionals including physicians the value our interactive services our clients reduced 
some our current large competitors such allscripts healthcare solutions inc cerner corporation epic systems corporation mckesson corp 
and quality systems inc and its subsidiary nextgen healthcare information systems llc have greater name recognition longer operating histories and 
significantly greater resources than result our competitors may able respond more quickly and effectively than can new changing 
opportunities technologies standards client requirements expect face new competitors continue develop and offer services for the 
inpatient market addition current and potential competitors have established and may the future establish cooperative relationships with vendors 
complementary products technologies services increase the availability their products the marketplace current future competitors may 
consolidate improve the breadth their products directly competing with our integrated offerings accordingly new competitors alliances may emerge 
that have greater market share larger client bases more widely adopted proprietary technologies broader offerings greater marketing expertise greater 
financial resources and larger sales forces than have which could put competitive disadvantage further light these advantages even our 
services are more effective than the product service offerings our competitors current potential clients might select competitive products and services 
lieu purchasing our services increased competition likely result pricing pressures which could negatively impact our sales profitability 
market share face competition from new niche vendors who offer stand alone products and services and from existing enterprise vendors including 
those currently focused software solutions which have information systems place with clients our target markets these existing enterprise vendors 
may now the future offer promise products services with less functionality than our services but offer ease integration with existing systems 
and that leverage existing vendor relationships 
the market for cloud based services for healthcare information technology may not develop substantially further develop more slowly than 
expect harming the growth our business 
the market for cloud based services for healthcare information technology remains narrowly based and uncertain whether these services will 
achieve and sustain the high levels demand and market acceptance anticipate our success will depend substantial extent the willingness 
enterprises large and small increase their use cloud based services general and for their revenue clinical and patient cycles particular many 
enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may 
reluctant unwilling switch cloud based service furthermore some enterprises may reluctant unwilling use cloud based services because 
they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability among other things the technology delivery model associated with 
these services enterprises not perceive the benefits our services then the market for these services may not expand much develop quickly 
expect either which would significantly adversely affect our business financial condition operating results 
changes the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services cause our existing contracts terminate and negatively impact the 
process negotiating future contracts 
the healthcare industry evolves changes our member client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services result the termination 
existing contracts and make more difficult negotiate new contracts terms that are acceptable for example the current trend toward 
consolidation healthcare providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts terminate independent practices are merged into 
hospital systems such larger healthcare organizations may also have their own practice management services and health systems reducing demand for our 
services similarly client and vendor consolidation results fewer larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability 
table contents 
demand terms that are unfavorable these trends continue cannot assure you that will able continue maintain expand our client base 
negotiate contracts with acceptable terms maintain our current pricing structure and our revenues may decrease 
general reductions expenditures healthcare companies reductions such expenditures within market segments that serve could have 
similar impacts with regard our interactive services such reductions may result from among other things reduced governmental funding for healthcare 
decrease the number the market exclusivity available new drugs coming market government regulation private initiatives that affect the 
manner which healthcare providers interact with patients pharmaceutical companies payers other healthcare industry participants limitations 
advertising physicians required disclosure payments made them adverse changes business economic conditions affecting healthcare 
payers providers the pharmaceutical industry other healthcare companies that subscribe for our interactive services changes the design 
health plans any these changes could reduce the purchase our services such interactive services clients reducing our revenue and possibly 
requiring materially revise our offerings addition our interactive services clients expectations regarding pending potential industry 
developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect services the types provide 
not continue innovate and provide services that are useful clients and users may not remain competitive and our revenues and 
operating results could suffer 
the market for healthcare the the early stages structural change and rapidly evolving toward more value base care model our success 
depends our ability keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated client and user requirements and sustain market

table contents 
service relevance unless are able provide current relevant and reliable healthcare content drug and clinical reference tools formulary

brand reputation the reputation our epocrates brand dependent large part the medical community continued perception 
independent from our healthcare industry clients particularly pharmaceutical companies healthcare professionals believe that are too closely

competitive landscape the developers mobile operating systems and mobile devices with which our products and services are compatible 
fail remain competitive the marketplace and adopted into medical practice and practice workflow members will less inclined use 
our services the availability price performance and functionality competing products and services including mobile web based and 
traditional products and services offered competitors through online resources and searches may affect our retention rate and the rate which 
attract new members for our drug and clinical reference tools the availability download sites such the apple app storesm that offer 
numerous free low priced competing products one location has also reduced the demand for our paid subscription products expect the use 
such sites expand reducing the number paying members for our drug and clinical reference tools percentage total members 
addition the loss subscription revenue our inability attract retain members especially physician members with desired characteristics such 
specialty and prescribing habits who update their mobile devices through our servers with sufficient frequency may cause even more significant 
decline revenue from our interactive services our market research payer and pharmaceutical clients are attracted our large engaged member network 
for the delivery their clinical messages formularies and other sponsored content and without sufficient active members who meet desired criteria those 
clients may reduce their subscription for our interactive services and our revenue may decline 
even the number our members not materially reduced their participation our services may decrease which could impact our revenues have 
established limits the number and the mix sponsored and non sponsored messages delivered members order promote the quality members 
experience with our services insufficient number members update during given service period the demand for promotional clinical messaging 
sponsorship exceeds the available supply our healthcare clients could become dissatisfied with our service result may unable grow our 
interactive services revenue beyond the bounds have set changes such limits could cause our members dissatisfied with our services and the 
response our interactive services decrease furthermore our members generally become less responsive participating our services the value 
these interactive services will likely decline this could cause our revenue remain flat decline

government regulations and government other payer actions inaction reducing delaying reimbursement and 
table contents 
reduction client revenue resulting from increased competition other changes the marketplace for physician services 
the current economic situation may give rise several these factors for example patients who have lost health insurance coverage due 
unemployment who face increased deductibles imposed financially struggling employers insurers could reduce the number visits those patients 
make our clients patients without health insurance with reduced coverage may also default their payment obligations higher rate than patients 
with coverage added financial stress our clients could lead their acquisition bankruptcy which could cause the termination some our service 
relationships further despite the cost benefits that believe our services provide prospective clients may wish delay contract decisions due 
implementation costs reluctant make any material changes their established business methods the current economic climate with reduction 
tax revenue state and federal government healthcare programs including reimbursement programs such medicaid initiatives under the patient 
protection and affordable care act which refer the aca may reduced eliminated which could negatively impact the payments that our

also although currently estimate our expected client life for clients athenahealth branded services twelve years this only estimate and 
there can assurance that our clients will elect renew their contracts for this period time our clients typically purchase one year contracts that 
most cases may terminated days notice without cause the majority our clinical information subscriptions have terms one year and our

these factors may contribute fluctuations our quarterly operating results particularly during any period which our sales volume relatively low

the healthcare industry highly regulated and subject changing political legislative regulatory and other influences existing and new laws and 
regulations affecting the healthcare industry changes existing laws and regulations including the potential amendment repeal all parts the 
aca result the recent presidential election could create unexpected liabilities for cause incur additional costs and restrict our 
operations 
many healthcare laws are complex and their application specific services and relationships may not clear particular many existing healthcare 
laws and regulations when enacted did not anticipate the healthcare information and interactive services that provide and these laws and regulations 
may applied our services ways that not anticipate particularly develop and release new and more sophisticated products and services 
our failure accurately anticipate the application these laws and regulations our other failure comply with them could create liability for result 
adverse publicity and negatively affect our business some the risks face from healthcare regulation are described below 
false fraudulent claim laws there are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit submission false information the failure disclose 
information connection with submission and payment physician claims for reimbursement some cases these laws also prohibit abuse connection 
with such submission and payment any failure our services comply with these laws and regulations could result substantial liability including but

hipaa and other health privacy regulations there are numerous federal and state laws related patient privacy particular hipaa includes 
privacy standards that protect individual privacy limiting the uses and disclosures individually identifiable health information and implementing data 
security standards that require covered entities implement administrative physical and technological safeguards ensure the confidentiality integrity 
availability and security individually identifiable health information electronic form hipaa also specifies formats that must used certain 
electronic transactions such claims payment advice and eligibility inquiries because translate electronic transactions and from hipaa prescribed 
electronic formats and other forms are considered clearinghouse and such covered entity subject hipaa addition our clients are also

the ability our clients terminate the underlying support agreement breach material term the business associate agreement and are 
unable cure the breach 
the requirement return destroy all individually identifiable health information the end our support agreement and 
access the hhs our internal practices books and records validate that are safeguarding individually identifiable health information 
may not able adequately address the business risks created hipaa implementation furthermore are unable predict what changes 
hipaa other laws regulations might made the future how those changes could affect our business the costs compliance for example the 
provisions the hitech act and the regulations issued under including the omnibus rule promulgated january have provided clarification 
certain aspects both the privacy and security rules issued under hipaa expansion the disclosure requirements for breach the security rule and 
strengthening the civil and criminal penalties for failure comply with hipaa addition the office the national coordinator for health information 
technology which refer onchit coordinating the ongoing development standards enable interoperable health information technology 
infrastructure nationwide based the widespread adoption electronic health records the healthcare sector are unable predict what any impact 
the changes such standards will have our compliance costs our services 
addition some payers and clearinghouses with which conduct business interpret hipaa transaction requirements differently than where 
clearinghouses payers require conformity with their interpretations condition effecting transactions and their interpretations are less stringent 
than ours seek comply with their interpretations 
the hipaa transaction standards include proper use procedure and diagnosis codes since these codes are selected approved our clients and 
since not verify their propriety some our capability comply with the transaction standards dependent the proper conduct those clients 
among our services provide automated reminder services patients internet and telephone based access medical test results pager and email 
notification practices patient calls and patient call answering services any failure our clients provide accurate contact information for their 
patients physicians any breach our telecommunications systems could result disclosure individually identifiable health information 
addition the hipaa privacy and security rules and the hitech act requirements most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that 
protect against the disclosure confidential medical and other personally identifiable information and many states have adopted are considering further

revenue recognition 
all revenue other than initial implementation and 
provider adds revenue recognized when the 
service performed recognize revenue when 
there evidence arrangement the service has 
been provided the client the collection the fees 
reasonably assured and the amount fees 
paid the client fixed determinable derive 
the majority our revenue from business services 
associated with our integrated network enabled 
services and from subscriptions and sponsored 
clinical information and decision support services for 
our point care medical application our integrated 
services consist medical billing and practice 
management electronic health record ehr 
patient engagement order transmission and care 
coordination and population health management 
which are supported our network athenanet 
our clients typically purchase one year service 
contracts related our integrated network enabled 
services that renew automatically most cases our 
clients may terminate their agreements with days 
notice without cause typically retain the right 
terminate client agreements the same timeframe 
our clients are billed monthly arrears typically 
based upon percentage collections posted our 
network minimum fees flat fees per claim fees 
where applicable not recognize revenue for 
business services until these collections are posted 
the fees are not fixed determinable until such 
time invoices are generated within the first two 
weeks the subsequent month for most our 
clients amounts due are then deducted from predefined bank account one week after invoice receipt 
via auto debit transaction unbilled amounts that 
have been earned are accrued and recorded 
revenue and are included our accounts receivable
