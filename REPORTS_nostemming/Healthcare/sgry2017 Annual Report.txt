november the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published its opps final rule for the final rule 
provides for payment rate increase hospitals that not meet the reporting requirements the medicare hospital outpatient 
quality reporting program will subject additional payment rate decrease 
additionally result legislative changes related off campus hopds certain off campus hopds that began billing under the 
opps underwent certain changes after november are longer paid for most services under the opps instead these 
facilities are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs which typically results lower reimbursements services provided 
dedicated emergency department are still paid under the opps this change has not significantly affected reimbursement any our 
hopds but cannot assure you that our hopds will not impacted the future 
medicare reimbursement ascs 
payments under the medicare program ascs are also made based the opps however the payment received from the medicare 
program asc percentage the payment hopds reimbursement rates for ascs are updated annually based changes the

corporation also face competition from local hospitals physicians and other providers who may compete with the ownership and 
operation surgical facilities well the trend physicians choosing perform procedures office based setting rather than 
surgical facility 
seasonality

need laws states with certificate need laws place limits the construction and acquisition healthcare facilities and the expansion 
existing facilities and services these states approvals generally known certificates need are required for capital expenditures exceeding 
certain preset monetary thresholds for the development acquisition and expansion certain facilities services including certain 
these states surgical facilities currently operate states that have certificate need laws 
our healthcare facilities also are subject state licensing requirements for medical providers our ascs have licenses operate the 
states which they operate and must meet all applicable requirements for ascs addition even though our surgical facilities that are 
licensed hospitals primarily provide surgical services they must meet all applicable requirements for general hospital licensure assure

comply with these regulations could result the suspension revocation facility license addition based the specific operations 
our surgical facilities some these facilities maintain pharmacy license controlled substance registration clinical laboratory 
certification waiver and environmental protection permits for biohazards and radioactive materials required applicable law 
december the majority our facilities were accredited either the joint commission the accreditation association 
for ambulatory health care two the major national organizations that establish standards relating the physical plant administration 
quality patient care and operation medical staffs various types healthcare facilities the effect accreditation these organizations 
exempt the facilities from routine surveys state agencies determine compliance with medicare conditions these accredited facilities 
are subject periodic surveys the accrediting organization ensure that they are compliance with the applicable standards many 
commercial health plans require our facilities accredited order participating providers failure maintain accreditation would 
cause facility become subject state survey agency oversight and potentially subject increased scrutiny cms and could result

december efforts repeal and replace the affordable care act full have not been successful however result the enactment 
the tax and jobs act the called individual mandate which requires most individuals obtain qualifying health insurance 
coverage pay tax penalty was repealed effective calendar year the repeal the individual mandate and any other future repeal 
replacement the affordable care act may have significant impact the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may cause 
more individuals become uninsured rendering them unable afford healthcare services offered the company accordingly there can

because physician investors our surgical facilities are position generate referrals the facilities the distribution available 
cash those investors could come under scrutiny under the anti kickback statute some courts have held that the anti kickback statute 
violated one purpose opposed primary the sole purpose payment provider induce referrals further section 
the affordable care act amends the anti kickback statute adding provision clarify that person need not have actual knowledge 
such section specific intent commit violation the anti kickback statute because none these cases involved joint venture 
such those owning and operating our surgical facilities not clear how court would apply these holdings our activities clear 
however that physician investment income from surgical facility may not vary with the number his her referrals the surgical 
facility 
under regulations issued the office the inspector general the department health and human services the oig 
certain categories activities are deemed not violate the anti kickback statute commonly referred the safe harbors according 
the preamble these safe harbor regulations the failure particular business arrangement comply with the regulations does not determine 
whether the arrangement violates the anti kickback statute the safe harbor regulations not make conduct illegal but instead outline 
standards that complied with protect conduct that might otherwise deemed violation the anti kickback statute when transaction 
relationship does not fit within safe harbor does not mean that anti kickback statute violation has occurred rather means that 
the facts and circumstances well the intent the parties related specific transaction relationship must examined determine 
whether not any illegal conduct has occurred 
believe the ownership and operations our surgery centers and hospitals not fit wholly within any the safe harbors but 
attempt structure our ascs fit closely possible within the safe harbor designed protect distributions physician investors 
ascs who directly refer patients the asc and personally perform the procedures the center extension their practice the asc 
safe harbor the asc safe harbor protects four categories investors including ascs owned general surgeons single specialty 
physicians multi specialty physicians and hospital physician joint ventures provided that certain requirements are satisfied these 
requirements include the following 
the asc must certified participate the medicare program and its operating and recovery room space must dedicated 
exclusively the center and not part hospital although such space may leased from hospital such lease meets 
the requirements the safe harbor for space rental 
each investor must either physician who derived least one third his her medical practice income for the previous 
fiscal year month period from performing procedures the list medicare covered procedures for ascs hospital 
person entity not position make influence referrals the center nor provide items services the 
center nor employed the center any investor 
unless all physician investors are members single specialty each physician investor must perform least one third his 
her procedures the asc each year this requirement addition the requirement that the physician investor has derived 
least one third his her medical practice income for the past year from performing procedures 
physician investors must have fully informed their referred patients the physician investment 
the terms which investment interest offered investor are not related the previous expected volume referrals 
services furnished the amount business otherwise generated from that investor the entity 
neither the asc nor any other investor nor any person acting their behalf may loan funds guarantee loan for 
investor the investor uses any part such loan obtain the investment interest 
the amount payment investor return for the investment interest directly proportional the amount the capital 
investment including the fair market value any pre operational services rendered that investor 
all physician investors any hospital investor and the center agree treat patients receiving benefits assistance under 
federal healthcare program non discriminatory manner 
all ancillary services performed the asc for beneficiaries federal healthcare programs must directly and integrally 
related primary procedures performed the center and may not billed separately 
hospital investor may include its cost report any claim for payment from federal healthcare program any costs 
associated with the asc 
the asc may not use equipment owned services provided hospital investor unless such equipment leased 
accordance with lease that complies with the anti kickback statute equipment rental safe harbor and such services are 
provided accordance with contract that complies with the anti kickback statute personal services and management contract 
safe harbor 
hospital investor may position make influence referrals directly indirectly any other investor the center 
believe that the ownership and operations our surgical centers will not fully satisfy the asc safe harbor requirements for investment 
interests ascs because among other things one our subsidiaries will generally investor and provide management services 
each asc while believe our ascs would nonetheless found compliant with the anti kickback statute cannot assure you 
that the oig would view our activities favorably even though strive achieve compliance with the remaining elements this safe harbor 
addition although expect each physician investor utilize the ascs extension his her practice and ask each physicianinvestor certify this practice cannot assure you that all physician investors will derive least one third their medical practice income 
from performing medicare covered asc procedures perform one third their procedures the centers inform their referred patients 
their investment interests interests our asc joint ventures are purchased what believe fair market value investors who purchase 
later time generally pay more for given percentage interest than founding investors the result that while all investors are paid 
distributions accordance with their ownership interests for ascs where there are later purchases cannot meet the safe harbor requirement 
that return investment directly proportional the amount capital investment the oig has several occasions reviewed investments 
relating ascs and advisory opinion raised concerns that purchases interests from physicians might yield gains 
investment rather than capital infusion the ascs such purchases could meant reward influence the selling physicians referrals 
the asc the hospital and such returns might not directly proportional the amount capital invested 
oig advisory opinion july the oig concluded that arrangement involving asc joint venture between 
hospital and physicians involving the combination their two ascs into single larger asc presented minimal risk fraud abuse despite 
the fact that did not fit within any applicable anti kickback safe harbors additionally the oig stated that fair market value should 
determined based only the tangible assets each asc since the physician investors are referral sources for the asc the oig stated that 
cash flow based valuation the business contributed the physician investors potentially would include the value the physician investors 
referrals over the time that their asc was existence prior the merger with the hospital asc the oig went note that valuation 
involving intangible assets would not necessarily result violation the anti kickback statute but would require review all the facts 
and circumstances not clear whether the oig concerned about using cash flow based valuation most healthcare transactions 
involving referral sources just transactions where the parties contributions would valued differently for contributing the same assets 
only one party contribution valued going concern based cash flow also the oig appears focused historical cash flow 
rather than projected discounted cash flow which commonly used valuation methodology 
our hospital investments not fit wholly within the safe harbor for investments small entities because more than the 
investment interests are held investors who are either position refer the hospital who provide services the hospital and more 
than the hospital gross revenue last year were derived from referrals generated investors however believe comply with 
the remaining elements the safe harbor 
addition the physician ownership our surgical facilities other financial relationships ours with potential referral sources could 
potentially scrutinized under the anti kickback statute have entered into management agreements manage the majority our 
surgical facilities and physician practices most these agreements call for our subsidiary paid percentage based management fee 
although there safe harbor for personal services and management contracts the personal services and management safe harbor the 
personal services and management safe harbor requires among other things that the amount the aggregate compensation paid the 
manager over the term the agreement set advance because our management fees are generally based percentage revenue our 
management agreements not typically meet this requirement however believe that our management arrangements satisfy the other 
requirements the personal services and management safe harbor for personal services and management contracts the oig has taken the 
position several advisory opinions that percentage based management agreements are not protected safe harbor and consequently 
may violate the anti kickback statute have implemented formal compliance programs designed safeguard against overbilling and 
believe that our management agreements comply with the requirements the anti kickback statute however cannot assure you that the 
oig would find our compliance programs adequate that our management agreements would found comply with the anti kickback 
statute 
certain our ascs have entered into arrangements for professional services including arrangements for anesthesia services special 
advisory bulletin issued april the oig focused questionable contractual arrangements where health care provider one line 
business the owner expands into related health care business contracting with existing provider related item service the 
manager supplier provide the new item service the owner existing patient population including federal health care program 
patients called suspect contractual joint ventures the manager supplier not only manages the new line business but may also 
supply with inventory employees space billing and other services other words the owner contracts out substantially the entire operation 
the related line business the manager supplier otherwise potential competitor receiving return the profits the business 
remuneration for its referrals through advisory opinion the oig extended this suspect contractual joint venture analysis arrangements 
between anesthesiologists and physician owners ascs advisory opinion the oig concluded that certain proposed arrangements 
between anesthesia groups and physician owned ascs could result prohibited remuneration under the federal anti kickback statute 
believe our arrangements for anesthesia services are distinguishable from those described advisory opinion may and are 
compliance with the requirements the federal anti kickback statute however cannot assure you that regulatory authorities would 
agree with that position 
also may guarantee surgical facility third party debt financing and certain lease obligations part our obligations under 
management agreement physician investors are generally not required enter into similar guarantees the oig might take the position that 
the failure the physician investors enter into similar guarantees represents special benefit the physician investors given induce 
patient referrals and that such failure constitutes violation the anti kickback statute believe that the management fees and some 
cases guarantee fees are adequate compensation for the credit risk associated with the guarantees and that the failure the physician 
investors enter into similar guarantees does not create material risk violating the anti kickback statute however the oig has not 
issued any guidance this regard 
the oig authorized issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability the anti kickback statute including 
whether activity constitutes grounds for the imposition civil criminal sanctions have not however sought such opinion regarding 
any our arrangements were determined that our activities those our surgical facilities hospitals violate the anti kickback 
statute our subsidiaries our officers our directors and each surgical facility and hospital investor could subject individually 
substantial monetary liability prison sentences and exclusion from participation any healthcare program funded whole part 
the government including medicare medicaid tricare state healthcare programs 
evolving interpretations current the adoption new federal state laws regulations could affect many our arrangements 
law enforcement authorities including the oig the courts and congress are increasing their scrutiny arrangements between healthcare 
providers and potential referral sources ensure that the arrangements are not designed mechanism exchange remuneration for patient 
care referrals opportunities investigators have also demonstrated willingness look behind the formalities business transaction 
determine the underlying purposes payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
federal physician self referral law 
the federal physician self referral law stark law prohibits certain self referrals for healthcare services the stark law prohibits 
practitioner including physician dentist podiatrist from referring patients entity with which the practitioner member his 
her immediate family has financial relationship for the provision certain designated health services that are paid for whole 
part medicare medicaid unless exception applies designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
clinical laboratory services and radiology services the term financial relationship broadly defined and includes most types ownership 
and compensation relationships the stark law also prohibits the entity from seeking payment from medicare medicaid for services that 
are rendered through prohibited referral entity paid for services provided through prohibited referral may required refund 
the payments violations the stark law may also result the imposition damages equal three times the amount improperly claimed 
and civil monetary penalties per prohibited claim and per prohibited circumvention scheme and exclusion from 
participation the medicare and medicaid programs 
notably designated health services does not include surgical services that are provided asc furthermore stark law regulations 
specifically define the term designated health services not include services that are reimbursed medicare part composite rate 
such services that are provided asc however designated health services are provided asc and separately billed referrals 
the asc physician investor would prohibited the stark law because our facilities that are licensed ascs not have 
independent laboratories and not provide designated health services apart from surgical services not believe referrals these facilities 
physician investors are prohibited legislation regulations are implemented that prohibit physicians from referring patients surgical 
facilities which the physician has beneficial interest our business and financial results would materially adversely affected 
the stark law currently includes the whole hospital exception which applies physician ownership hospital provided such 
ownership the whole hospital and the physician authorized perform services the hospital believe that physician investments 
our facilities licensed hospitals meet this requirement however certain changes the whole hospital exception were made the 
affordable care act including 
prohibition hospitals from having any physician ownership unless the hospital already had physician ownership and 
medicare provider agreement effect december 
limitation the percentage total physician ownership investment interests the hospital entity whose assets include 
the hospital the percentage physician ownership investment march 
prohibition from expanding the number beds operating rooms and procedure rooms for which licensed after march 
unless the hospital obtains exception from the secretary 
requirement that return investment proportionate the investment each investor 
restrictions preferential treatment physician versus non physician investors 
requirement for written disclosures physician ownership interests the hospital patients and the hospital website 
and any advertising along with annual reports the government detailing such interests 
prohibition the hospital other investors from providing financing physician investors 
requirement that any hospital that does not have physician coverage inform patients this fact and receive signed 
acknowledgments from the patients the disclosure and 
prohibition grandfathered status for any physician owned hospital that converted from asc hospital after 
march 
cannot predict whether other proposed amendments the whole hospital exception will included any future legislation 
including repeal the affordable care act congress will adopt any similar provisions that would prohibit otherwise restrict physicians 
from holding ownership interests hospitals any such changes could have adverse effect our financial condition and results operations 
cms issued self referral disclosure protocol for hospitals and other providers that wish self disclose potential violations 
the stark law cms and attempt resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities levels below the 
maximum penalties and amounts set forth the statute 
addition the physician ownership our surgical facilities have other financial relationships with potential referral sources that 
potentially could scrutinized under the stark law have entered into personal service agreements such medical director agreements 
with physicians our hospitals and physician owners within our physician practices may make referrals for certain designated health services 
within their physician practices believe that our agreements with referral sources satisfy the requirements the personal service 
arrangements exception and that our physician practices satisfy the physician services and office ancillary services exceptions the stark 
law and have implemented formal compliance programs designed ensure continued compliance however cannot assure you that the 
oig cms would find our compliance programs adequate that our agreements with referral sources would found comply with 
the stark law 
other fraud and abuse laws 
the medicare patient and program protection act amended the health insurance portability and accountability act 
hipaa and the balanced budget act impose civil monetary penalties and exclusion from state and federal healthcare 
programs providers who commit violations fraud and abuse laws hipaa authorizes the secretary the department health human 
services secretary and some cases requires the secretary exclude individuals and entities that the secretary determines have

the hitech act strengthened the requirements and significantly increased the penalties for violations the hipaa privacy and 
security regulations january hhs issued the hipaa omnibus rule which became effective march the hipaa 
omnibus rule requires notify patients any unauthorized access acquisition disclosure their unsecured protected health information 
all situations except those which can demonstrate that there low probability that the protected health information has been

hipaa privacy and security regulations the new data breach law that affects the privacy their state residents expect vigorous

hipaa administrative simplification requirements 
the hipaa transaction regulations were issued encourage electronic commerce the healthcare industry these regulations include 
standards that healthcare providers must follow when electronically transmitting certain healthcare transactions such healthcare claims 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
our hospitals are subject the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala this federal law requires any hospital 
that participates the medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every person who presents the 
hospital emergency department for treatment and the patient suffering from emergency medical condition either stabilize that 
condition make appropriate transfer the patient facility that can handle the condition the obligation screen and stabilize 
emergency medical conditions transfer exists regardless patient ability pay for treatment off campus facilities such surgery 
centers that lack emergency departments otherwise not treat emergency medical conditions generally are not subject emtala they 
must however have policies place that explain how the location should proceed emergency situation such transferring the patient 
the closest hospital with emergency department there are severe penalties under emtala hospital fails screen appropriately 
stabilize transfer patient the hospital delays appropriate treatment order first inquire about the patient ability pay including 
civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation the government health care programs addition injured patient the patient 
family medical facility that suffers financial loss direct result another hospital violation the law can bring civil suit against 
that other hospital cms has actively enforced emtala and has indicated that will continue the future believe that our 
hospitals comply with emtala 
state regulation 
many the states which our surgical facilities operate have adopted statutes and regulations that prohibit the payment kickbacks 
any type remuneration exchange for patient referrals and that prohibit healthcare providers from certain circumstances referring 
patient healthcare facility which the provider has ownership investment interest while these statutes generally mirror the federal 
anti kickback statute and stark law they vary widely their scope and application some are specifically limited healthcare services 
that are paid for whole part the medicaid program others apply all healthcare services regardless payor and others apply only 
state defined designated services which may differ from the designated health services under the stark law addition many states have 
adopted statutes that mirror the false claims act and that prohibit the filing false fraudulent claim with state governmental agency 
intend comply with all applicable state healthcare laws rules and regulations however these laws rules and regulations have typically 
been the subject limited judicial and regulatory interpretation result cannot assure you that our surgical facilities will not 
investigated scrutinized the governmental authorities empowered challenged that their activities would found 
lawful determination non compliance with the applicable state healthcare laws rules and regulations could subject our surgical facilities 
civil and criminal penalties and could have material adverse effect our operations 
are also subject various state insurance statutes and regulations that prohibit from submitting inaccurate incorrect misleading 
claims many state insurance laws and regulations are broadly worded and could implicated for example our surgical facilities were 
adjust out network payment other patient responsibility amounts without fully disclosing the adjustment the claim submitted 
the payor while some our surgical facilities adjust the out network costs patient payment and deductible amounts reflect innetwork payment costs when providing services patients whose health insurance covered payor with which the surgical facilities 
are not contracted our policy fully disclose adjustments the claims submitted the payors believe that our surgical facilities are 
compliance with all applicable state insurance laws and regulations regarding the submission claims cannot assure you however 
that none our surgical facilities insurance claims will ever challenged were found violation state insurance laws 
regulations could forced discontinue the violative practice which could have adverse effect our financial position and results 
operations and could subject fines and criminal penalties 
fee splitting corporate practice medicine 
the laws many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non physicians sharing percentage professional fees 
prohibit non physician entities such from practicing medicine and exercising control over employing physicians and prohibit referrals 
facilities which physicians have financial interest the existence interpretation and enforcement these laws vary significantly from 
state state light these restrictions certain states facilitate the provision physician services maintaining long term management 
services agreements through our subsidiaries with affiliated professional contractors which employ contract with physicians and other 
healthcare professionals provide physician professional services under these arrangements our subsidiaries perform only non medical 
administrative services not represent that they offer medical services and not exercise influence control over the practice medicine 
the physicians employed the affiliated professional contractors although believe that the fees receive from affiliated professional 
contractors have been structured manner that compliant with applicable fee splitting laws possible that government regulator 
could interpret such fee arrangements violation certain fee splitting laws future interpretations changes these laws might 
require structural and organizational modifications our existing relationships and cannot assure you that would able appropriately 
modify such relationships addition statutes some states could restrict our expansion into those states 
clinical laboratory regulation 
our clinical laboratories are subject federal oversight under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia 
which extends federal oversight virtually all clinical laboratories requiring that they certified the federal government 
federally approved accreditation agency clia requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance quality control and personnel 
standards laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject inspections standards for testing under clia are based 
the complexity the tests performed the laboratory with tests classified high complexity moderate complexity waived 
laboratories performing high complexity testing are required meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories 
laboratories performing only waived tests which are tests determined the food and drug administration have low potential for error 
and requiring little oversight may apply for certificate waiver exempting them from most the requirements clia our operations 
also subject state and local laboratory regulation clia provides that state may adopt laboratory regulations different from more stringent 
than those under federal law and number states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements state laws may require 
that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications specify certain quality controls require maintenance certain records believe 
that are material compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements but assurances can given that our laboratories will pass 
all future licensure certification inspections 
regulatory compliance program 
have place and continue enhance company wide compliance program that focuses all areas regulatory compliance 
including billing reimbursement cost reporting practices and contractual arrangements with referral sources 
this regulatory compliance program intended help ensure that high standards conduct are maintained the operation our 
business and that policies and procedures are implemented that employees act compliance with applicable laws regulations and company 
policies under the regulatory compliance program every employee and certain contractors involved patient care and coding and billing

payments from private third party payors including state workers compensation programs and managed care organizations represented 
approximately and our patient service revenue for the years ended december and respectively most 
these payments came from third party payors with which our facilities have contracts managed care companies such hmos and ppos 
which offer prepaid and discounted medical service packages represent growing segment private third party payors fail enter 
into favorable contracts maintain satisfactory relationships with managed care organizations our revenue may decrease our competitive 
position has been and will continue affected initiatives undertaken during the past several years major purchasers healthcare 
services including insurance companies and employers revise payment methods and monitor healthcare expenditures effort contain 
healthcare costs for instance managed care payors may lower reimbursement rates response increased obligations payors imposed 
the affordable care act future reductions medicare reimbursement rates further managed care payors may narrow their provider 
networks response the need negotiate lower reimbursement rates with providers are unable maintain strong relationships with 
payors may not able ensure participation these narrow provider networks cost containment measures such fixed fee schedules 
capitation payment arrangements reductions reimbursement schedules third party payors and closed provider networks could also cause 
reduction our revenue the future 
some our payments from third party payors come from third party payors with which our surgical facilities physicians subsidiaries 
that provide diagnostic services not have contract those cases where provide services patient that does not use third party 
payor with which have contracted commonly known out network services generally charge the patients the same payment 
other patient responsibility amounts that would have charged had our surgical facilities had contract with the payor accordance 
with insurance laws and regulations submit claim for the services the payor along with full disclosure that our surgical facility has 
charged the patient network patient responsibility amount historically those third party payors who not have contracts with our 
surgical facilities typically have paid our claims higher than comparable contracted rates however over the past five years have observed 
increase third party payors adopting out network fee schedules that are more comparable our contracted rates take other steps 
discourage their enrollees from seeking treatment out network surgical facilities are not always successful securing contracts 
with payors the proportion our services subject out network fee schedules increases may experience decrease volume 
our ascs due fewer referrals out network patients 
payments from workers compensation payors represented approximately our patient service revenue for the fiscal year ended 
december majority states have implemented workers compensation provider fee schedules some cases the fee schedule 
rates contain lower rates than the rates our surgical facilities have historically been paid for the same services states reduce the amounts 
paid providers under the workers compensation fee schedules could have adverse impact our operating results 
significant changes our payor mix surgical case mix resulting from fluctuations the types cases performed our facilities 
could have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
our results may change from period period due fluctuations payor mix surgical case mix other factors relating the type 
cases performed physicians our facilities payor mix refers the relative share total cases provided patients with insurance 
commercial insurance medicare coverage medicaid coverage and workers compensation insurance respectively since generally speaking 
receive relatively higher payment rates from commercial and workers compensation insurers than medicare medicaid and other 
government funded programs significant shift our payor mix toward higher percentage medicare and medicaid cases which could 
occur for reasons beyond our control could have adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
surgical case mix refers the relative share total cases performed specialty such general surgery ophthalmology orthopedic

results operations and financial condition 
operate multiple markets each with different competitive landscape shifts within our payor mix surgical case mix may 
not uniform across all our affiliated facilities rather these shifts may concentrated within certain markets due local competitive

depend physician utilization our surgical facilities which could decrease fail maintain good relationships with affiliated 
physicians our ability provide medical services our facilities would impaired and our revenue reduced are not able 
maintain these relationships 
our business depends among other things upon the efforts and success affiliated physicians who provide medical services our 
surgical facilities and the strength our relationships with these physicians most physicians are not employees our surgical facilities and 
are not contractually required use our facilities generally not enter into contracts with physicians who use our surgical facilities

factors and market conditions physicians may able negotiate relatively higher levels equity ownership our facilities consequently 
limiting reducing our share the profits from these facilities addition physician ownership our facilities subject certain regulatory

acquisition candidates the limited number surgical facilities develop typically incur losses their early months operation more 
the case surgical hospitals and until their case loads grow they generally experience lower total revenue and operating margins than 
established surgical facilities and expect this trend continue 
are not successful integrating newly acquired surgical facilities may not realize the potential benefits such acquisitions 
likewise are not able integrate acquired facilities operations and personnel with ours timely and efficient manner then the

face competition for patients physicians and commercial payor contracts 
the healthcare business highly competitive and each the individual geographic areas which operate has different competitive 
landscape each our markets compete with other healthcare providers for patients and contracting with commercial payors 
addition because the number physicians available utilize and invest our facilities finite face intense competition from other 
surgery centers hospitals health systems and other healthcare providers recruiting physicians utilize and invest our facilities are 
competition with other surgery centers hospitals and healthcare systems the communities serve attract patients and provide them 
with the care they need 
there are also unaffiliated hospitals each market which operate these hospitals have established relationships with physicians 
and payors addition other companies either currently are the same similar business developing acquiring and operating surgical 
facilities may decide enter our business many these companies have greater resources than including financial marketing 
staff and capital resources also may compete with some these companies for entry into strategic relationships with healthcare systems 
and healthcare professionals addition many physician groups develop surgical facilities without corporate partner recent years more 
physicians are choosing perform procedures including pain management and gastrointestinal procedures office based setting rather 
than surgical facility are unable compete effectively with any these entities groups may unable implement our 
business strategies successfully and our financial position and results operations could adversely affected 
competition for physicians and nurses shortages qualified personnel other factors could increase our labor costs and adversely

our labor costs increase may not able raise rates offset these increased costs because significant percentage our revenue 
consists fixed prospective payments our ability pass along increased labor costs limited particular labor costs rise annual 
rate greater than our net annual consumer price index basket update from medicare our results operations and cash flows will likely 
adversely affected any union activity our facilities that may occur the future could contribute increased labor costs certain proposed

some jurisdictions preclude from entering into non compete agreements with our physicians and other non compete agreements 
and restrictive covenants applicable certain physicians and other clinical employees may not enforceable 
have contracts with physicians and other health professionals many states some our physician services contracts well 
many our physician services contracts with hospitals include provisions preventing these physicians and other health professionals from 
competing with both during and after the term our contract with them the law governing non compete agreements and other forms 
restrictive covenants varies from state state some jurisdictions prohibit from entering into non compete agreements with our professional 
staff other states are reluctant strictly enforce non compete agreements and restrictive covenants against physicians and other healthcare 
professionals therefore there can assurance that our non compete agreements related employed otherwise contracted physicians 
and other health professionals will enforceable challenged certain states such event would unable prevent former employed 
otherwise contracted physicians and other health professionals from competing with potentially resulting the loss some our 
hospital contracts and other business additionally certain facilities have the right employ engage our providers after the termination 
expiration our contract with those facilities and cause not enforce our non compete provisions related those providers 
may become involved litigation which could negatively impact the value our business 
from time time are involved lawsuits claims audits and investigations including those arising out services provided personal 
injury claims professional liability claims billing and marketing practices employment disputes and contractual claims may become 
subject future lawsuits claims audits and investigations that could result substantial costs and divert our attention and resources and 
adversely affect our business condition addition since our current growth strategy includes acquisitions among other things may 
become exposed legal claims for the activities acquired business prior the acquisition these lawsuits claims audits investigations 
regardless their merit outcome may also adversely affect our reputation and ability expand our business 
addition from time time have received and expect continue receive correspondence from former employees terminated 
who threaten bring claims against alleging that have violated one more labor and employment regulations certain instances 
former employees have brought claims against and expect that will encounter similar actions against the future adverse 
outcome any such litigation could require pay contractual damages compensatory damages punitive damages attorneys fees and 
costs 
become subject large malpractice other legal claims could required pay significant damages which may not 
covered insurance 
recent years physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject increasing number legal actions alleging 
malpractice product liability related legal theories many these actions involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
also owe certain defense and indemnity obligations our officers and directors 
maintain liability insurance amounts that believe are customary for the industry maintain general liability insurance that 
provides coverage occurrence basis million per occurrence with retention per occurrence and million annual 
aggregate coverage per surgical facility also maintain business interruption insurance and property damage insurance well 
additional umbrella liability insurance policy the aggregate amount million coverage under certain these policies contingent 
upon the policy being effect when claim made regardless when the events which caused the claim occurred addition physicians 
who provide professional services our surgical facilities are required maintain separate malpractice coverage with similar minimum 
coverage limits also maintain directors and officers insurance policy which insures our directors and officers against unindemnified 
losses arising from certain wrongful acts their capacities directors and officers and reimburses for those losses for which have 
lawfully indemnified the directors and officers 
this insurance coverage may not cover all claims against insurance coverage may not continue available cost allowing 
maintain adequate levels insurance one more successful claims against were not covered exceeded the coverage our

addition our costs insurance and claims increase then our earnings could decline market rates for insurance premiums and 
deductibles have been steadily increasing our earnings and cash flows could materially and adversely affected any the following

increases the number liability claims against the cost settling trying cases related those claims 
inability obtain one more types insurance acceptable terms all 
financial pressures patients and current and future economic condition may adversely affect our volume and surgical case mix 
even the economy shows signs sustained modest growth many individuals throughout the country continue experience 
difficult financial conditions our case volume and surgical case mix may adversely affected patients unwillingness pay for procedures 
our facilities higher numbers unemployed individuals generally translates into more individuals without healthcare insurance help 
pay for procedures thereby increasing the potential for persons elect not have procedures performed even procedures normally thought 
non elective may delayed may not performed the patient cannot afford the procedure due lack insurance money 
pay their portion our facilities fee although have taken steps minimize the impact these conditions difficult predict the 
degree which our business will continue impacted such conditions the course the economy the future 
addition the difficult conditions the economy have adversely affected and could continue adversely affect the budgets 
individual states and the federal government which has resulted and could continue result attempts reduce payments made 
federal and state government healthcare programs including medicare military services medicaid and workers compensation programs 
reduction the scope services covered those programs and increase taxes and assessments our activities additionally there 
continues uncertainty regarding the affordable care act and any such result could adversely affect our business exacerbating the 
financial pressures patients leading them further delay cancel non emergency surgical procedures 
our surgical facilities are sensitive regulatory economic and other conditions the states where they are located addition three 
our surgical facilities account for significant portion our patient service revenue

all our facilities are deemed certified meaning that they are accredited properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations 
and certified under the medicare program are the process applying for such accreditation licensing certification the effect 
maintaining certified facilities allow such facilities participate the medicare and medicaid programs believe that all our 
facilities are material compliance with applicable federal state local and other relevant accreditation and certification regulations and 
standards however should any our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the medicare 
medicaid programs such facilities would unable receive reimbursement from either both those programs and possibly from

laws governing the corporate practice medicine fee splitting change may required restructure some our relationships 
which may result significant loss revenue and divert other resources

revenue and profitability 
for the years ended december and derived approximately and our revenue respectively 
from government payors including medicare and medicaid programs the medicare and medicaid programs are subject statutory and 
regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements funding levels and 
the method calculating payments reimbursements among other things requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding 
restrictions any which could materially increase decrease payments from these government programs the future well affect the 
timing payments our facilities 
are unable predict the effect future government healthcare funding policy changes our operations the rates paid 
governmental payors are reduced the scope services covered governmental payors limited any our surgical facilities 
are excluded from participation the medicare medicaid other government sponsored healthcare programs there could material 
adverse effect our business financial condition results operations cash flows 
during the past several years healthcare payors such federal and state governments insurance companies and employers have 
undertaken initiatives revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare costs part their efforts contain healthcare costs payors 
increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures the assumption healthcare providers all portion the financial risk relating 
paying for care provided often exchange for exclusive preferred participation their benefit plans expect efforts impose greater 
discounts and more stringent cost controls government and other payors continue thereby reducing the payments receive for our 
services 
way example under the medicare program physician payments were previously updated annual basis according statutory 
formula because application the statutory formula for the update factor would result decrease total physician payments congress 
would intervene with interim legislation annual basis prevent the reductions april however macra was signed into law 
which repealed and replaced the statutory formula for medicare payment adjustments physicians macra provides permanent end 
the annual interim legislative updates that had previously been necessary delay prevent significant reductions payments under the 
mpfs macra extended previous payment rates through june with update for each calendar year through addition 
macra requires the establishment mips beginning under which physicians may receive performance based payment incentives 
payment reductions based their performance with respect clinical quality resource use clinical improvement activities and meaningful 
use electronic health records for more information the implementation macra see business sources revenue ancillary

our surgical facilities not satisfy the requirements for any the safe harbors under the federal anti kickback statute federal 
state agency asserts different position enacts new laws this regard could subject criminal and civil penalties loss 
licenses and exclusion from governmental programs which may result substantial loss revenue 
the anti kickback statute prohibits the offer payment solicitation receipt any form remuneration return for referrals for items 
services payable medicare medicaid any other federally funded healthcare program additionally the anti kickback statute prohibits 
any form remuneration return for purchasing leasing ordering arranging for recommending the purchasing leasing ordering 
items services payable medicare medicaid any other federally funded healthcare program the anti kickback statute very broad 
scope and many its provisions have not been uniformly definitively interpreted existing case law regulations moreover several 
federal courts have held that the anti kickback statute can violated only one purpose not necessarily the primary purpose transaction 
induce reward referral business notwithstanding other legitimate purposes addition person entity does not need have 
actual knowledge the statute specific intent violate order have committed violation moreover the government may assert 
that claim including items services resulting from violation the federal anti kickback statute constitutes false fraudulent claim 
for purposes the false claims act discussed below violations the anti kickback statute may result substantial civil criminal 
penalties including five years imprisonment and criminal fines and civil penalties for each violation 
plus three times the remuneration involved the amount claimed and exclusion from participation all federally funded healthcare programs 
our exclusion from participation such programs would have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and 
financial condition addition many the states which operate have also adopted laws similar the anti kickback statute that 
prohibit payments physicians exchange for referrals some which apply regardless the source payment for care these statutes 
typically impose criminal and civil penalties including the loss license business the state 
july hhs issued final regulations defining various safe harbors under the anti kickback statute business arrangements that 
meet the requirements the safe harbors are not treated criminal violations under the anti kickback statute business arrangements that 
not meet the safe harbor requirements not necessarily violate the anti kickback statute but may subject scrutiny the federal 
government determine compliance two the original safe harbors issued apply business arrangements similar those used 
connection with our surgical facilities the investment interest safe harbor and the personal services and management contracts safe 
harbor however the structure the partnerships and limited liability companies operating our surgery centers and surgical hospitals well 
our various business arrangements involving physician group practices not satisfy all the requirements either safe harbor have 
entered into management agreements manage the majority our surgical facilities most these agreements call for our subsidiary 
paid percentage based management fee because our management fees are generally based percentage revenue our management 
agreements not typically meet the personal services and management contracts safe harbor have implemented formal compliance 
programs designed safeguard against overbilling and believe that our management agreements comply with the requirements the antikickback statute however cannot assure you that the oig would find our compliance programs adequate that our management 
agreements would found comply with the anti kickback statute 
hhs promulgated final regulations creating additional safe harbor provisions including safe harbor that applies 
physician ownership investment interests surgery centers the surgery center safe harbor protects four types investment arrangements 
surgeon owned surgery centers single specialty surgery centers multi specialty surgery centers and hospital physician surgery 
centers each category has its own requirements with regard what type physician may investor the surgery center addition 
the physician investor the categories permit unrelated investor who person entity that not position provide items 
services related the surgery center its investors our business arrangements with our surgical facilities typically consist one our 
subsidiaries being investor each partnership limited liability company that owns the facility addition providing management and 
other services the facility therefore our business arrangements with our surgery centers surgical hospitals and physician groups not 
qualify for the expanded safe harbor protection from government review prosecution under the anti kickback statute however believe 
that are compliance with the requirements the anti kickback statute 
employ dedicated marketing personnel whose job functions include the recruitment physicians perform surgery our facilities 
these employees are paid base salary plus productivity bonus believe our employment arrangements with these employees are consistent 
with safe harbor provision designed protect payments made employees however government agency private party may assert 
contrary position 
also enter into lease agreements with physicians from time time for the rental space for our surgical facilities seek structure 
these lease agreements that they are compliance with the anti kickback statute safe harbor provision regarding real estate leases however 
government agency private party may assert contrary position 
any our business arrangements with physicians sales and marketing personnel were alleged deemed violate the anti kickback 
statute similar laws new federal state laws were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal could have material adverse 
effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
addition the physician ownership our surgical facilities other financial relationships ours with potential referral sources 
could potentially scrutinized under the anti kickback statute 
certain our ascs have entered into arrangements for professional services including arrangements for anesthesia services special 
advisory bulletin issued april the oig focused questionable contractual arrangements where health care provider one line 
business the owner expands into related health care business contracting with existing provider related item service the 
manager supplier provide the new item service the owner existing patient population including federal health care program 
patients called suspect contractual joint ventures the manager supplier not only manages the new line business but may also 
supply with inventory employees space billing and other services other words the owner contracts out substantially the entire operation 
the related line business the manager supplier otherwise potential competitor receiving return the profits the business 
remuneration for its referrals through advisory opinion the oig extended this suspect contractual joint venture analysis arrangements 
between anesthesiologists and physician owners ascs advisory opinion the oig concluded that certain proposed arrangements 
between anesthesia groups and physician owned ascs could result prohibited remuneration under the federal anti kickback statute 
believe our arrangements for anesthesia services are distinguishable from those described advisory opinion may and are 
compliance with the requirements the federal anti kickback statute however cannot assure you that regulatory authorities would 
agree with that position 
fail comply with physician self referral laws they are currently interpreted may interpreted the future other 
legislative restrictions are issued could incur substantial monetary penalties and significant loss revenue 
the federal physician self referral law commonly referred the stark law prohibits physician from making medicare medicaid 
reimbursed referral for designated health service entity the physician member the physician immediate family has 
financial relationship with the entity unless exception applies the list designated health services under the stark law does not 
generally include ambulatory surgery services but does include inpatient and outpatient hospital service and services such clinical 
laboratory services and certain imaging services that may provided and separately billed asc other facility under the current 
stark law and related regulations services provided asc are not covered the statute even those services include imaging laboratory 
services other stark designated health services provided that the asc does not bill for these services separately the center 
permitted bill separately for these services they are specifically exempted from stark law prohibitions these are generally radiology and 
other imaging services integral performance surgical procedures that meet certain requirements and certain outpatient prescription drugs 
services provided our facilities licensed hospitals are covered the stark law attempt structure our relationship with physicians 
who refer our hospitals meet exception the stark law where required but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed 
and complex and cannot guarantee that every relationship complies fully with the stark law also believe that certain services provided 
our managed physician network are covered the stark law but referrals for those services are exempt from the stark law under its inoffice ancillary services exception among others our diagnostic laboratory also subject the stark law but believe that have 
structured our agreements with physicians not violate the stark law and related regulations 
the stark law and similar state statutes are subject different interpretations with respect many important provisions violations 
these self referral laws may result substantial civil criminal penalties including treble damages for amounts improperly claimed civil 
monetary penalties per prohibited service billed per prohibited circumvention scheme and exclusion from 
participation the medicare and medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs violations the stark law will also create liability 
under the federal false claims act exclusion our ascs hospitals from these programs through judicial agency interpretation 
existing laws additional legislative restrictions physician ownership investments healthcare entities could result significant 
loss reimbursement revenue cannot provide assurances that cms will not undertake other rulemaking address additional revisions 
interpretations the stark law regulations future rules modify the provisions the stark law regulations that are applicable our 
business our revenue and profitability could materially adversely affected and could require modify our relationships with our physician 
and healthcare system partners 
federal law restricts the ability our surgical hospitals expand surgical capacity 
the stark law includes exception that permits physicians refer medicare and medicaid patients hospitals which they have 
ownership interest certain requirements are met however the affordable care act dramatically curtailed this exception and prohibits 
physician ownership hospitals that did not have medicare provider agreement december result the law effectively 
prevents the formation new physician owned hospitals that participate medicare and medicaid after december each our 
surgical hospitals had medicare provider agreement place prior december and therefore able continue operating with 
the ownership structure that was place prior december however the affordable care act prohibits grandfathered hospitals 
from increasing their percentage physician ownership and limits certain extent their ability grow because prohibits such hospitals 
from increasing the aggregate number inpatient beds operating rooms and procedure rooms 
companies within the healthcare industry continue the subject federal and state audits and investigations and may 
subject such audits and investigations including actions for false and other improper claims 
federal and state government agencies well commercial payors have increased their auditing and administrative civil and criminal 
enforcement efforts part numerous ongoing investigations healthcare organizations these audits and investigations relate wide 
variety topics including the following cost reporting and billing practices quality care financial reporting financial relationships with 
referral sources and medical necessity services provided addition the oig and the department justice doj have from time 
time undertaken national enforcement initiatives that focus specific billing practices other suspected areas abuse its work 
plan the oig stated its intention review the safety and quality care for medicare beneficiaries having surgeries and procedures ascs 
and hospital outpatient departments 
the federal government may impose criminal civil and administrative penalties any person entity that files false claim for payment 
from the medicare medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs claims filed with private insurers can also lead 
criminal and civil penalties including but not limited penalties relating violations federal mail and wire fraud statutes well 
penalties under the anti fraud provisions the hipaa while the criminal statutes are generally reserved for instances fraudulent intent 
the federal government applying its criminal civil and administrative penalty statutes ever expanding range circumstances including 
claiming payment for unnecessary services the claimant merely should have known the services were unnecessary and claiming payment 
for low quality services the claimant should have known that the care was substandard addition violation the stark law the antikickback statute can result liability under the federal false claims act fca 
over the past several years the federal government has investigated increasing number healthcare providers for potential fca 
violations which among other things prohibits person from knowingly presenting causing presented false fraudulent claim 
the federal government the statute defines knowingly include not only actual knowledge claim falsity but also reckless disregard 
for intentional ignorance the truth falsity claim violators the fca are subject severe financial penalties including treble 
damages and per claim penalties excess because our facilities perform hundreds thousands similar procedures each year 
for which they are paid medicare and since the statute limitations for such claims extends for six years under normal circumstances 
and possibly long ten years the event failure discover material facts repetitive billing error cost reporting error could result 
significant material repayments and civil criminal penalties 
moreover another trend impacting healthcare providers the increased use the fca particularly individuals who bring actions 
under that law under the qui tam whistleblower provisions the fca private parties may bring actions behalf the federal 
government the government intervenes and prevails the action the defendant may required pay three times the actual damages 
sustained the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties between and for each false claim submitted the 
government these private parties often referred relators are entitled share any amounts recovered the government through trial 
settlement these qui tam cases are sealed the court the time filing the only parties privy the information contained the 
complaint are the relator the federal government and the presiding court possible that qui tam lawsuits have been filed against and 
that are unaware such filings both direct enforcement activity the government and whistleblower lawsuits under the fca have 
increased significantly recent years thus the risk that will have defend false claims action pay significant fines excluded 
from the medicare and medicaid programs has increased for example october the company received civil investigative 
demand cid from the federal government under the false claims act fca for documents and information dating back january 
relating the medical necessity certain drug tests conducted the company physicians and submitted laboratories owned and 
operated the company the company intends respond the cid and cooperate with the attorney office connection with the 
fca investigation 
addition the fraud enforcement and recovery act fera further expanded the scope the fca create liability for 
knowingly and improperly avoiding decreasing obligation pay money the federal government and fera along with statutory 
provisions found the acts created federal false claims act liability for the knowing failure report and return overpayment within 
days the identification the overpayment certain cases the date which corresponding cost report due whichever later 
governmental authorities may challenge scrutinize our operations may the subject whistleblower lawsuit any time 
determination that have violated these laws could have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and 
financial condition 
hipaa also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing attempting 
execute scheme defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payors knowingly and willfully embezzling 
stealing from healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing criminal investigation healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully 
falsifying concealing covering material fact making any materially false fictitious fraudulent statement connection with the 
delivery payment for healthcare benefits items services similar the federal anti kickback statute person entity does not need 
have actual knowledge the statute specific intent violate order have committed violation 
addition person who offers transfers medicare medicaid beneficiary any remuneration including waivers payments 
and deductible amounts any part thereof that the person knows should know likely influence the beneficiary selection 
particular provider practitioner supplier medicare medicaid payable items services may liable for civil monetary penalties 
for each wrongful act moreover certain cases providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for medicare and 
medicaid beneficiaries can also held liable under the anti kickback statute and civil false claims act which can impose additional 
penalties associated with the wrongful act although this prohibition applies only federal healthcare program beneficiaries the routine 
waivers copayments and deductibles offered patients covered commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related among 
other things unlawful schemes defraud excessive fees for services tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory common 
law fraud the extent our patient assistance programs other discount policies are found inconsistent with applicable laws may 
required restructure discontinue such programs subject other significant penalties 
enforce compliance with the federal laws the doj has recently increased its scrutiny interactions between health care companies 
and health care providers which has led number investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements the health care industry 
dealing with investigations can time and resource consuming and can divert management attention from the business addition 
settlements with the doj other law enforcement agencies have forced healthcare providers agree additional compliance and reporting 
requirements part consent decree corporate integrity agreement any such investigation settlement could increase our costs 
otherwise have adverse effect our business 
are also subject various state laws and regulations well contractual provisions with commercial payors that prohibit from 
submitting inaccurate incorrect misleading claims cannot sure that none our surgical facilities claims will ever challenged 
were found violation state laws regulations commercial payor contract could forced discontinue the 
violative practice and subject recoupment actions fines and criminal penalties which could have material adverse effect our business 
prospects results operations and financial condition 
all payors are increasingly conducting post payment audits for example cms has implemented the rac program involving medicare 
claims audits nationwide under the program cms contracts with racs contingency fee basis conduct post payment reviews detect 
and correct improper payments the fee for service medicare program the affordable care act expanded the rac program scope 
include managed medicare plans and include medicaid claims addition cms employs mics perform post payment audits medicaid 
claims and identify overpayments the affordable care act increases federal funding for the mic program addition racs and mics 
the state medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities are regularly subject these external audits and 
also perform both internal and third party audits and monitoring 
although all other repayments requested date result rac mic and zpic audits have not been material our company 
are unable quantify the suspended payments and aggregate financial impact these audits our facilities given the pending appeals and 
uncertainty about the extent future audits and whether the underlying conduct could considered systemic such the resolution these 
audits could have material adverse effect our business prospects results operations and financial condition 
failure comply with medicare conditions for coverage and conditions participation may result loss program payment 
other governmental sanctions 
participate and receive payment from the medicare program our facilities must comply with regulations promulgated cms 
these regulations known conditions for coverage for ascs and conditions participation for hospitals set forth specific requirements 
with respect among other things the facility physical plant equipment personnel and standards medical care all our surgery centers 
and surgical hospitals are certified participate the medicare program such these facilities are subject site unannounced surveys 
state survey agencies working behalf cms under the asc survey process the surveyors are becoming more familiar with expanded 
interpretive guidance and the updated asc conditions for coverage which may lead increased number deficiency citations requiring 
remedy with appropriate action plans failure comply with medicare conditions for coverage conditions participation may result 
loss payment other governmental sanctions including termination from participation the medicare program have established 
ongoing quality assurance activities monitor our facilities compliance with these conditions and respond surveys but cannot sure 
that our facilities are will always remain full compliance with the requirements addition pending determination regarding our 
compliance with these conditions payment may suspended and may required devote significant time effort and expense 
demonstrate satisfactory compliance 
our facilities could face decreased medicare payments they fail report and meet various quality metrics 
the medicare program presently requires hospitals and ascs report performance data variety quality metrics facilities that 
fail report are penalized with reduced medicare payments additionally payments hospitals are adjusted based the hospital 
performance these quality measures substantial portion hospital payment risk depending its individual performance relative 
benchmarks and other hospitals performance there substantial risk that our medicare payments could reduced our hospitals fail 
perform adequately these measures additionally there risk that medicare payments could reduced our facilities hospitals and 
ascs fail adequate report data required cms asc payments are not yet adjusted based performance against quality measures 
but there substantial risk that congress may soon link asc medicare payments actual performance addition reporting 
the public performance data becomes primary factor determining where patients choose receive care and competing hospitals 
and ascs have better results than our facilities those measures our patient volumes could decline 
our use and disclosure personally identifiable information including health information subject federal and state privacy 
and security regulations and our failure comply with those regulations adequately secure the information hold could result 
significant liability reputational harm 
hipaa well numerous other federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use privacy security 
confidentiality integrity and availability personally identifiable information pii including protected health information phi hipaa 
applies national privacy and security standards for phi covered entities such hipaa requires covered entities maintain policies 
and procedures governing phi that used disclosed and implement administrative physical and technical safeguards protect phi

security breach loss protected health information other data subject privacy laws material disruption our operational systems 
could result material adverse impact our business along with potentially substantial fines and penalties ongoing implementation and

hipaa also requires our surgical facilities use standard transaction code sets and identifiers for certain standardized healthcare 
transactions including billing and other claim transactions have undertaken significant efforts involving substantial time and expense 
implement these requirements and anticipate that continual time and expense will required submit standardized transactions and 
ensure that any newly acquired facilities can submit hipaa compliant transactions 
hipaa requires covered entities report breaches unsecured protected health information affected individuals without unreasonable

the hitech act authorized state attorneys general bring civil actions seeking either injunction damages response violations 
hipaa privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy state residents 
hipaa also authorizes state attorneys general bring civil actions seeking either injunction damages response violations 
hipaa privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy state residents while hipaa does not create private right action 
allowing individuals sue civil court for violations hipaa requirements its standards have been used basis for the duty

where these state laws are more protective than hipaa have comply with their stricter provisions only some these state laws impose 
fines and penalties upon violators but some may afford private rights action individuals who believe their pii has been misused california 
patient privacy laws for example provide for penalties and permit injured parties sue for damages both state and federal

state privacy related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa these statutes vary and could impose 
additional requirements and more severe penalties for disclosures confidential health information new health information standards

financial resources and operational experience the potential new owners existing healthcare facilities many the states which 
currently operate certificates need must obtained for capital expenditures exceeding prescribed amount changes capacity services 
offered and various other matters the remaining states which now may the future operate may adopt similar legislation our costs 
obtaining certificate need could significant and cannot assure you that will able obtain the certificates need other

contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are adequate the actual write offs are significantly different from our estimates could have 
material adverse effect our financial condition and results operations because most cases have the ability verify patient
