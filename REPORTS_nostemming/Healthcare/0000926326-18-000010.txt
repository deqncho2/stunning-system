the delivery healthcare the united states still relies significant number manual and paper based processes most hospitals have 
deployed least some automation solutions but few have deployed them throughout the entire institution system the use manual and paper based 
systems many hospital departments today results highly complex and inefficient processes for tracking and delivering medications and supplies 
patients addition many existing healthcare information systems are unable support the modernization healthcare delivery processes address 
mandated patient safety initiatives these factors contribute medical errors and unnecessary process costs across the healthcare sector 
healthcare providers and facilities are affected significant economic pressures rising costs labor prescription drugs and new medical 
technology all contribute increased spending governmental pressures surrounding healthcare reform have led increased scrutiny the cost and 
efficiency with which healthcare providers deliver their services these factors combined with continuing consolidation the healthcare industry have 
increased the need for the efficient delivery healthcare order control costs 
our automation and analytics products are sold worldwide wide variety healthcare institutions but most our sales are acute care 
hospital customers the united states the acute care hospital market comprised approximately hospitals and other facilities with total 
capacity more than million acute care beds currently serve over hospitals and other facilities with total capacity more than acute 
care beds our customers include single location community hospitals government hospitals and regional and national hospital systems

supply chain 
the fda updated its guidance that requires linear bar codes most prescription drugs drug manufacturers packagers labelers 
and private label distributors are subject the rule the fda estimated that the bar code rule would result reduction medication 
errors fewer adverse drug events over the subsequent years billion cost savings and other economic benefits

the competitive challenges face the medication management and supply chain solutions market include but are not limited the following 
certain competitors may offer have the ability offer broader range solutions the marketplace that are unable match 
certain competitors may develop alternative solutions the customer problems our products are designed solve that may provide better 
customer outcome lower cost operation 
certain competitors may develop new features capabilities for their products not previously offered that could compete directly with our 
products 
competitive pressures could result increased price competition for our products and services fewer customer orders and reduced gross 
margins any which could harm our business 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions establish cooperative relationships among themselves with third parties 
including larger more established healthcare supply companies such the acquisition carefusion corporation becton dickenson 
corporation and the acquisition talyst systems llc swisslog healthcare thereby increasing their ability develop and offer broader 
suite products and services address the needs our prospective customers 
our competitive environment currently experiencing significant degree consolidation which could lead competitors developing new 
business models that require adapt how market sell distribute our products 
other established emerging companies may enter the medication management and supply chain solutions market with products and services 
that are preferred our current and potential customers based factors such features capabilities cost 
our competitors may develop license incorporate new emerging technologies devote greater resources the development promotion 
and sale their products and services than 
certain competitors have greater brand name recognition and more extensive installed base medication and supply dispensing systems 
other products and services than and such advantages could used increase their market share 
certain competitors may have existing business relationships with our current and potential customers which may cause these customers 
purchase medication and supply dispensing systems automation solutions from these competitors and 
our competitors may secure products and services from suppliers more favorable terms secure exclusive arrangements with suppliers 
buyers that may impede the sales our products and services 
any reduction the demand for adoption our medication and supply systems related services consumables would reduce our revenues 
table contents 
our medication and supply dispensing systems represent only one approach managing the distribution pharmaceuticals and supplies acute 
healthcare facilities and our medication packaging systems represent only one way managing medication distribution non acute care facilities while 
significant portion domestic acute care facilities have adopted some level medication and supply automation significant portion domestic and 
international healthcare facilities still use traditional approaches some form that not include fully automated methods medication and supply 
management result must continuously educate existing and prospective customers about the advantages our products which requires significant 
sales efforts particularly when are seeking replace incumbent supplier medication and supply automation solutions and can cause longer sales 
cycles despite our significant efforts and extensive time commitments sales healthcare facilities cannot assured that our efforts will result sales 
these customers 
addition our medication and supply dispensing systems and our more complex automated packaging systems typically represent sizable initial 
capital expenditure for healthcare organizations changes the budgets these organizations and the timing spending under these budgets can have 
significant effect the demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services these budgets are often supported cash flows that 
can negatively affected declining investment income and influenced limited resources increased operational and financing costs macroeconomic 
conditions such unemployment rates and conflicting spending priorities among different departments any decrease expenditures healthcare 
facilities increased financing costs could decrease demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services and reduce our revenues 
changing customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products and services and our new product solutions may not achieve market 
acceptance 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market characterized evolving technologies and industry standards frequent new 
product introductions and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete less competitive the medication management and 
supply chain solutions market could erode rapidly due unforeseen changes the features and functions competing products well the pricing 
models for such products our future success will depend part upon our ability enhance our existing products and services and develop and introduce 
new products and services meet changing customer requirements the process developing products and services such those offer extremely 
complex and expected become increasingly more complex and expensive the future new technologies are introduced are unable enhance 
our existing products develop new products meet changing customer requirements and bring such enhancements and products market timely 
manner demand for our products could decrease 
cannot provide assurance that will successful marketing any new products services that introduce that new products services 
will compete effectively with similar products services sold our competitors that the level market acceptance such products services will 
sufficient generate expected revenues and synergies with our other products services for example recently announced our new automated 
central pharmacy system and ivx workflow solutions and cannot guarantee that demand will meet our expectations addition our series 
and vbm automated pharmacy solutions for multi medication blister card packaging are relatively new the market deployment new products 
services often requires interoperability with other omnicell products services well with healthcare facilities existing information management 
systems these products services fail satisfy these demanding technological objectives our customers may dissatisfied and may unable 
generate future sales 
the healthcare industry faces changes healthcare legislation and other healthcare reform well financial constraints and consolidation which 
could adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
the healthcare industry has faced and will likely continue face significant financial constraints government legislation such the 
american recovery and reinvestment act the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca the budget control act 
and other health reform legislation the repeal all portion any such legislation may cause customers postpone purchases our products due 
reductions federal healthcare program reimbursement rates and needed changes their operations order meet the requirements legislation our 
automation solutions often involve significant financial commitment from our customers and result our ability grow our business largely 
dependent our customers capital and operating budgets the extent legislation promotes spending other initiatives healthcare providers 
spending declines increases more slowly than anticipate demand for our products and services could decline 
for example some the provisions the ppaca have yet implemented and there have been judicial and congressional challenges 
certain aspects the ppaca well recent efforts the trump administration repeal replace certain aspects the ppaca since january 
president trump has signed two executive orders designed delay the implementation certain provisions the ppaca otherwise circumvent some 
the requirements for health insurance mandated the ppaca concurrently congress has considered legislation that would repeal repeal and replace all 
part 
table contents 
the ppaca while congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation two bills affecting the implementation certain taxes under the ppaca 
have been enacted the tax cuts and jobs act includes provision repealing effective january the tax based shared responsibility payment 
imposed the ppaca certain individuals who fail maintain qualifying health coverage for all part year that commonly referred the 
individual mandate additionally january president trump signed continuing resolution appropriations for fiscal year that delayed 
the implementation certain fees mandated under the ppaca including the called cadillac tax certain high cost employer sponsored insurance 
plans the annual fee imposed certain health insurance providers based market share and the medical device excise tax non exempt medical 
devices congress may consider other legislation repeal replace other elements the ppaca thus the full impact the ppaca any law replacing 
elements our business remains unclear the implementation cost containment measures other healthcare reforms may have effect our 
revenue profitability 
addition healthcare providers have consolidated create larger healthcare delivery organizations order achieve greater market power this 
consolidation continues would increase the size certain target customers which could increase the cost effort and difficulty selling our products 
such target customers could cause our existing customers potential new customers begin utilizing our competitors products such customers are 
acquired healthcare providers that prefer our competitors products ours addition the resulting organizations could have greater bargaining power 
which may lead price erosion 
when experience delays installations our medication and supply dispensing systems our more complex medication packaging systems 
resulting delays our ability recognize revenue our competitive position results operations and financial condition could harmed 
the purchase our medication and supply dispensing systems our more complex medication packaging systems often part customer 
larger initiative engineer its pharmacy and their distribution and materials management systems result our sales cycles are often lengthy the 
purchase our systems often entails larger strategic purchases customers that frequently require more complex and stringent contractual requirements and 
generally involve significant commitment management attention and resources prospective customers these larger and more complex transactions 
often require the input and approval many decision makers including pharmacy directors materials managers nurse managers financial managers 
information systems managers administrators lawyers and boards directors addition new product announcements such that our series can 
cause delay our customers decision purchase our products convert orders from our older products those our newer products such the 
series for these and other reasons the sales cycle associated with the sale our medication and supply dispensing systems often lengthy and subject 
number delays over which have little control delay loss sales our medication and supply dispensing systems could have adverse 
effect upon our operating results and could harm our business 
addition and part result the complexities inherent larger transactions the time between the purchase and installation our systems 
can range from two weeks one year delays installation can occur for reasons that are often outside our control have also experienced fluctuations 
our customer and transaction size mix which makes our ability forecast our product bookings more difficult because recognize revenue for our 
medication and supply dispensing systems and our more complex medication packaging systems only upon installation customer site any delay 
installation our customers will also cause delay the recognition the revenue for that system 
demand for our consumable medication packages time sensitive and are not able supply the demand from our institutional and retail pharmacy

distribution and administration process institutional and retail pharmacies have alternative methods distributing medications including bulk and 
alternative packaging and medication adherence packaging may supplied our competitors the extent that are unable supply quality 
packaging our customers timely manner that demand will met via alternative distribution methods including consumable medication packaging 
sold our competitors and our revenue will decline any disruption the production capabilities our petersburg facilities will adversely affect our
