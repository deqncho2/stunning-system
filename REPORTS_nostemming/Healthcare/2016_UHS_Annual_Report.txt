required repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services although believe our policies 
procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations assurance can given that will not subjected additional 
governmental inquiries actions that would not faced with sanctions fines penalties subjected even were 
ultimately prevail significant governmental inquiry action under one the above laws regulations rules could have material 
adverse impact 
licensing certification and accreditation all our hospitals are subject compliance with various federal state and 
local statutes and regulations the and receive periodic inspection state licensing agencies review standards medical 
care equipment and cleanliness our hospitals must also comply with the conditions participation and licensing requirements

obtain necessary state approval can result our inability complete acquisition expansion replacement the imposition civil 
some cases criminal sanctions the inability receive medicare medicaid reimbursement the revocation facility 
license which could harm our business addition significant con reforms have been proposed number states that would 
increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions various services from review requirements the past have 
not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but cannot predict the impact these changes upon our 
operations 
conversion legislation many states have enacted are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion sale not forprofit hospitals for profit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general advance notification and 
community involvement addition attorneys general states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary 
authority over these transactions although the level government involvement varies from state state the trend provide for 
increased governmental review and some cases approval transaction which not for profit entity sells health care facility 
for profit entity the adoption new expanded conversion legislation and the increased review not for profit hospital 
conversions may limit our ability grow through acquisitions not for profit hospitals 
utilization review federal regulations require that admissions and utilization facilities medicare and medicaid patients

various administrative appeal rights the federal government contracts with third party recovery audit contractors racs and 
medicaid integrity contractors mics contingent fee basis audit the propriety payments medicare and medicaid 
providers the recovery audit prepayment review demonstration program will enable racs review claims before they are paid 
ensure that the provider complied with all medicare payment rules currently the demonstration program targeting states with high 
populations fraud and error prone providers similarly medicare zone program integrity contractors zpics target claims for 
potential fraud and abuse additionally medicare administrative contractors macs must ensure they pay the right amount for 
covered and correctly coded services rendered eligible beneficiaries legitimate providers the centers for medicare and 
medicaid services cms announced its intent consolidate many these medicare and medicaid program integrity functions 
into new unified program integrity contractors upics though remains unclear what effect any this proposed consolidation 
may have have undergone claims audits related our receipt federal healthcare payments during the last three years the 
results which have not required material adjustments our consolidated results operations however potential liability from 
future federal state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves and any excess could potentially substantial further 
medicare and medicaid regulations also provide for withholding medicare and medicaid overpayments certain circumstances 
which could adversely affect our cash flow 
self referral and anti kickback legislation 
the stark law the social security act includes provision commonly known the stark law this law prohibits 
physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients entities with which they any their immediate family members have 
financial relationship unless exception met these types referrals are known self referrals sanctions for violating the 
stark law include civil penalties for each violation for sham arrangements for each day 
entity fails report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs there are number exceptions 
the self referral prohibition including exception for physician ownership interest entire hospital opposed 
ownership interest hospital department unit service subpart however federal laws and regulations now limit the ability 
hospitals relying this exception expand aggregate physician ownership interest expand certain hospital facilities this 
regulation also places number compliance requirements physician owned hospitals related reporting ownership interest 
there are also exceptions for many the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers including employment 
contracts leases and recruitment agreements that adhere certain enumerated requirements 
monitor all aspects our business and have developed comprehensive ethics and compliance program that designed 
meet exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards nonetheless because the law this area complex and 
constantly evolving there can assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any our arrangements with 
physicians violate the stark law 
anti kickback statute provision the social security act known the anti kickback statute prohibits healthcare 
providers and others from directly indirectly soliciting receiving offering paying money other remuneration other 
individuals and entities return for using referring ordering recommending arranging for such referrals orders services 
other items covered federal state health care program however changes the anti kickback statute have reduced the intent 
required for violation one longer required have actual knowledge specific intent commit violation of the antikickback statute order found violation such law 
the anti kickback statute contains certain exceptions and the office the inspector general the department health and 
human services oig has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors from the federal anti kickback statute for various 
activities these activities which must meet certain requirements include but are not limited the following investment interests 
space rental equipment rental practitioner recruitment personnel services and management contracts sale practice referral 
services warranties discounts employees group purchasing organizations waiver beneficiary coinsurance and deductible 
amounts managed care arrangements obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies investments group practices freestanding 
surgery centers donation technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services the fact that 
conduct business arrangement does not fall within safe harbor exception does not automatically render the conduct 
business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute however such conduct and business arrangements may lead increased 
scrutiny government enforcement authorities 
uhs annual report pdf 
although believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured comply with 
current law and available interpretations there can assurance that all arrangements comply with available safe harbor that 
regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements not violate the anti kickback statute other 
applicable laws violations the anti kickback statute may punished criminal fine for each violation 
imprisonment however under section this fine may increased for individuals and for 
organizations civil money penalties may include fines per violation and damages three times the total 
amount the remuneration and exclusion from participation medicare and medicaid 
similar state laws many the states which operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments physicians 
exchange for referrals similar the anti kickback statute and the stark law some which apply regardless the source payment 
for care these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties well loss licensure many instances the state statutes 
provide that any arrangement falling federal safe harbor will immune from scrutiny under the state statutes however most 
cases little precedent exists for the interpretation enforcement these state laws 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and many cases don have the benefit regulatory judicial 
interpretation possible that different interpretations enforcement these laws and regulations could subject our current past 
practices allegations impropriety illegality could require make changes our facilities equipment personnel 
services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses determination that have violated one more these laws 
the public announcement that are being investigated for possible violations one more these laws see item legal 
proceedings could have material adverse effect our business financial condition results operations and our business 
reputation could suffer significantly addition cannot predict whether other legislation regulations the federal state level 
will adopted what form such legislation regulations may take what their impact may 
are deemed have failed comply with the anti kickback statute the stark law other applicable laws and regulations 
could subjected liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss our licenses operate one 
more facilities and exclusion one more facilities from participation the medicare medicaid and other federal and state health 
care programs the imposition such penalties could have material adverse effect our business financial condition results

supreme court ruling limited the federal government ability expand health insurance coverage holding 
unconstitutional sections the legislation that sought withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain medicaid 
coverage requirements pursuant that decision the federal government may not penalize states that choose not participate the 
medicaid expansion program reducing their existing medicaid funding therefore states can choose accept not participate 
without risking the loss federal medicaid funding result many states including texas have not expanded their medicaid 
programs without the threat loss federal funding 
addition king burwell the supreme court decided favor the federal government ability subsidize premiums 
paid certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges number our 
hospitals operate states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges the supreme court decision this case ultimately preserved 
the viability federally facilitated exchanges different decision the supreme court could have resulted increased number 
uninsured patients generally including increase uninsured patients treated our hospitals located these states 
the various provisions the legislation that directly indirectly affect medicare and medicaid reimbursement are scheduled 
take effect over number years the impact the legislation healthcare providers will subject implementing 
regulations interpretive guidance and possible future legislation legal challenges certain legislation provisions such those 
creating the medicare shared savings program and the independent payment advisory board create uncertainty how healthcare 
may reimbursed federal programs the future thus cannot predict the impact the legislation our future 
reimbursement this time and can provide assurance that the legislation will not have material adverse effect our future 
results operations 
the legislation also contained provisions aimed reducing fraud and abuse healthcare the legislation amends several 
existing laws including the federal anti kickback statute and the false claims act making easier for government agencies and 
private plaintiffs prevail lawsuits brought against healthcare providers while congress had previously revised the intent 
requirement the anti kickback statute provide that person not required have actual knowledge specific intent 
commit violation of the anti kickback statute order found violation such law the legislation also provides that any 
claims for items services that violate the anti kickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes the federal civil 
false claims act the legislation provides that healthcare provider that retains overpayment excess days subject the 
federal civil false claims act although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending the legislation 
also expands the recovery audit contractor program medicaid these amendments also make easier for severe fines and 
penalties imposed healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations 
have partnered with local physicians the ownership certain our facilities these investments have been permitted 
under exception the physician self referral law the legislation permits existing physician investments hospital continue 
under grandfather clause the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from 
increasing the aggregate percentage their ownership the hospital the legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure 
requirements upon existing physician owned hospitals and restricts the ability physician owned hospitals expand the capacity 
their facilities discussed below should the legislation repealed its entirety this aspect the legislation would also 
repealed restoring physician ownership hospitals and expansion right its position and practice existed prior the 
legislation 
the impact the legislation each our hospitals may vary because legislation provisions are effective various times 
over the next several years anticipate that many the provisions the legislation may subject further revision initiatives 
repeal the legislation whole part delay elements implementation funding and offer amendments supplements 
modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase result the election the ultimate outcomes legislative 
attempts repeal amend the legislation and legal challenges the legislation are unknown results recent congressional 
elections and the change presidential administrations beginning could create political environment which substantial 
portions the legislation are repealed revised specifically president donald trump day action plan called for full repeal 
the legislation and its replacement with health savings accounts cross states sales health insurance and modifications statemanaged medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment radical change the health care regulatory landscape 
are not clear and president donald trump has already indicated that popular provisions the legislation should preserved 
remains unclear what portions the legislation may remain whether any replacement alternative programs may created 
any future legislation any such future repeal replacement may have significant impact the reimbursement for healthcare 
services generally and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered our hospitals accordingly 
there can assurance that the adoption any future federal state healthcare reform legislation will not have negative 
financial impact our hospitals including their ability compete with alternative healthcare services funded such potential

sources revenue 
overview receive payments for services rendered from private insurers including managed care plans the federal 
government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients 
hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered 
physicians and provided patients the volume outpatient procedures and the charges negotiated payment rates for such 
services charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending the type services provided 
medical surgical intensive care behavioral health and the geographic location the hospital inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate 
for various reasons many which are beyond our control the percentage patient service revenue attributable outpatient 
services has generally increased recent years primarily result advances medical technology that allow more services 
provided outpatient basis well increased pressure from medicare medicaid and private insurers reduce hospital stays 
and provide services where possible less expensive outpatient basis believe that our experience with respect our 
increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring the health care industry and are unable predict the rate 
growth and resulting impact our future revenues 
uhs annual report pdf 
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such 
services under medicare medicaid some private insurance plans and managed care plans but are responsible for services not 
covered such plans exclusions deductibles insurance features their coverage the amount such exclusions deductibles 
and insurance has generally been increasing each year indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will 
continue collection amounts due from individuals typically more difficult than from governmental business payers which 
unfavorably impacts the collectability our patient accounts 
sources revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits the federal government and many states are 
currently considering additional ways limit increases levels medicare and medicaid funding which could also adversely affect 
future payments received our hospitals addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government 
result among other things economic recovery stimulus packages responses natural disasters and the federal budget deficit 
general may affect the availability federal funds provide additional relief the future are unable predict the effect

programs medicare medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled implemented various times during 
this decade are noted below 
initiatives repeal the aca whole part delay elements implementation funding and offer amendments 
supplements modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase result the election the ultimate outcomes 
legislative attempts repeal amend the aca and legal challenges the aca are unknown results recent congressional 
elections and the change presidential administrations beginning could create political environment which substantial 
portions the aca are repealed revised specifically president donald trump day action plan called for full repeal the 
aca and its replacement with health savings accounts cross states sales health insurance and modifications state managed 
medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment radical change the health care regulatory landscape are not 
clear and president donald trump has already indicated that popular provisions the aca should preserved remains unclear 
what portions the aca may remain what any replacement alternative programs may created any future legislation 
any such future repeal replacement may have significant impact the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may 
create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered our hospitals accordingly there can assurance that 
the adoption any future federal state healthcare reform legislation will not have negative financial impact our hospitals 
including their ability compete with alternative healthcare services funded such potential legislation for our hospitals
