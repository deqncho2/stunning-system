applicable regulations through compliance programs policies and procedures manuals and personnel training despite these efforts cannot guarantee 
that will absolute compliance with all regulations all times failure comply with applicable governmental regulations may result significant 
penalties including exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs which would have material adverse effect our business and financial results

veterans affairs health programs and the department defense tricare program formerly known champus these laws which include but are 
not limited federal and state anti kickback laws false claims laws physician self referral laws and federal criminal health care fraud laws are discussed 
further detail below believe our billing practices operations and compensation and financial arrangements with referral sources and others materially 
comply with applicable federal and state requirements however cannot assure that such requirements will always interpreted governmental 
authority manner consistent with our interpretation and application the failure comply even inadvertent with any these requirements could 
require alter our operations with and refund payments the government such refunds could significant and could also lead the imposition 
significant penalties even successfully defend against any action against for violation these laws regulations would likely forced

recommendation purchasing leasing ordering items services that may paid for whole part federal health care program courts 
have held that the statute may violated when even one purpose opposed primary sole purpose the remuneration induce referrals other 
business 
recognizing that the anti kickback statute broad and may technically prohibit beneficial commercial arrangements the office inspector general the 
department health and human services has developed regulations addressing certain business arrangements that will offer protection from scrutiny under 
the anti kickback statute these safe harbors describe activities which may protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute provided that 
they meet all the requirements the applicable safe harbor regulation for example the safe harbors cover activities such offering discounts health 
care providers and contracting with physicians other individuals entities that have the potential refer business that would ultimately billed 
federal health care program long the discount properly disclosed and appropriately reflected any claims charges 
failure qualify for safe harbor protection does not automatically mean that arrangement illegal rather the facts and circumstances the 
arrangement must analyzed determine whether there improper intent pay receive remuneration return for referrals conduct and business 
arrangements that not fully satisfy one the safe harbors may result increased scrutiny government enforcement authorities addition some 
states have anti kickback laws that vary scope and may apply regardless whether federal health care program involved 
our operations and business arrangements include for example discount programs other financial arrangements with individuals and entities such 
lease arrangements with hospitals and certain participation agreements therefore our operations and business arrangements are required comply with the 
anti kickback laws although our business arrangements and operations may not always satisfy all the criteria safe harbor believe that our 
operations are material compliance with federal and state anti kickback statutes nonetheless cannot ensure that the government interpretation 
safe harbor provision will always consistent with our own and our arrangements may subject scrutiny under anti kickback laws noncompliance 
with such laws can result number enforcement actions including the imposition civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal health care 
programs 
medical device regulation provide distribute and lease products that are subject regulation medical devices the food and drug 
administration fda under the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and accompanying regulations our patient care segment with the 
exception two products which have been cleared for marketing prescription medical devices under section the fdca believe that the

the physician immediate family member has investment interest the entity shares are generally available the public the time the designated 
health service referral and are traded certain exchanges including among others the new york stock exchange nyse well over the counter 
quotation systems including the otc markets group inc otc and the investment entity had shareholders equity exceeding million for its 
most recent fiscal year average during the three previous fiscal years meet these tests and therefore believe that referrals from physicians who 
have ownership interests our stock whose immediate family members have ownership interests our stock should not result liability under the stark 
law 
with respect compensation arrangements there are exceptions under the stark law that permit physicians maintain certain business arrangements such 
personal service contracts and equipment space leases with health care entities which they refer patients for designated health services all the 
elements stark law exception must met order for the exception apply further unlike the anti kickback statute under the stark law liability 
can result without specific intent induce referrals believe that our compensation arrangements with physicians comply with the stark law either 
because the physician relationship fits fully within stark law exception because the physician does not generate prohibited referrals however 
receive prohibited referral our submission bill for services rendered pursuant such referral could subject sanctions under the stark law and 
applicable state self referral laws including false claims liability potential exclusion and imposition civil monetary penalties state self referral laws may 
extend the prohibitions the stark law medicaid beneficiaries and there are some indications that the federal government may similarly expand the 
reach the law

include double triple damages plus penalties ranging from per claim these penalties are nearly double what they were prior years 
while endeavor assure that our billing practices comply with applicable laws claims submitted payors are deemed false fraudulent for 
items services not provided claimed may face liability for presenting causing presented such claims

the abc the abc conducts certification program for clinicians and accreditation program for patient care clinics the minimum requirements for

how they may interpreted interpreted the various state and local agencies failure comply with state licensure requirements could result

health care reform has initiated significant changes the united states health care system and expect see further changes the health care system 
the future 
various health care reform provisions became law upon enactment the patient protection and affordable care act pub march 
the affordable care act the reforms contained the affordable care act have impacted our business continued political economic and regulatory 
influences are subjecting the health care industry the united states fundamental change further changes relating the health care industry and 
health care spending may adversely affect our revenue anticipate that congress will continue review and assess alternative health care delivery and 
payment systems and may the future propose and adopt legislation effecting additional fundamental changes the health care system although efforts 
replacing the affordable care act and overhauling the health care system have currently stalled congress health care reform remains priority for the 
trump administration and for many members congress cannot assure you the ultimate content timing effect changes nor possible 
this time estimate the impact potential legislation our business however although the specific reforms the current health care system cannot 
accurately predicted this time such changes could have considerable impact how health care reimbursed particularly the coverage for certain 
types services and the reimbursement levels provided government sources 
changes government reimbursement levels could adversely affect our patient care segment net revenue cash flows and profitability 
derived approximately and our net revenue for the years ended december and respectively from 
reimbursements for services and products from programs administered medicare medicaid and the department veterans affairs va each 
these programs set reimbursement levels for the services and products provided under their program these agencies reduce reimbursement levels 
for services and products the future our net revenues could substantially decline addition the percentage our net revenues derived from these 
sources may increase the portion the population over age continues grow making more vulnerable reimbursement reductions these 
organizations reduced government reimbursement levels could result reduced private payor reimbursement levels because fee schedules certain third 
party payors are indexed medicare reimbursement levels furthermore the health care industry experiencing trend towards cost containment 
government and other third party payors seek impose lower reimbursement rates and negotiate reduced contract rates with service providers this trend 
could adversely affect our net revenues for example number states have reduced their medicaid reimbursement rates for services and products 
have reduced medicaid eligibility and others are the process reviewing medicaid reimbursement policies generally including for prosthetic and 
orthotic devices 
medicare provides for reimbursement for products and services based prices set forth fee schedules for ten regional service areas medicare prices 
are adjusted each year based the cpi unless congress acts change eliminate the adjustment the medicare price changes for and 
were and respectively the affordable care act aca changed the medicare inflation factors applicable and other 
suppliers the annual updates for years subsequent are based the percentage increase the cpi for the months ended 
table contents 
june the previous year section the aca required that for and each subsequent year the fee schedule update factor based the cpi 
for the months ended june the previous year adjusted the annual change economy wide private nonfarm business multifactor 
productivity the mfp adjustment the mfp adjustment may result the percentage increase being less than zero for year and may result payment 
rates for year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year although the decrease the medicare fee schedule for not 
unprecedented the first time that there has been decrease since when the productivity adjustment was first introduced following the aca the 
centers for medicare medicaid services cms has not yet issued final rule implementing these adjustments for years beyond but has indicated 
proposed rule that will part the annual program instructions the fee schedule updates see fed reg july 
the congress were legislate additional modifications the medicare fee schedules our net revenues from medicare and other payors could 
adversely and materially affected 
alternative models reimbursement for durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos may also affect our business the 
medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act requires that medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for 
certain dmepos items and services with single payment amounts determined through competitive bidding process and cms has issued regulations 
finalizing the methodology for adjusting fee schedule amounts for such items see fed reg november the types dmepos 
subject competitive bidding under the statute include oxygen and oxygen equipment continuous positive airway pressure devices single and level 
standard manual and power wheelchairs scooters and walkers group complex rehabilitative power wheelchairs hospital beds commode chairs patient 
lifts and seat lifts support surfaces pressure reducing mattresses and overlays enteral nutrients supplies and equipment negative pressure wound therapy 
pumps infusion pumps transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices standard nebulizers and certain mail order diabetic testing supplies under the 
dmepos competitive bidding program suppliers compete submit bids for selected products and the medicare suppliers offering the best price 
addition meeting applicable quality and financial standards are awarded contracts supply the designated products and services medicare 
beneficiaries specified competitive bidding areas although our product offerings currently subject competitive bidding not comprise significant 
portion our business possible that the dmepos competitive bidding program may expand include other types products offer that other 
payors will adopt similar models for reimbursement which may negatively affect our net revenue 
the budget control act required among other things mandatory across the board reductions federal spending sequestration while 
delayed the american taxpayer relief act president obama issued sequestration order march for services provided after 
april medicare fee for service claim payments including those for dmepos well claims under the dmepos competitive bidding program 
are reduced november president obama signed the bipartisan budget act into law which provided for two years increases 
discretionary spending offset additional year medicare sequestration through this claims payment adjustment with limited impact 
permanent reductions the medicare dmepos fee schedule have been made result sequestration therefore additional reimbursements from 
medicaid the and commercial payors who use the medicare fee schedule basis for reimbursement have not been impacted 
cms may also develop policies limit medicare coverage specific products and services medical administrative contractors may issue local coverage 
determinations lcd that limit coverage for particular item service their jurisdiction only this can lead state state variation medicare 
coverage for some items and services any lcd that negatively impacts orthotic prosthetic reimbursement would negatively affect our revenue 
finally patients may continue move medicare advantage plans from traditional medicare plans which will change the nature the reimbursement 
received from the traditional medicare program and negatively affect our net revenue 
table contents 
the average rates that commercial payors pay decline significantly then would have material adverse effect our patient care segment net 
revenues earnings and cash flows 
derived approximately and our net revenue for the years ended december and respectively from 
reimbursements for services and products for patients who have commercial payors their primary payor continue experience downward 
pressure some our commercial payment rates result general conditions the market recent and future consolidations among commercial payors 
increased focus services and products and other factors there guarantee that commercial payment rates will not materially lower the 
future particularly given the fluctuations government reimbursement rates 
are continuously the process negotiating new agreements and renegotiating agreements that are for renewal with commercial payors who tend 
aggressive their negotiations with sometimes many significant agreements are for renewal being renegotiated the same time the event 
that our continual negotiations result overall commercial rate reductions excess overall commercial rate increases the cumulative effect could have 
material adverse effect our financial results consolidations the commercial payor market have significantly increased the negotiating leverage 
commercial payors our negotiations with payors are also influenced competitive pressures and may experience decreased contracted rates with 
commercial payors experience decreases patient volume our negotiations with commercial payors continue the average rates that commercial 
payors pay decline significantly see decline commercial patients would have material adverse effect our revenues earnings and cash 
flows 
changes government reimbursement levels could adversely affect our products services segment net revenues cash flows and profitability 
addition the risks our patient care segment businesses discussed previously changes government reimbursement levels could also adversely affect 
the net revenues cash flows and profitability the businesses our products services segment particular significant majority our therapeutic 
services sales involve devices and related services provided snfs and similar businesses reductions government reimbursement levels snfs have 
caused and could continue cause such snfs reduce cancel their use our therapeutic service equipment and related consultative services 
negatively impacting net revenues cash flows and profitability for example july cms announced across the board reduction approximately 
snf reimbursement levels which negatively impacted the demand for our devices and treatment modalities although cms has announced increases 
snf reimbursement levels the years since the agency announced increase for for for for 
and for cannot predict whether any other changes reimbursement levels will implemented implemented what form any 
changes might take may cms announced proposed replacement called patient driven payment model pdrm for the current resource 
utilization group rug iv snf payment system under medicare part pdrm further update the resident classification system version 
rcs proposed cms may cms has proposed effective date october for pdpm pdpm proposed subject change and 
revision before becomes effective and its effective date could postponed additionally its potential impact snf reimbursement levels not clear 
depend reimbursements third party payors well payments individuals which could lead delays and uncertainties the patient care 
segment reimbursement process 
receive substantial portion our payments for health care services fee for service basis from third party payors including medicare and medicaid 
private insurers and managed care organizations estimate that have received approximately and our net revenues from such 
third party payors during and respectively estimate that such amounts included approximately and from 
medicare and respectively and and from medicaid programs and respectively addition 
estimate net revenues from the were and and respectively 
the reimbursement process complex and can involve lengthy delays third party payors continue their efforts control expenditures for health care 
including proposals revise reimbursement policies while recognize revenue when health care services are provided there can delays before 
receive payment addition third party payors may disallow 
table contents 
whole part requests for reimbursement based determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage that services provided 
were not medically necessary that additional supporting documentation necessary retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third 
party payors third party payors may require pre authorizations for certain services and devices which may result delay our ability provide 
services provide services all additionally may see increase bundled payment models which can result delays before receive payment 
payment all for certain services 
changes government reimbursement levels and policies such those described above may also contribute uncertainties surrounding the reimbursement 
process are subject governmental audits our reimbursement claims under medicare medicaid the and other governmental programs and may 
required repay these agencies found that were incorrectly reimbursed delays and uncertainties the reimbursement process may adversely affect 
accounts receivable increase the overall costs collection and cause incur additional borrowing costs 
also may not paid with respect payments and deductibles that are the patient financial responsibility many the plans offered the state 
health insurance exchanges have high deductibles and require coinsurance that patients cannot afford pay amounts not covered third party payors are 
the obligations individual patients from whom may not receive whole partial payment also may not receive whole partial payments from 
uninsured and underinsured individuals such event our earnings and cash flow would adversely affected potentially affecting our ability 
maintain our restrictive debt covenant ratios and meet our financial obligations 
additionally employer based plans and other individual plans are increasingly relying high deductible plan designs their participation health 
plans with these high deductible designs increases our patients will face greater financial burdens and participatory costs that may affect their decisions 
regarding the timing their replacement their devices due cost considerations they may seek repair refurbish their existing devices and delay 
the purchase new replacement devices which will adversely affect our revenues and our profitability 
the risks associated with third party payors payments and deductibles and the inability monitor and manage accounts receivable successfully could 
still have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations furthermore our collection policies our provisions for 
allowances for medicare medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts receivable may not adequate 
due constraints the growth our rates reimbursement may face cost pressures that adversely affect our profitability 
due increased pressures governmental and commercial payors seek ways reducing the costs care those payors have and may continue seek 
ways reduce growth the rate our reimbursement for the services provide this constraint the rate growth reimbursement may adversely 
affect our profitability experience increases the wages materials and other costs necessary the conduct our business these cost increases may 
adversely affect our profitability and our profit margins 
given the complexities and demands related reimbursement may fail adequately provide the staffing and systems necessary ensure 
effectively manage our reimbursement processes 
the nature our business requires that are effective the assessment patient eligibility the process pre authorization the recordation and

products services segment which derives its net revenue from commercial transactions with independent providers healthcare facilities and other 
customers contrast net revenues from our patient care segment payment for these products and services are not directly subject third party 
reimbursement from health care payors 
the amount our reimbursement varies based the nature the device fabricate for our patients given the particular physical weight and size 
characteristics location injury amputation capability for physical activity and mobility cosmetic and other needs each individual patient each 
fabricated prostheses and orthoses customized for each particular patient the nature this customization and the manner which our claims 
submissions are reviewed payors makes our reimbursement process administratively difficult 
receive reimbursement for our work must ensure that our clinical administrative and billing personnel receive and verify certain medical and health 
plan information record detailed documentation regarding the services provide and accurately and timely perform number claims submission and 
related administrative tasks traditionally have performed these tasks manual fashion and decentralized basis recent years due increases 
payor pre authorization processes documentation requirements pre payment reviews and pre and post payment audits our ability successfully 
undertake these tasks using our traditional approach has become increasingly challenging believe these changes industry trends have been brought 
about part increased nationwide efforts reduce health care costs 
measure our effectiveness securing reimbursement for our services can found the degree which payors ultimately disallow payment our 
claims payors can deny claims due their determination that physician who referred patient did not sufficiently document that device was 
medically necessary clearly establish the ambulatory activity level patient claims can also denied based our failure ensure that 
patient was currently eligible under payor health plan that the plan provides full benefits that received prior authorization that filed 
appealed the payor determination timely the basis our coding failure certain classes patients pay their portion claim and for various 
other reasons any portion administrative factor within our claim found the payor lacking then the entirety the claim amount may 
denied reimbursement due the increasing demands these processes the level and capability our staffing well our material weaknesses and 
other considerations our consolidated disallowed revenue and bad debt expense and their relationship consolidated adjusted gross revenue increased

that have been disallowed increased high from due industry trends and our specific administrative factors our 
collection experience degraded and disallowed revenue increased during that period time these adverse industry trends included increased level 
payor audits and more stringent requests payors that referring physician documentation provided connection with claims during that period 
time utilized decentralized billing and collections approach where invoicing and collections were undertaken individual patient care locations our 
typical locations have average two office administrators who are required handle patient administration purchasing and clinician support tasks due 
increasing payor documentation demands and budgetary limitations staffing administrative staff were increasingly unable successfully address the 
growing levels payor denials our accounts receivable trends were further complicated due issues encountered with our implementation 
new patient management and electronic health record system due system customizations that were subsequently determined not adequately tested 
staffing deficiencies cash application functions and other related procedural issues billing and collections were further adversely affected due this 
system implementation during that year can seen the increase the disallowed revenue rate and bad debt expense that year throughout this 
period our processes were also impeded due the subsequently identified underlying material control weakness the administration our contracts 
contracts were negotiated amended with payors our procedures did not provide adequate assurance timely documented reconciliation updated terms 
and conditions with those loaded into our remote billing systems 
commencing late and continuing through and took number actions halt and reverse these disallowed revenue and bad 
debt trends these initiatives included the retention consultants and constitution central revenue cycle management function the temporary 
halting the roll out our new patient management and electronic health record system address the identified issues and iii the establishment new 
clinic level procedures and training regarding the collection supporting documentation and the importance diligence our claims submission 
processes the percentage our gross billings that have been disallowed decreased from the high these initiatives are 
each discussed more fully sections provided for each them below while intend continue work towards further improvements our procedures

our overall accounts receivables balances are due part our revenue cycle management initiative 
new system implementation 
our patient care segment commenced the implementation new patient management and electronic health record system our patient care 
clinics key purpose the system was automate clinician documentation claims coding and other increasingly complex clinic administrative 
requirements connection with the system implementation customized certain templates and software code within system developed nextgen 
the system was installed increasing numbers clinics encountered difficulties clinic workload were unable timely apply cash 
received from payors patient accounts and experienced marked increase our accounts receivable balance due these issues halted the 
implementation the end the third quarter after the system had been installed approximately one third our sites 
believe the implementation issues encountered related primarily inadequate testing the system failure successfully establish and effectively 
staff central cash applications function insufficient training and other difficulties associated with our customizations the software code 
table contents 
subsequently resolved the issues encountered with the system and our implementation process and recommenced implementation 
and expensed million and million respectively training travel and related implementation costs currently anticipate that will 
incur approximately million training travel and related implementation costs approximately two thirds our clinics were utilizing this 
system the end and plan convert the remaining locations this system mid 
clinic level claims documentation 
addition our revenue cycle management initiatives and resolution the aforementioned issues associated with our implementation our new 
electronic health record and patient management system commenced more intensive training and increased our internal clinic level emphasis 
the importance adherence procedural and documentation standards the absence sufficient documentation establishing medical necessity and 
patient degree ability for future activity key factor utilized payors when denying our claims for reimbursement irrespective patient need 
and the existence referral from the treating physician have found increasingly necessary retrieve other supporting documentation and notes from 
referring physicians themselves further justify and document their medical determinations relating the patients they refer given that these 
referring physicians not work for the retrieval this additional information suit payors can difficult and time consuming 
believe our efforts increase our discipline through this clinic level claims documentation initiative assisted further reducing the level our 
disallowed sales however also believe these efforts had one time indirect effect reducing our overall revenue growth rate addition other 
factors affecting our same clinic sales trends and early clinicians and their office administrators increased their attention achieving higher 
documentation standards believe were able see and treat fewer patients thereby contributing our reduced same clinic patient care net revenue 
continued apply these procedural and documentation standards throughout and plan continue with the initial 
implementation impact behind not believe the use these standards will significant factor our year over year net revenue growth trends for 
increasing patient responsibility for the cost devices 
the majority our devices are provided replacement devices patients with devices that are broken have become worn with age prosthetic devices 
are typically replaced every three five years recent years increasing number employers have been shifting the cost burdens their health plans 
employees through use high deductible consumer driven health plans these plan designs typically require the patient bear greater portion 
the cost their care exchange for lower monthly premium believe the increased use these plans has and will continue have the effect 
causing patients delay the replacement their devices and could accordingly adversely impact our net revenue 
products services segment trends 
during several the larger independent providers serve through the distribution componentry encountered financial difficulties which 
resulted our discontinuing distribution services them generally believe our distribution customers are encountering reimbursement pressures 
similar those have experienced our own patient care services and depending their ability adapt the increased claims documentation 
standards that have emerged our industry that this may either limit the rate growth some our customers otherwise affect the rate growth 
experience our distribution componentry independent providers 
within our products services segment addition our distribution products provide therapeutic equipment and services patients snfs and 
other healthcare provider locations late number our clients including several our larger snf clients elected discontinue their use our 
therapeutic services believe these discontinuances relate primarily their overall efforts reduce the costs they bear for therapy related services within 
their facilities part

legal matters and due the effect our non compliance with certain our debt covenants relating our failure meet financial statement reporting 
requirements connection with refinancing our debt and the resolution the primary factors which led halt our acquisitions currently 
intend recommence acquisitions businesses similar those that have consummated prior years

during the course the year the first quarter normally our lowest relative net revenue quarter followed the second and third quarters which are 
somewhat higher and consistent with one another and due the general fulfillment patients their health plan payments and deductible 
requirements towards the year end our fourth quarter normally our highest revenue producing quarter 
our results are also affected lesser extent our holding education fair the first quarter each year this one week event conducted assist 
our clinicians maintaining their training and certification requirements and facilitate national meeting with our clinical leaders also invite

business environment and outlook 
our patient care segment have positive view the long term need for prosthetic and orthotic devices and services within the markets that serve 
address the debilitating effects injuries and medical conditions such diabetes vascular disease cancer and congenital disorders believe patients 
will have continuing need for the services that provide the population grows and ages also believe there will gradual underlying 
increase market demand 
ensure maintain and grow our share this market believe that will necessary for find effective means automate and better organize 
our business processes further improve our reimbursement capabilities and lower our cost structure the longer term our size may afford the ability 
achieve economies scale through purchasing and process automation initiatives that would difficult for our smaller competitors however our size can 
work against not succeed effectively serving our referring physicians and competing with our individual competitors each the markets

accordance with gaap the preparation consolidated financial statements conformity with gaap requires management make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the consolidated financial 
statements and the reported amounts revenues and expenses during the reporting period gaap provides the framework from which make these 
estimates assumptions and disclosures have chosen accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate fairly present all 
material respects our operating results and financial position our significant accounting policies are stated note significant accounting policies 
the consolidated financial statements included this annual report form believe the following accounting policies are critical 
understanding our results operations and the more significant judgments and estimates used the preparation our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
patient care segment 
revenues our patient care segment are primarily derived from the sale devices and are recognized when the patient has received the device 
service subsequent delivery issue invoice third party payor which primarily consists commercial insurance companies medicare 
medicaid the and private patient pay private pay recognize revenue for the amounts expect receive from payors based expected 
contractual reimbursement rates which are net estimated contractual discounts government reimbursement comprised medicare medicaid and the 
department veterans affairs the aggregate accounted for approximately and our net revenue and 
respectively 
these revenue amounts are further revised claims are adjudicated which may result disallowances decreases revenue believe that adjustments 
related write offs receivables should predominantly recorded reduction revenues which refer disallowed revenue this due the 
majority our revenues being collected from commercial insurance companies medicare medicaid and the most which are under contractual 
reimbursement rates 
table contents 
such adjustments not relate inability pay but contractual allowances lack timely claims submission insufficient medical documentation 
other administrative errors amounts recorded bad debt expense which are presented within other operating costs generally relate commercial 
payor bankruptcies and private pay balances for which there was assessment collectability and collection attempts were made the end each 
period establish allowances for estimated disallowances relating that period based prior adjudication experience and record such amounts 
adjustment revenue similar fashion estimate and record allowances for doubtful accounts unpaid receivables each period end also 
record liability with corresponding adjustment revenue for refunds expected paid our patients third party payors 
medicare and medicaid regulations and the various agreements have with other third party payors including commercial healthcare providers under 
which these contractual adjustments and disallowed revenue are calculated are complex and are subject interpretation and adjustment and may include 
multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types services therefore the particular devices and related services authorized and provided and 
the related reimbursement are subject interpretation and adjustment that could result payments that differ from our estimates additionally updated 
regulations and reimbursement schedules and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating regular review and assessment the estimation process 
management result there reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change and any related adjustments will recorded changes 
estimates when they become known 
for more information our use estimates calculate allowances for disallowed revenue and doubtful accounts refer the accounts receivable net

not yet invoiced period end this estimate based historical look back analysis lag times between delivery and invoicing that occur over period

products services segment 
revenues our products services segment are derived from the distribution components and the leasing and sale rehabilitation equipment and 
ancillary consumable supplies combined with equipment maintenance education and training distribution revenues are recorded upon the delivery 
products net estimated returns 
equipment leasing and related services revenue are recognized over the applicable term the customer has the right use the equipment and the services 
are provided equipment sales revenue recognized upon delivery with any related services revenue deferred and recognized the services are performed 
sales consumables are recognized upon delivery 
accounts receivable net 
patient care segment 
establish allowances for accounts receivable reduce the carrying value such receivables their estimated net realizable value the patient care 
segment accounts receivables are recorded net unapplied cash estimated allowance for disallowed revenue and estimated allowance for doubtful 
accounts described the revenue recognition accounting policy above 
both the allowance for disallowed revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates consider historical collection experience each the

business combinations 
record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed business combinations under the acquisition method accounting for

capacity under our million revolving credit facility this increase liquidity relates primarily the net proceeds million from the

connection with refinancing our debt and the resolution the primary factors which led halt our acquisitions currently intend 
recommence acquisitions businesses similar those that have consummated prior years 
our capital expenditures are primarily comprised the replacement furniture fixtures and equipment our clinics and other facilities the construction 
leasehold improvements and the purchase computer equipment and related software replace certain older equipment reaching the end its 
useful life currently believe that may necessary for expend amounts additional our normal levels connection with the purchase 
replacement therapeutic equipment for use our therapy business the approximate amount million may choose delay defer these 
other capital expenditures the event that business financial conditions warrant

our omnibus incentive plan not qualify for deductibility under section because the plan was not approved our shareholders 
result changes made the tax cuts and jobs act starting with compensation paid section will limit from deducting

these revenue amounts are further revised claims are adjudicated which may result disallowances decreases revenue believe that adjustments 
related write offs receivables should predominantly recorded reduction revenues which refer disallowed revenue this due the 
majority our revenues being collected from commercial insurance companies medicare medicaid and the veterans administration most which are 
under contractual reimbursement rates such adjustments not relate inability pay but contractual allowances lack timely claims 
submission insufficient medical documentation other administrative errors amounts recorded bad debt expense which are presented within other 
operating costs generally relate commercial payor bankruptcies and private pay balances for which there was assessment collectability and 
collection attempts were made the end each period establish allowances for estimated disallowances relating that period based prior 
adjudication experience and record such amounts adjustment revenue similar fashion estimate and record allowances for doubtful accounts 
unpaid receivables each period end also record liability with corresponding adjustment revenue for refunds expected paid our 
patients third party payors 
medicare and medicaid regulations and the various agreements have with other third party payors including commercial healthcare payors under which 
these contractual adjustments and disallowed revenue are calculated are complex and are subject interpretation and adjustment and may include multiple 
reimbursement mechanisms for different types services therefore the particular devices and related services authorized and provided and the 
related reimbursement are subject interpretation and adjustment that could result payments that differ from our estimates additionally updated 
regulations and reimbursement schedules and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating regular review and assessment the estimation process 
management result there reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change and any related adjustments will recorded changes 
estimates when they become known
