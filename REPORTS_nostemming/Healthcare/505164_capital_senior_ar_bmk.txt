cannot assure that will attempt able acquire additional senior housing communities 
the acquisition existing communities other businesses involves number risks existing communities available for acquisition frequently serve target different markets than those presently served 
may also determine that renovations acquired communities and changes staff and operations management 
personnel are necessary successfully integrate those communities businesses into our existing operations 
the costs incurred reposition renovate newly acquired communities may not recovered undertaking acquisitions also may adversely impacted unforeseen liabilities attributable the prior operators those communities businesses against whom may have little recourse the success our

more until completion and are operating and producing revenue addition may incur substantial costs prior 
achieving stabilized occupancy for each project and cannot assure you that the costs will not greater than 
have anticipated our failure achieve our renovation repositioning and redevelopment plans could 
adversely impact our anticipated revenues results operations and cash flows 
termination resident agreements and resident attrition could affect adversely our revenues and earnings 
state regulations governing assisted living facilities require written resident agreements with each resident 
most these regulations also require that each resident have the right terminate the resident agreement for 
any reason reasonable notice consistent with these regulations the resident agreements signed allow 
residents terminate their lease upon days notice thus cannot contract with residents stay for 
longer periods time unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods year longer our resident agreements generally provide for termination the 
lease upon death allow resident terminate their lease upon the need for higher level care not provided 
the community addition the advanced age our average resident means that the resident turnover rate 
our senior living facilities may difficult predict large number residents elected otherwise 
terminate their resident agreements around the same time then our revenues and earnings could 
adversely affected 
largely rely private pay residents and circumstances that adversely affect the ability the elderly 
pay for our services could have material adverse effect 
approximately our total revenues from communities that operated were attributable private 
pay sources and approximately our revenues from these communities were attributable reimbursements from medicaid each case during fiscal expect continue rely primarily the ability 
residents pay for our services from their own family financial resources unfavorable economic conditions 
the housing financial and credit markets inflation other circumstances that adversely affect the ability 
the elderly pay for our services could have material adverse effect our business financial condition cash

organizations and have the ability finance capital expenditures tax exempt basis through the receipt 
charitable contributions neither which are available furthermore the development new senior 
housing communities outpaces the demand for those communities the markets which have senior housing communities those markets may become saturated regulation the independent and assisted living 
industry not substantial consequently development new senior housing communities could outpace

among other things guaranteed coverage requirements eliminates pre existing condition exclusions and annual 
and lifetime maximum limits restricts the extent which policies can rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes health insurers and health care benefits provisions the health care reform legislation become

critical accounting policies 
the preparation financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the 
united states requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported the 
accompanying financial statements and related notes management bases its estimates and assumptions historical experience observance industry trends and various other sources information and factors the results 
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates critical accounting policies are 
defined those that are reflective significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially could result 
materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the company believes the following are 
our most critical accounting policies and typically require management most difficult subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
resident revenue recognized estimated net realizable amounts based historical experiences due 
from residents the period which the rental and other services are provided additionally substantially all 
community fees received from residents are non refundable and are recorded initially the company 
deferred revenue the deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents initial lease term which 
consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay the resident 
revenues from the medicaid program accounted for approximately the company revenue fiscal the company revenue fiscal and the company revenue fiscal 
during fiscal and and respectively the company communities were providers 
services under medicaid programs accordingly these communities were entitled reimbursement under the 
foregoing program established rates that were lower than private pay rates patient service revenue for medicaid patients was recorded the reimbursement rates the rates were set prospectively the applicable state 
upon the filing annual cost report none the company communities were providers services under 
the medicare program during fiscal 
laws and regulations governing the medicaid program are complex and subject interpretation the 
company believes that compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and not aware any pending threatened investigations involving allegations potential wrongdoing while such regulatory 
inquiries have been made compliance with such laws and regulations can subject future government review 
and interpretation well significant regulatory action including fines penalties and exclusion from the 
medicaid program 
purchase accounting

and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed any the company makes estimates fair 
value using information obtained result pre acquisition due diligence leasing activities and 
independent appraisals the company assigns the purchase price for senior living communities assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed based their estimated fair values which are determined accordance with the provisions asc business combinations the determination fair value involves the use significant judgments and estimates which generally assessed follows 
the company allocates the fair values buildings acquired vacant basis and depreciates the 
building values over the estimated remaining lives the buildings not exceed years the company 
determines the allocated values other fixed assets such site improvements and furniture fixtures and 
equipment based upon the replacement cost and depreciates such values over the assets estimated remaining 
useful lives determined the acquisition date the company determines the value land considering the 
sales prices similar properties recent transactions 
the fair value acquired lease related intangibles reflects the estimated fair value existing resident 
place leases represented the cost obtain residents and estimated absorption period reflect the 
value the rent and recovery costs foregone during reasonable lease period the property acquired was 
vacant the company amortizes any acquired resident place lease intangibles depreciation and amortization 
expense over the estimated remaining useful life the respective resident operating leases 
credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company resident receivables are generally due within days from the date billed accounts receivable are reported net allowance for doubtful accounts million and million december 
and respectively and represent the company estimate the amount that ultimately will collected the adequacy the company allowance for doubtful accounts reviewed ongoing basis using 
historical payment trends write off experience analyses receivable portfolios payor source and aging 
receivables well review specific accounts and adjustments are made the allowance necessary 
credit losses resident receivables have historically been within management estimates and management 
believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses
