the current state clinical development inefficient 
fragmented and costly and there tremendous 
opportunity for shape the future clinical trials 
the average drug takes over years develop and 
the capitalized development cost per drug upwards 
billion trial operations are bogged down the 
complexity protocols non standard data and small 
scale solutions crf pages per protocol increased 
astonishing from the last decade 
alone further compounding the problem are the 
clinical technology vendors who offer siloed fragmented 
solutions causing single trial run upwards

sell our solutions and provide services globally approximately and our revenues each the years

backlog 
december and our total multi year subscription backlog was million and million respectively 
total subscription backlog increases with the addition new customer contracts customer renewals and contract modifications 
decreases with the recognition revenue contract modifications the timing and duration new contracts renewals contract 
modifications and revenue recognition are variable and are not comparable year year total subscription backlog typically highest 
the beginning contract and approaches zero prior renewal the level total backlog not indicator the likelihood 
renewal future revenue that contract the amount total backlog associated with existing multi year contract may significantly 
vary year year solely based the status renewal and have significant impact the amount revenue attributable that 
contract year over year comparison additionally large multi study deals may include provisions under which the customer 
contracts for smaller amount subscription services they start the contract and the amount ramps over the life the contract 
the result initial large increase total subscription backlog that does not equate proportional increase revenue the 
subsequent period 
also calculate month subscription backlog which represents the future contract value outstanding multi study and 
single study arrangements billed and unbilled recognized the next months excluding expected intra year renewals and 
other adjustments january and had month subscription backlog approximately million and 
million respectively believe that month subscription backlog more easily reconciled future revenues recognized than 
total backlog and therefore more valuable metric for evaluation expected future revenues 
our presentation backlog may differ from that other companies our industry 
competition 
the market for clinical trial solutions highly competitive and rapidly evolving subject changing technology shifting 
customer needs changes laws and regulations and frequent introductions new products and services compete with firms 
such oracle parexel informatics and others offering products and services that compete with one more our solutions 
table contents

sales and marketing capabilities including the ability create and communicate operational value 
although some our competitors and potential competitors may have greater name recognition longer operating histories more 
product offerings and greater financial technological and other resources than believe that compete favorably with our 
competitors the basis these factors

expected recognized during the subsequent month period recorded current deferred revenue and the remaining 
portion noncurrent deferred revenue 
some instances customer elects renew its subscription arrangement prior the original termination date the 
arrangement the renewed subscription agreement provides support for process clinical trials and includes the right use
