the performance plan based subjective performance factor rating for the neo provided however that the 
maximum performance based cash incentive opportunity for neo may not exceed the neo annual

sole performance metric for all neos continue believe this metric aligns well with our internal financial 
imperatives expand operating margin and grow bottom line earnings and the compensation committee believes 
this the best performance metric help drive business growth and return our shareholders while providing 
meaningful incentive both quarterly and annual basis our neos the adjusted eps performance for 
incentive compensation purposes represented earnings growth over which was primarily result increased

deductibility executive compensation 
section the internal revenue code generally disallows federal income tax deduction public company 
for compensation excess million per fiscal year paid covered employees prior january any 
amounts that qualified under the performance based compensation exception under section were excluded 
from this deduction limit pursuant the tax reform legislation passed december commonly referred 
the tax cuts and jobs act this performance based compensation exception was eliminated effective for taxable 
years beginning after december such that compensation paid public company covered employees 
excess million will not deductible unless qualifies for transition relief applicable certain arrangements 
place november addition the tax cuts and jobs act amended the definition covered employees 
include company chief financial officer such effective january covered employees include 
company chief executive officer chief financial officer and the next three other most highly compensated officers 
serving the end the taxable year further under the tax cuts and jobs act once officer covered employee 
their compensation will remain subject section indefinitely 
general matter making its previous compensation decisions the compensation committee sought maximize 
the deductibility compensation under section the extent doing was reasonable and consistent with our 
strategies and goals stock options and performance based equity awarded under our shareholder approved long term 
incentive plan and payments under our shareholder approved performance based compensation plan for were 
designed with the intent qualify under the performance based compensation exception under section and 
enable deduct such compensation the greatest extent permitted under section each case such 
rules were effect when the compensation decisions were made 
although deductibility compensation preferred tax deductibility not the primary objective our compensation 
programs believe important retain the flexibility compensate executives competitively even such 
compensation potentially not deductible for tax purposes the compensation committee considers the impacts 
all relevant tax provisions developing implementing and administering our compensation programs however the 
compensation committee balances this consideration with our primary goal structuring compensation programs 
attract motivate reward and retain qualified associates such exceptions may occur when the compensation 
committee after balancing tax efficiency with our strategies and goals believes the best interests our 
shareholders addition because the uncertainties associated with the application and interpretation section 
and the regulations issued thereunder including the uncertain scope the transition relief under the tax cuts 
and jobs act there can assurance that compensation intended satisfy the requirements for deductibility under 
section will fact deductible further the compensation committee reserves the right modify 
compensation that was initially intended exempt from section determines that such modifications 
are consistent with our strategies and goals
