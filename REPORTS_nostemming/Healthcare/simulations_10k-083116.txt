fda assess the likely bioequivalence generic drug formulations dosed the eye under this rca receive per year this rca may 
renewed for total three years based the progress achieved during the project after successful second year the rca was renewed for its third 
year september and will expire september 
were awarded another rca the fda september this time expand the capabilities gastroplus simulate the dosing long acting 
injectable microspheres this type dosage form usually injected via subcutaneous intramuscular routes but can also used for ocular dosing once 
again this rca provides per year for three years under this agreement are developing simulation models deal with the slow 
dissolution decomposition the microsphere carrier material that gradually releases the active drug over periods long weeks months after successful 
first year the rca was renewed for the second year september and will expire september unless renewed 
addition the two funded efforts with the fda described above also have unfunded rca with the fda office generic drugs ogd that began 
the objective this rca which has five year term directed toward the fda evaluation mechanistic ivivcs vitro vivo correlations 
determine whether mechanistic absorption modeling mam can relate laboratory vitro dissolution experiment results the behavior dosage forms 
humans and animals vivo better than traditional empirical methods 
april released version gastroplus this was the largest single upgrade have made the program date and the added level science 
and technology enabled valuable new functionalities that believe provide the most advanced decision making tool for preclinical and early clinical trial 
simulation and modeling analysis available today several the significant enhancements include 
ability simulate the absorption and distribution biologics antibodies and proteins 
ability simulate dosing the skin including patches creams ointments and subcutaneous injections and 
tighter integration with our admet predictor software increase the utility the program early drug discovery 
our goal with gastroplus integrate the most advanced science into user friendly software enable pharmaceutical researchers and regulators perform 
sophisticated analyses complex drug behaviors humans and laboratory animals already the most widely used program the world for physiologically 
based pharmacokinetics pbpk the addition these new capabilities expected expand the user base the early pharmaceutical research and 
development process while also helping further penetrate the biopharmaceuticals food cosmetics and general toxicology markets 
are now finalizing the development version gastroplus which will add number new capabilities and will refine and enhance some the existing 
capabilities the program including intramuscular dosing simulation antibody drug conjugates additional animal physiologies enhanced report generation 
and enhancements the pbpk tissue models expect release version before the end calendar year 
dddplus 
dddplus simulates vitro laboratory experiments that measure the rate dissolution drug and desired the additives excipients particular 
dosage form powder tablet capsule under variety experimental conditions this unique software program used formulation scientists 
industry and the fda understand the physical mechanisms affecting the dissolution rate for various formulations reduce the number cut and try 
attempts design new drug formulations and design vitro dissolution experiments better mimic vivo animal and human conditions version 
dddplus which adds number significant enhancements was released april this version adds new formulation types controlled release bilayer 
tablet delayed release coated tablet and immediate release coated beads expanded formulation specification options biorelevant solubilities and surfactant 
effects dissolution tablet compression and disintegration models links with gastroplus and updated licensing 
membraneplus 
membraneplus was released october similar dddplus membraneplus simulates laboratory experiments but this case the experiments are for 
measuring permeability drug like molecules through various membranes including several different standard cell cultures caco mdck well 
artificially formulated membranes pampa the value such simulation derives from the fact that when the permeabilities the same molecules are 
measured different laboratories using supposedly the same experimental conditions the results are often significantly different these differences are 
caused complex interplay factors how the experiment was set and run membraneplus simulates these experiments with their specific experimental 
details and this enables scientists better interpret how results from specific experimental protocols can used predict permeability human and animals 
which the ultimate goal few initial sales membraneplus have been made similar dddplus ten years ago this program new concept that requires 
educating scientists how and why use and our marketing and sales program has been tasked with providing that training 
pkplus 
august announced the release new standalone software product called pkplus based the internal pkplus module gastroplus that 
has been available since the pkplus module gastroplus provides quick and easy fitting compartmental pharmacokinetic models well 
noncompartmental analysis nca for intravenous and extravascular oral dermal ocular pulmonary etc doses however the pkplus module gastroplus 
was not designed meet all the requirements for performing these analyses for phase and clinical trials and producing report quality output for regulatory 
submissions the new standalone pkplus program has been developed provide the full level functionality needed pharmaceutical industry scientists 
perform the analyses and generate the outputs needed fully satisfy regulatory agency requirements for both nca and compartmental modeling believe 
the potential number eventual users for pkplus the thousands world wide and that has the potential eventually become one our leading revenue 
producers 
admet predictor 
admet absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity predictor chemistry based computer program that takes molecular structures 
drawings molecules represented various formats inputs and predicts approximately different properties for them average rate over 
compounds per hour modern laptop computer this capability allows chemists generate estimates for large number important molecular properties 
without the need synthesize and test the molecules well generate estimates unknown properties for molecules that have been synthesized but for 
which only limited number experimental properties have been measured thus chemist can assess the likely success large number existing 
molecules company chemical library well molecules that have never been made providing their molecular structures either drawing them 
using tool such our medchem designer software automatically generating large numbers molecules using various computer algorithms including 
those embedded our medchem studio software 
admet predictor has been top ranked for predictive accuracy multiple peer reviewed independent comparison studies while generating its results high 
throughput rate although the state the art this type software does not enable identifying the best molecule series does allow early screening 
molecules that are highly likely fail potential drug candidates the worst molecules which usually the majority chemical library before 
synthesizing and testing them thus millions virtual compounds can created and screened day compared potentially months years work 
actually synthesize and test much smaller number actual compounds 
the most recent release admet predictor version was released august this new version features completely redesigned and modernized 
interface well number new capabilities enhance the performance and user friendliness the program addition have integrated number 
medchem studio features into the new admet predictor and created tighter integration between the two programs when medchem studio license 
obtained along with admet predictor license 
the optional admet modeler module admet predictor enables scientists use their own experimental data quickly create proprietary high quality 
predictive models using the same powerful machine learning methods use build our top ranked property predictions pharmaceutical companies expend 
substantial time and money conducting wide variety experiments new molecules each year generating large databases experimental data using this 
proprietary data build predictive models can provide second return their investment however model building has traditionally been difficult and tedious 
activity performed specialists the automation admet modeler makes easy for scientist create very powerful models with minimal training 
potential new markets for machine learning 
are currently investigating applications our sophisticated machine learning engine outside our normal pharmaceutical markets date have 
conducted several proof concept studies including building predictive models for missile aerodynamic force and moment coefficients function 
missile geometry mach number and angle attack classifying identifying missiles and other objects from radar tracking data mapping jet engine 
compressor performance predict when maintenance might required and classifying patients healthy experiencing some disease state genetic 
disorder evidenced magnetic resonance imaging mri the brain other potential applications for this modeling engine have also been identified however 
our focus date has been primarily these areas 
believe our proprietary machine learning software engine has wide variety potential applications and intend pursue funding develop customized 
tools further monetize our investment this technology expanding our markets beyond the life sciences and chemistry addition are examining 
variety expanded capabilities add the basic modeling engine accommodate even larger data sets big data analytics and new applications 
medchem designer 
medchem designer was launched was initially molecule drawing program sketcher but now has capabilities exceeding those other 
molecule drawing programs because its integration with both medchem studio and admet predictor provide medchem designer for free because 
believe that the long run will help increase demand for admet predictor and medchem studio and because most other existing molecule drawing 
programs are also provided for free our free version includes small set admet predictor best class property predictions allowing the chemist modify 
molecular structures and then see few key properties very quickly with paid admet predictor license the chemist would see the entire approximately 
predictions that are available over copies medchem designer have been downloaded scientists around the world date 
when used with license for admet predictor medchem designer becomes novo molecule design tool with researcher can draw one more 
molecular structures then click the admet predictor icon and have properties for each structure calculated seconds including our 
proprietary admet risk index researchers can also click icon generate the likely metabolites molecule and then predict all the properties 
those metabolites from admet predictor including each their admet risk scores this important because metabolite molecule can 
therapeutically beneficial harmful even though the parent molecule not 
our proprietary admet risk score provides single number that tells the chemist how many default threshold values for various predicted properties were 
crossed violated each structure thus single number the chemist can instantly compare the effects different structural changes many 
dimensions the ideal score zero however low score greater than zero might acceptable depending what property caused the points 
assigned the number too high greater than the molecule not likely successful drug the default rules can modified and new rules 
can added the user include any desired rule set based any combination calculated descriptors predicted properties and user inputs chemists 
attempt modify structures improve one property they often cause others become unacceptable without admet risk the chemist would have 
individually examine many key properties for each new molecule and its metabolites determine whether any them became unacceptable result 
changing the structure 
medchem studio 
medchem studio powerful software tool that used both for data mining and for novo design new molecules its data mining role medchem studio 
facilitates searching large chemical libraries find molecules that contain identified substructures and enables rapid identification clusters classes 
molecules that share common substructures medchem studio version was released during fiscal year have now merged medchem studio with 
the refactoring admet predictor that either program can entered through the same interface and the communication between the two programs 
enhanced through the seamless integration both technologies believe this will enhance the attractiveness both admet predictor and medchem studio 
medicinal and computational chemists 
while medchem designer can used refine small number molecules medchem studio can used create and screen with admet predictor very 
large numbers molecules down few promising lead candidates medchem studio has features that enable generate new molecular structures using 
variety novo design methods when medchem studio used with admet predictor and medchem designer the combination which refer our 
admet design suite believe the programs provide unmatched capability for chemists search through large libraries compounds that have 
undergone high throughput screening experiments find the most promising classes groups molecules with large common part their structures and 
molecules that are active against particular target addition medchem studio can take interesting but not acceptable molecule and using variety 
design algorithms quickly generate many thousands millions high quality analogs similar new molecules these molecules can then screened using 
admet predictor find molecules that are predicted both active against the target and acceptable variety admet properties demonstrated 
the power the admet design suite during two nce new chemical entity projects wherein designed lead molecules inhibit the growth the 
plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite one study and lead molecules that were combined cox and cox inhibitors each case announced ahead 
time that were attempting this and reported the results when the projects were complete every molecule designed and had synthesized hit 
their targets both projects

contract research and consulting services 
our scientists and engineers have expertise drug absorption via various dosing routes oral intravenous ocular nasal pulmonary and dermal 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics they have been speakers presenters over scientific meetings worldwide the past four years 
frequently conduct contracted consulting studies for large customers including the five largest pharmaceutical companies who have particularly difficult 
problems and who recognize our expertise solving them well for smaller customers who prefer have studies run our scientists rather than license 
our software and train someone use the demand for our consulting services has been steadily increasing and have expanded our consulting teams 
meet the increased workload 
closed five year consulting agreement with major research foundation implement platform for coordinating the data generated global teams 
engaged model based drug development and began work the project 
currently are working with the fda three different research collaboration agreements rcas the two funded efforts for the ocular model and longacting injectable microspheres and the unfunded ivivc effort all described above under gastroplus also successfully completed the fifth year our fiveyear renewable collaboration with the center for food safety and nutrition the fda develop predictive toxicity models for food additives and contaminants 
pharmacometric modeling 
have reputation for high quality analyses and regulatory reporting data collected during preclinical experiments well clinical trials new and 
existing pharmaceutical products typically working drug projects per year the model based analysis clinical trial data that perform different 
from the modeling analysis offered gastroplus the former relies more statistical and semi mechanistic models whereas the latter relies very detailed 
mechanistic models statistical models rely direct observation and mathematical equations that are used fit data collected across multiple studies along with 
describing the variability within and between patients mechanistic models are based detailed understanding the human body and the chemistry the 
drug and involve mathematical and scientific representation the phenomena involved drug dissolution precipitation absorption distribution metabolism and 
elimination collectively the models guide drug formulation design and dose selection 
because the synergies achieved through the integration our buffalo division cognigen into simulations plus our first full fiscal year combined 
operations resulted significantly increased revenues and earnings our clinical pharmacometricians buffalo supported our consulting team california 
are learning use the pbpk modeling capabilities gastroplus and are performing such studies under new and expanded contracts with pharmaceutical 
customers

competition 
our pharmaceutical software and services business compete against number established companies that provide screening testing and research 
services and products that are not based simulation software there are also software companies whose products not compete directly with but are 
sometimes closely related ours our competitors this field include some companies with financial personnel research and marketing resources that are 
larger than ours our management believes there currently significant competitive threat gastroplus however spite high barrier entry one 
could developed over time our new pkplus software product will compete with one major and few minor software programs however the capabilities and 
design features pkplus along with more affordable licensing are expected generate significant interest medchem studio medchem designer and 
admet predictor admet modeler operate more competitive environment several other companies presently offer simulation modeling software 
simulation software based services the pharmaceutical industry 
major pharmaceutical companies conduct drug discovery and development efforts through their internal development staffs and through outsourcing smaller 
companies generally need outsource greater percentage this research thus compete not only with other software suppliers but also with the inhouse development teams some the larger pharmaceutical companies 
although competitive products exist both new licenses and license renewals for gastroplus have continued grow believe that enjoy significant 
market share this segment believe that the success our two nce projects which successfully designed synthesized and tested new lead 
molecules treat malaria well cox cox will further promote the abilities our admet design suite for rapid and cost effective design lead 
compounds expect the completely refactored admet predictor version with its fresh look and expanded features will generate increased interest 
drug discovery and early drug development teams 
believe the key factors our ability successfully compete this field are our ability continue invest research and development and develop 
and support industry leading simulation and modeling software and related products and services effectively predict activities and admet related behaviors
