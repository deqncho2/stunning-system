our success depends part upon the deployment our vocera communication solution new hospital customers the expansion and upgrade our solution 
existing customers and our ability continue provide timely basis cost effective solutions that meet the requirements our hospital customers our 
vocera communication solution requires substantial upfront investment customers typically our hospital customers initially deploy our solution for specific 
users specific departments before expanding our solution into other departments for other users the cost the initial deployment depends the number 
users and departments involved the size and age the hospital and the condition the existing wireless infrastructure any within the hospital 
even hospital personnel determine that our vocera communication solution provides compelling benefits over their existing communications methods their 
hospitals may not have may not willing spend the resources necessary install and maintain wireless infrastructure initially deploy and support our 
solution expand our solution other departments users hospitals face significant budget constraints from unpredictable patient population trends and 
commercial reimbursements and increasing demands from and competition for patients addition both governmental and commercial hospitals are 
experiencing lower medicare reimbursement rates and higher compliance demands and penalties from the implementation the patient protection and affordable

new interpretations existing regulations could adversely affect spending information technology and capital equipment reducing funding changing 
healthcare pricing delivery creating 
table contents 
impediments for obtaining healthcare reimbursements which together with declining admission trends could cause our sales decline and negatively impact our 
business for example the profit margins our hospital customers are modest and pending changes reimbursement for healthcare costs may reduce the overall 
solvency our customers cause further deterioration their financial business condition 
since three significant bills were signed into law that impact the healthcare system those bills include the health information technology for 
economic and clinical health act enacted under title xiii the american recovery and reinvestment act hitech act the aca and the health 
care and education reconciliation act together these acts drive substantive changes over several years the operating processes reimbursements and 
rules governing the healthcare system further the president the united states and members the legislature have stated their intent significantly revise 
repeal the aca uncertainty surrounding the status the aca and its regulations may impact the spending our healthcare customers and cannot predict 
the effect our business any new legislation and regulations that may adopted the aca significantly changed repealed 
believe that our healthcare customers are unsure the impact that number the elements those acts well the related efforts reform repeal the 
aca will have their business and cannot predict the timing and requirements the final rules issued the department health and human services 
hhs for these statutes making managing their business operations more difficult further has been experienced since rules and agency guidance 
pursuant these statutes are implemented and revised hhs number aspects the acts have been interpreted modified delayed for example sudden 
changes the rules for individuals buying insurance through state federal health insurance exchanges and individual and employer mandates have and offer 
insurance coverage have challenged hospitals abilities forecast patient utilization and revenues and set operational plans and budget accordingly 
federal budget activities also impact our customers believe that likely that additional legislative changes congress and rulemaking hhs will 
continue our customers include healthcare facilities run the department defense and the department veterans affairs these potential customers 
have been and may continue impacted budgetary and legislative actions 
addition many state governments are changing expanding their healthcare laws adding additional complexity understanding the potential impacts 
are unable predict the full impact these new and changing rules our hospital customers and others the healthcare industry impacts these rules 
have affected and could continue affect materially our customers ability budget for purchase our products the healthcare industry has changed

customers may choose solutions that are not hipaa compliant given their budget constraints 
while not currently have directly comparable single competitor that provides solution richly featured the vocera communication system for the 
healthcare market could face such competition the future potential competitors the healthcare communications markets include large multinational 
companies with significantly more resources dedicate product development and sales and marketing these companies which may include electronic health

revenue recognition 
derive revenue from the sales communication badges smartphones perpetual software licenses for software that essential the functionality the 
communication badges software maintenance extended warranty and professional services also derive revenue from the sale licenses for software that 
not essential the functionality the communication badges which may include clinical integration and mobile application software well certain 
subscription based revenues including vocera care experience sales tax excluded from reported total revenue 
revenue recognized when all the below criteria are met 
there persuasive evidence that arrangement exists the form written contract amendments that contract purchase orders from third party 
delivery has occurred services have been rendered 
the price fixed determinable after evaluating the risk concession and 
collectability reasonably assured based customer creditworthiness and past history collection 
typical sales arrangement involves multiple elements such sales communications badges smartphones perpetual software licenses professional services 
and maintenance services which entitle customers unspecified upgrades bug fixes patch releases and telephone support revenue from the sale 
communication badges and perpetual software licenses recognized upon shipment delivery the customers premises the contractual provisions governing 
sales these products not include any provisions regarding acceptance performance general right return cancellation termination provisions 
adversely affecting revenue recognition revenue from the sale maintenance services software licenses recognized over the period during which the 
services are provided which generally one year revenue from professional services recognized either fixed fee basis based milestones time 
and materials basis the services are provided both which generally take place over period two twelve weeks but may take longer depending the 
complexity the work involved 
also derive revenue from the provision hosted services subscription basis revenue from these products recognized ratably over the term the 
arrangement 
arrangements with multiple deliverables assuming all other revenue criteria are met recognize revenue for individual delivered items they have value 
the customer standalone basis allocate arrangement consideration the inception the arrangement all deliverables using the relative selling price 
method this method requires determine the selling price which each deliverable could sold were sold regularly standalone basis when 
available use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe the selling price vsoe represents the price charged for deliverable when sold separately 
for deliverable not yet being sold separately the price established management with the relevant authority have established vsoe the selling price for 
our software maintenance when vsoe selling price not available third party evidence tpe selling price for similar products and services acceptable 
however our offerings and market strategy differ from those our competitors such that cannot obtain sufficient comparable information about third parties 
prices neither vsoe nor tpe are available use our best estimates selling prices besp determine besp considering factors such market 
conditions sales channels internal costs and product margin objectives and pricing practices regularly review and update our vsoe and besp information 
the relative selling price method allocates total arrangement consideration proportionally each deliverable the basis its estimated selling price addition 
the amount recognized for any delivered items cannot exceed that which contingent upon delivery any remaining deliverables the arrangement 
for non essential software arrangements with multiple deliverables including license professional services and maintenance recognize license revenue using 
the residual method accounting pursuant relevant software revenue recognition guidance under the residual method revenue recognized when vsoe for 
fair value exists for all the undelivered elements the arrangement but does not exist for one more the delivered elements the arrangement evidence 
fair value cannot established for the undelivered elements all the revenue deferred until evidence fair value can established until the items for 
which evidence fair value cannot established are delivered have established vsoe for software maintenance which refer maintenance and 
support our revenue arrangements not include general right return relative the delivered products apply the combined services approach for 
arrangements which have vsoe for software maintenance but not for professional services under this approach ratably recognize revenue over the 
longer the period over which professional services expected delivered the software maintenance period

component for remaining service obligations based relative present value the difference between the amount proceeds allocated the net investment 
lease and the carrying value the net investment lease included product revenue proceeds allocated the executory cost component are accounted for 
initially financing liabilities with subsequent amortization recorded revenue for maintenance extended warranty and battery refresh programs offset

product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge specific product failures any the specific product warranty includes parts and 
labor over period generally ranging from one three years provide warranty for software regularly assess our estimates evaluate the adequacy 
the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts necessary the total warranty expense under our standard warranty was million compared

stock based compensation 
stock options 
record all stock based awards which consist stock option grants fair value the grant date and recognize the expense over the requisite service period 
generally over the vesting period the award the expenses relating these awards have been reflected our financial statements stock options granted our 
employees vest over periods months stock options were issued during the year ended december 
use the black scholes option pricing model calculate the fair value stock options their grant date this model requires the following major inputs the 
estimated fair value the underlying common stock the expected life the option the expected volatility the underlying common stock over the expected life 
the option the risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield the following assumptions were used for each respective period for employee stock based 
compensation

volatility group comparable companies for the same expected term our options the comparable companies were selected based industry and market 
capitalization data assumed the dividend yield zero have never declared paid dividends and not expect the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation expense recognized based straight line amortization method over the respective vesting period the award and has been 
reduced for estimated forfeitures estimated the expected forfeiture rate based our historical experience considering voluntary termination behaviors trends

goodwill and intangible assets 
allocate the purchase price any acquisitions tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price 
recorded goodwill the allocation the purchase price requires management make significant estimates determining the fair values assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed especially with respect intangible assets these estimates are based information obtained from management the acquired companies 
and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited the cash flows that asset expected generate the future and the cost savings 
expected derived from acquiring asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and different estimates were used the purchase price 
for the acquisition could allocated the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that have made addition unanticipated events and 
circumstances may occur which affect the accuracy validity such estimates and such events occur may required record charge against the value 
ascribed acquired asset increase the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 
goodwill 
goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level least annually more often events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not recoverable our annual assessment date october and the results our assessment performed october indicated impairment had been 
incurred impairment was recorded december changes circumstances indicate that goodwill carrying values may 
not recoverable application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment circumstances that could affect the valuation goodwill include among other 
things significant change our business climate and the buying habits our customers along with changes the costs provide our products and services 
intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives upon completion development acquired process research and development assets are 
generally considered amortizable finite lived assets and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
finite lived intangible assets consist customer relationships developed technology trademarks backlog and non compete agreements evaluate our 
intangible assets for impairment the asset group level which means the intangibles grouped with other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities management has concluded that our asset groups align with our 
reporting units the intangible assets are allocated the product and services asset groups given that the product and services asset groups are the lowest level 
for which discrete cash flow information are identifiable independent from other assets assess the recoverability these assets whenever adverse events 
changes circumstances business climate indicate that expected undiscounted future cash flows related such intangible assets may not sufficient 
support the net book value such assets impairment recognized the period identification the extent the carrying amount asset exceeds the fair 
value such asset impairment intangible assets was recorded 
significant judgments required assessing the impairment goodwill and intangible assets include the identification reporting units identifying whether 
events changes circumstances require impairment assessment estimating future cash flows determining appropriate discount and growth rates and other 
assumptions changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value whether impairment exists and the 
amount that impairment 
income taxes

value follows level observable inputs such quoted prices active markets level inputs other than the quoted prices active markets that are 
observable either directly indirectly and level unobservable inputs which there little market data which requires the company develop its own 
assumptions this hierarchy requires the company use observable market data when available and minimize the use unobservable inputs when 
determining fair value for the years ended december and there have been transfers between level and level fair value instruments 
and transfers out level 
the company money market funds are classified within level the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices the fair value 
the company level fixed income securities are obtained from independent pricing services which may use quoted market prices for identical comparable 
instruments model driven valuations using observable market data other inputs corroborated observable market data the company does not have any 
financial instruments which are valued using level inputs
