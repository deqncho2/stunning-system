represent significant portion our revenue for the foreseeable future 
most our solutions require substantial upfront investment new customers the cost the initial deployment depends the number users and 
departments involved the size and age the hospital and the condition the existing wireless infrastructure any within the hospital even hospital personnel 
determine that our solutions provide compelling benefits over their existing communications methods their hospitals may not have may not willing spend 
the resources necessary install and maintain wireless infrastructure initially deploy and support our solutions expand our solutions other departments 
users hospitals face significant budget constraints from unpredictable patient population trends and commercial reimbursements and increasing demands from 
and competition for patients addition both governmental and commercial hospitals are experiencing lower medicare reimbursement rates and higher 
compliance demands and penalties from the implementation the patient protection and affordable care act aca and now face uncertainty the 
president the united states and members the legislature have announced their intention attempt repeal reform the aca well other healthcare 
reform consequence may experience slowdowns and deferral orders for our solutions that could negatively impact our sales might not able 
sustain increase our revenue from sales our solutions achieve the growth rates that envision hospitals continue face significant budgetary 
constraints and reduce their spending communications systems

our sales cycle can lengthy and unpredictable which may cause our revenue and operating results fluctuate significantly 
our sales cycles can lengthy and unpredictable our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits our solutions including the 
technical capabilities our solutions and the potential cost savings and productivity gains achievable deploying them customers typically undertake 
significant evaluation process which frequently involves not only our solutions but also their existing communications methods and those our competitors and 
can result lengthy sales cycle nine twelve months more spend substantial time effort and money our sales efforts without any assurance that our 
efforts will produce sales similarly our increasing dependence larger hospital wide deployments may increase fluctuations our revenue and operating 
results because the failure complete significant sale the loss large customer will have greater

developments the healthcare industry and governing regulations have negatively affected and may continue negatively affect our business 
substantially all our revenue derived from customers the healthcare industry particular hospitals the healthcare industry highly regulated and 
subject changing political legislative regulatory and other influences developments generally affecting the healthcare industry including new regulations 
new interpretations existing regulations could adversely affect spending information technology and capital equipment reducing funding changing 
healthcare pricing delivery creating impediments for obtaining healthcare reimbursements which together with declining admission trends could cause our 
sales decline and negatively impact our business for example the margins our hospital customers are modest and pending changes reimbursement for 
healthcare costs may reduce the overall solvency our customers cause further deterioration their financial business condition 
since three significant bills were signed into law that impact the healthcare system those bills include the health information technology for 
economic and clinical health act enacted under title xiii the american recovery and reinvestment act hitech act the aca and the health 
care and education reconciliation act together these acts drive substantive changes over several years the operating processes reimbursements and 
rules governing the healthcare system further the president the united states and members the legislature have stated their intent significantly revise 
repeal reduce funding under the aca uncertainty surrounding the status the aca and its regulations may impact the spending our healthcare customers 
and cannot predict the effect our business any new legislation and regulations that may adopted the aca significantly changed repealed 
believe that our healthcare customers are unsure the impact that number the elements those acts well the related efforts reform repeal the 
aca will have their business and cannot predict the timing and requirements the final rules issued the department health and human services 
hhs for these statutes making managing their business operations more difficult further has been experienced since rules and agency guidance 
pursuant these statutes are implemented and revised hhs number aspects the acts have been interpreted modified delayed for example sudden 
changes the rules for individuals buying insurance through state federal health insurance exchanges and individual and employer mandates have and offer 
insurance coverage have challenged hospitals abilities forecast patient utilization and revenues and set operational plans and budget accordingly 
federal budget activities also impact our customers believe that likely that additional legislative changes congress and rulemaking hhs will 
continue our customers include healthcare facilities run the department defense and the department veterans affairs during the year ended 
december generated approximately our revenue from these customers these customers have been and may continue impacted 
budgetary and legislative actions 
addition many state governments are changing expanding their healthcare laws adding additional complexity understanding the potential impacts 
are unable predict the full impact these new and changing rules our hospital customers and others the healthcare industry impacts these rules 
have affected and could continue affect materially our customers ability budget for purchase our products the healthcare industry has changed 
significantly recent years and expect that significant changes will continue occur cannot provide assurance that the markets for our solutions will 
continue exist current levels that will have adequate technical financial and marketing resources react changes those markets

operating results could harmed 
believe that the primary competition for our solutions has consisted traditional methods using wired and wireless phones pagers and overhead intercoms 
while believe that our system superior these legacy methods our solutions require significant infrastructure investment hospital and many hospitals 
spending severely constrained other priorities 
manufacturers and distributors product categories such cellular phones smartphone applications pagers mobile radios and building wireless telephones 
also sell their products hospitals components communication solutions these product categories building wireless telephones and pagers represent 
the most significant current competition for the sale our solutions the market for building wireless phones dominated communications companies such 
cisco systems ascom and spectralink addition the growing proliferation smartphones and related applications including cloud based applications 
represents another category competitive offerings while consider secure text messaging using smartphones feature valued many customers not 
believe most our potential customers would consider that feature alone adequate substitute for comprehensive multi mode communication solution some 
customers may choose solutions that are not hipaa compliant given their budget constraints furthermore clinical integrations and middleware compete 
with companies including connexall and philips healthcare 
table contents 
while not currently have directly comparable single competitor that provides solution richly featured the vocera communication and workflow 
system for the healthcare market could face such competition the future potential competitors the healthcare communications markets include large 
multinational companies with significantly more resources dedicate product development and sales and marketing these companies which may include 
electronic health record vendors other large software companies may have existing relationships within the hospital which may enhance their ability gain 
foothold our market for example some the electronic health record vendors have started offer secure text messaging additional service customers 
may prefer purchase more highly integrated bundled solution from single provider existing supplier rather than new supplier regardless 
performance features accordingly fail effectively respond competitive pressures could experience pricing pressure reduced profit margins

could differ materially from the amounts reported based these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described note the notes our consolidated financial statements included item financial 
statements and supplementary data believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used 
the preparation our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
derive revenue from the sales communication badges smartphones perpetual software licenses for software that essential the functionality the 
badges software maintenance extended warranty and professional services also derive revenue from the sale licenses for software that not essential 
the functionality the badges which may include clinical integration and mobile application software well certain subscription based revenues including 
vocera care experience sales tax excluded from reported total revenue 
revenue recognized when all the below criteria are met 
there persuasive evidence that arrangement exists the form written contract amendments that contract purchase orders from third party 
delivery has occurred services have been rendered 
the price fixed determinable after evaluating the risk concession and 
collectability reasonably assured based customer creditworthiness and past history collection 
typical sales arrangement involves multiple elements such sales badges smartphones perpetual software licenses professional services and maintenance 
services which entitle customers unspecified upgrades bug fixes patch releases and telephone support revenue from the sale communication badges and 
perpetual software licenses recognized upon shipment delivery the customers premises the contractual provisions governing sales these products 
not include any provisions regarding acceptance performance general right return cancellation termination provisions adversely affecting revenue 
recognition revenue from the sale maintenance services software licenses recognized over the period during which the services are provided which 
generally one year revenue from professional services recognized either fixed fee basis based milestones time and materials basis the services 
are provided both which generally take place over period two twelve weeks but may take longer depending the complexity the work involved 
also derive revenue from the provision hosted services subscription basis revenue from these products recognized ratably over the term the 
arrangement 
arrangements with multiple deliverables assuming all other revenue criteria are met recognize revenue for individual delivered items they have value 
the customer standalone basis allocate arrangement consideration the inception the arrangement all deliverables using the relative selling price 
method this method requires determine the selling price which each deliverable could sold were sold regularly standalone basis when 
available use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe the selling price vsoe represents the price charged for deliverable when sold separately 
for deliverable not yet being sold separately the price established management with the relevant authority have established vsoe the selling price for 
our software maintenance when vsoe selling price not available third party evidence tpe selling price for similar products and services acceptable 
however our offerings and market strategy differ from those our competitors such that cannot obtain sufficient comparable information about third parties 
prices neither vsoe nor tpe are available use our best estimates selling prices besp determine besp considering factors such market 
conditions sales channels internal costs and product margin objectives and pricing practices regularly review and update our vsoe and besp information 
table contents 
the relative selling price method allocates total arrangement consideration proportionally each deliverable the basis its estimated selling price addition 
the amount recognized for any delivered items cannot exceed that which contingent upon delivery any remaining deliverables the arrangement 
for non essential software arrangements with multiple deliverables including license professional services and maintenance recognize license revenue using 
the residual method accounting pursuant relevant software revenue recognition guidance under the residual method revenue recognized when vsoe for 
fair value exists for all the undelivered elements the arrangement but does not exist for one more the delivered elements the arrangement evidence 
fair value cannot established for the undelivered elements all the revenue deferred until evidence fair value can established until the items for 
which evidence fair value cannot established are delivered have established vsoe for software maintenance which refer maintenance and 
support our revenue arrangements not include general right return relative the delivered products apply the combined services approach for 
arrangements which have vsoe for software maintenance but not for professional services under this approach ratably recognize revenue over the 
longer the period over which professional services expected delivered the software maintenance period 
portion our sales are made through multi year lease agreements with customers when these arrangements are considered sales type leases upon delivery 
leased products customers recognize revenue for such products amount equal the net present value the minimum lease payments unearned 
income recognized part product revenue under the effective interest method recognize revenue related certain executory costs including 
maintenance and extended warranty ratable over the term the underlying arrangements recognize revenue related battery refresh executory costs when 
such executory costs are incurred 
proceeds from transfers sales type leases third party financial companies are allocated between the net investment sales type leases and the executory cost 
component for remaining service obligations based relative present value the difference between the amount proceeds allocated the net investment 
lease and the carrying value the net investment lease included product revenue proceeds allocated the executory cost component are accounted for 
initially financing liabilities with subsequent amortization recorded revenue for maintenance extended warranty and battery refresh programs offset 
interest expense 
standard product warranties 
provide for the estimated costs product warranties the time the related revenue recognized costs are estimated based historical and projected 
product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge specific product failures any the specific product warranty includes parts and 
labor over period generally ranging from one three years provide warranty for software regularly assess our estimates evaluate the adequacy 
the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts necessary the total warranty expense under our standard warranty was million compared 
million and million the key drivers the warranty reserve calculation are the installed base products under standard warranty the 
estimated return rate the installed base products under standard warranty and the availability refurbished units fulfill expected warranty claims 
stock based compensation 
stock options 
record all stock based awards which consist stock option grants fair value the grant date and recognize the expense over the requisite service period 
generally over the vesting period the award the expenses relating these awards have been reflected our financial statements stock options granted our 
employees vest over periods months stock options were issued during the year ended december and 
use the black scholes option pricing model calculate the fair value stock options their grant date this model requires the following major inputs the 
estimated fair value the underlying common stock the expected life the option the expected volatility the underlying common stock over the expected life 
the option the risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield the following assumptions were used for each respective period for employee stock based 
compensation

base the risk free rate for the expected term options the treasury constant maturity rate the grant date the computation expected life was 
determined based the historical exercise and forfeiture behavior our employees giving consideration the contractual terms the stock based awards 
vesting schedules and expectations future employee behavior the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated based the historical 
volatility group comparable companies for the same expected term our options the comparable companies were selected based industry and market 
capitalization data assumed the dividend yield zero have never declared paid dividends and not expect the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation expense recognized based straight line amortization method over the respective vesting period the award for the year ended 
december the straight line amortization reduced actual forfeitures for the years ended december and the straight line amortization 
has been reduced for estimated forfeitures estimated the expected forfeiture rate based our historical experience considering voluntary termination 
behaviors trends actual award forfeitures and other events that will impact the forfeiture rate the extent our actual forfeiture rate different from our 
estimate the stock based compensation expense adjusted accordingly 
restricted stock units 
addition stock options also issue restricted stock units our employees which vest one third the first anniversary the grant one third the second 
anniversary the grant and one third upon the third anniversary the grant the grant date fair value the rsus the closing market price the date grant 
this amount charged expense ratably over the requisite service period 
goodwill and intangible assets 
allocate the purchase price any acquisitions tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired any residual purchase price 
recorded goodwill the allocation the purchase price requires management make significant estimates determining the fair values assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed especially with respect intangible assets these estimates are based information obtained from management the acquired companies 
and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited the cash flows that asset expected generate the future and the cost savings 
expected derived from acquiring asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and different estimates were used the purchase price 
for the acquisition could allocated the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that have made addition unanticipated events and 
circumstances may occur which affect the accuracy validity such estimates and such events occur may required record charge against the value 
ascribed acquired asset increase the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 
goodwill 
goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level least annually more often events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not recoverable our annual assessment date october and the results our assessment performed october indicated impairment had been 
incurred impairment was recorded december changes circumstances indicate that goodwill carrying values may 
not recoverable application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment circumstances that could affect the valuation goodwill include among other 
things significant change our business climate and the buying habits our customers along with changes the costs provide our products and services 
intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives upon completion development acquired process research and development assets are 
generally considered amortizable finite lived assets and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
finite lived intangible assets consist customer relationships developed technology trademarks backlog and non compete agreements evaluate our 
intangible assets for impairment the asset group level which means the intangibles grouped with other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities management has concluded that our asset groups align with our 
reporting units the intangible assets are allocated the product and services asset groups given that the product and services asset groups are the lowest level 
for which discrete cash flow information are identifiable independent from other assets assess the recoverability these assets whenever adverse events 
changes circumstances business climate indicate that expected undiscounted future cash flows related such intangible assets may not sufficient 
support the net book value such assets impairment recognized the period identification the extent the carrying amount asset exceeds the fair 
value such asset impairment intangible assets was recorded 
significant judgments required assessing the impairment goodwill and intangible assets include the identification reporting units identifying whether 
events changes circumstances require impairment assessment estimating future cash flows

fair value whether impairment exists and the amount that impairment 
income taxes

value follows level observable inputs such quoted prices active markets level inputs other than the quoted prices active markets that are 
observable either directly indirectly and level unobservable inputs which there little market data which requires the company develop its own 
assumptions this hierarchy requires the company use observable market data when available and minimize the use unobservable inputs when 
determining fair value for the years ended december and there have been transfers between level and level fair value instruments 
and transfers out level 
the company money market funds are classified within level the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices the fair value 
the company level fixed income securities are obtained from independent pricing services which may use quoted market prices for identical comparable 
instruments model driven valuations using observable market data other inputs corroborated observable market data the company does not have any 
financial instruments which are valued using level inputs
