regulation and licenses 
health care area extensive regulatory oversight and frequent regulatory change the federal government 
and the states which operate regulate various aspects our business these regulatory bodies among other 
things require annually license our skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities some states and other 
health care businesses including home health operate nursing facilities and provide health care services must 
comply with federal state and local laws relating the delivery and adequacy medical care distribution 
pharmaceuticals equipment personnel operating policies fire prevention rate setting building codes and 
environmental protection 
governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies 
assure that continue comply with their various standards must pass these inspections continue our 
licensing under state law obtain certification under the medicare and medicaid programs and continue our 
participation the veterans administration program can only participate other third party programs our 
facilities pass these inspections addition these authorities inspect our record keeping and inventory control 
from time time like others the health care industry may receive notices from federal and state 
regulatory agencies alleging that failed comply with applicable standards these notices may require take 
corrective action and may impose civil money penalties and other operating restrictions our skilled nursing 
facilities and home health agencies fail comply with these directives otherwise fail comply substantially with 
licensure and certification laws rules and regulations could lose our certification medicare and medicaid 
provider and lose our licenses 
local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities specific their location 
regulate varying degrees our assisted living facilities although regulations and licensing requirements vary 
significantly from state state they typically address among other things personnel education training and records 
facility services including administration medication assistance with supervision medication management and 
limited nursing services physical plant specifications furnishing resident units food and housekeeping services 
emergency evacuation plans and resident rights and responsibilities assisted living facilities fail comply with 
licensing requirements these facilities could lose their licenses most states also subject assisted living facilities 
state local building codes fire codes and food service licensure certification requirements addition the 
manner and extent which the assisted living industry regulated federal and state levels are evolving 
changes the laws new interpretations existing laws applied the skilled nursing facilities the 
assisted living facilities other components our health care businesses may have significant impact our 
operations 
all states which operate before skilled nursing facility can make capital expenditure exceeding 
certain specified amounts construct any new skilled health care beds approval the state health care regulatory 
agency agencies must obtained and certificate need issued the appropriate state health planning agency 
must review the certificate need according state specific guidelines before certificate need can issued 
certificate need generally issued for specific maximum amount expenditure and the project must 
completed within specific time period there advance assurance that will able obtain certificate 
need any instance some states approval also necessary order purchase existing health care beds 
although the purchaser normally permitted avoid full scale certificate need application procedure giving 
advance written notice the acquisition and giving written assurance the state regulatory agency that the change 
ownership will not result change the number beds services offered and some cases reimbursement 
rates the facility 
while there are currently significant legislative proposals eliminate certificates need pertaining 
skilled nursing care the states which business deregulation the certificate need area would likely 
result increased competition and could adversely affect occupancy rates and the supply licensed and certified 
personnel 
medicare and medicaid participation 
all health care centers owned leased managed are certified participate medicare all but eight 
seven owned and one managed our affiliated nursing centers participate medicaid all our homecares 
participate medicare which comprises the majority their revenue homecares also participate medicaid 
during the fiscal years received payments from medicare and participating from medicaid record 
receivables the amounts ultimately expect receive under the medicare and medicaid programs and record 
into profit loss any differences amounts received the time interim final settlements adjustments have 
not had material adverse effect within the last three years 
certifications and participation requirements efforts impose reduced payments 
changes certification and participation requirements the medicare and medicaid programs have restricted 
and are likely continue restrict further eligibility for reimbursement under those programs failure obtain and 
maintain medicare and medicaid certification our nursing centers would result denial medicare and medicaid 
payments which would likely result significant loss revenue addition private payors including managed 
care payors increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting lost revenue for 
specific patients efforts impose reduced payments greater discounts and more stringent cost controls 
government and other payors are expected continue any reforms that significantly limit rates reimbursement 
under the medicare and medicaid programs could have material adverse effect our profitability and cash flows 
are unable predict what reform proposals reimbursement limitations will adopted the future the 
effect such changes will have our operations assurance can given that such reforms will not have material 
adverse effect 
medicare legislation and regulations 
federal health care reform 
march president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca 
commonly aca and the health care and education reconciliation act hcera which represents 
significant changes the current health care system collectively the acts the primary goals the acts 
are expand coverage americans without health insurance reform the delivery system improve quality

spans over several years some the provisions were effective immediately and others will phased 
through 
since significant goal federal health care reform transform the delivery health care holding 
providers accountable for the cost and quality care provided medicare and many commercial third party payors 
are implementing accountable care organization aco models which groups providers share the benefit 
and risk providing care assigned group individuals other reimbursement methodology reforms which 
are participating expect participate include value based purchasing which portion provider 
reimbursement redistributed based relative performance designated economic clinical quality and patient 
satisfaction metrics also cms implementing demonstration programs bundle acute care and post acute care 
reimbursement hold providers accountable for costs across broader continuum care these reimbursement 
methodologies and similar programs are likely continue and expand both public and commercial health plans 
providers who respond successfully these trends and can deliver quality care lower costs are likely benefit 
financially

whether any the existing provisions will remain place the potential replacement modification aca

including the medicare and medicaid programs third party payor programs are highly regulated and are subject 
frequent and substantial changes changes the reimbursement rate methods payment from third party payors 
including the medicare and medicaid programs the implementation other measures reduce reimbursements 
for our services has the past and could the future result substantial reduction our revenues and operating 
margins additionally net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and 
retroactive adjustment payors during the claims settlement processes result post payment audits payors 
may disallow requests for reimbursement based determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable 
reasonable because additional documentation necessary because certain services were not covered were not 
reasonable and medically necessary there also continue new legislative and regulatory proposals that could 
impose further limitations government and private payments health care providers some cases states have 
enacted are considering enacting measures designed reduce their medicaid expenditures and make changes 
private health care insurance cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue 
available for the services provided which are currently being reimbursed medicare medicaid private 
third party payors further limits the scope services reimbursed and reimbursement rates could have 
material adverse effect our liquidity financial condition and results operations possible that the effects 
further refinements pps that result lower payments cuts state medicaid funding could have material 
adverse effect our results operations see item business regulation and licenses and medicare 
legislation and regulations and medicaid legislation and regulations 
the affordable care act and its implementation could impact our business the affordable care act may 
continue alter the existing health care system for the delivery and financing health care significant goal 
federal health care reform transform the delivery health care changing reimbursement for health care 
services hold providers accountable for the cost and quality care provided medicare and many commercial 
third party payors are implementing aco models which groups providers share the benefit and risk 
providing care assigned group individuals lower cost other reimbursement methodology reforms include 
value based purchasing which portion provider reimbursement redistributed based relative performance 
designated economic clinical quality and patient satisfaction metrics addition cms implementing programs 
bundle acute care and post acute care reimbursement hold providers accountable for costs across broader 
continuum care these reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely continue and expand both 
public and commercial health plans providers who respond successfully these trends and can deliver quality 
care lower cost are likely benefit financially the affordable care act and the programs implemented the law 
may reduce reimbursements for our services and may impact the demand for the company products addition 
various healthcare programs and regulations may ultimately implemented the federal state level failure 
respond successfully these trends could negatively impact our business results operations and financial 
condition 
cannot predict the effect that further healthcare reform the possible repeal and replacement the 
affordable care act and other changes government programs may have our business financial condition 
results operations since the adoption the affordable care act the law has been challenged before 
the supreme court and several bills have been and continue introduced congress delay defund

ongoing litigation over the interpretation and implementation certain provisions the law furthermore 
january newly inaugurated president trump issued executive order that among other things stated that 
was the intent his administration repeal the affordable care act and pending that repeal instructed the 
executive branch the federal government defer delay the implementation any provision requirement 
the affordable care act that would impose fiscal burden any state cost fee tax penalty any individual 
family health care provider health insurer 
cannot predict whether the affordable care act will repealed replaced modified the impact that 
the president executive order will have the implementation and enforcement the provisions the affordable 
care act addition the affordable care act replaced modified cannot predict what the replacement plan 
modifications would when the replacement plan modifications would become effective whether any 
the existing provisions the affordable care act would remain place

the regulatory environment surrounding the post acute and long term care industry has intensified particularly 
for larger for profit multi facility providers like the federal government has imposed extensive enforcement 
policies resulting significant increase the number inspections citations regulatory deficiencies and other 
regulatory sanctions including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs denials payment for new

new accounting pronouncements 
see note the consolidated financial statements for the impact new accounting standards 
application critical accounting policies 
the preparation financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the 
united states america requires make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets 
and liabilities and disclosure contingent assets and liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported 
amounts revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and 
cause our reported net income vary significantly from period period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important the portrayal our financial condition and results and 
require our most difficult subjective complex judgments are follows 
revenue recognition third party payors 
medicare and medicaid program revenues well certain managed care program revenues are subject 
audit and retroactive adjustment government representatives their agents our opinion adequate provision 
has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews any differences between our original 
estimates reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected operations the period which the revisions 
are made often due final determination the period payment longer being subject audit review 
have made provisions approximately and december and 
respectively for various medicare medicaid and managed care claims reviews and current and prior year cost 
reports 
revenue recognition private pay 
for private pay patients skilled nursing assisted living facilities bill room and board charges for the 
current month with payment being due upon receipt the statement the month the services are performed charges 
for ancillary pharmacy therapy and other services private patients are billed the month following the 
performance services however all billings are recognized revenue when the services are performed 
revenue recognition subordination fees and uncertain collections 
provide management services healthcare operators and others provide accounting and financial 
services generally charge net operating revenues for our management services and predetermined fixed 
rate per bed for the accounting and financial services our policy recognize revenues associated with both 
management services and accounting and financial services accrual basis the services are provided 
however under the terms our management contracts payments for our management services are subject 
subordination other expenditures the long term care center being managed furthermore for certain the third 
parties with whom have contracted provide services and which have determined based insufficient 
historical collections and the lack expected future collections that collection not reasonably assured our policy 
recognize revenues only the period which the amounts are realized may receive payment for the unpaid 
and unrecognized management fees whole part the future only cash flows from the operating and 
investing activities the centers proceeds from the sale the centers are sufficient pay the fees there can 
assurance that such future cash flows will occur the realization such previously unrecognized revenue could 
cause our reported net income vary significantly from period period 
agree subordinate our fees the other expenses managed center because believe know how 
improve the quality patient services and finances skilled nursing assisted living facility and because 
subordinating our fees demonstrates the owner and employees the managed center how confident are the 
impact can have making the center operations successful may continue provide services certain 
managed centers despite not being fully paid currently that may able collect unpaid fees the future from 
improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services center may small 
compared the potential benefit also may benefit from providing other ancillary services the managed

both asserted and unasserted claims reassess our accrued risk reserves quarterly basis 
professional liability remains area particular concern the long term care industry has seen 
increase personal injury wrongful death claims based alleged negligence skilled nursing facilities and their 
employees providing care residents december and our managed centers are defendants 
claims remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our 
reserves which could have material adverse effect our consolidated financial position results operations and
