other specific risks include but are not limited risks relating

especially hipaa hitech and standards and requirements published industry groups such the joint commission require the use standard

with any client vendor would place violation applicable standards and requirements and could expose liability our business associates may 
interpret hipaa requirements differently than and may not able adequately address the risks created such interpretations these new

third party health care information technology suppliers with the passing the macra the congress declared national objective 
achieve widespread exchange health information through interoperable certified ehr technology nationwide december the century 
cures act which was passed and signed into law december includes numerous provisions intended encourage this nationwide interoperability 
result the century cures act the department health and human services hhs has the regulatory authority investigate and assess 
civil monetary penalties against health developers and providers found violation information blocking this new 
oversight and authority investigate claims information blocking creates significant risks for and our clients although this time hhs the office the 
national coordinator for health onc and the office the inspector general oig have yet issue regulations and guidance regarding how these 
provisions will defined and enforced the century cures act legislation also requires hhs and onc add new certification requirements related 
interoperability condition health developer achieving maintaining approved federal government certification status one these requirements 
for developer publish application programming interface api that allows health information accessed exchanged and used without special

generate revenue from sales licensing rights and subscriptions our software products hardware and third party software products support and 
maintenance services revenue cycle management and related services rcm electronic data interchange and data services edi and professional 
services such implementation training and consulting performed for clients who use our products 
generally recognize revenue provided that persuasive evidence arrangement exists fees are considered fixed determinable delivery the 
product service has occurred and collection considered probable revenue from the delivered elements such software licenses are generally 
recognized upon physical electronic delivery certain transactions where collection not considered probable the revenue deferred until collection 
occurs the fee not fixed determinable then the revenue recognized each period subject application other revenue recognition criteria will 
the lesser the aggregate amounts due and payable the amount the arrangement fee that would have been recognized the fees were being 
recognized using the residual method assess whether fees are considered fixed determinable the inception the arrangement and negotiated fees 
generally are based specific volume products delivered and not subject change based variable pricing mechanisms such the number 
units copied distributed the expected number users 
typical software licensing arrangement may contain multiple elements such software licenses support and maintenance services and professional 
services revenue from arrangements involving multiple elements generally allocated each element using the residual method when evidence fair 
value only exists for the undelivered elements the fair value element based vendor specific objective evidence vsoe which established 
based the price charged when the same element sold separately renewed generally establish vsoe for the related undelivered elements based 
the bell shaped curve method vsoe established maintenance for certain clients based stated renewal rates only the rate determined 
substantive and falls within our customary pricing practices vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed quarterly annual basis depending the

deferred until vsoe fair value the undelivered element established the element has been delivered 
revenue related arrangements that include hosting services recognized accordance the revenue recognition criteria described above only the 
client has the contractual right take possession the software any time without incurring significant penalty and feasible for the client either host 
the software its own equipment through another third party otherwise the arrangement accounted for service contract which the entire 
arrangement deferred and recognized over the period that the hosting services are being provided 
from time time offer future purchase discounts our products and services part our arrangements such discounts that are incremental the 
range discounts reflected the pricing the other elements the arrangement that are incremental the range discounts typically given 
comparable transactions and that are significant are assessed additional element the arrangement based our assessments such discounts are 
generally not considered incremental and significant revenue deferred related incremental and significant future purchase options any are not 
recognized until either the client exercises the discount offer the offer expires 
revenue from professional services including implementation training and consulting services are generally recognized the corresponding services are 
performed revenue from software related subscription services and support and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the contractual service

the amount and timing revenue recognized given period affected our judgment whether arrangement includes multiple elements and 
the allocation revenue each element generally apply the residual method for the revenue recognition our multiple element arrangements and 
estimate the fair value the undelivered elements based vsoe establishing vsoe our undelivered elements requires judgment establish vsoe 
for each undelivered element the price charged when the same element sold separately and generally evidenced when substantial majority 
historical standalone transactions fall within reasonably narrow range using the bell shaped curve method our determination vsoe also consider 
service type client type and other variables our revenue recognition based our ability maintain vsoe although not currently expected certain 
events may occur such modification lack consistency our selling and pricing practices that could result changes our determination vsoe 
vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed quarterly annual basis depending the nature the product service
