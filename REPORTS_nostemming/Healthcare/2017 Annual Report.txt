industry trends 
the post acute care industry has evolved meet the growing demand for post acute and custodial healthcare services generated aging 
population increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting patient care lower cost settings the industry has evolved recent years which 
believe has led number favorable improvements the industry described below 
shift patient care lower cost alternatives the growth the senior population the united states continues increase healthcare costs 
often faster than the available funding from government sponsored healthcare programs response federal and state governments have adopted 
cost containment measures that encourage the treatment patients more cost effective settings such skilled nursing facilities for which the 
staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals and other post acute care settings result 
skilled nursing facilities are generally serving larger population higher acuity patients than the past 
significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities the skilled nursing industry large and highly fragmented characterized predominantly 
numerous local and regional providers due the increasing demands from hospitals and insurance carriers implement sophisticated and 
expensive reporting systems believe this fragmentation provides significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities for 
improving supply and demand balance the number skilled nursing facilities has declined modestly over the past several years expect that 
the supply and demand balance the skilled nursing industry will continue improve due the shift patient care lower cost settings 
aging population and increasing life expectancies 
increased demand driven aging populations and increased life expectancy life expectancy continues increase the united states and 
seniors account for higher percentage the total population believe the overall demand for skilled nursing services will increase 
present the primary market demographic for skilled nursing services primarily individuals age and older according the census 
there were over million people the united states that are over years old the census estimates this group one the 
fastest growing segments the united states population and expected more than double between and 
accountable care organizations and reimbursement reforms significant goal federal health care reform transform the delivery health 
care changing reimbursement for health care services hold providers accountable 
for the cost and quality care provided medicare and many commercial third party payors are implementing accountable care organization 
aco models which groups providers share the benefit and risk providing care assigned group individuals other reimbursement 
methodology reforms include value based purchasing which portion provider reimbursement redistributed based relative performance 
designated economic clinical quality and patient satisfaction metrics addition cms implementing demonstration and mandatory 
programs bundle acute care and post acute care reimbursement hold providers accountable for costs across broader continuum care these 
reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely continue and expand both public and commercial health plans april

bundled payments and the end march cms announced that its target for was reached january

implemented certain revisions cjr including giving certain hospitals one time option choose whether continue participation the 
changes the final rule allow the agency engage providers future voluntary efforts including additional voluntary episode based payment 
models but removes the mandatory episode payment models 
believe the post acute industry has been and will continue impacted several other trends the use long term care insurance increasing 
among seniors means planning for the costs skilled nursing services addition result increased mobility society reduction average 
family size and the increased number two wage earner couples more seniors are looking for alternatives outside the family for their care 
effects changing prices 
medicare reimbursement rates and procedures are subject change from time time which could materially impact our revenue medicare reimburses 
our skilled nursing operations under pps for certain inpatient covered services under the pps facilities are paid predetermined amount per patient per 
day based the anticipated costs treating patients the amount paid determined classifying each patient into resource utilization group 
rug category that based upon each patient acuity level october the rug categories were expanded from with the introduction 
minimum data set mds should future changes skilled nursing facility payments reduce rates increase the standards for reaching certain 
reimbursement levels our medicare revenues could reduced and our costs provide those services could increase with corresponding adverse 
impact our financial condition results operations 
our medicare reimbursement rates and procedures for our home health and hospice operations are based the severity the patient condition his 
her service needs and other factors relating the cost providing services and supplies our home health rates and services are bundled into day 
episodes care payments can adjusted for outlier payment our patient care was unusually costly capped total reimbursement per 
provider number low utilization payment adjustment lupa the number visits during the episode was fewer than five partial payment our 
patient transferred another provider received patient from another provider before completing the episode payment adjustment based upon 
the level therapy services required with various incremental adjustments made for additional visits and larger payment increases associated with the sixth 
fourteenth and twentieth visit thresholds payment adjustment are unable perform periodic therapy assessments the number episodes 
care provided patient regardless whether the same home health provider provided care for the entire series episodes changes the base episode 
payments established the medicare program adjustments the base episode payments for case mix and geographic wages and recoveries

reconciliation act collectively the aca the reforms contained the aca have affected our operating subsidiaries some manner and are directed

methods payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment these reforms include the possible modifications the conditions 
qualification for payment bundling payments cover both acute and post acute care and the imposition enrollment limitations new providers the

cms payment rules cms proposed alternative case mix classification system for fiscal year named resident classification system 
version rcs rcs would case mix adjust for the following major cost categories physical therapy occupational therapy speech language 
pathology slp services nursing services and non therapy ancillaries ntas thus where rug consists two case mix adjusted components therapy 
and nursing rcs would create four slp nursing and nta for more resident centered case mix adjustment rcs would also maintain the 
existing non case mix component cover utilization snf resources that not vary according resident characteristics for two the case mixadjusted components and nta rcs includes variable per diem payment adjustments that modify payment based changes utilization these 
services over the course stay the proposed model will compensate snfs accurately based the complexity the particular beneficiaries they serve 
and the resources necessary caring for those beneficiaries and addresses concerns about current incentives for snfs delivery therapy beneficiaries 
based financial considerations rather than the most effective course treatment for beneficiaries the proposed rcs classification model could improve 
the snf pps basing payments predominantly clinical characteristics rather than service provision thereby enhancing payment accuracy and 
strengthening incentives for appropriate care the proposed rule expected reduce payments associated with residents the highest therapy rug 
and increase payments associated with residents who receive extensive services have high nta costs the proposed rule also simplifies the mds structure

enrollment medicare and medicaid end stage renal disease esrd having longer qualifying inpatient stay diabetes wound infections and use

reimbursement for hospice services hospice revenues are primarily derived from medicare receive one four predetermined rate categories 
based the level care furnish the beneficiary this payment designed include all the services needed manage the beneficiary care 
these rates are subject annual adjustments based inflation and geographic wage considerations its final rule cms established two tiered 
payment system for routine home care services effective january hospices are reimbursed higher rate for routine home care services provided 
from days through hospice episode care and lower rate for all subsequent days service cms also provided for service intensity add 
which increases payments for certain routine home care services provided registered nurses and social workers hospice patients during the final seven 
days life

days that can reimbursed inpatient care rate both respite and general the total number days hospice care both inpatient and the 
home that provide medicare beneficiaries payments for days excess this limit are paid the routine home care rate and must reimburse the 
government for any amounts received excess that rate 
second hospices are subject aggregate payment cap this cap amount calculated annually multiplying the number beneficiaries electing 
hospice care during the year statutory amount that indexed for inflation for cap years ended after october and all subsequent cap 
years the hospice aggregate cap calculated using the proportional method under the proportional method the hospice shall include its number 
medicare beneficiaries only that fraction which represents the portion patient total days care all hospices and all years that were spent that 
hospice that cap year using the best data available the time the calculation the whole and fractional shares medicare beneficiaries time given 
cap year are then summed compute the total number medicare beneficiaries served that hospice that cap year the hospice total medicare 
beneficiaries given cap year multiplied the medicare per beneficiary cap amount resulting that hospice aggregate cap which the allowable 
amount total medicare payments that hospice can receive for that cap year hospice exceeds its aggregate cap then the hospice must repay the excess 
back medicare the medicare cap amount reduced proportionately for patients who transferred and out our hospice services

competition 
the post acute care industry highly competitive and expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive the future the industry 
highly fragmented and characterized numerous local and regional providers addition large national providers that have achieved geographic 
diversity and economies scale our operating subsidiaries also compete with inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long term acute care hospitals 
competitiveness may vary significantly from location location depending upon factors such the number competing facilities availability 
services expertise staff and the physical appearance and amenities each location believe that the primary competitive factors the post acute care 
industry are 
ability attract and retain qualified management and caregivers 
reputation and achievements quality healthcare outcomes 
attractiveness and location facilities 
the expertise and commitment the facility management team and employees and 
community value including amenities and ancillary services 
seek compete effectively each market establishing reputation within the local community the operation choice this means that 
the operation leaders are generally free discern and address the unique needs and priorities healthcare professionals customers and other stakeholders 
the local community market and then create superior service offering and reputation for that particular community market that calculated 
encourage prospective customers and referral sources choose recommend the operation 
increased competition could limit our ability attract and retain patients maintain increase rates expand our business some our 
competitors have greater financial and other resources than have may have greater brand recognition and may more established their respective 
communities than are competing companies may also offer newer facilities different programs services than offer and may therefore attract 
individuals who are currently patients our facilities potential patients our facilities who are otherwise receiving our healthcare services other 
competitors may have lower expenses other competitive advantages than and therefore provide services lower prices than offer 
there are few barriers entry the home health and hospice business jurisdictions that not require certificates need permits approval 
our primary competition these jurisdictions comes from local privately and publicly owned and hospital owned health care providers compete based 
the availability personnel the quality services expertise visiting staff and certain instances the price our services addition 
compete with number non profit organizations that finance acquisitions and capital expenditures tax exempt basis and charity funded programs that 
may have strong ties their local medical communities and receive charitable contributions that are unavailable 
our other services such assisted living facilities and other ancillary services also compete with local regional and national companies the primary 
competitive factors these businesses are similar those for our skilled nursing facilities and include reputation cost services quality clinical 
services responsiveness patient resident needs location and the ability provide support other areas such third party reimbursement information

increase mix high acuity patients many skilled nursing facilities are serving increasingly larger population patients who require high level 
skilled nursing and rehabilitative care whom refer high acuity patients result government and other payors seeking lower cost alternatives 
traditional acute care hospitals generally receive higher reimbursement rates for providing care for these medically complex patients addition 
many these patients require therapy and other rehabilitative services which are able provide part our integrated service offerings where 
therapy services are medically necessary and prescribed patient physician other appropriate healthcare professional generally receive additional 
revenue connection with the provision those services making these integrated services available such patients and maintaining established 
clinical standards the delivery those services are able increase our overall revenues believe that can continue attract high acuity 
patients and therapy patients our facilities maintaining and enhancing our reputation for quality care and continuing our community focused approach 
focus organic growth and internal operating efficiencies plan continue grow organically focusing increasing patient occupancy 
within our existing facilities although some the facilities have acquired were good physical and operating condition the majority have been 
clinically and financially troubled with some facilities having had occupancy rates low the time acquisition additionally believe that 
incremental operating margins the last our beds are significantly higher than the first offering opportunities improve financial 
performance within our existing 
facilities our overall occupancy impacted significantly the number facilities acquired and the operational occupancy the acquisition date 
therefore consolidated occupancy will vary significantly based these factors our average occupancy rates for our skilled nursing facilities for the years 
ended december and were and respectively our average occupancy rates for our assisted and independent living 
facilities for the years ended december and were and respectively 
also believe can generate organic growth improving operating efficiencies and the quality care the patient level focusing staff 
development clinical systems and the efficient delivery quality patient care believe are able deliver higher quality care lower costs than many 
our competitors 
also have achieved incremental occupancy and revenue growth creating expanding outpatient therapy programs existing facilities 
physical occupational and speech therapy services account for significant portion revenue most our skilled nursing facilities expanding 
therapy programs provide outpatient services many markets are able increase revenue while spreading the fixed costs maintaining these 
programs over larger patient base outpatient therapy has also proven effective marketing tool raising the visibility our facilities their local 
communities and enhancing the reputation our facilities with short stay rehabilitation patients 
add new facilities and expand existing facilities key element our growth strategy includes the acquisition new and existing facilities from 
third parties and the expansion and upgrade current facilities the near term plan take advantage the fragmented skilled nursing industry 
acquiring operations within select geographic markets and may consider the construction new facilities addition have targeted facilities that 
believed were performing and operations that were underperforming and where believed could improve service delivery occupancy rates and cash 
flow with experienced leaders place the community level and demonstrated success significantly improving operating conditions acquired 
facilities believe that are well positioned for continued growth while the integration underperforming facilities generally has negative short term 
effect overall operating margins these facilities are typically accretive earnings within months following their acquisition for the 
facilities that acquired from through the aggregate ebitdar see part item selected financial data percentage revenue 
improved from during the first full three months operations during the thirteenth through fifteenth months operations 
strategically invest and integrate other post acute care healthcare businesses another important element our growth strategy includes 
acquiring new and existing home health hospice and other post acute care healthcare businesses since have steadily expanded our home health 
and hospice businesses through the acquisition smaller third party providers our strategy provide more seamless experience manage the 
transition care throughout the post acute continuum our objective simultaneously improve patient outcomes and reduce costs payers acos and

including reliance experienced local leaders the community level focus integrating these operations into the continuum care services 
provide between and february have acquired hospice agencies home health and home care agencies and are well positioned for 
continued growth these and other healthcare businesses 
labor 
the operation our skilled nursing and assisted and independent living facilities home health and hospice operations requires large number 
highly skilled healthcare professionals and support staff december had approximately full time equivalent employees who were 
employed our service center and our operating subsidiaries for the year ended december approximately our total expenses were 
payroll related periodically market forces which vary region require that increase wages excess general inflation excess increases 
reimbursement rates receive believe that staff appropriately focusing primarily the acuity level and day day needs our patients and 
residents most the states where operate our skilled nursing facilities are subject state mandated minimum staffing ratios our ability reduce 
costs decreasing staff notwithstanding decreases acuity need limited and subject government audits and penalties some states seek 
manage our labor costs improving staff retention improving operating efficiencies maintaining competitive wage rates and benefits and reducing reliance 
overtime compensation and temporary nursing agency services

would subject facility two percent reduction market basket prices then effect 
the impact act further requires hhs and the medicare payment advisory commission medpac commission chartered congress advise 
medicare payment issues study alternative pac payment models including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care 
setting with corresponding congressional reports required based such analysis the impact act also included provisions impacting medicare certified 
hospices including increasing survey frequency for medicare certified hospices once every months imposing medical review process for

january the president signed the american taxpayer relief act into law this statute delayed significant cuts medicare rates for 
physician services until december the statute also created commission long term care the goal which was develop plan for the

february the president signed into law which among other things delayed cut physician and part services 
establishing the funding for the law payments nursing facilities for patients unpaid medicare insurance was reduced the deficit reduction act 
had previously limited reimbursement bad debt privately responsibility insurance however under this reimbursement will 
reduced 
further prior the introduction were reimbursed for bad debt related dual eligible medicare patients insurance 
will phase down the dual eligible reimbursement over three years effective october medicare dual eligible insurance reimbursement 
decreased from with further reductions and october and respectively any reductions medicare 
medicaid reimbursement could materially adversely affect our profitability 
our future revenue financial condition and results operations could impacted continued cost containment pressures medicaid spending 
medicaid which largely administered the states significant payor for our skilled nursing services rapidly increasing medicaid spending 
combined with slow state revenue growth has led many states institute measures aimed controlling spending growth for example february the 
california legislature approved new budget help relieve billion budget deficit the budget package was signed after months negotiation during 
which time california governor declared fiscal state emergency california the new budget implemented spending cuts several areas including 
medi cal spending further california initially had extended its cost based medi cal long term care reimbursement system enacted through assembly bill 
through the and rate years with growth rate five percent for both years however due california severe 
budget crisis july the state passed budget balancing proposal that eliminated this five percent growth cap amending the current statute 
provide that for the and rate years the weighted 
table contents 
average medi cal reimbursement rate paid long term care facilities shall not exceed the weighted average medi cal reimbursement rate for the 
rate year addition the budget proposal increased the amounts that california nursing facilities will pay medi cal quality assurance fees for the and rate years including medicare revenue the calculation the quality assurance fee that nursing facilities pay under 
although overall reimbursement from medi cal remained stable individual facility rates varied 
california governor signed the budget trailer into law october despite its enactment these changes reimbursement long term care 
facilities were implemented retroactively the beginning the calendar quarter which california submitted its request for federal approval cms 
california governor released budget that includes billion additional medi cal funding this proposal however would not eliminate 
retroactive rate cuts for hospital based skilled nursing facilities 
because state legislatures control the amount state funding for medicaid programs cuts delays approval such funding legislatures could 
reduce the amount cause delay payment from medicaid skilled nursing facilities since significant portion our revenue generated from 
our skilled nursing operating subsidiaries california these budget reductions approved could adversely affect our net patient service revenue and 
profitability expect continuing cost containment pressures medicaid outlays for skilled nursing facilities and any such decline could adversely affect 
our financial condition and results operations 
generate funds pay for the increasing costs the medicaid program many states utilize financial arrangements such provider taxes under 
provider tax arrangements states collect taxes fees from healthcare providers and then return the revenue these providers medicaid expenditures 
congress however has placed restrictions states use provider tax and donation programs source state matching funds under the medicaid 
voluntary contribution and provider specific tax amendments the federal medical assistance percentage available state was reduced the 
total amount healthcare related taxes that the state imposed unless certain requirements are met the federal medical assistance percentage not reduced 
the state taxes are broad based and not applied specifically medicaid reimbursed services addition the healthcare providers receiving medicaid 
reimbursement must risk for the amount tax assessed and must not guaranteed receive reimbursement through the applicable state medicaid 
program for the tax assessed lower medicaid reimbursement rates would adversely affect our revenue financial condition and results operations 
may not fully reimbursed for all services for which each facility bills through consolidated billing which could adversely affect our revenue 
financial condition and results operations 
skilled nursing facilities are required perform consolidated billing for certain items and services furnished patients and residents the consolidated 
billing requirement essentially confers the skilled nursing facility itself the medicare billing responsibility for the entire package care that its patients 
receive these situations the bba also affected skilled nursing facility payments requiring that post hospitalization skilled nursing services 
bundled into the hospital diagnostic related group drg payment certain circumstances where this rule applies the hospital and the skilled nursing 
facility must effect divide the payment which otherwise would have been paid the hospital alone for the patient treatment and additional funds are 
paid medicare for skilled nursing care the patient present this provision applies limited number drgs but already apparently having 
negative effect skilled nursing facility utilization and payments either because hospitals are finding difficult place patients skilled nursing 
facilities which will not paid before because hospitals are reluctant discharge the patients skilled nursing facilities and lose part their 
payment this bundling requirement could extended more drgs the future which would accentuate the negative impact skilled nursing facility 
utilization and payments may not fully reimbursed for all services for which each facility bills through consolidated billing which could adversely 
affect our revenue financial condition and results operations 
reforms the healthcare system will impose new requirements upon and may lower our reimbursements 
aca and the health care and education reconciliation act the reconciliation act include sweeping changes how health care paid for

public and government calls for increased survey and enforcement efforts toward long term care facilities could result increased scrutiny state and

cms has undertaken several initiatives increase intensify medicaid and medicare survey and enforcement activities including federal oversight 
state actions cms taking steps focus more survey and enforcement efforts facilities with findings substandard care repeat violations 
medicaid and medicare standards and identify multi facility providers with patterns noncompliance addition hhs has adopted rule that requires 
cms charge user fees healthcare facilities cited during regular certification recertification substantiated complaint surveys for deficiencies which 
require revisit assure that corrections have been made cms also increasing its oversight state survey agencies and requiring state agencies use 
enforcement sanctions and remedies more promptly when substandard care repeat violations are identified investigate complaints more promptly and 
survey facilities more consistently 
the intensified and evolving enforcement environment impacts providers like because the increase the scope number inspections 
surveys governmental authorities and the severity consequent citations for alleged failure comply with regulatory requirements also divert 
personnel resources respond federal and state investigations and other enforcement actions the diversion these resources including our management 
team clinical and compliance staff and others take away from the time and energy that these individuals could otherwise spend routine operations 
noted from time time the ordinary course business receive deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such 
inspections surveys the focus these deficiency reports tends vary from year year although most inspection deficiencies are resolved through 
agreed upon plan corrective action the reviewing agency typically has the authority take further action against licensed certified facility which 
could result the imposition fines imposition provisional conditional license suspension revocation license suspension denial 
payment for new admissions loss certification provider under state federal healthcare programs imposition other sanctions including criminal 
penalties the past have experienced inspection deficiencies that have resulted the imposition provisional license and could experience these 
results the future currently have affiliated facilities operating under provisional licenses which were the result inspection deficiencies 
furthermore some states citations one facility impact other facilities the state revocation license given facility could therefore impair 
our ability obtain new licenses renew existing licenses other facilities which may also trigger defaults cross defaults under our leases and our 
credit arrangements adversely affect our ability operate obtain financing the future state federal regulators were determine formally 
otherwise that one facility regulatory history ought impact another our existing prospective facilities this could also increase costs result 
increased scrutiny state and federal survey agencies and even impact our expansion plans therefore our failure comply with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements any single facility could negatively impact our financial condition and results operations whole 
when facility found deficient under state licensing and medicaid and medicare standards sanctions may threatened imposed such 
denial payment for new medicaid and medicare admissions civil monetary penalties focused state and federal oversight and even loss eligibility for 
medicaid and medicare participation state licensure sanctions such denial payment for new admissions often are scheduled into effect before 
surveyors return verify compliance generally the surveyors confirm that the facility compliance upon their return the sanctions never take effect 
however they determine that the facility not compliance the denial payment goes into effect retroactive the date given the original notice 
this possibility sometimes leaves affected operators including with the difficult task deciding whether continue accepting patients after the 
potential denial payment date thus risking the retroactive denial revenue associated with those patients care the operators are later found out 
compliance simply refusing admissions from the potential denial payment date until the facility actually found compliance the past some 
our affiliated facilities have 
table contents 
been denial payment status due findings continued regulatory deficiencies resulting actual loss the revenue associated with the medicare 
and medicaid patients admitted after the denial payment date additional sanctions could ensue and imposed these sanctions entailing various 
remedies and including decertification would further negatively affect our financial condition and results operations elected 
voluntarily close one operating subsidiary result multiple regulatory deficiencies order avoid continued strain our staff and other resources 
and avoid restrictions our ability acquire new facilities expand operate existing facilities addition from time time have opted 
voluntarily stop accepting new patients pending completion new state survey order avoid possible denial payment for new admissions during 
the deficiency cure period simply avoid straining staff and other resources while retraining staff upgrading operating systems making other 
operational improvements elect voluntary close any operations the future opt stop accepting new patients pending completion state 
federal survey could negatively impact our financial condition and results operation 
facilities with otherwise acceptable regulatory histories generally are given opportunity correct deficiencies and continue their participation 
the medicare and medicaid programs certain date usually within nine months although where denial payment remedies are asserted such interim 
remedies into effect much sooner facilities with deficiencies that immediately jeopardize patient health and safety and those that are classified poor 
performing facilities however are not generally given opportunity correct their deficiencies prior the imposition remedies and other enforcement 
actions moreover facilities with poor regulatory histories continue classified cms poor performing facilities notwithstanding any intervening 
change ownership unless the new owner obtains new medicare provider agreement instead assuming the facility existing agreement however new 
owners including historically nearly always assume the existing medicare provider agreement due the difficulty and time delays generally associated 
with obtaining new medicare certifications especially previously certified locations with sub par operating histories accordingly facilities that have 
poor regulatory histories before acquire them and that develop new deficiencies after acquire them are more likely have sanctions imposed upon 
them cms state regulators addition cms has increased its focus facilities with history serious quality care problems through the special 
focus facility initiative facility administrators and owners are notified when identified special focus facility this information also provided 
the general public the special focus facility designation based part the facility compliance history typically dating before our acquisition the 
facility local state survey agencies recommend cms that facilities placed special focus status special focus facility receives heightened scrutiny 
and more frequent regulatory surveys failure improve the quality care can result fines and termination from participation medicare and medicaid 
facility graduates from the program once demonstrates significant improvements quality care that are continued over time 
have received notices potential sanctions and remedies based upon alleged regulatory deficiencies from time time and such sanctions have 
been imposed some our affiliated facilities have had several affiliated facilities placed special focus facility status due largely entirely

analyzed the results medical record review hospice general inpatient care stays estimate the percentage such stays that were billed 
inappropriately and found that hospices billed one third general inpatient stays inappropriately costing medicare million consequently 
the oig recommended and cms concurred with such recommendations that cms increase its oversight hospice general inpatient stay claims and 
review part payments for drugs for hospice beneficiaries ensure that physician involved the decision use general inpatient care conduct 
prepayment reviews for lengthy general inpatient care stays increase surveyor efforts ensure that hospices meet care planning requirements 
establish additional enforcement remedies for poor hospice performance and follow inappropriate general inpatient care stays

other things the report used medicare cost reports compare medicare payments skilled nursing facilities costs for therapy over ten year period and 
found that medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded skilled nursing facilities costs for therapy the oig recommended and cms concurred with 
such recommendations that cms evaluate the extent which medicare payment rates for therapy should reduced change the method for paying for 
therapy adjust medicare payments eliminate any increases that are unrelated beneficiary characteristics and strengthen oversight skilled nursing

report analyzed all medicare hospices claims from through and raised concerns about the financial incentives created the current payment 
system and the potential for hospices especially for profit hospices target beneficiaries assisted living facilities because they may offer the hospices the 
greatest financial gain accordingly the report recommended that cms reform payments reduce the incentive for hospices target beneficiaries with 
certain diagnoses and those likely have long stays target certain hospices for review develop and adopt claims based measures quality make hospice 
data publicly available for the beneficiaries and provide additional information hospices educate them about how they compare their peers cms

data from home health inpatient hospital and skilled nursing facilities claims from identify inappropriate home health payments the report found 
that medicare made overpayments largely connection with three specific errors overlapping with claims for inpatient hospital stays overlapping 
with claims for skilled nursing facility stays billing for services dates after beneficiaries deaths the report also concluded that home health agencies 
with questionable billing were located mostly texas florida california and michigan the report recommended that cms implement claims processing 
edits improve existing edits prevent inappropriate payments for the three specific errors referenced above increase monitoring billing for home health 
services enforce and consider lowering the ten percent cap the total outlier payments home health agency may receive annually consider imposing 
temporary moratorium new home health agency enrollments florida and texas and take appropriate action regarding the inappropriate payments 
identified and home health agencies with questionable billing cms concurred with all five recommendations moratoria were subsequently put place and

higher activities daily living adl scores and had long average length stay among part beneficiaries compared their government and not forprofit counterparts the oig recommended that cms vigilantly monitor overall payments skilled nursing facilities adjust rug rates annually change the 
method for determining how much therapy needed ensure appropriate payments and conduct additional reviews for skilled nursing operators that exceed 
certain thresholds for higher paying therapy rugs cms concurred with and agreed take action three the four recommendations declining only

and what effect any such proposals would have two our affiliated facilities have been listed the report our business model like those 
some other for profit operators based part seeking out higher acuity patients whom believe are generally more profitable and over time our 
overall patient mix has consistently shifted higher acuity and higher rugs patients most facilities operate also use specialized care delivery 
software that assists our caregivers more accurately capturing and recording adl services order among other things increase reimbursement levels

established such stringent development standards and approval procedures for constructing new healthcare facilities that the construction new facilities 
the expansion renovation existing facilities may become cost prohibitive extremely time consuming addition some states the acquisition 
facility being operated non profit organization requires the approval the state attorney general 
our ability acquire construct new facilities expand provide new services existing facilities would adversely affected are unable

services 
changes federal and state employment related laws and regulations could increase our cost doing business 
our operating subsidiaries are subject variety federal and state employment related laws and regulations including but not limited the 
fair labor standards act which governs such matters minimum wages overtime and other working conditions the americans with disabilities act ada 
and similar state laws that provide civil rights protections individuals with disabilities the context employment public accommodations and other 
areas the national labor relations act regulations the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc regulations the office civil rights 
regulations state attorneys general family leave mandates and variety similar laws enacted the federal and state governments that govern these and 
other employment law matters because labor represents such large portion our operating costs changes federal and state employment related laws and 
regulations could increase our cost doing business 
the compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could substantial for example all our affiliated facilities are required 
comply with the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial properties but generally requires 
that buildings made accessible people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements could require removal access barriers and noncompliance could result imposition government fines award damages private litigants further legislation may impose additional burdens 
restrictions with respect access disabled persons addition federal proposals introduce system mandated health insurance and flexible work 
time and other similar initiatives could implemented adversely affect our operations also may subject employee related claims such wrongful 
discharge discrimination violation equal employment law while are insured for these types claims could experience damages that are not 
covered our insurance policies that exceed our insurance limits and may required pay such damages directly which would negatively impact 
our cash flow from operations 
compliance with federal and state fair housing fire safety and other regulations may require make unanticipated expenditures which could 
costly 
must comply with the federal fair housing act and similar state laws which prohibit from discriminating against individuals would cause 
such individuals face barriers gaining residency any our affiliated facilities additionally the fair housing act and other similar state laws require 
that advertise our services such way that promote diversity and not limit may required among other things change our marketing 
techniques comply with these requirements 
addition are required operate our affiliated facilities compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations building codes and other land 
use regulations and food licensing certification requirements they may adopted governmental agencies and bodies from time time like other 
healthcare facilities our affiliated skilled nursing facilities are subject periodic surveys inspections governmental authorities assess and assure 
compliance with regulatory requirements surveys occur regular often annual biannual schedule and special surveys may result from specific 
complaint filed patient family member one our competitors may required make substantial capital expenditures comply with these 
requirements

whom refer high acuity patients and our mix payment sources changes the acuity level patients attract well our payor mix 
among medicaid medicare private payors and managed care companies significantly affect our profitability because generally receive higher 
reimbursement rates for high acuity patients and because the payors reimburse different rates for the year ended december our 
revenue was provided government payors that reimburse predetermined rates respectively our labor other operating costs increase will 
unable recover such increased costs from government payors accordingly fail maintain our proportion high acuity patients there any 
significant increase the percentage the patients our operating subsidiaries for whom receive medicaid reimbursement our results operations 
may adversely affected

initiatives undertaken major insurers and managed care companies contain healthcare costs may adversely affect our business among other 
initiatives these payors attempt control healthcare costs contracting with healthcare providers obtain services discounted basis believe that 
this trend will continue and may limit reimbursements for healthcare services insurers managed care companies from whom receive substantial 
payments were reduce the amounts they pay for services may lose patients choose not renew our contracts with these insurers lower rates 
compliance with state and federal employment immigration licensing and other laws could increase our cost doing business

restrictive government regulations proposed the department homeland security are enacted our access qualified and skilled personnel may 
limited 
operate least one state that requires verify employment eligibility using procedures and standards that exceed those required under federal 
form and the statutes and regulations related thereto proposed federal regulations would extend similar requirements all the states which our 
affiliated facilities operate the extent that such proposed regulations similar measures become effective and are required state federal 
authorities verify work authorization legal residence for current and prospective employees beyond existing form requirements and other statutes 
and regulations currently effect may make more difficult for recruit hire and retain qualified employees may increase our risk noncompliance with state and federal employment immigration licensing and other laws and regulations and could increase our cost doing business

liability claims alleging that our services have resulted personal injury elder abuse wrongful death other related claims the defense these lawsuits 
has the past and may the future result significant legal costs regardless the outcome and can result large settlement amounts damage awards 
plaintiffs tend sue every healthcare provider who may have been involved the patient care and accordingly respond multiple lawsuits and 
claims every year 
addition plaintiffs attorneys have become increasingly more aggressive their pursuit claims against healthcare providers including skilled 
nursing providers and other long term care companies and have employed wide variety advertising and publicity strategies among other things these 
strategies include establishing their own internet websites paying for premium advertising space other websites paying internet search engines 
optimize their plaintiff solicitation advertising that appears advantageous positions internet search results including results from searches for our 
company and affiliated facilities using newspaper magazine and television ads targeted customers the healthcare industry generally well 
customers specific providers including from time time law firms claiming specialize long term care litigation have named our affiliated 
facilities and other specific healthcare providers and facilities their advertising and solicitation materials these advertising and solicitation activities 
could result more claims and litigation which could increase our liability exposure and legal expenses divert the time and attention the personnel 
our operating subsidiaries from day day business operations and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results operations 
furthermore the extent the frequency and severity losses from such claims and suits increases our liability insurance premiums could increase and 
available insurance coverage levels could decline which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results operations 
healthcare litigation including class action litigation common and filed based upon wide variety claims and theories and are routinely 
subjected varying types claims one particular type suit arises from alleged violations state established minimum staffing requirements for skilled 
nursing facilities failure meet these requirements can among other things jeopardize facility compliance with conditions participation under 
certain state and federal healthcare programs may also subject the facility notice deficiency citation civil monetary penalty litigation these 
class action staffing suits have the potential result large jury verdicts and settlements and have become more prevalent the wake previous 
substantial jury award against one our competitors expect the plaintiff bar continue aggressive their pursuit these staffing and similar

elect dispose underperforming non strategic operating subsidiaries which would also decrease our revenue 
date our revenue growth has been significantly impacted our acquisition new facilities and businesses subject general market conditions 
and the availability essential resources and leadership within our company continue seek both single and multi facility acquisition and business 
acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our geographic financial and operating objectives 
face competition for the acquisition facilities and businesses and expect this competition increase based upon factors such our ability 
identify suitable acquisition candidates the purchase price the facilities prevailing market conditions the availability leadership manage new 
facilities and our own willingness take new operations the rate which have historically acquired facilities has fluctuated significantly the 
future anticipate the rate which may acquire facilities will continue fluctuate which may affect our revenue 
have also historically acquired few facilities either because they were included larger indivisible groups facilities under other 
circumstances which were have proven non strategic less desirable and may consider disposing such facilities exchanging them for 
facilities which are more desirable the extent dispose such facility without simultaneously acquiring facility exchange our revenues might 
decrease 
may not able successfully integrate acquired facilities and businesses into our operations and may not achieve the benefits expect from 
any our facility acquisitions 
may not able successfully efficiently integrate new acquisitions with our existing operating subsidiaries culture and systems the process 
integrating acquisitions into our existing operations may result unforeseen operating difficulties divert management attention from existing 
operations require unexpected commitment staff and financial resources 
table contents 
and may ultimately unsuccessful existing operations available for acquisition frequently serve target different markets than those that currently 
serve also may determine that renovations acquired facilities and changes staff and operating management personnel are necessary successfully 
integrate those acquisitions into our existing operations may not able recover the costs incurred reposition renovate newly operating 
subsidiaries the financial benefits expect realize from many our acquisitions are largely dependent upon our ability improve clinical 
performance overcome regulatory deficiencies rehabilitate improve the reputation the operations the community increase and maintain occupancy

stand alone skilled nursing operations seven post acute care campuses two home health agencies and five hospice agencies with total 
operational skilled nursing beds and assisted living units this growth has placed and will continue place significant demands our current

employees including facility level leaders and our local directors nursing may not successful attracting qualified individuals necessary for 
future acquisitions successful and our management team may expend significant time and energy working attract qualified personnel manage 
facilities may acquire the future also the newly acquired facilities may require spend significant time improving services that have historically 
been substandard and are unable improve such facilities quickly enough may subject litigation and loss licensure certification 
are not able successfully overcome these and other integration challenges may not achieve the benefits expect from any our facility 
acquisitions and our business may suffer 
undertaking acquisitions may adversely impacted costs liabilities and regulatory issues that may adversely affect our operations 
undertaking acquisitions also may adversely impacted unforeseen liabilities attributable the prior providers who operated those 
facilities against whom may have little recourse many facilities have historically acquired were underperforming financially and had clinical 
and regulatory issues prior and the time acquisition even where have improved operating subsidiaries and patient care affiliated facilities that 
have acquired still may face post acquisition regulatory issues related pre acquisition events these may include without limitation payment 
recoupment related our predecessors prior noncompliance the imposition fines penalties operational restrictions special regulatory status further 
may incur post acquisition compliance risk due the difficulty impossibility immediately quickly bringing non compliant facilities into full 
compliance diligence materials pertaining acquisition targets especially the underperforming facilities that often represent the greatest opportunity for 
return are often inadequate inaccurate impossible obtain sometimes requiring make acquisition decisions with incomplete information despite 
our due diligence procedures facilities that have acquired may acquire the future may generate unexpectedly low returns may cause incur 
substantial losses may require unexpected levels management time expenditures other resources may otherwise not meet risk profile that our 
investors find acceptable for example july acquired facility that had history intermittent noncompliance although the affiliated 
facility had already been surveyed once the local state survey agency after being acquired and that survey would have met the heightened 
requirements the special focus facility program based upon the facility compliance history prior our acquisition january state officials 
nevertheless recommended cms that the facility placed special focus facility status addition october acquired facility which 
had history intermittent non compliance this affiliated facility was surveyed the local state survey agency during the third quarter and 
passed the heightened survey requirements the special focus facility program both affiliated facilities have successfully graduated from the centers for 
medicare and medicaid services special focus program had other affiliated facilities that have successfully graduated from the program other 
affiliated facilities may identified for special focus status the future 
addition might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating any the acquired facilities including contingent liabilities 
for example when acquire facility generally assume the facility existing medicare provider number for purposes billing medicare for services 
cms later determined that the prior owner the facility had received overpayments from medicare for the period time during which operated the 
facility had incurred fines connection with the operation the facility cms could hold liable for repayment the overpayments fines the 
prior operator defunct otherwise unable reimburse may unable recover these funds may unable improve every facility that 
acquire addition operation these facilities may divert management time and attention from other operations and priorities 
table contents 
negatively impact cash flows result adverse unanticipated accounting charges otherwise damage other areas our company they are not timely 
and adequately improved 
also incur regulatory risk acquiring certain facilities due the licensing certification and other regulatory requirements affecting our right 
operate the acquired facilities for example order acquire facilities predictable schedule acquire declining operations quickly prevent 
further pre acquisition declines frequently acquire such facilities prior receiving license approval provider certification operate such facilities 
the interim manager for the outgoing licensee assuming financial responsibility among other obligations for the facility the extent that may 
unable delayed obtaining license may need operate the facility under management agreement from the prior operator any inability 
obtaining consent from the prior operator target acquisition utilizing its license this manner could impact our ability acquire additional facilities 
were subsequently denied licensure certification for any reason might not realize the expected benefits the acquisition and would likely incur 
unanticipated costs and other challenges which could cause our business suffer 
termination our patient admission agreements and the resulting vacancies our affiliated facilities could cause revenue our affiliated facilities

most state regulations governing skilled nursing and assisted living facilities require written patient admission agreements with each patient several 
these regulations also require that each patient have the right terminate the patient agreement for any reason and without prior notice consistent with 
these regulations all our skilled nursing patient agreements allow patients terminate their agreements without notice and all our assisted living 
resident agreements allow patients terminate their agreements upon thirty days notice patients and residents terminate their agreements from time time 
for variety reasons causing some fluctuations our overall occupancy patients and residents are admitted and discharged normal course 
unusual number patients residents elected terminate their agreements within short time occupancy levels our affiliated facilities could decline

the post acute care industry highly competitive and expect that our industry may become increasingly competitive the future our affiliated 
skilled nursing facilities compete primarily local and regional basis with many long term care providers from national and regional multi facility 
providers that have substantially greater financial resources small providers who operate single nursing facility also compete with other skilled 
nursing and assisted living facilities and with inpatient rehabilitation facilities long term acute care hospitals home healthcare and other similar services 
and care alternatives increased competition could limit our ability attract and retain patients attract and retain skilled personnel maintain increase

generally come higher reimbursement rates some our competitors have greater financial and other resources than may have greater brand 
recognition and may more established their respective communities than are competing companies may also offer newer facilities different 
programs services than and may thereby attract current potential patients other competitors may have lower expenses other competitive 
advantages and therefore present significant price competition for managed care and private pay patients addition some our competitors operate

certain agreements with our officers directors and employees under which may required indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out their 
employment relationships the terms such obligations vary contract and most instances specific maximum dollar amount not explicitly

despite the importance these measures analyzing our underlying business designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting non gaap

they not reflect the net interest expense the cash requirements necessary service interest principal payments our debt 
they not reflect rent expenses which are necessary operate our leased operations the case adjusted ebitdar 
they not reflect any income tax payments may required make 
although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have replaced the future 
and not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and 
other companies our industry may calculate these measures differently than which may limit their usefulness comparative measures 
compensate for these limitations using them only supplement net income basis prepared accordance with gaap order provide 
more complete understanding the factors and trends affecting our business

skilled and quality mix like most skilled nursing providers measure both patient days and revenue payor medicare managed care and other 
skilled patients whom refer high acuity patients typically require higher level skilled nursing and rehabilitative care accordingly medicare 
and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors most states medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest 
all payor types changes the payor mix can significantly affect our revenue and profitability
