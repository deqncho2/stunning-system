the senior living industry 
the senior living industry has undergone dramatic growth the last twenty years marked the emergence the assisted living segment the 
mid and remains highly fragmented and characterized numerous local and regional operators are one limited number large 
operators that provide broad range community locations and service level offerings varying price levels 
beginning the industry was affected negatively the downturn the general economy which resulted near halt construction 
new units the industry experienced slow recovery occupancy and rate growth beginning according the national investment center 
for the seniors housing care industry nic more recent years the economy and senior living industry have improved the industry 
has attracted increased investment resulting increased development new senior housing supply according nic data industry occupancy 
increased modestly through the pace absorption outpaced inventory growth slightly during the year ended december nic 
data shows that industry occupancy began decrease result new openings and based projections nic industry occupancy 
expected flat through during experienced adverse change the competitive environment for our consolidated senior 
housing portfolio with significant new competition opening number our markets have addressed such competition through our 
increased use discounts and incentives which has impacted rate growth certain markets additional local marketing efforts additional

senior living services individuals age and older according census data that group projected the fastest growing age cohort 
over the next twenty years result scientific and medical breakthroughs over the past years seniors are living longer due 
demographic trends and continuing advances science nutrition and healthcare the senior population will continue grow and expect the

frailty seniors soaring rates dementia among the elderly and growing burden chronic illness and chronic conditions result 
increased mobility society reduction average family size and increased number two wage earner couples families struggle provide 
care for seniors and look for alternatives outside their family for their care there growing consumer awareness among seniors and their 
families concerning the types services provided senior living operators which has further contributed the demand for senior living 
services also the current prospective senior customer possesses greater financial resources than the past which makes more likely that they 
are able afford live market rate senior housing seniors the demographic cohort that were born between and have significant 
amount income generated from savings pensions and social security along with strong asset base 
challenges our industry include increased state and local regulation the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors which has led 
increase the cost doing business the regulatory environment continues intensify the number and types laws and regulations 
affecting accompanied increased enforcement activity state and local officials addition like other companies our financial results may 
negatively impacted increasing employment costs including salaries wages and benefits such health care benefit coverage for our 
employees increases the costs food utilities insurance and real estate taxes may also have negative impact our financial results

limit payments healthcare providers the future cannot predict what action any congress will take reimbursement policies the 
medicare program what future rule changes the centers for medicare medicaid services cms will implement changes the

government regulation 
the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues intensify the number and type laws and regulations affecting 
addition federal state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts enforcement these laws and regulations this 
particularly true for large for profit multi community providers like some the laws and regulations that impact our industry include state and 
local laws impacting licensure protecting consumers against deceptive practices and generally affecting the communities management 
property and equipment and how otherwise conduct our operations such fire health and safety laws and regulations and privacy laws 
federal and state laws designed protect medicare and medicaid which mandate what are allowable costs pricing quality services quality 
care food service resident rights including abuse and neglect and fraud federal and state residents rights statutes and regulations antikickback and physicians referral stark laws and safety and health standards set the occupational safety and health administration 
are unable predict the future course federal state and local legislation regulation changes the regulatory framework could have 
material adverse effect our business 
many senior living communities are also subject regulation and licensing state and local health and social service agencies and other 
regulatory authorities although requirements vary from state state these requirements may address among others the following personnel 
education training and records community services including administration medication assistance with self administration medication and 
the provision nursing home health and therapy services staffing levels monitoring resident wellness physical plant specifications 
furnishing resident units food and housekeeping services emergency evacuation plans professional licensing and certification staff prior 
beginning employment and resident rights and responsibilities including some states the right receive health care services from providers 
resident choice that are not our employees several the states which operate may operate are prohibited from providing certain 
higher levels senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses addition several the states which operate 
intend operate assisted living communities home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities require certificate need before the 
community can opened the services existing community can expanded senior living communities may also subject state and 
local building zoning fire and food service codes and must compliance with these local codes before licensing certification may 
granted these laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability expand into new markets and expand our services and communities 
existing markets addition any our presently licensed communities operates outside its licensing authority may subject 
penalties including closure the community 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like because the increase the number inspections surveys 
governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure comply with regulatory requirements unannounced surveys inspections 
may occur annually annually following regulator receipt complaint about the community from time time the ordinary course 
business receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections surveys most inspection deficiencies 
are resolved through agreed plan corrective action relating the community operations but the reviewing agency typically has the 
authority take further action against licensed certified community which could result the imposition fines imposition provisional 
conditional license suspension revocation license suspension denial admissions loss certification provider under federal 
health care programs imposition other sanctions including criminal penalties loss suspension modification license may also cause 
default under our loan lease agreements and trigger cross defaults sanctions may taken against providers facilities without 
regard the providers facilities history compliance may also expend considerable resources respond federal and state 
investigations other enforcement action under applicable laws regulations date none the deficiency reports received has 
resulted suspension fine other disposition that has had material adverse effect our revenues however any future substantial failure 
comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result material adverse effect our business whole addition 
states attorneys general vigorously enforce consumer protection laws those laws relate the senior living industry state medicaid fraud and 
abuse units may also investigate assisted living communities even the community any its residents not receive federal state funds 
regulation the senior living industry evolving least partly because the growing interests variety advocacy organizations and 
political movements attempting standardize regulations for certain segments the industry particularly assisted living our operations could 
suffer future regulatory developments such federal assisted living laws and regulations well mandatory increases the scope and 
severity deficiencies determined survey inspection officials increase the number citations that can result civil criminal penalties 
certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials make determinations whether the care provided one more our 
communities exceeds the level care for which the community licensed finding that community delivering care beyond its license might 
result the immediate transfer and discharge residents which may create market instability and other adverse consequences furthermore 
certain states may allow citations one community impact other communities the state revocation suspension license citation 
given community could therefore impact our ability obtain new licenses renew existing licenses other communities which may also 
cause default under our loan lease agreements and trigger cross defaults may also trigger defaults under certain our credit 
agreements adversely affect our ability operate and obtain financing the future state were find that one community citation will 
impact another our communities this will also increase costs and result increased surveillance the state survey agency regulatory 
requirements increase whether through enactment new laws regulations changes the enforcement existing rules including increased 
enforcement brought about advocacy groups addition federal and state regulators our operations could adversely affected 
addition any adverse finding survey and inspection officials may serve the basis for false claims lawsuits private plaintiffs and may lead 
investigations under federal and state laws which may result civil and criminal penalties against the community individual 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing wide array referrals relationships and arrangements and prohibiting 
fraud health care providers including those the senior living industry and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and 
resources such anti fraud initiatives the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the balanced budget act 
expanded the penalties for health care fraud addition with respect our participation federal health care reimbursement programs 
the government private individuals acting behalf the government may bring action under the false claims act alleging that health 
care provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment additional monetary civil penalties 
recently other health care providers have faced enforcement action under the false claims act the false claims act allows private individual 
with knowledge fraud bring claim behalf the federal government and earn percentage the federal government recovery because 
these incentives called whistleblower suits have become more frequent also any our communities exceeds its level care may 
subject private lawsuits alleging transfer trauma residents such allegations could also lead investigations enforcement officials 
which could result penalties including the closure communities the violation any these regulations may result the imposition fines 
other penalties that could jeopardize our business 
additionally operate communities that participate federal and state health care reimbursement programs including state medicaid waiver 
programs for assisted living communities the medicare skilled nursing facility benefit program and other healthcare programs such therapy and 
home health services other federal and state health care programs consequently are subject federal and state laws that prohibit 
anyone from presenting causing presented claims for reimbursement which are false fraudulent are for items services that were not 
provided claimed similar state laws vary from state state and cannot sure that these laws will interpreted consistently keeping 
with past practices violation any these laws can result loss licensure claims for recoupment civil criminal penalties and exclusion 
health care providers suppliers from furnishing covered items services beneficiaries the applicable federal and state health care 
reimbursement program loss licensure may also cause default under our leases and loan agreements and trigger cross defaults 
are also subject certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements health care providers such the federal antikickback law the stark laws and certain state referral laws the federal anti kickback law makes unlawful for any person offer pay 
solicit receive any remuneration directly indirectly overtly covertly cash kind for referring recommending for purchase any 
item service which eligible for payment under the medicare and medicaid programs authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly 
apply many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources patient referral were violate the federal antikickback law may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such 
medicare and medicaid which may also cause default under our leases and loan agreements and trigger cross defaults adverse 
consequences may also result violate federal stark laws related certain medicare and medicaid physician referrals while endeavor 
comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation our senior living communities difficult predict how our revenues could 
affected were subject action alleging such violations are also subject federal and state laws designed protect the 
confidentiality patient health information the department health and human services hhs has issued rules pursuant hipaa

communities securing such indebtedness the case lease cause the lessor terminate the lease each with consequent loss revenue 
and asset value furthermore some cases indebtedness secured both mortgage community communities and guaranty 
and one more our subsidiaries the event default under one these scenarios the lender could avoid judicial procedures 
required foreclose real property declaring all amounts outstanding under the guaranty immediately due and payable and requiring the 
respective guarantor fulfill its obligations make such payments the realization any these scenarios would have adverse effect our 
financial condition and capital structure additionally foreclosure any our properties could cause recognize taxable income even 
did not receive any cash proceeds connection with such foreclosure further because many our outstanding debt and lease documents 
contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions default related one community could affect significant number our

reasons including without limitation 
may have little cash flow apart from cash flow that dedicated the payment any interest principal amortization required

our ability pay dividends our stockholders may limited 
our ability make payments principal and interest our indebtedness and make lease payments our leases depends upon our future 
cash flow performance which will subject general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting 
our operations many which are beyond our control our business might not continue generate cash flow above current levels are 
unable generate sufficient cash flow from operations the future service our debt make lease payments our leases may 
required among other things seek additional financing the debt equity markets refinance restructure all portion our 
indebtedness leases sell selected assets reduce delay planned capital expenditures delay abandon desirable acquisitions these 
measures might not sufficient enable service our debt make lease payments our leases the failure make required payments 
our debt leases could result adverse effect our future ability generate revenues and our results operations and cash flow any 
contemplated financing refinancing restructuring sale assets might not available economically favorable terms addition 
certain our debt agreements contain extension options are not able satisfy the conditions precedent exercising these extension 
options our liquidity and financial condition could negatively impacted 
our existing credit facilities mortgage loans and lease arrangements contain covenants that limit restrict our operations and activities 
including our ability borrow additional funds and engage certain transactions without consent the applicable lender lessor and 
any default under such facilities loans arrangements could result the acceleration indebtedness termination the leases crossdefaults under our other debt lease documents any which would negatively impact our liquidity and interfere with our portfolio 
optimization and growth initiatives 
our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain restrictions and covenants and require maintain satisfy specified financial ratios and 
coverage tests including maintaining prescribed net worth levels leverage ratios and debt service and lease coverage ratios consolidated 
basis and community communities basis based the debt lease securing the communities addition certain our leases require 
maintain lease coverage ratios lease portfolio basis each defined the leases and maintain stockholders equity tangible net worth 
amounts the debt service coverage ratios are generally calculated revenues less operating expenses including implied management fee and 
reserve for capital expenditures divided the debt principal and interest lease payment net worth generally calculated stockholders

gains from sale leaseback transactions and deferred entrance fee revenue these restrictions and covenants may interfere with our ability obtain 
financing engage other business activities which may inhibit our ability pursue our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives 
fail comply with any these requirements then the related indebtedness could become immediately due and payable cannot assure you 
that could pay this debt became due addition certain our outstanding indebtedness and leases limit restrict among other things 
our ability and our subsidiaries ability borrow additional funds engage change control transaction dispose all substantially all 
our their assets engage mergers other business combinations without consent the applicable lender lessor 
our credit facilities mortgage loans and leases are secured our communities and certain cases guaranty and one more our

lease foreclose collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness and leases and restrict our ability make additional borrowings under the 
outstanding indebtedness continue operate the properties subject the lease many our outstanding debt and lease documents contain

operations and cash flow and could interfere with our ability pursue our portfolio optimization and growth initiatives 
certain our master leases and management agreements also contain radius restrictions which limit our ability own develop acquire new 
communities within specified distance from certain existing communities covered such agreements these radius restrictions could negatively 
affect our ability expand develop acquire senior housing communities and operating companies 
mortgage debt and lease obligations expose increased risk loss property which could harm our ability generate future revenues 
and could have adverse tax effect 
mortgage debt and lease obligations increase our risk loss because defaults indebtedness secured properties pursuant the terms 
the lease may result foreclosure actions initiated lenders lessors and ultimately our loss the property securing any loans for which 
are default cause the lessor terminate the lease for tax purposes foreclosure any our properties would treated sale the 
property for purchase price equal the outstanding balance the debt secured the mortgage the outstanding balance the debt secured 
the mortgage exceeds our tax basis the property would recognize taxable income foreclosure but would not receive any cash 
proceeds which could negatively impact our results operations and cash flow further our mortgage debt and leases generally contain crossdefault and cross collateralization provisions and default one community could affect significant number our communities financing 
arrangements and leases 
addition our leases generally provide for renewal extension options and certain cases purchase options these options generally are 
based upon prescribed formulas but certain cases may fair market value expect renew extend exercise purchase options with 
respect our leases the normal course business however there can assurance that these rights will exercised the future that 
will able satisfy the conditions precedent exercising any such renewal extension purchase options furthermore the terms any 
such options that are based fair market value are inherently uncertain and could unacceptable unfavorable depending the 
circumstances the time exercise are not able renew extend our existing leases purchase the communities subject such leases 
prior the end the existing lease terms the terms such options are unfavorable unacceptable our business results 
operations and cash flow could adversely affected 
increases market interest rates could significantly increase the costs our unhedged debt and lease obligations which could adversely 
affect our results operations and cash flow 
our unhedged floating rate debt and lease payment obligations and any unhedged floating rate debt incurred the future exposes interest 
rate risk therefore increases prevailing interest rates could increase our payment obligations which would negatively impact our results 
operations and cash flow

operations and cash flow 
state regulations governing assisted living communities require written resident agreements with each resident several these regulations also 
require that each resident have the right terminate the resident agreement for any reason reasonable notice consistent with these 
regulations many our assisted living resident agreements allow residents terminate their agreements upon days notice unlike typical 
apartment leasing independent living arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods year longer 
many instances cannot contract with our assisted living residents stay those living spaces for longer periods time our retirement 
center resident agreements generally provide for termination the lease upon death allow resident terminate his her lease upon the need 
for higher level care not provided the community multiple residents terminate their resident agreements around the same time our 
occupancy revenues results operations and cash flow could adversely affected addition because the demographics our typical 
residents including age and health resident turnover rates our communities are difficult predict result the living spaces lease may

waste management companies does not immunize from alleged violations such laws for operations for which are responsible even 
carried out such waste management companies nor does immunize from third party claims for the cost cleanup disposal sites which

are unable predict the future course federal state and local environmental regulation and legislation changes the environmental 
regulatory framework including legislative regulatory efforts designed address climate change such the proposed cap and trade 
legislation could have material adverse effect our business addition because environmental laws vary from state state expansion

result litigation related regulatory compliance matters result maintain general liability and professional liability insurance policies

the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues evolve and intensify the amount and type laws and 
regulations affecting many which vary from state state addition many senior living communities are subject regulation and licensing 
state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities several the states which operate may operate 
are prohibited from providing certain higher levels senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses also several 
the states which operate intend operate assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities require certificate need before 
the community can opened the services existing community can expanded furthermore federal state and local officials are 
increasingly focusing their efforts enforcement these laws particularly with respect large for profit multi community providers like 
these requirements and the increased enforcement thereof could affect our ability expand into new markets expand our services and 
communities existing markets and any our presently licensed communities were operate outside its licensing authority may subject 
penalties including closure the community future regulatory developments well mandatory increases the scope and severity 
deficiencies determined survey inspection officials could cause our operations suffer are unable predict the future course 
federal state and local legislation regulation regulatory requirements increase whether through enactment new laws regulations 
changes the enforcement existing rules our business results operations and cash flow could adversely affected 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like because the increase the number inspections surveys 
governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure comply with regulatory requirements also expend considerable resources 
respond federal and state investigations other enforcement action from time time the ordinary course business receive 
deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections surveys although most inspection deficiencies are 
resolved through agreed plan corrective action the reviewing agency typically has the authority take further action against licensed 
certified facility which could result the imposition fines imposition provisional conditional license suspension revocation 
license suspension denial admissions loss certification provider under federal health care programs imposition other sanctions 
including criminal penalties furthermore certain states may allow citations one community impact other communities the state revocation 
license given community could therefore impact our ability obtain new licenses renew existing licenses other communities 
which may also cause default under our leases trigger cross defaults trigger defaults under certain our credit agreements 
adversely affect our ability operate and obtain financing the future state were find that one community citation would impact 
another our communities this would also increase costs and result increased surveillance the state survey agency date none the 
deficiency reports received has resulted suspension fine other disposition that has had material adverse effect our revenues 
however the failure comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements the future could result material adverse effect our 
business whole 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing wide array referral relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud 
health care providers including those the senior living industry and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources 
such anti fraud initiatives some examples are the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the balanced budget 
act and the false claims act which gives private individuals the ability bring action behalf the federal government the 
violation any these laws regulations may result the imposition fines other penalties that could increase our costs and otherwise 
jeopardize our business under the deficit reduction act dra every entity that receives least million annually medicaid 
payments must have established written policies for all employees contractors agents providing detailed information about false claims false 
statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws including the federal false claims act and similar state laws failure 
comply with this compliance requirement may potentially give rise potential liability dra also creates incentive for states enact false 
claims laws that are comparable the federal false claims act 
additionally provide services and operate communities that participate federal and state health care reimbursement programs which 
makes subject federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting causing presented claims for reimbursement which are 
false fraudulent are for items services that were not provided claimed similar state laws vary from state state and cannot sure 
that these laws will interpreted consistently keeping with past practice violation any these laws can result loss licensure civil 
criminal penalties and exclusion health care providers suppliers from furnishing covered items services beneficiaries the applicable 
federal and state health care reimbursement program loss licensure may also cause default under our leases and trigger crossdefaults 
are also subject certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements health care providers such the federal antikickback law the stark laws and certain state referral laws authorities have interpreted the federal anti kickback law very broadly apply 
many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources patient referral this could result criminal penalties and civil 
sanctions including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such medicare and medicaid which may also cause default 
under our leases and trigger cross defaults adverse consequences may also result violate federal stark laws related certain medicare 
and medicaid physician referrals while endeavor comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation our business difficult 
predict how our revenues could affected were subject action alleging such violations 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act fair housing act and fire safety and other regulations may require make

all our communities are required comply with the americans with disabilities act ada the ada has separate compliance requirements 
for public accommodations and commercial properties but generally requires that buildings made accessible people with disabilities 
compliance with ada requirements could require removal access barriers and non compliance could result imposition government fines 
award damages private litigants 
must also comply with the fair housing act which prohibits from discriminating against individuals certain bases any our 
practices would cause such individuals face barriers gaining residency any our communities additionally the fair housing act and 
other state laws require that advertise our services such way that promote diversity and not limit may required among other 
things change our marketing techniques comply with these requirements 
addition are required operate our communities compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations building codes and other land 
use regulations and food licensing certification requirements they may adopted governmental agencies and bodies from time time 
like other health care facilities senior living communities are subject periodic survey inspection governmental authorities assess and 
assure compliance with regulatory requirements surveys occur regular often annual annual schedule and special surveys may result 
from specific complaint filed resident family member one our competitors may required make substantial capital 
expenditures comply with those requirements 
capital expenditures have made comply with any the above date have been immaterial however the increased costs and capital 
expenditures that may incur order comply with any the above would result negative effect our results operations and financial 
condition 
significant legal actions and liability claims against excess insurance limits could subject increased operating costs and 
substantial uninsured liabilities which may adversely affect our financial condition and results operations 
the senior living and healthcare services businesses entail inherent risk liability particularly given the demographics our residents 
including age and health and the services provide recent years well other participants our industry have been subject 
increasing number claims and lawsuits alleging that our services have resulted resident injury other adverse effects many these 
lawsuits involve large damage claims and significant legal costs many states continue consider tort reform and how will apply the senior 
living industry may continue faced with the threat large jury verdicts jurisdictions that not find favor with large senior living 
healthcare providers maintain liability insurance policies amounts and with the coverage and deductibles believe are adequate based 
the nature and risks our business historical experience and industry standards have formed wholly owned captive insurance company 
for the purpose insuring certain portions our risk retention under our general and professional liability insurance programs there can 
guarantee that will not have any claims that exceed our policy limits the future 
successful claim made against and not covered our insurance exceeds the policy limits our financial condition and results 
operations could materially and adversely affected some states state law may prohibit limit insurance coverage for the risk punitive 
damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and litigation result may liable for punitive damage awards 
these states that either are not covered are excess our insurance policy limits also the above deductibles self insured retention are 
accrued based actuarial projection future liabilities these projections are inaccurate and there are unexpectedly large number 
successful claims that result liabilities excess our self insured retention our operating results could negatively affected claims against

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation our financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the united states gaap requires 
make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts assets and liabilities revenues and expenses consider accounting 
estimate critical requires assumptions made that were uncertain the time the estimate was made and changes the estimate 
different estimates that could have been selected could have material impact our consolidated results operations financial condition 
have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect significant estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and assumptions entrance fee communities 
our entrance fee communities provide housing and healthcare services through entrance fee agreements with residents under certain these 
agreements residents pay entrance fee upon entering into the contract and are contractually guaranteed certain limited lifecare benefits the 
form healthcare discounts the recognition entrance fee income requires the use various actuarial estimates recognize this revenue 
recording the non refundable portion the residents entrance fees deferred entrance fee income and amortizing into revenue using the 
straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy each resident couple adjusted annually periodically assess the 
reasonableness these mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions and measurement future service obligations 
self insurance liability accruals

and professional liability insurance policies for our owned leased and managed communities under master insurance program the company 
current policies provide for deductibles for each and every claim 
result are effectively self insured for claims that are less than the deductible amounts addition maintain high deductible workers

with cash aggregating million deposits aggregating million and letters credit aggregating million december 
third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above program deductibles and retentions 
the cost our employee health and dental benefits net employee contributions shared and our communities based the respective 
number participants working directly either our corporate offices the communities cash received used pay the actual costs 
administering the program which include paid claims third party administrative fees network provider fees communication costs and other

outstanding losses and expenses for general liability and professional liability and workers compensation are estimated based the 
recommendations independent actuaries and management estimates outstanding losses and expenses for our self insured medical program 
are estimated based the recommendation our third party administrator and management estimates 
review the adequacy our accruals related these liabilities ongoing basis using historical claims actuarial valuations third party 
administrator estimates consultants advice from legal counsel and industry data and adjust accruals periodically estimated costs related these 
self insurance programs are accrued based known claims and projected claims incurred but not yet reported subsequent changes actual 
experience are monitored and estimates are updated information available changes self insurance reserves are recorded increase 
decrease expense the period that the determination made

against deferred tax assets approximately million and million respectively when determine that more likely than not that 
will able realize our deferred tax assets the future excess our net recorded amount adjustment the deferred tax asset would 
made and reflected income this determination will made considering various factors including the reversal and timing existing 
temporary differences tax planning strategies and estimates future taxable income exclusive the reversal temporary differences although 
are currently precluded under gaap from considering estimates future taxable income our analysis due our cumulative historical 
operating losses 
have elected the with and without approach regarding ordering windfall tax benefits determine whether the windfall tax benefit did 
reduce taxes payable the current year under this approach the windfall tax benefits would recognized additional paid capital only 
incremental tax benefit realized after considering all other tax benefits presently available 
lease accounting 
determine whether account for our leases either operating capital financing leases depending the underlying terms 
december operated communities under long term leases with operating capital and financing lease obligations the determination 
this classification complex and certain situations requires significant level judgment our classification criteria based estimates 
regarding the fair value the leased communities minimum lease payments effective cost funds the economic life the community and 
certain other terms the lease agreements communities under operating leases are accounted for our consolidated statements operations 
lease expenses for actual rent paid plus minus straight line adjustments for fixed estimated minimum lease escalators well amortization 
above below market rents and deferred gains for communities under capital and financing lease obligation arrangements liability established 
our balance sheets and corresponding long term asset recorded lease payments are allocated between principal and interest the 
remaining base lease obligations for capital lease assets the asset depreciated over the remaining lease term unless there bargain purchase 
option which case the asset depreciated over the useful life for financing lease assets the asset depreciated over the useful life the 
asset addition amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term the lease over the shorter their economic life the lease 
term sale leaseback transactions are recorded lease financing obligations when the transactions include form continuing involvement 
such purchase options 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
accounts receivable are reported net allowance for doubtful accounts and represent our estimate the amount that ultimately will 
realized cash the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million december and respectively the 
adequacy our allowance for doubtful accounts reviewed ongoing basis using historical payment trends write off experience analyses 
receivable portfolios payor source and aging receivables well review specific accounts and adjustments are made the 
allowance necessary recent changes legislation are not expected have material impact the collectability our accounts receivable 
however changes economic conditions could have impact the collection existing receivable balances future allowance calculations 
approximately and our resident fee revenues for the years ended december and respectively were derived from 
private pay customers and and our resident fee revenues for the years ended december and respectively were 
derived from services covered various third party payor programs including medicare and medicaid billings for services under third party 
payor programs are recorded net estimated retroactive adjustments any under reimbursement programs revenue related these billings 
recorded estimated basis the period the related services are rendered and adjusted future periods final settlements are determined

long lived assets and goodwill 
december and our long lived assets were comprised primarily billion and billion net property plant and 
equipment and leasehold intangibles respectively accounting for our property plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles apply the 
provisions asc property plant and equipment acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method accounting and the 
purchase prices are assigned acquired assets and liabilities based their estimated fair values goodwill recorded connection with business 
combinations allocated the respective reporting unit and included our application the provisions asc intangibles goodwill 
and other asc december and had goodwill balances million and million respectively the 
decrease goodwill during the year ended december attributed the allocation goodwill communities sold identified assets 
held for sale 
test long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for recoverability annually during our fourth quarter 
whenever changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may not recoverable recoverability asset estimated comparing its 
carrying value the future net undiscounted cash flows expected generated the asset calculated utilizing the lowest level identifiable 
cash flows this comparison indicates that the carrying value asset not recoverable are required recognize impairment loss the 
impairment loss measured the amount which the carrying amount the asset exceeds its estimated fair value when impairment loss 
recognized for assets held and used the carrying amount those assets permanently adjusted and depreciated over its remaining useful 
life during and evaluated long lived depreciable assets and determined that the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the 
carrying value these assets for all except small number communities estimated fair values were determined for these certain properties and 
recorded asset impairment charges million million and million for and respectively for property plant and 
equipment and leasehold intangibles these impairment charges are primarily due our decision dispose assets either through sales lease 
terminations lower than expected performance the underlying communities and equal the amount which the carrying values the assets 
exceed the estimated fair value the case assets held for sale fair value less costs dispose the asset impairment charges for the year 
ended december include million charges related the property plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles the leased 
communities subject the disposition and lease restructuring transactions with hcp 
test goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter whenever indicators exist that suggest that our goodwill may not 
recoverable factors consider important our analysis whether indicator impairment exists which could trigger impairment 
goodwill the future include significant decline our stock price for sustained period since the last testing date decline our market 
capitalization below net book value significant underperformance relative historical projected future operating results and significant 
negative industry economic trends first assess qualitative factors determine whether necessary perform two step quantitative 
goodwill impairment test are not required calculate the fair value reporting unit unless the entity determines based qualitative 
assessment that more likely than not that its fair value less than its carrying amount the quantitative goodwill impairment test based 
upon comparison the estimated fair value the reporting unit which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit carrying 
value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during our fourth quarter more frequently required the impairment test 
consists comparison the estimated fair value the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value the carrying amount exceeds 
its fair value impairment loss recognized for that difference during recorded million and million impairment charges 
related intangible assets for community purchase options and health care licenses respectively these impairment charges are primarily due 
lower than expected operating performance the communities subject the community purchase options and reflect the amount which the 
carrying values the community purchase options exceeded their estimated fair value 
estimating the fair value long lived assets and reporting units for purposes our goodwill impairment test generally use the income 
approach the income approach utilizes future cash flow projections that are developed internally any estimates future cash flow projections 
necessarily involve predicting unknown future and require significant management judgments and estimates arriving our cash flow 
projections consider our historic operating results approved budgets and business plans future demographic factors expected growth rates 
and other factors future events may indicate differences from management current judgments and estimates which could turn result future 
impairments future events that may result impairment charges include increases interest rates which could impact capitalization and discount 
rates differences the projected occupancy rates and changes the cost structure existing communities 
using the income approach estimate the fair value long lived assets and reporting units for purposes our goodwill impairment test 
make certain key assumptions those assumptions include future revenues and future facility operating expenses and future cash flows that 
would receive upon sale the communities using estimated capitalization rates corroborate the capitalization rates use these 
calculations with capitalization rates observable from recent market transactions 
where required future cash flows are discounted rate that consistent with weighted average cost capital from market participant 
perspective the weighted average cost capital estimate the overall after tax rate return required equity and debt holders 
business enterprise 
our annual assessment date october and december our estimated fair values our reporting units exceeded their 
carrying values and concluded based the first step process that there was impairment goodwill the fair value exceeded carrying 
value more than for each our reporting units with the exception our assisted living and brookdale ancillary services reporting 
units the fair value exceeded the carrying value our assisted living and brookdale ancillary services reporting units approximately 
and respectively goodwill allocated our assisted living and brookdale ancillary services reporting units approximately million 
and million respectively december determining the fair value reporting unit asset group involves the use 
significant estimates and assumptions which believe reasonable that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain these estimates and 
assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used calculate projected future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates 
significant adverse changes our future revenues and operating margins significant changes the market for senior housing the valuation 
the real estate senior living communities well other events and circumstances including but not limited increased competition and 
changing economic market conditions including market control premiums could result changes fair value and the determination that all 
portion our goodwill impaired the fair value our assisted living reporting unit was estimated utilizing revenue growth rates ranging from 
expense growth rates discount rates and capitalization rates 
our impairment loss assessment contains uncertainties because requires apply judgment estimate whether there has been decline 
the fair value our reporting units including estimating future cash flows and necessary the fair value our assets and liabilities 
periodically perform this assessment changes our estimates and assumptions may cause realize material impairment charges the future 
although make every reasonable effort ensure the accuracy our estimate the fair value our reporting units future changes the
