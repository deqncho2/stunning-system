payment system ipps under the ipps our hospitals are paid prospectively determined amount for each hospital discharge that 
based the patient diagnosis specifically each discharge assigned medicare severity diagnosis related group msdrg which groups patients that have similar clinical conditions and that are expected require similar amount hospital 
resources each drg turn assigned relative weight that prospectively set and that reflects the average amount 
resources determined national basis that are needed treat patient with that particular diagnosis compared the amount 
hospital resources that are needed treat the average medicare inpatient stay the ipps payment for each discharge based two 
national base payment rates standardized amounts one that covers hospital operating expenses and another that covers hospital 
capital expenses the base drg payment rate for operating expenses has two components labor share and non labor share 
although the labor share adjusted wage index reflect geographical differences the cost labor the base drg 
payment rate does not consider the actual costs incurred individual hospital providing particular inpatient service

medicaid 
our revenues under the various state medicaid programs including state funded managed care programs were approximately 
million total revenues for the year ended december included these payments are dsh and other 
supplemental payments received under various state medicaid programs for and our revenues attributable dsh 
and other supplemental payments were approximately million million and million respectively the increase 
revenues from dsh and other supplemental payments primarily attributable additional funding provided certain states 
which was made available part additional annual state provider taxes certain our hospitals and changes classification 
state programs however anticipate that there will reduction such payments 
medicaid programs are funded both state governments and federal matching funds provide healthcare benefits certain 
low income individuals and groups these programs and the reimbursement methodologies are administered the states and vary 
from state state and from year year amounts received under the medicaid programs are often significantly less than the 
hospital customary charges for the services provided most state medicaid payments are made under prospective payment system 
fee schedule cost reimbursement programs some combination these three methods 
many states which operate are facing budgetary challenges and have adopted may considering legislation that 
intended control reduce medicaid expenditures enroll medicaid recipients managed care programs and impose additional 
taxes hospitals help finance expand their medicaid programs additionally part the movement repeal replace 
modify the affordable care act and means reduce the federal budget deficit there are renewed congressional efforts move 
medicaid from open ended program with coverage and benefits set the federal government one which states receive fixed 
amount federal funds either through block grants per capita caps and have more flexibility determine benefits eligibility and 
provider payments implemented cannot predict whether the amount fixed federal funding the states will based 
current payment amounts will based lower payment amounts which would negatively impact those states that expanded 
their medicaid programs response the affordable care act such efforts modify reduce federal funding the medicaid 
program well those that would reduce the amount federal medicaid matching funding available states curtailing the use 
provider taxes could have negative impact state medicaid budgets resulting less coverage for eligible individuals 
addition potential changes the way the federal government funds the medicaid program cms also recently issued new 
guidance permitting states require work and community engagement for certain medicaid beneficiaries cms has indicated that 
issued the new guidance response numerous state requests test programs through medicaid demonstration projects under 
which work participation other community engagement activities such skills training education job searches volunteering

health care reform 
the affordable care act which became federal law dramatically altered the healthcare system and was intended 
decrease the number uninsured americans and reduce the overall cost healthcare among other things requiring most 
americans obtain health insurance the individual mandate providing additional funding for medicaid states that choose 
expand their programs reducing medicaid dsh payments providers expanding the medicare program use value based 
purchasing programs tying hospital payments the satisfaction certain quality criteria bundling payments hospitals and other 
providers and instituting certain private health insurance reforms the affordable care act also includes certain reductions 
medicare spending such negative adjustments the ipps and opps market basket updates the revision annual inflation 
updates and other cost containment measures including planned payment reductions since have expended substantial cost 
and effort prepare for and comply with the affordable care act which has been implemented rolling basis 
january president trump issued executive order that among other things stated that was the intent his 
administration repeal the affordable care act and pending that repeal instructed the executive branch the federal government 
defer delay the implementation any provision requirement the affordable care act that would impose fiscal burden 
any state cost fee tax penalty any individual family health care provider health insurer 
october president trump issued another executive order related the affordable care act that intended 
promote choice and competition the health insurance marketplace and among other things requires the secretaries the 
departments health and human services labor and the treasury consider proposing regulations revising existing guidance 
that would expand access health insurance coverage allowing more employers form association health plans that would 
allowed provide coverage across state lines increasing the availability short term limited duration health insurance plans which 
are generally not subject the requirements the affordable care act and increasing the availability and permitted use health 
reimbursement arrangements 
addition the executive orders number bills have been introduced congress that would repeal the affordable care act 
and would replace with varying health coverage plans including plans that would allow insurers sell health insurance across state 
lines allow the use health savings accounts hsas without high deductible plan give states the option either keep the 
coverage framework created the affordable care act expanded medicaid individual subsidies and insurance exchanges 
utilize the increased federal funding that was intended provided the federal government under the affordable care act 
create hsas for low income individuals and allow such individuals use their hsas purchase health insurance none those 
bills have been adopted and cannot predict whether the affordable care act will repealed replaced materially modified

december president trump signed tax reform legislation into law addition overhauling the federal tax system 
the legislation also effective january repeals the penalties associated with the individual mandate the congressional 
budget office cbo has estimated that the repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate would result four 
million fewer people having health insurance million fewer people having health insurance and increase 
the average premiums the non group health insurance market most years the next decade the cbo has however also stated 
that the non group insurance markets would continue stable almost all areas the country during that period time 
cannot predict the impact that the repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate will have the number uninsureds 
the cost and availability health insurance 
addition the legislative efforts and administrative actions repeal replace modify the affordable care act there have 
been and will likely continue number legal challenges various provisions the affordable care act for example 
the house representatives the house filed lawsuit challenging the use federal funds pay insurance companies 
for cost sharing reductions that are provided certain individuals who purchase insurance through the affordable care act health 
insurance marketplace exchange the exchanges may the united states district court for the district columbia held 
that the use federal funds for the payment cost sharing reductions was unconstitutional because funds had been appropriated 
congress for that purpose the district court ruling being appealed and the court appeals for the district columbia 
circuit has allowed coalition state attorneys general intervene the proceedings october the department 
justice the doj announced court filings related the appeal that the department health and human services hhs was 
immediately stopping its cost sharing reduction payments insurance companies based the determination that those payments had 
not been appropriated congress eighteen states and the district columbia have filed lawsuit the district court for the 
northern district california seeking have the cost sharing reduction payments insurers restored and members congress 
have announced various plans that would restore the cost sharing reduction payments insurers for period two years 
december the parties the house lawsuit announced that they had reached conditional settlement that would essentially 
dismiss the lawsuit light the fact that the cost sharing reductions were longer being made cannot predict whether the 
court appeals for the district columbia circuit will approve the settlement agreement the outcome the new litigation that has 
been filed relating the cessation hhs cost sharing reduction payments insurance companies whether the cost sharing 
reduction payments will authorized congress the impact that the cessation hhs cost sharing reduction payments will 
have the premiums that are charged insurers the number insurers who offer health insurance coverage through the

unless specifically stated otherwise our summary provisions the affordable care act throughout the remainder this 
section and elsewhere this report are based the law currently effect 
expanded coverage 
based original cbo and cms estimates the affordable care act was originally expected expand coverage 
million additional individuals resulting coverage estimated the legal population this increased coverage 
was expected occur through combination public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms 
however july the cbo revised its estimate reflect the impact the supreme court determination that the 
provision the affordable care act that authorized the secretary hhs penalize states that choose not participate the 
expansion the medicaid program was unconstitutional and indicated that three million fewer individuals would have coverage 
result the decision for the cbo has estimated that while million people had coverage through the health insurance 
marketplaces one million people had coverage from state basic health programs and million people had coverage through 
medicaid and the children health insurance program chip due the affordable care act approximately million people 
still remained uninsured the cbo has also estimated that the number uninsured individuals will remain relatively unchanged 
million individuals from but has indicated that the repeal the individual mandate could result additional 
four million uninsured individuals and additional million uninsured individuals beginning and 
continuing throughout primarily result the expansion health insurance coverage experienced increase 
revenues from providing care certain previously uninsured individuals although expect this trend continue the future 
impact and timing such expansion remains difficult predict for the reasons discussed above will gradual and may not offset 
scheduled decreases reimbursement additionally cannot predict the impact the cessation cost sharing reduction payments 
the repeal the individual mandate any other modifications the affordable care act that may adopted 
medicaid expansion 
the primary public program coverage expansion has occurred through changes medicaid and lesser extent expansion 
chip the most significant changes expand the categories individuals eligible for medicaid coverage and permit individuals with 
relatively higher incomes qualify the federal government reimburses the majority state medicaid expenses and conditions 
its payment the state meeting certain requirements the federal government currently requires that states provide coverage for only 
limited categories low income adults under years old women who are pregnant and the blind disabled addition the 
income level required for individuals and families qualify for medicaid varies widely from state state 
table contents 
the affordable care act materially changed the requirements for medicaid eligibility originally enacted commencing 
january the affordable care act essentially required all state medicaid programs provide medicaid coverage virtually 
all adults under years old with incomes under the federal poverty level fpl addition the affordable care act 
also required states apply income disregard the medicaid eligibility standard that medicaid eligibility would 
effectively extended those with incomes the fpl offset the cost the medicaid program expansion the 
affordable care act authorized the federal government provide states with matching funds referred enhanced fmap 
cover the costs covering the newly eligible individuals beginning states began receiving enhanced fmap for the 
individuals enrolled medicaid pursuant the affordable care act the enhanced fmap percentage follows for cys 
through and and thereafter the cbo has estimated that the new 
eligibility requirements expanded medicaid and chip coverage estimated million individuals with 
disproportionately large percentage the new medicaid coverage likely states that currently have relatively low income 
eligibility requirements 
the supreme court held that the provision the affordable care act that authorized the secretary hhs 
penalize states that choose not participate the expansion the medicaid program removing all their existing medicaid 
funding was unconstitutional result the expansion the medicaid program all individuals under years old with incomes 
under the fpl became optional cms has stated that there deadline for states determine whether they will 
expand their medicaid programs and has indicated that state does decide expand its medicaid program may also decide 
drop the expanded coverage later date while the supreme court decision has resulted fewer individuals being covered 
the medicaid and chip programs unclear how many states will ultimately elect implement the medicaid expansion 
particularly light the possible repeal and replacement the affordable care act december only ten the states 
which operate have decided implement expansions their medicaid programs accordingly some low income persons 
states that have not expanded medicaid may not have insurance coverage intended the affordable care act addition cms 
recently approved demonstration waivers for the kentucky and indiana medicaid programs that among other things would require 
most able bodied working age adults who are medicaid beneficiaries work otherwise engaged their communities for 
hours per week and certain adult medicaid beneficiaries pay monthly premiums that are based the beneficiary income least 
eight other states including some which the company has facilities have similar demonstration program waiver requests pending 
before cms therefore are unable predict the future impact the medicaid expansion our business model financial 
condition result operations 
the affordable care act also provides that the federal government will subsidize states that create non medicaid plans for 
residents whose incomes are greater than the fpl but not exceed the fpl approved state plans will eligible 
receive federal funding the amount that funding per individual will equal subsidies that would have been provided 
for that individual had she enrolled health plan offered through one the exchanges discussed below 
addition since the affordable care act has allowed medicaid participating hospitals make presumptive 
determinations medicaid eligibility for certain categories individuals such pregnant women infants children and parents and 
other caretaker relatives and their spouses individual found presumptively eligible for medicaid benefits the hospital 
will get paid for the services provides during the temporary presumptive eligibility period just though the patient were already 
enrolled the medicaid program however states have significant flexibility developing their state specific presumptive eligibility 
rules and can establish standards that hospitals must meet order make presumptive eligibility determinations for example state 
may impose standards related the accuracy hospital presumptive eligibility determinations require hospitals tell individuals 
how apply for and obtain full medicaid application establish policies that require hospitals assist individuals completing 
medicaid application and develop proficiency standards trainings and audits with which hospitals must comply presumptive 
eligibility determination made accordance with the applicable federal and state presumptive eligibility requirements state will 
not permitted recoup money from the hospital for the services that were rendered during the presumptive eligibility period 
state may however disqualify hospital from making future presumptive eligibility determinations the hospital does not meet the 
state established performance standards 
private sector expansion 
the expansion health coverage through the private sector result the affordable care act will occur through new 
requirements health insurers employers and individuals commencing january health insurance companies were 
prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits dropping coverage excluding persons based upon pre existing conditions 
denying coverage for any individual who willing pay the premiums for such coverage since january each health plan 
has been required keep its annual non medical costs lower than premium revenue for the group market and lower than 
the small group and individual markets rebate its enrollees the amount spent excess the percentage addition since 
september health insurers have not been permitted deny coverage children based upon pre existing condition and 
must allow dependent care coverage for children years old 
table contents 
larger employers will continue subject new requirements and incentives provide health insurance benefits their full 
time employees effective january all employers subject the requirement are required offer health insurance coverage 
their full time employees and their dependents order avoid penalties the employer penalties range from 
per employee subject certain thresholds and conditions 
enacted the affordable care act uses various means induce individuals who not have health insurance obtain 
coverage for individuals and families below the fpl the cost obtaining health insurance will subsidized the federal 
government those with lower incomes will eligible receive greater subsidies facilitate the purchase health insurance 
individuals and small employers each state was required establish exchange january based cbo estimates 
approximately million individuals obtained their health insurance coverage through exchange health insurers 
participating the exchange must offer set minimum benefits defined hhs and may offer more benefits and must offer 
least two and five levels plans that vary the percentage medical expenses that must paid the enrollee each 
level plan must require the enrollee share certain specified percentages medical expenses the deductible payment 
limit health insurers may establish varying deductible payment levels statutory maximum the health insurers must cover 
the amount medical expenses excess the deductible payment limit for example individual making 
the fpl will have payments and deductibles reduced about one third the amount payable those with the same 
plan with incomes above the fpl 
any benefits from the expansion private sector coverage depend large part our success contracting with payers 
whose policies are listed the exchanges currently have contracts with exchange payers every state which operate 
and the reimbursement rates paid under those contracts generally are comparable that paid other private payers 
public program spending 
the affordable care act provides for medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare program spending reductions between 
and the cbo previously estimated that these program spending reductions would include billion medicare feefor service market basket and productivity reimbursement reductions for all providers the majority which would come from 
hospitals cms previously set this estimate billion the cbo estimate also included additional billion reductions

quality based payment adjustments and reductions for inpatient services 
the affordable care act established expanded provisions promote value based purchasing and link payments quality 
and efficiency among other things requires hhs implement value based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services 
this program rewards hospitals based either how well the hospitals perform certain quality measures how much the hospitals 
performance improves certain quality measures from their performance during baseline period part the program the 
affordable care act requires hhs reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges percentage beginning ffy 
and increasing for each fiscal year ffy and subsequent years hhs will pool the amount collected 
from these reductions fund payments reward hospitals that meet and exceed certain quality performance standards established 
hhs under the program each hospital performance evaluated during specified performance period and hospitals receive points 
each number pre determined measures based the higher their level achievement relative established 
standard their improvement performance from their performance during prior baseline period each hospital combined 
scores all the measures are translated into value based incentive payments hospitals that receive higher total performance scores 
receive higher incentive payments than those that receive lower total performance scores because the affordable care act provides 
that the funds pooled and otherwise set aside for the value based purchasing program will fully distributed hospitals with high 
scores may receive greater reimbursement under the value based purchasing program than they would have otherwise and hospitals 
with low scores may receive reduced medicare inpatient hospital payments 
addition the affordable care act prohibits the use federal funds under the medicaid program reimburse providers for 
medical assistance provided treat hacs with respect medicare hospitals that fall into the top national risk adjusted 
hac rates for all hospitals the previous year receive reduction their total medicare payments hospitals with excessive 
readmissions for conditions designated hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges not just discharges relating

defines excessive readmissions for these conditions will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges not just discharges 
relating the conditions subject the excessive readmission standard each hospital performance will publicly reported

medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments 
the medicare dsh program provides for additional payments hospitals that treat disproportionate share low income 
patients under the affordable care act beginning ffy medicare dsh payments were reduced the amount they 
otherwise would have been absent the new law the remaining the amount that would otherwise paid under medicare dsh 
will effectively pooled and this pool will reduced further each year formula that reflects reductions the national level 
uninsured who are under years age other words the greater the level coverage for the uninsured nationally the more the 
medicare dsh payment pool will reduced each hospital will then paid out the reduced dsh payment pool amount

competition for patients 
our hospitals and other healthcare businesses operate extremely competitive environments competition among healthcare 
providers occurs primarily the local level accordingly each facility develops its own strategies address competition locally 
hospital position within the geographic area which operates affected number competitive factors including but not 
limited

addition tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available our facilities such endowments 
charitable contributions tax exempt financing exemptions from sales property and income taxes and participation the

are prohibited from doing 
also face increasing competition from specialized care providers including freestanding emergency departments and 
outpatient surgery oncology physical therapy diagnostic and urgent care centers well competing services rendered physician 
offices the extent that other providers are successful developing specialized outpatient facilities our market share for those 
specialized services will likely decrease physician competition also has increased physicians some cases have become equity 
owners surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers which they refer patients some our hospitals have developed 
specialized outpatient facilities where necessary compete with these other providers 
competition for professionals 
our facilities must also compete for professional talent significant factor our future success will the ability our 
facilities attract and retain physicians physicians who decide whether patient admitted the hospital and the procedures 
performed seek attract physicians striving employ excellent nurses equipping our facilities with technologically 
advanced equipment and attractive date physical plant properly maintaining the equipment and physical plant and 
otherwise creating environment within which physicians choose practice while physicians may terminate their association with 
our facilities any time believe that striving maintain and improve the quality care our facilities and maintaining 
ethical and professional standards our facilities will better positioned attract and retain qualified physicians with variety 
specialties

also recruit physicians the communities which our facilities are located the types amount and duration compensation 
and assistance can provide recruited physicians are limited the federal physician self referral law stark law the antikickback statute state anti kickback and physician self referral statutes and related regulations the stark law requires among other 
things that recruitment assistance can only provided physicians who meet certain geographic and practice requirements that the 
amount assistance cannot changed during the term the recruitment agreement and that the recruitment payments cannot 
generally benefit physicians currently practice the community beyond recruitment costs actually incurred addition these 
legal requirements there competition from other communities and facilities for these physicians and this competition continues 
after the physician begins practicing one our communities 
many physicians today prefer employed rather than operating their own practices joining existing medical groups our 
hospitals and affiliated entities had more employed physicians the end than the end when employing officebased physicians also often employ office employees and other personnel necessary support these physicians and incur 
additional expenses result expect this trend continue 
compete with other healthcare providers recruiting and retaining qualified management and staff personnel responsible for 
the day day operations each our facilities including nurses and other non physician healthcare professionals some markets 
the scarce availability nurses and other medical support personnel presents significant operating issue this shortage may require 
enhance wages and benefits recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel recruit personnel from foreign

government regulation 
overview 
all participants the healthcare industry are required comply with extensive government regulations the federal state and 
local levels under these laws and regulations facilities must meet requirements for licensure and qualify participate 
government healthcare programs including the medicare and medicaid programs these requirements relate the adequacy 
medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures maintenance adequate records rate setting compliance with 
building codes and environmental protection laws fail comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject 
criminal penalties and civil sanctions and our facilities may lose their licenses and ability participate medicare and medicaid 
addition government regulations frequently change when regulations change may required make changes our facilities 
equipment personnel and services that our facilities remain licensed and qualified participate these programs believe that 
our facilities are substantial compliance with current federal state and local regulations and standards 
acute care hospitals are subject periodic inspection federal state and local authorities determine their compliance with 
applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing certification and accreditation all our hospitals are currently 
licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified participate the medicare and medicaid programs addition 
december with the exception bluegrass and miners all our hospitals were accredited the joint commission 
utilization and claim review 
federal law contains numerous provisions designed ensure that services rendered medicare and medicaid patients meet 
professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed these 
provisions include requirement that sampling admissions medicare and medicaid patients must reviewed quality 
improvement organizations which review the appropriateness medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges the 
quality care provided the validity drg classifications and the appropriateness cases extraordinary length stay 
cost post discharge basis quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services assess fines and also have the 
authority recommend hhs that provider which substantial noncompliance with the standards the quality improvement 
organization excluded from participation the medicare program utilization review also requirement most nongovernmental managed care organizations 
table contents 
addition utilization reviews cms has also adopted nationwide claim review and provider education program known the 
targeted probe and educate tpe program which intended reduce errors the claims submission process and focuses 
items and services that pose the greatest risk the medicare program that have high national error rate under the tpe program 
medicare administrative contractors macs and each individually mac use data analysis identify providers who for 
particular item service have high claim denial rates billing practices that vary significantly from their peers once provider has 
been identified the mac reviews between and the provider claims for the item service and issues are noted offers the 
provider individualized education session that based the results the review the provider then generally given days 
improve its systems and processes and after that period has ended the mac conducts another review the provider claims 
additional issues are identified the provider given the opportunity for another education session providers are typically given three 
rounds review and education before being referred cms for further action such pre payment rac review 
value based purchasing 
there trend the healthcare industry toward value based purchasing healthcare services these value based purchasing 
programs include both public reporting quality data and preventable adverse events tied the quality and efficiency care 
provided facilities governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals report certain quality 
data receive full reimbursement updates addition medicare does not reimburse for care related certain preventable adverse 
events reduces payments hospitals that have high hac rates and rewards hospitals that meet exceed certain quality performance 
standards established cms many large commercial payers currently require hospitals report quality data and several 
commercial payers also not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events 
fraud and abuse laws 
participation medicare and medicaid programs heavily regulated federal statutes and regulations hospital fails 
comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing the facility activities the hospital participation the medicare 
and medicaid programs may terminated and civil criminal penalties may imposed for example hospital may lose its 
ability participate medicare and medicaid programs among other things 
submits claims medicare and medicaid for services not provided misrepresents actual services provided order 
obtain higher payments

under federal state healthcare program 
fails provide appropriate emergency medical screening services any individual who comes hospital campus 
otherwise fails properly treat and transfer emergency patients 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa broadened the scope the fraud and abuse laws 
adding several criminal statutes that apply all health plans regardless whether any payments such plans are made 
through federal healthcare program addition hipaa created civil penalties for certain proscribed conduct including upcoding 
and billing for medically unnecessary goods services and established new enforcement mechanisms combat fraud and abuse 
these new mechanisms include bounty system where portion the payments recovered returned the applicable government 
agency well whistleblower program hipaa also expanded the categories persons that may excluded from participation

addition issuing new regulations applying new interpretations existing rules regulations the federal government has 
modified its approach for ensuring compliance with and enforcing penalties for violations the stark law cms also issued 
self referral disclosure protocol for hospitals and other providers that wish self disclose potential violations the stark law and

amounts set forth the statute 
federal false claims act 
the federal false claims act prohibits providers from among other things knowingly submitting false fraudulent claims for 
payment the federal government and failing refund identified overpayments received from the government the federal false 
claims act defines the term knowingly broadly and while simple negligence generally will not give rise liability submitting 
claim with reckless disregard its truth falsity can constitute the knowing submission false fraudulent claim for the 
purposes the false claims act the qui tam whistleblower provisions the false claims act allow private individuals 
bring actions under the false claims act behalf the government these private parties are entitled share any amounts 
recovered the government and result the number whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has 
increased significantly recent years when private party brings qui tam action under the federal false claims act the defendant 
will generally not aware the lawsuit until the government makes determination whether will intervene and take lead the 
litigation provider found liable under the federal false claims act the provider may required pay three times 
the actual damages sustained the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties between for each 
separate false claim accordance with the requirements the act the civil monetary penalties for violations the false 
claims act are also subject annual adjustments for inflation the government and whistleblowers have used the federal false 
claims act prosecute medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such coding errors billing for services not 
provided submitting false cost reports and providing care that not medically necessary that substandard quality 
changes the regulatory environment 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act fera expanded the scope the federal false claims act among 
other things creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding decreasing obligation pay money the federal 
government and broadening protections for whistleblowers addition the affordable care act made several significant changes 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws including providing additional enforcement tools the government increasing cooperation between 
agencies establishing mechanisms for the sharing information and enhancing criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance for example the affordable care act provides million increased federal funding over years fight 
healthcare fraud waste and abuse expands the scope the rac program include medicaid authorizes hhs 
consultation with the oig suspend medicare and medicaid payments provider services supplier pending 
investigation credible allegation fraud provides medicare contractors with additional flexibility conduct random 
prepayment reviews and requires providers adopt compliance programs that meet certain specified requirements condition 
their medicare enrollment the affordable care act also expanded the scope the false claims act cover payments 
connection with the exchanges those payments include any federal funds and provides that claims submitted connection with 
patient referrals that result from violations the stark law the anti kickback statute constitute false claims for the purposes the 
federal false claims act 
addition the changes mentioned above the affordable care act created federal false claims act liability for the knowing 
failure report and return overpayment within days the identification the overpayment the date which 
corresponding cost report due whichever later february cms published final rule that provides clarification 
around the meaning overpayment identification and generally establishes six year lookback period for medicare part and part 
providers and suppliers avoid liability providers must among other things carefully and accurately code claims for 
reimbursement promptly return overpayments accurately prepare cost reports and timely resolve credit balances light the 
provisions fera and the affordable care act relating reporting and refunding overpayments and the robust funding for 
enforcement activities and audits increasing number healthcare providers have self reported potential violations law 
including technical violations certain fraud and abuse laws and refunded overpayments avoid incurring fines and penalties 
likely such refunds and voluntary disclosures will continue the future and will make such refunds and disclosures accordance 
with the law finally the act requires each agency including hhs and the doj make annual inflation adjustments civil 
monetary penalty amounts including those that may assessed under the stark law and false claims act based updates the 
consumer price index lesser amount the agency involved determines that increasing the civil monetary penalty amount the 
consumer price index would have negative economic impact the costs the increase outweigh the benefits

state laws 
many the states which operate have adopted laws similar the anti kickback statute and the stark law these state 
laws are generally very broad scope and typically apply patients whose treatment covered the medicaid program and 
some cases all patients regardless payment source addition many the states which operate have false claims statutes 
that impose civil and criminal liability for the types acts prohibited the federal false claims act that otherwise prohibit the 
submission false fraudulent claims the state government medicaid program violations these laws are punishable civil 
and criminal penalties and many cases the loss the facility license although believe that our operations and 
arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with the applicable state fraud and abuse laws most these laws 
have not been interpreted any court governmental agency and there can assurance that the regulatory authorities 
responsible for enforcing these laws will determine that our arrangements comply with the applicable requirements 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act

such transferring the patient the closest hospital with emergency department there are severe penalties under the emtala 
hospital fails screen appropriately stabilize transfer patient the hospital delays appropriate treatment order first

addition injured patient the patient family medical facility that suffers financial loss direct result another 
hospital violation the law can bring civil suit against that other hospital cms has actively enforced the emtala and has

results differ from our expectations 
our revenues will decline the federal government reduces payments made the medicare program healthcare providers 
its funding the medicaid program states reduce the coverage and funding their medicaid programs 
derived our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs collectively numerous factors could 
materially decrease delay timing medicare and medicaid payments our facilities these factors include reduction 
payments for services adverse determinations concerning patient and provider eligibility the method calculating reimbursements 
and requirements for utilization review furthermore the affordable care act amended the pathway act and pama the tax 
relief act and the atra provide for material scheduled reductions the growth medicare and medicaid program spending 
including reductions market basket updates and dsh funding 
recent years have benefited from the expansion medicaid under the affordable care act however number states 
have adopted are considering legislation designed reduce their medicaid expenditures including enrolling medicaid recipients 
managed care programs and imposing additional taxes hospitals help finance such states medicaid systems addition cms 
has recently approved demonstration waivers for the kentucky and indiana medicaid programs that among other things impose work 
community engagement and income based premiums certain adult medicaid beneficiaries and least eight other states 
including some which the company has facilities have similar waiver requests pending before cms also part the 
movement repeal replace modify the affordable care act and means reduce the federal budget deficit there are renewed 
congressional efforts move medicaid from open ended program with coverage and benefits set the federal government one 
which states receive fixed amount federal funds either through block grants per capita caps and have more flexibility 
determine benefits eligibility provider payments those changes are implemented cannot predict whether the amount fixed 
federal funding the states will based current payment amounts will based lower payment amounts which would 
negatively impact those states that expanded their medicaid programs response the affordable care act such efforts reduce 
federal funding the medicaid program well those that would reduce the amount federal medicaid matching funding 
available states curtailing the use provider taxes could have negative impact state medicaid budgets resulting less 
coverage for eligible individuals 
expect that efforts impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls and beneficiary requirements government 
payers will continue thereby reducing the payments receive for our services and possibly reducing the number individuals 
eligible for such programs reimbursement from medicare and medicaid reduced the scope services covered 
medicare and medicaid limited there could material adverse effect our revenues and results operations 
changes the payer mix patients reimbursement methodologies consolidation among commercial insurance companies 
and shifts insurance plans with narrow networks high deductibles high payments could adversely affect our revenues and 
results operations 
the amounts receive for services provided patients are determined number factors including the payer mix our 
patients and the reimbursement methodologies and rates utilized our patients recent years have seen shifts patients from 
commercial and private insurance medicare and medicaid programs and from traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid 
programs managed medicare and medicaid programs reimbursement rates are generally lower for medicare and medicaid 
beneficiaries than they are for patients whose treatment are covered commercial and private insurance and for managed medicare 
and medicaid beneficiaries than they are for traditional medicare and medicaid beneficiaries however also experience payer mix 
pressures aging populations our non urban communities shift from commercial insurance programs medicare managed 
medicare programs our revenues and results operations may adversely affected these shifts 
addition payments from hmos ppos insurance companies employers and other private payers are the result negotiated 
rates the healthcare industry has experienced trend consolidation among commercial insurance companies resulting fewer 
but larger insurance companies that have significant bargaining power given their market share result payers increasingly are 
demanding discounted fee structures the assumption healthcare providers all portion the financial risk related paying 
for care provided this includes moving away from percent charge payment structure fixed payment which typically reduces 
our reimbursement rate and limits our ability raise prices going forward addition other healthcare providers including some 
with greater financial resources greater geographic coverage wider range services may negotiate exclusivity provisions with 
managed care plans otherwise restrict the ability managed care plans contract with 
table contents 
additionally commercial insurance plans and plans provided through the exchanges are increasingly using narrow and tiered 
networks that limit beneficiary provider choices and impose increased financial liability beneficiaries who use certain tiers 
providers these payers may also restrict exclude our facilities and employed physicians from participation their networks the 
increased utilization narrow and tiered networks has increased the bargaining power commercial insurance companies and the 
potential adverse impact ceasing contracted provider with any such insurer 
there are also increasing number patients enrolling insurance plans with high deductibles high payments including 
those purchased the exchanges which increase the amount due from the patient and may result reimbursement for lower 
portion the total payment amount relative traditional employer sponsored health insurance plans for the healthcare services 
provided our facilities and employed physicians patients enrolled higher deductible and payment plans tend defer elective

medicaid dsh payments are federally required made the states hospitals that serve significant numbers medicaid and 
uninsured patients recognition the added costs incurred hospitals treating these patients the total amount medicaid 
dsh payments state may make and the total amount any one hospital may receive are both capped federal law unlike medicaid 
dsh payments upl payments are not required made states under federal law rather federal regulations establish upper 
payment limit above which states may not receive federal matching dollars upl programs have expanded recent years and related 
msps our hospitals have similarly increased states use upl programs way avoid mitigate reimbursement cuts 
providers however anticipate that there will reduction such payments 
pursuant the affordable care act amended the pathway act pama macra and the act funding for medicaid 
dsh programs significantly reduced beginning ffy because many the states which operate have not 
expanded medicaid programs intended under the affordable care act the reduction medicaid dsh payments may take place

other hospitals and outpatient facilities provide services similar those which offer addition physicians provide

therefore adversely affect our revenues and results operations 
competition among hospitals and other healthcare service providers including outpatient facilities has intensified recent years 
also have acquired and may continue acquire larger facilities more concentrated population centers which experience 
greater competition for healthcare services compete with other hospitals including larger tertiary care centers located 
metropolitan areas although the hospitals with which compete may significant distance away from our facilities patients 
our markets may migrate their own may referred local physicians may required their health plan travel 
these hospitals furthermore some the hospitals with which compete may offer more different services than those available 
our facilities may have more advanced equipment technology may have medical staff that perceived better qualified 
also compete with hospitals and health systems that are implementing physician alignment strategies such employing 
physicians acquiring physician practice groups and participating acos other clinical integration models which may impact our 
competitive position many the hospitals that compete with our facilities are owned tax supported governmental agencies 
not for profit entities supported endowments and charitable contributions and are eligible participate the program

quality care and value based purchasing have also become significant trends and competitive factors the healthcare industry 
cms makes public the performance data relating multiple quality measures that hospitals submit connection with their medicare 
reimbursement the publicly available performance data become primary factor where patients choose receive care and 
competing hospitals have better results than our hospitals those measures our revenues and patient volumes could decline 
also face significant and increasing competition from services offered physicians including physicians our medical 
staffs their offices and from other specialized care providers including freestanding emergency departments and outpatient 
surgery oncology physical therapy diagnostic and urgent care centers including many which physicians may have ownership 
interest also compete with specialty hospitals that focus one small number lucrative service lines some which are 
not required operate emergency departments some our hospitals have and will seek develop outpatient facilities where 
necessary compete effectively however the extent that other providers are successful developing outpatient facilities 
physicians are able offer additional advanced services their offices our market share for these services will likely decrease the 
future 
the industry emphasis value based purchasing and bundled payment arrangements may negatively affect our revenues 
there trend the healthcare industry toward value based purchasing healthcare services and bundled payment 
arrangements these value based purchasing programs include among other things programs that require public reporting quality 
data and tie reimbursement the quality and efficiency care that provided facility for example medicare and medicaid 
currently require hospitals report certain quality data receive full reimbursement updates addition beginning the 
qpp which was created macra will used adjust payments that are made physicians under the pfs based the value 
and quality care that provided medicare also does not reimburse for care related certain hospital acquired conditions and 
reduces reimbursement hospitals that have excessive readmissions many large commercial payers currently require hospitals 
report quality data and several commercial payers also not reimburse hospitals for certain hospital acquired conditions bundled 
payment arrangements generally set single target spending level for all healthcare services provided patient during episode 
care and are intended create incentives for physicians hospitals and other providers work together provide higher quality and 
more coordinated care lower cost while participation most bundled payment arrangements voluntary cms made 
participation the cjr model bundled payment arrangements mandatory for some providers 
expect value based purchasing programs become more common and involve higher percentage procedures and 
payments given cms recent announcement that intends increase opportunities for providers participate voluntary 
initiatives rather than large mandatory bundled payment models are unable this time predict how this trend will affect our 
results operations however could negatively affect our revenues 
not effectively attract recruit and retain qualified physicians our ability deliver healthcare services efficiently will 
adversely affected 
the success our facilities depends part the number and quality the physicians the medical staffs our hospitals 
the success our efforts recruit and retain quality physicians depends several factors including the actual and perceived 
quality services provided our facilities our ability meet demands for new technology our ability identify and communicate

ability our facilities offer and sustain employment arrangements particular face intense competition the recruitment 
and retention specialists and primary care physicians may not able recruit all the physicians target 
additionally our ability recruit and employ physicians closely regulated for example the types amount and duration 
compensation and assistance can provide recruited physicians are limited the stark law the anti kickback statute state antikickback and physician self referral statutes and related regulations all arrangements with physicians must also fair market value 
and commercially reasonable 
addition these legal requirements there competition from other communities and facilities for these physicians and this 
competition continues after the physician practicing one our communities for example integrated acos and other kinds 
narrow provider networks organizations may exclude our physicians from their plans networks healthcare providers our 
affiliated providers are excluded from such networks may have difficulty recruiting new providers retaining existing providers 
generally small number attending physicians within each our facilities represent large share our inpatient revenues 
and admissions the loss one more these physicians even temporary could cause material reduction our revenues 
which could take significant time and operational resources replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and 
retaining physicians

our facilities face competition for management and other non physician staffing which may increase labor costs and reduce 
profitability labor union activity could raise costs and interfere with our operations 
addition our physicians the operations our facilities are dependent the efforts abilities and experience our 
management and medical support personnel such nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and the available labor pool semiskilled and unskilled employees compete with other healthcare providers recruiting and retaining qualified management and 
staff personnel responsible for the day day operations each our facilities including nurses and other non physician healthcare 
professionals some markets the scarce availability nurses and other medical support personnel presents significant operating 
issue and the competition for experienced and talented hospital management personnel intense this may result employee 
turnover require enhance wages and benefits recruit and retain management nurses and other medical support personnel hire 
more expensive temporary contract personnel and recruit personnel from foreign countries which may limited changes 
immigration law regulation and policy addition the states which operate could adopt mandatory nurse staffing ratios 
could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already place state mandated nurse staffing ratios could significantly affect labor 
costs and have adverse impact revenues are required limit admissions order meet the required ratios 
increased ongoing labor union activity another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs otherwise adversely 
impact for example currently have ongoing labor negotiations health system marquette and have labor 
agreements that will expire five our facilities significant portion our employee base unionizes our labor costs 
could increase significantly addition when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions whether such agreements are 
renewals first contracts there the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process and our continued operation 
during any strikes could increase our labor costs

health care reform efforts 
the affordable care act which became federal law dramatically altered the healthcare system and was intended 
decrease the number uninsured americans and reduce the overall cost healthcare among other things requiring most 
americans obtain health insurance the individual mandate providing additional funding for medicaid states that choose 
expand their programs reducing medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments providers expanding the medicare 
program use value based purchasing programs tying hospital payments the satisfaction certain quality criteria bundling 
payments hospitals and other providers and instituting certain private health insurance reforms the affordable care act also 
includes certain reductions medicare spending such negative adjustments the inpatient prospective payment system and 
outpatient prospective payment system market basket updates the revision annual inflation updates and other cost containment 
measures including planned payment reductions since have expended substantial cost and effort prepare for and comply 
with the affordable care act which has been implemented rolling basis 
january president trump issued executive order that among other things stated that was the intent his 
administration repeal the affordable care act and pending that repeal instructed the executive branch the federal government 
defer delay the implementation any provision requirement the affordable care act that would impose fiscal burden 
any state cost fee tax penalty any individual family health care provider health insurer 
october president trump issued another executive order related the affordable care act that intended 
promote choice and competition the health insurance marketplace and among other things requires the secretaries the 
departments health and human services labor and the treasury consider proposing regulations revising existing guidance 
that would expand access health insurance coverage allowing more employers form association health plans that would 
allowed provide coverage across state lines increasing the availability short term limited duration health insurance plans which 
are generally not subject the requirements the affordable care act and increasing the availability and permitted use health 
reimbursement arrangements 
addition the executive orders number bills have been introduced congress that would repeal the affordable care act 
and would replace with varying health coverage plans including plans that would allow insurers sell health insurance across state 
lines allow the use health savings accounts hsas without high deductible plan give states the option either keep the 
coverage framework created the affordable care act expanded medicaid individual subsidies and insurance exchanges 
utilize the increased federal funding that was intended provided the federal government under the affordable care act 
create hsas for low income individuals and allow such individuals use their hsas purchase health insurance none those 
bills have been adopted and cannot predict whether the affordable care act will repealed replaced materially modified 
congress addition the affordable care act repealed replaced materially modified cannot predict what the replacement 
plan modifications would when any such replacement plan modifications would become effective whether any the 
existing provisions the affordable care act would remain place 
table contents 
december president trump signed tax reform legislation into law addition overhauling the federal tax system 
the legislation also repeals the penalties associated with the individual mandate effective january the congressional 
budget office cbo has estimated that the repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate would result four million 
fewer people having health insurance million fewer people having health insurance and increase the 
average premiums the non group health insurance market most years the next decade the cbo has however also stated that 
the non group insurance markets would continue stable almost all areas the country during that period time cannot 
predict the impact that the repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate will have the number uninsureds the 
cost and availability health insurance 
addition the legislative efforts and administrative actions repeal replace modify the affordable care act there have 
been and will likely continue number legal challenges various provisions the affordable care act for example 
the house representatives the house filed lawsuit challenging the use federal funds pay insurance companies 
for cost sharing reductions that are provided certain individuals who purchase insurance through the affordable care act health 
insurance marketplace exchange the exchanges may the united states district court for the district columbia held 
that the use federal funds for the payment cost sharing reductions was unconstitutional because funds had been appropriated 
congress for that purpose the district court ruling being appealed and the court appeals for the district columbia 
circuit has allowed coalition state attorneys general intervene the proceedings october the department 
justice the doj announced court filings related the appeal that the department health and human services hhs was 
immediately stopping its cost sharing reduction payments insurance companies based the doj determination that those 
payments had not been appropriated congress eighteen states and the district columbia have filed lawsuit the district 
court for the northern district california seeking have the cost sharing reduction payments insurers restored and members 
congress have announced various plans that would restore the cost sharing reduction payments insurers for period two years 
december the parties the house lawsuit announced that they had reached conditional settlement agreement that 
would essentially dismiss the lawsuit light the fact that the cost sharing reductions were longer being made cannot predict 
whether the court appeals for the district columbia circuit will approve the settlement agreement the outcome the new 
litigation that has been filed relating the cessation hhs cost sharing reduction payments insurance companies whether the 
cost sharing reduction payments will authorized congress the impact that the cessation hhs cost sharing reduction

law complexity lack complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the sporadic implementation the 
numerous programs designed improve access and quality additional variables related the affordable care act impacting our

competitive and structural environment 
the environment which our facilities operate extremely competitive our hospitals face competition from other acute care 
hospitals including larger tertiary hospitals located larger markets and affiliated with universities specialty hospitals that focus 
one small number very lucrative service lines but that are not required operate emergency departments freestanding 
emergency departments and outpatient surgery diagnostic cancer care and urgent care centers and physicians the medical staffs 
our hospitals many cases our competitors focus the service lines that offer the highest margins doing our competitors 
can potentially draw the best paying business out our hospitals this turn can reduce the overall operating profit our hospitals 
are often obligated offer service lines that operate loss that have much lower profit margins continue see the 
shift increasingly complex procedures from the inpatient the outpatient setting and have also seen growth the general shift 
lower acuity procedures physician offices and other non hospital outpatient settings these trends have contributed decreases 
admissions and surgical volumes and have some extent offset our efforts improve equivalent admission rates many our 
hospitals 
table contents 
our hospitals also face extreme competition their efforts recruit and retain physicians their medical staffs widely 
recognized that the has shortage physicians certain practice areas including primary care physicians and specialists such 
cardiologists oncologists urologists and orthopedists various areas the country this fact and our ability overcome these 
shortages directly relevant our growth strategies because cardiologists oncologists urologists and orthopedists are often the 
physicians highest demand communities where our hospitals are located larger tertiary medical centers are acquiring physician 
practices and employing physicians some our communities while physicians these practices may continue members 
the medical staffs our hospitals they may less likely refer patients our hospitals over time 
believe other key factors our competition for patients the quality our patient care and the perception that quality 
the communities where our facilities are located which may influenced among other things the technology service lines and 
capital improvements made our facilities and the skills and experience our non physician employees involved patient care 
addition competitive concerns many our communities are experiencing slow growth and some cases population losses 
believe this trend has occurred mainly result recent challenging economic conditions because the economies the nonurban communities which our facilities primarily operate are often dependent small number larger employers especially 
manufacturing other facilities this causes the economies our communities more sensitive economic downturns and 
slower rebound when the overall economy improves addition other economic factors including potentially self rationing 
healthcare services have made more difficult increase the number patients who seek care many our facilities 
business strategy 
order achieve growth patient volumes revenues and profitability given the competitive and structural environment 
continue focus our business strategy the following 
measurement and improvement quality patient care and perceptions such quality communities where our facilities 
are located 
targeted recruiting primary care physicians and physicians key specialties 
retention physicians and efforts improve physician satisfaction including employing greater number primary care 
physicians well physicians certain specialties 
retention and where needed recruitment non physician employees involved patient care and efforts improve 
employee satisfaction 
targeted investments new technologies new service lines and capital improvements our facilities 
improvements management expenses and revenue cycle 
negotiation improved reimbursement rates with non governmental payers 
strategic growth through acquisition and integration hospitals and other healthcare facilities where valuations are attractive 
and can identify opportunities for improved financial performance through our management ownership and 
developing strategic partnerships with not for profit healthcare providers achieve growth new regions 
part our ongoing efforts further manage costs and improve the results our revenue cycle have partnered with third 
party provide certain nonclinical business functions including payroll processing supply chain management and revenue cycle 
functions believe this model sharing centralized resources support common business functions across multi facility 
enterprises provides efficiencies and the most cost effective approach managing these nonclinical business functions 
regulatory environment 
our business and our facilities are highly regulated and the penalties for noncompliance can severe are required comply 
with extensive complicated and overlapping government laws and regulations the federal state and local levels these laws and 
regulations govern every aspect how our hospitals conduct their operations from what service lines must offered order 
licensed acute care hospital whether our hospitals may employ physicians and how and whether our hospitals may 
receive payments pursuant the medicare and medicaid programs the failure comply with these laws and regulations can result 
severe penalties including criminal penalties civil sanctions and the loss our ability receive reimbursements through the 
medicare and medicaid programs the refund such payments previously received 
table contents 
not only are our facilities heavily regulated but the rules regulations and laws which they are subject often change with little 
notice and are often interpreted and applied differently various regulatory agencies with authority enforce such 
requirements each change conflicting interpretation may require our facilities make changes space usage equipment 
personnel services and may also require that standard operating policies and procedures written and implemented the cost 
complying with such laws and regulations significant component our overall expenses further this expense has grown 
recent periods because new regulatory requirements and the severity the penalties associated with non compliance management 
anticipates that compliance expenses will continue grow the foreseeable future the healthcare industry has seen number 
ongoing investigations related patient referrals physician recruiting and employment practices cost reporting and billing practices 
medical necessity inpatient admissions physician office leasing laboratory and home healthcare services physician ownership 
hospitals and other healthcare providers and joint ventures involving hospitals and physicians hospitals continue one the 
primary focal areas the office inspector general oig the doj and other governmental fraud and abuse programs 
the affordable care act imposed affirmative obligation healthcare providers report and refund any overpayments 
received overpayments this context include any amount received from government program provider which not 
entitled regardless the cause such overpayments are deemed fraudulent and become violations the false claims act not 
reported and refunded within the later days identification the date any corresponding cost report due applicable 
hospitals can meet the obligation report and refund three ways refunding overpayments directly the program selfdisclosing the overpayment the oig via its voluntary self disclosure protocol with respect false claims act and other violations 
not related the federal physician self referral law stark law and self disclosing the centers for medicare and medicaid 
services cms via the self referral disclosure protocol with respect overpayments caused potential violations the stark 
law only for which cms has the authority reduce the amounts otherwise owed 
revenue sources 
our facilities generate revenues providing healthcare services our patients depending upon the patient medical insurance 
coverage are paid for these services governmental medicare and medicaid programs commercial insurance including 
managed care organizations and directly the patient the amounts are paid for providing healthcare services our patients 
vary depending upon the payer governmental payers generally pay significantly less than the hospital customary charges for the 
services provided insured patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and the 
amounts received from commercial insurance payers however insured patients are responsible for payments not covered 
insurance such exclusions deductibles and payments 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
revenues from governmental payers such medicare and medicaid are controlled complex rules and regulations that 
stipulate the amount hospital paid for providing healthcare services must comply with these rules and regulations continue 
eligible participate the medicare and medicaid programs these rules and regulations are subject frequent changes 
result legislative and administrative action and annual payment adjustments both the federal and the state levels 
addition medicare payment methodologies have been and are expected continue revised significantly based cost 
containment and policy considerations while cms has already implemented number the medicare reimbursement reductions 
required the affordable care act additional reductions will become effective the future and some the reductions that have 
already been imposed cms will increased accordance with the terms the affordable care act additionally the middle 
class tax relief and job creation act and the american taxpayer relief act require further reductions medicare 
payments and the budget control act bca imposed reduction medicare spending effective april 
the bipartisan budget act bba extended the reduction medicare spending through ffy and the bipartisan 
budget act the act which provides approximately billion discretionary spending sequestration relief for 
ffys and further extends the reduction medicare spending through additionally effective january 
the bba reduced medicare payments off campus hospital outpatient departments that were not billing the medicare program for 
covered outpatient services prior november which limits our ability expand the scope and profitability outpatient 
services offer off campus locations 
april medicare access and the chip reauthorization act macra was enacted among other things 
macra the medicare dependent hospital program which provides enhanced payment support for rural hospitals that have more 
than beds and least their inpatient days discharges covered medicare and the medicare low volume hospital 
program which provides additional medicare reimbursement for general acute care hospitals that are located certain distance from 
another general acute care hospital and have less than certain number medicare discharges each fiscal year through september 
the act which was enacted february extended both these programs through ffy 
table contents 
medicaid programs are funded both state governments and federal matching funds provide healthcare benefits certain low 
income individuals and groups recent years have benefited from the expansion medicaid under the affordable care act 
however number states have adopted are considering legislation designed reduce their medicaid expenditures including 
enrolling medicaid recipients managed care programs and imposing additional taxes hospitals help finance such states 
medicaid systems addition cms has recently approved demonstration waivers for the kentucky and indiana medicaid programs 
that among other things impose work and community engagement and income based premiums certain adult medicaid 
beneficiaries and least eight other states including some which have facilities have similar waiver requests pending also 
part the movement repeal replace modify the affordable care act and means reduce the federal budget deficit there 
are renewed congressional efforts move medicaid from open ended program with coverage and benefits set the federal 
government one which states receive fixed amount federal funds either through block grants per capita caps and have 
more flexibility determine benefits eligibility provider payments those changes are implemented cannot predict whether 
the amount fixed federal funding the states will based current payment amounts will based lower payment 
amounts which would negatively impact those states that expanded their medicaid programs response the affordable care act 
such efforts reduce federal funding the medicaid program well those that would reduce the amount federal medicaid 
matching funding available states curtailing the use provider taxes could have negative impact state medicaid budgets 
resulting less coverage for eligible individuals 
given the reduced federal financing expanded medicaid programs that took effect and light the possible repeal 
replacement modification the affordable care act are unable predict how many any additional states which 
operate will expand their medicaid programs how many any the states which operate that have expanded their 
medicaid programs will keep their expansions place the future 
furthermore pursuant the affordable care act amended the pathway for sgr reform act protecting access 
medicare act pama macra and the act funding for medicaid dsh programs significantly reduced 
beginning ffy because many the states which operate have not expanded medicaid programs intended under the 
affordable care act the reduction medicaid dsh payments may take place without coupled increase the medicaid eligible 
population thus increasing the net amount uncompensated care provide

multiple legislative acts delaying application the sgr the pfs 
april macra was enacted into law which replaced the sgr formula with new systems for establishing the annual 
updates payments made under the pfs under macra the pfs payment rates that were effect when macra was enacted 
were extended through june and then increased for the remainder calendar year cy and increased 
additional for cys through and after the adoption the act will increased for pfs 
payment rates would then remain their levels through beginning amounts paid individual

maintenance organizations hmos preferred provider organizations ppos and other private insurers revenues from hmos 
ppos and other private insurers are subject contracts and other arrangements that require discount the amounts 
customarily charge for healthcare services accept fixed pre determined fees for our services these discounted arrangements often 
limit our ability increase charges revenues response increasing costs actively negotiate with these payers effort 
maintain increase the pricing our healthcare services however have control over patients switching their healthcare 
coverage payer with which have negotiated less favorable reimbursement rates recent years increasing number our 
patients have moved lower cost healthcare coverage plans and such plans generally provide lower reimbursement rates and require 
patients pay increased portion the costs care through deductibles payments exclusions additionally plans 
purchased through the exchanges are increasingly using narrow and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices 
provide services when are not participating provider the network can result higher patient responsibility amounts that 
patient may not have the ability pay may choose not pay expect these trends continue the coming years

our estimated reserves for self insured claims will significantly affected current and future claims differ from historical 
trends while monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes when determining our reserves for self insured 
claims the complexity the claims the extended period time settle the claims and the wide range potential outcomes 
complicates the estimation process addition certain states have passed varying forms tort reform which attempt limit the 
amount awards such laws are passed the states where our hospitals are located our loss estimates could decrease 
our estimate reserves for self insured and deductible claims are based upon actuarial calculations and are significantly 
influenced key assumptions and other factors these factors include but are not limited historical paid claims trending loss 
development factors trends the frequency and severity claims which can differ significantly jurisdiction result the 
legislative and judicial climate such jurisdictions coverage limits third party insurance and actuarial determined statistical 
confidence levels given the number assumptions and characteristics each assumption considered establishing the reserves for 
self insured claims difficult compute the individual financial impact each assumption groups assumptions some the 
assumptions are dependent upon the quantitative measurement other assumptions and therefore are not accurately evaluated 
isolation for example change the frequency claims assumption also affected the estimated severity these claims 
resulting inability properly isolate and quantify the impact change this assumption 
professional and general liability claims are typically resolved over extended period time often long five years more

changing that single item 
ultimately from actuarial standpoint the sensitivity the estimates reserves for self insured claims reflected the 
various actuarial confidence levels our best estimate our reserves for self insured claims utilizes statistical confidence level that 
higher statistical confidence levels while not representative our best estimate reflect reasonably likely outcomes upon the 
ultimate resolution related claims using higher statistical confidence level would increase the estimated reserves for self insured

our estimates reserves for self insured claims are non cash charges and accordingly not impact our liquidity capital resources

the combination changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results loss estimation process 
that requires actuarial skill and the application judgment and such estimates require periodic revision result the variety 
factors that must considered there risk that actual incurred losses may develop differently from estimates the results our

estimate the fair value stock options granted using binomial lattice option valuation model and single option award 
approach use binomial lattice option valuation model because considers characteristics fair value option pricing such 
option contractual term and the probability exercise before the end the contractual term addition the complications 
surrounding the expected term option are material indicated asc given our relatively large pool unexercised 
options believe binomial lattice option valuation model that specifically addresses this fact and models full term exercises 
the most appropriate and reliable means valuing our stock options are amortizing the fair value straight line basis over the 
requisite service periods the awards which are the vesting periods three four years the stock options vest either 
each grant anniversary date over three four years continued employment

appropriate based analysis our historical exercise patterns 
expected volatility 
volatility measure the tendency investment returns vary around long term average rate historical volatility 
appropriate starting point for setting this assumption accordance with asc according asc companies should 
also consider how future experience may differ from the past this may require using other factors adjust historical volatility such 
implied volatility peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion volatility estimates over various historical periods 
asc acknowledges that there likely range reasonable estimates for volatility addition asc requires 
that best estimate cannot made management should use the mid point the range reasonable estimates for volatility 
estimate the volatility our common stock the date grant based both historical volatility and implied volatility from traded 
options our common stock consistent with asc 
table contents 
risk free interest rate 
lattice models require risk free interest rates for all potential times exercise obtained using grant date yield curve lattice 
model would therefore require the yield curve for the entire time period during which employees might exercise their options 
base the risk free rate the implied yield effect the time option grant treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent 
remaining terms 
expected dividends 
have never paid any cash dividends our common stock and not anticipate paying any cash dividends the foreseeable 
future accordingly use expected dividend yield zero 
pre vesting forfeitures 
pre vesting forfeitures not affect the fair value calculation but they affect the expense calculation asc requires 
estimate pre vesting forfeitures the time grant and revise those estimates subsequent periods actual forfeitures differ from 
those estimates use historical data estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those 
awards that are expected vest 
apply dynamic forfeiture rate methodology over the vesting period the award the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology 
incorporates the lapse time into the resulting expense calculation and results forfeiture rate that diminishes the granted 
awards approach its vest date accordingly the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results more consistent stock compensation 
expense calculation over the vesting period the award 
post vesting cancellations 
post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled exercised expire unexercised lattice models treat postvesting cancellations and voluntary early exercise behavior two separate assumptions use historical data estimate postvesting cancellations

fully extinguished while extinguishment may result from exercise can also result from post vesting cancellation expiration

history tax and operating losses are projected have losses future periods result changes operational performance 
then determine valuation allowance should established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step determine the amount the valuation allowance will generally establish valuation allowance equal

valuation 
the company estimated the fair value stock options granted using binomial lattice option valuation model and single option 
award approach the company uses binomial lattice option valuation model because considers characteristics fair value option 
pricing such option contractual term and the probability exercise before the end the contractual term addition the 
complications surrounding the expected term option are material indicated asc given the company relatively 
large pool unexercised options the company believes binomial lattice option valuation model that specifically addresses this fact 
and models full term exercises the most appropriate and reliable means valuing its stock options the company 
amortizing the fair value straight line basis over the requisite service period the awards which the vesting period three 
four years the stock options vest either each grant anniversary date over three four years continued 
employment 
the following table shows the weighted average assumptions the company used develop the fair value estimates under its 
lattice option valuation model and the resulting estimates weighted average fair value per share stock options granted during the 
years ended december and 
expected volatility 
risk free interest rate 
expected dividends

fair value per share stock options granted 
population stratification 
accordance with asc company should aggregate individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect 
exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose refining the expected term assumption regardless the 
valuation technique used estimate the fair value addition asc indicates that company may generally make 
reasonable fair value estimate with few one two groupings the company has determined that single employee population 
group appropriate based analysis the company historical exercise patterns 
expected volatility 
volatility measure the tendency investment returns vary around long term average rate historical volatility 
appropriate starting point for setting this assumption accordance with asc according asc companies should 
also consider how future experience may differ from the past this may require using other factors adjust historical volatility such 
implied volatility peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion volatility estimates over various historical periods 
asc acknowledges that there likely range reasonable estimates for volatility addition asc requires 
that best estimate cannot made management should use the mid point the range reasonable estimates for volatility the 
company estimates the volatility its common stock the date grant based both historical volatility and implied volatility 
from traded options its common stock consistent with asc

risk free interest rate 
lattice models require risk free interest rates for all potential times exercise obtained using grant date yield curve lattice 
model would therefore require the yield curve for the entire time period during which employees might exercise their options the 
company bases the risk free rate the implied yield effect the time option grant treasury zero coupon issues with 
equivalent remaining terms 
expected dividends 
the company has never paid any cash dividends its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends the 
foreseeable future accordingly the company uses expected dividend yield zero 
pre vesting forfeitures 
pre vesting forfeitures not affect the fair value calculation but they affect the expense calculation asc requires the 
company estimate pre vesting forfeitures the time grant and revise those estimates subsequent periods actual forfeitures 
differ from those estimates the company uses historical data estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record share based compensation 
expense only for those awards that are expected vest 
the company applies dynamic forfeiture rate methodology over the vesting period the award the dynamic forfeiture rate 
methodology incorporates the lapse time into the resulting expense calculation and results forfeiture rate that diminishes the 
granted awards approach its vest date accordingly the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results more consistent stock based 
compensation expense calculation over the vesting period the award 
post vesting cancellations 
post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled exercised expire unexercised lattice models treat postvesting cancellations and voluntary early exercise behavior two separate assumptions the company uses historical data estimate 
post vesting cancellations 
expected term 
asc calls for extinguishment calculation dependent upon how long granted option remains outstanding before 
fully extinguished while extinguishment may result from exercise can also result from post vesting cancellation expiration 
the contractual term expected term output lattice models the company does not have determine this amount
