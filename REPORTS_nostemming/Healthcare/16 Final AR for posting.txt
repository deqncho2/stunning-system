remuneration induce referrals provider not required have actual knowledge specific intent commit violation the 
anti kickback statute found guilty violating the law 
the office the inspector general the department health and human services has issued regulations that provide safe 
harbors from federal anti kickback statute liability for various activities the fact that conduct business arrangement does not 
fall within safe harbor exception does not automatically render the conduct business arrangement illegal under the antikickback statute however conduct and business arrangements falling outside the safe harbors may lead increased scrutiny 
government enforcement authorities 
although management believes that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and 
available interpretations there can assurance that all arrangements comply with available safe harbor that regulatory 
authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements not violate the anti kickback statute other

establishment programs where reimbursement tied part patient outcomes based congressional budget office estimates 
the health reform legislation enacted expected expand health insurance coverage approximately million 
additional individuals through combination public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
some the most significant changes will expand the categories individuals eligible for medicaid coverage and permit 
individuals with relatively higher incomes qualify the federal government reimburses the majority state medicaid expenses 
and conditions its payment the state meeting certain requirements the federal government currently requires that states provide 
coverage for only limited categories low income adults under years old women who are pregnant and the blind 
disabled addition the income level required for individuals and families qualify for medicaid varies widely from state state 
while the health reform legislation will greatly expand the number adults who are eligible for medicaid may not impact our

including uhs and the nhs the also compete against hospitals and general healthcare facilities that provide mental 
health services important part our business strategy continue making targeted acquisitions other behavioral health 
facilities however reduced capacity the passage mental health parity legislation and increased demand for mental health services 
are likely attract other potential buyers including diversified healthcare companies and possibly other pure play behavioral 
healthcare companies 
the mental health services sector the comprises hospitals establishments that provide psychiatric treatment for illness 
mental disorder all security and treatment levels operate several highly competitive markets the with variety 
for profit the nhs and other not for profit groups each our markets most competition regional local based relevant 
catchment areas and procurement initiatives the nhs often the dominant provider although the trend has been towards increased 
outsourcing whereby the nhs both provider and customer mental healthcare services nhs house beds accounts for 
approximately the total mental health hospital beds providing care the with independent providers accounting for the 
remaining approximately beds 
addition the competition face for acquisitions must also compete for patients patients are referred our behavioral 
healthcare facilities through number different sources including healthcare practitioners public programs other treatment 
facilities managed care organizations unions emergency departments judicial officials social workers police departments and word

and how our referral sources and payors view 
our revenue and results operations are significantly affected payments received from the government and third party payors 
significant portion our revenue derived from government healthcare programs for the year ended december 
derived approximately our revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs and our revenue from public funded 
sources the including the nhs ccgs and local authorities see structural shifts the behavioral healthcare 
market may adversely affect us for further details funding risks which are subject 
government payors the such medicaid generally reimburse fee for service basis based predetermined 
reimbursement rate schedules result are limited the amount can record revenue for our services from these 
government programs and have cost increase typically will not able recover this increase addition the federal 
government and many state governments are operating under significant budgetary pressures and they may seek reduce payments 
under their medicaid programs for services such those provide government payors also tend pay slower schedule 
addition limiting the amounts they will pay for the services provide their members government payors may among other 
things impose prior authorization and concurrent utilization review programs that may further limit the services for which they will 
pay and shift patients lower levels care and reimbursement therefore governmental entities reduce the amounts they will pay 
for our services they elect not continue paying for such services altogether total partial repeal ppaca results 
significant contraction the number individuals covered state medicaid programs our business financial condition results 
operations could adversely affected addition governmental entities slow their payment cycles further our cash flow from 
operations could negatively affected 
commercial payors such managed care organizations private health insurance programs and labor unions generally 
reimburse for the services rendered insured patients based upon contractually determined rates these commercial payors are 
under significant pressure control healthcare costs addition limiting the amounts they will pay for the services provide 
their members commercial payors may among other things impose prior authorization and concurrent utilization review programs 
that may further limit the services for which they will pay and shift patients lower levels care and reimbursement these actions 
may reduce the amount revenue derive from commercial payors 
changes these government programs recent years have resulted limitations reimbursement and some cases 
reduced levels reimbursement for healthcare services payments from federal and state government healthcare programs are subject 
statutory and regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations requirements for utilization review and 
federal and state funding restrictions all which could materially increase decrease program payments well affect the cost 
providing service patients and the timing payments facilities are unable predict the effect recent and future policy 
changes our operations addition since most states operate with balanced budgets and since the medicaid program often 
state largest program some states can expected enact consider enacting legislation formulated reduce their medicaid 
expenditures furthermore the potential repeal ppaca which may negatively affect the availability taxpayer funds for 
medicare and medicaid programs the rates paid the scope services covered government payors are reduced there could 
material adverse effect our business financial condition and results operations 
addition changes government reimbursement programs our ability negotiate favorable contracts with private payors 
including managed care providers significantly affects the financial condition and operating results our facilities the 
management expects third party payors aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions reimbursement 
amounts received from third party payors could have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results

acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers such facilities the purchase agreement with priory contained 
minimal representations and warranties about the entities and business that acquired addition have indemnification 
rights against the sellers under the priory purchase agreement and all the purchase price consideration was paid closing the 
priory acquisition see our acquisition priory and crc may expose unknown contingent liabilities for which will

the majority our revenue from our operations the not guaranteed and being generated either from spot purchasing 
under framework agreements where volume commitments are given addition there can assurance that can 
achieve any fee rate increases the future will not suffer any fee rate decreases 
any decline demand for our services the from publicly funded entities private payers any failure extend 
current agreements enter into alternative agreements comparable terms with such entities could have adverse effect our 
average daily census adc which would have corresponding negative impact our business results operations and financial 
condition further there can assurances that will able implement fee rate increases which are driver our revenue 
from our operations not suffer from any decline fee rates the future should the effect any increase annual wages other 
operating costs the business exceed the effect any increase our fee rates should our fee rates suffer decline would have 
absorb any costs that cannot offset our fees which could have negative impact our business results operations and 
financial condition 
publicly funded entities 
significant portion our services funded publicly funded entities are commissioned spot purchase basis 
prices determined prevailing market conditions generally matter for the relevant commissioner determine whether use 
our services and there guarantee that previous spot market purchasing activity commissioner will continue the future 
all also have number fixed term framework agreements which grant preferred provider status with local authorities 
the nhs typically lasting between one three years while and the commissioners typically agree pricing for months 
times with discounts related the number beds purchased the commissioners not make minimum purchasing commitments 
under such agreements such commissioners may decide place existing and new service users with our competitors including 
their own house service providers short notice also have small number fixed period block contracts where set 
number beds are paid for discount spot prices regardless occupancy while may have flexibility increase spot rates 
for new admissions any fee increases under our block contracts are restricted the terms and conditions those block contracts 
the rates that charge publicly funded entities for our services are negotiated individually with commissioners and 
historically have been subject annual review april each year with customary adjustments based the retail prices index 
rpi consumer price index cpi sector specific costs indices however the current economic climate and the 
government overriding economic policy reduce the budget deficit means that the short term least commissioners are 
resistant fee increases often expecting that efficiency savings made offset inflationary cost increases accordance with 
national policy result there can assurance that can maintain the payment terms our arrangements with publicly 
funded entities including with respect the timing payments 
further following expiration contracts there can assurance that negotiations with commissioners will result the 
extension renewal existing arrangements the entering into alternative arrangements for those services addition changing 
commissioning structures and practices such those under the health and social care act may involve tendering processes 
which may result failing remain become approved provider commissioners may also require that following the expiration 
date current agreements with they contract with spot basis rather than through block arrangement reduce the number 
beds subject block arrangements even are successful extending current agreements entering into alternative 
arrangements the duration such extensions arrangements uncertain and may unsuccessful implementing rate 
increases under such agreements 
private payers 
although have agreements place with number private medical insurance pmi plans where pricing generally 
agreed annually there obligation the pmi plans refer its members pay for its members use our services 
further may not able renew our existing arrangements with pmi plans terms comparable what has achieved the 
past fee rates for self paying individuals are adjusted january each year depending capacity and demand the relevant 
service markets fees paid reimbursed pmi plans are typically adjusted line with specific contract terms and are generally 
based rpi and specific wage indices demand both the pmi market and the self pay dependent economic conditions which 
impacts the number people with sufficient income capital pay for insurance coverage treatment themselves 
structural shifts the behavioral healthcare market may adversely affect 
publicly funded entities 
payments for our services publicly funded entities the particularly the nhs and local authorities account for the 
vast majority our revenue expect publicly funded entities the continue generate the significant majority 
our revenue from our operations the budget constraints public spending cuts other financial pressures could cause such 
publicly funded entities spend less money the type services that provide political government policy changes 
could mean that fewer such services are purchased publicly funded entities from independent sector providers favor 
protecting nhs and local authority house services 
while the outsourcing the nhs england healthcare services has been increasing recent years the need the nhs 
england achieve substantial efficiency savings likely result continued funding pressure the pricing such services for 
instance monitor now part nhs improvement the nhs economic regulator has under nhs tariff rules determined national 
prices across range nhs services and has issued extensive guidance how they are applied including provision for local 
variations national tariffs subject approval monitor while none our services are currently subject national prices the 
future application any national prices regime upon our services could have material adverse impact our revenue 
addition the allocation funding responsibility for adult social care may subject change some time the future 
under the provisions the care act under which individuals identified being required pay for their own care under the 
relevant means test will required take funding responsibility specified lifetime monetary cap with local authorities 
responsible for the remainder expenses for personal care excluding daily living expenses this would potentially place greater 
funding responsibility with public sector bodies over the longer term which would potentially exacerbate the current funding 
challenges faced such bodies 
private payers 
payments for our services the pmi plans account for small portion our revenue addition payments for 
our services the self pay patients who purchase treatment spot basis account for small portion our revenue 
many the patients who use our acute healthcare services the because their pmi plan recognizes our facilities being 
appropriate provider the psychiatric treatment services required the patient our ability attract patients who are funded 
pmi plans could adversely impacted one more pmi plans withdraws recognition status from our facilities for example 
result change pmi plan recognition status standards addition many pmi plans have been changing the terms their 
policies and shortening the length time they will cover stay one our facilities

consequently must either develop sites create facilities purchase lease existing facilities which may require substantial 
modification must able identify suitable sites and there guarantee that such sites will available all 
economically viable cost areas sufficient demand for our services the subsequent successful development and construction 
new facility contingent upon among other things negotiation construction contracts regulatory permits and planning consents 
and satisfactory completion construction similarly our ability expand existing facilities also dependent upon various factors 
including identification appropriate expansion projects permitting licensure financing integration into our relationships with 
payors and referral sources and margin pressure new facilities are filled with patients 
delays caused difficulties respect any the above factors may lead cost overruns and longer periods before return 
generated investment all may incur significant capital expenditure but due regulatory planning other reason 
may find that are prevented from opening new facility modifying existing facility moreover even when incurring such 
development capital expenditure there guarantee that can fill beds when they become available upon operational 
commencement new facility typically expect that will take approximately months reach our targeted occupancy

the construction and operation healthcare facilities the are subject extensive federal state and local regulation 
relating among other things the adequacy medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures fire 
prevention rate setting compliance with building codes and environmental protection additionally such facilities are subject 
periodic inspection government authorities assure their continued compliance with these various standards fail adhere 
these standards could subject monetary and operational penalties 
all our facilities that handle and dispense controlled substances must comply with strict federal and state regulations 
regarding the purchase storage distribution and disposal such controlled substances the potential for theft diversion such 
controlled substances for illegal uses has led the federal government well number states and localities adopt stringent 
regulations not applicable many other types healthcare providers compliance with these regulations expensive and these costs 
may increase the future 
property owners and local authorities have attempted and may the future attempt use enact zoning ordinances 
eliminate our ability operate given treatment facility program local governmental authorities some cases also have 
attempted use litigation and the threat prosecution force the closure certain comprehensive treatment facilities any 
these attempts were succeed their frequency were increase our revenue would adversely affected and our operating

many our facilities are also accredited third party accreditation agencies such the joint commission carf 
any our existing healthcare facilities lose their accreditation any our new facilities fail receive accreditation such facilities

placements known the industry embargoes and extreme cases removal all residents placed that authority which 
turn may affect the level referrals from other publicly funded entities and our occupancy levels 
furthermore new regulations regulatory bodies may introduced the future existing regulations and regulatory bodies 
may amended replaced and may not adapt such changes quickly enough cost efficient manner for example the 
government appointed monitor now part nhs improvement the new market regulator for healthcare providers 
way licensing regime any failure comply with the licensing regime could result monitor revoking our license which

may restrained 
may required spend substantial amounts comply with statutes and regulations relating privacy and security phi 
there are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives both the and the addressing patient privacy and 
information security concerns particular federal regulations issued under hipaa require our facilities comply with 
standards protect the privacy security and integrity phi these regulations have imposed extensive administrative requirements 
technical and physical information security requirements restrictions the use and disclosure phi and related financial 
information and have provided patients with additional rights with respect their health information compliance with these 
regulations requires substantial expenditures which could negatively impact our business financial condition results operations 
addition our management has spent and may spend the future substantial time and effort compliance measures 
addition hipaa are subject similar and some cases more restrictive state and federal privacy regulations for 
example the federal government and some states impose laws governing the use and disclosure health information pertaining 
mental health and substance abuse treatment that are more stringent than the rules that apply healthcare information generally 
public attention drawn the issues the privacy and security medical information states may revise expand their laws 
concerning the use and disclosure health information may adopt new laws addressing these subjects 
violations the privacy and security regulations could subject our operations substantial civil monetary penalties and 
substantial other costs and penalties associated with breach data security including criminal penalties may also subject 
substantial reputational harm experience substantial security breach involving phi 
have been and could become the subject governmental investigations regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits 
healthcare companies both the and the are subject numerous investigations various governmental agencies 
certain our facilities have received and other facilities may receive government inquiries from and may subject investigation 
governmental agencies depending whether the underlying conduct these future inquiries investigations could 
considered systemic their resolution could have material adverse effect our business financial condition and results 
operations 
further under the false claims act private parties are permitted bring qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against 
companies that submit false claims for payments improperly retain overpayments from the government because qui tam 
lawsuits are filed under seal could named one more such lawsuits which are not aware may also subject 
substantial reputational harm result the public announcement any investigation into such claims 
are subject uncertainties regarding recent health reform and budget legislation 
the expansion health insurance coverage the health reform legislation continued may increase the number patients 
using our facilities who have either private public program coverage addition disproportionately large percentage new 
medicaid coverage likely states that currently have relatively low income eligibility requirements and may include states 
where have facilities furthermore result the health reform legislation there may reduction uninsured patients 
which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable 
notwithstanding the foregoing the health reform legislation makes number other changes medicare and medicaid 
which management believes may have adverse impact the various provisions the health reform legislation that directly 
indirectly affect reimbursement are scheduled take effect over number years health reform legislation provisions are likely 
affected the incomplete nature implementing regulations expected forthcoming interpretive guidance gradual 
implementation future legislation further health reform legislation provisions such those creating the medicare shared 
savings program and the independent payment advisory board create certain flexibilities how healthcare may reimbursed 
federal programs the future thus cannot predict the impact the health reform legislation our future reimbursement 
this time 
the health reform legislation also contains provisions aimed reducing fraud and abuse healthcare the health reform 
legislation amends several existing laws including the federal anti kickback statute and the false claims act making easier for 
government agencies and private plaintiffs prevail lawsuits brought against healthcare providers congress revised the intent 
requirement the anti kickback statute provide that person not required have actual knowledge specific intent 
commit violation the anti kickback statute order found guilty violating such law the health reform legislation also 
provides that any claims for items services that violate the anti kickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes 
the false claims act the health reform legislation provides that healthcare provider that knowingly retains overpayment 
excess days subject the false claims act 
the impact the health reform legislation each our facilities may vary cannot predict the impact the health 
reform legislation may have our business results operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity whether will 
able adapt successfully the changes required the health reform legislation are similarly unable predict the impact 
future modifications the health reform legislation the impact its wholesale repeal 
are similarly unable guarantee that current laws regulations and regulatory assessment methodologies will not 
modified replaced the future additionally there risk that budget constraints public spending cuts such the cuts 
announced the government the comprehensive spending review and implemented the and government 
budgets other financial pressures could cause the nhs reduce funding for the types services that provide such policy 
changes the could lead fewer services being purchased publicly funded entities material changes being made their 
procurement practices any which could materially reduce our revenue these and other future developments and amendments may 
negatively impact our operations which could have material adverse effect our business financial condition results 
operations see expanding our operations internationally poses additional risks our business 
finally the allocation funding responsibility for adult social care will subject change over the next few years under the 
provisions the care act with individuals identified being required pay for their own care under the relevant means test 
being required take funding responsibility specified lifetime monetary cap with local authorities then becoming 
responsible for the continued funding personal care but not daily living expenses this will potentially place greater funding 
responsibility with public sector bodies over the longer term which will potentially exacerbate the current funding challenges faced 
such bodies 
the industry trend value based purchasing may negatively impact our revenue 
there trend the healthcare industry toward value based purchasing healthcare services these value based purchasing 
programs include both public reporting quality data and preventable adverse events tied the quality and efficiency care 
provided facilities governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals report certain quality 
data receive full reimbursement updates addition medicare does not reimburse for care related certain preventable adverse 
events many large commercial payors currently require hospitals report quality data and several commercial payors not 
reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events 
expect value based purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement patient outcome measures 
become more common and involve higher percentage reimbursement amounts are unable this time predict how this 
trend will affect our results operations but could negatively impact our revenue are unable meet quality standards 
established both governmental and private payers 
operate highly competitive industry and competition may lead declines patient volumes 
the healthcare industry highly competitive and competition among healthcare providers including hospitals for patients 
physicians and other healthcare professionals has intensified recent years there are other healthcare facilities that provide 
behavioral and other mental health services comparable those offered our facilities each the geographical areas which 
operate some our competitors are owned tax supported governmental agencies non profit corporations and may have 
certain financial advantages not available including endowments charitable contributions tax exempt financing and exemptions 
from sales property and income taxes some our for profit competitors are local independent operators physician groups with 
strong established reputations within the surrounding communities which may adversely affect our ability attract sufficiently 
large number patients markets where compete with such providers also face competition from other for profit entities 
who may possess greater financial marketing research and development resources than may invest more funds renovating 
their facilities developing technology 
our competitors are better able attract patients recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals expand 
services obtain favorable managed care contracts their facilities may experience decline patient volume and our results 
operations may adversely affected 
the nhs the principal provider secure mental healthcare services the with approximately the total beds 
secure mental healthcare services the the preferred provider there often bias toward referrals nhs and therefore 
nhs facilities have maintained high occupancy rates result budget constraints independent operators have emerged satisfy 
the demand for mental health services not supplied the nhs addition the nhs face competition the from 
independent sector providers and other publicly funded entities for individuals requiring care and for appropriate sites which 
develop expand facilities the should fail compete effectively with our peers and competitors the industry the 
competitive environment intensifies individuals may referred elsewhere for services that provide negatively impacting our 
ability secure referrals and limiting the expansion our business 
the trend insurance companies and managed care organizations enter into sole source contracts may limit our ability 
obtain patients 
insurance companies and managed care organizations the are entering into sole source contracts with healthcare 
providers which could limit our ability obtain patients since not offer the range services required for these contracts 
moreover private insurers managed care organizations and lesser extent medicaid and medicare are beginning carve out 
specific services including mental health and substance abuse services and establish small specialized networks providers for such 
services fixed reimbursement rates continued growth the use carve out arrangements could materially adversely affect our 
business the extent are not selected participate such networks the reimbursement rate such networks not adequate 
cover the cost providing the service 
our performance depends our ability recruit and retain quality psychiatrists and other physicians 
the success and competitive advantage our facilities depends part the number and quality the psychiatrists and other 
physicians the medical staffs our facilities and our maintenance good relations with those medical professionals although 
employ psychiatrists and other physicians many our facilities psychiatrists and other physicians generally are not employees 
our facilities and number our markets they have admitting privileges competing hospitals providing acute inpatient
