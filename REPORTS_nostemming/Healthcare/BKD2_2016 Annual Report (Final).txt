the senior living industry 
the senior living industry has undergone dramatic growth the last twenty years marked the emergence the assisted living segment the mid the industry highly 
fragmented and characterized numerous local and regional operators are one limited number large operators that provide broad range community locations and service 
level offerings varying price levels 
beginning the industry was affected the downturn the general economy increased unemployment and downturn the housing market spite these factors industry 
occupancy declined only approximately basis points cyclic low early while rate growth remained positive less than per year this also resulted near 
halt construction new units the industry has experienced slow recovery occupancy and rate growth since the beginning according the national investment center 
for the seniors housing care industry nic over the past year industry occupancy has been rising modestly the pace absorption has been outpacing inventory growth 
believe that number trends will contribute the continued growth the senior living industry coming years the primary market for senior living services individuals age 
and older according census data that group projected the fastest growing age cohort over the next twenty years result scientific and medical breakthroughs 
over the past years seniors are living longer due demographic trends and continuing advances science nutrition and healthcare the senior population will continue grow 
and expect the demand for senior living services continue increase future years 
believe the senior living industry has been and will continue impacted several other trends increased longevity results increasing frailty seniors soaring rates 
dementia among the elderly and growing burden chronic illness and chronic conditions result increased mobility society reduction average family size and increased 
number two wage earner couples families struggle provide care for seniors and look for alternatives outside their family for their care there growing consumer awareness 
among seniors and their families concerning the types services provided senior living operators which has further contributed the demand for senior living services also the 
current prospective senior customer possesses greater financial resources than the past which makes more likely that they are able afford live market rate senior housing 
seniors the demographic cohort that were born between and have significant amount income generated from savings pensions and social security along with strong 
asset base 
challenges our industry include increased state and local regulation the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors which has led increase the cost doing business the 
regulatory environment continues intensify the number and types laws and regulations affecting accompanied increased enforcement activity state and local officials 
addition like other companies our financial results may negatively impacted increasing employment costs including salaries wages and benefits such health care benefit 
coverage for our employees increases the costs food utilities insurance and real estate taxes may also have negative impact our financial results 
beginning october were impacted reduction the reimbursement rates for medicare skilled nursing patients and home health patients well negative change 
the allowable method for delivering therapy services skilled nursing patients resulting increased therapy labor expense addition certain per person annual limits medicare 
reimbursement for therapy services became effective subject certain exceptions these exceptions are currently scheduled expire december these exceptions 
are modified not extended beyond that date our revenues and net operating income relating our outpatient therapy services could materially adversely impacted 
effective october certain medicare part therapy services exceeding specified threshold are subject prepayment manual medical review process the review process has 
had adverse effect the provision and billing services for patients and could negatively impact therapist productivity these medicare part therapy cap exception requirements 
including the applicable pre approval requirements could also negatively impact the revenues and net operating income relating our outpatient therapy services business pursuant 
the medicare access and chip reauthorization act which was signed the president april the manual review process will replaced with new review program 
developed the secretary health and human services 
addition there continue various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals implement cost containment measures that would limit payments healthcare providers 
the future cannot predict what action any congress will take reimbursement policies the medicare program what future rule changes the cms will implement changes 
the reimbursement policies the medicare program could have adverse effect our results operations and cash flow

government regulation 
the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues intensify the number and type laws and regulations affecting addition federal state and local 
officials are increasingly focusing their efforts enforcement these laws and regulations this particularly true for large for profit multi community providers like some the 
laws and regulations that impact our industry include state and local laws impacting licensure protecting consumers against deceptive practices and generally affecting the 
state laws designed protect medicare and medicaid which mandate what are allowable costs pricing quality services quality care food service resident rights including abuse 
occupational safety and health administration are unable predict the future course federal state and local legislation regulation changes the regulatory framework could 
have material adverse effect our business 
many senior living communities are also subject regulation and licensing state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities although 
employees several the states which operate may operate are prohibited from providing certain higher levels senior care services without first obtaining the 
appropriate licenses addition several the states which operate intend operate assisted living communities home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities 
require certificate need before the community can opened the services existing community can expanded senior living communities may also subject state and 
local building zoning fire and food service codes and must compliance with these local codes before licensing certification may granted these laws and regulatory 
requirements could affect our ability expand into new markets and expand our services and communities existing markets addition any our presently licensed 
communities operates outside its licensing authority may subject penalties including closure the community 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like because the increase the number inspections surveys governmental authorities and 
consequent citations for failure comply with regulatory requirements unannounced surveys inspections may occur annually annually following regulator receipt 
complaint about the community from time time the ordinary course business receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections 
surveys most inspection deficiencies are resolved through agreed plan corrective action relating the community operations but the reviewing agency typically has the 
authority take further action against licensed certified community which could result the imposition fines imposition provisional conditional license suspension 
revocation license suspension denial admissions loss certification provider under federal health care programs imposition other sanctions including criminal 
penalties loss suspension modification license may also cause default under our loan lease agreements and trigger cross defaults sanctions may taken against 
providers facilities without regard the providers facilities history compliance may also expend considerable resources respond federal and state investigations 
other enforcement action under applicable laws regulations date none the deficiency reports received has resulted suspension fine other disposition that has had 
material adverse effect our revenues however any future substantial failure comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result material adverse effect 
our business whole addition states attorneys general vigorously enforce consumer protection laws those laws relate the senior living industry state medicaid fraud 
and abuse units may also investigate assisted living communities even the community any its residents not receive federal state funds 
regulation the senior living industry evolving least partly because the growing interests variety advocacy organizations and political movements attempting 
standardize regulations for certain segments the industry particularly assisted living our operations could suffer future regulatory developments such federal assisted living 
laws and regulations well mandatory increases the scope and severity deficiencies determined survey inspection officials increase the number citations that can 
result civil criminal penalties certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials make determinations whether the care provided one more our 
communities exceeds the level care for which the community licensed finding that community delivering care beyond its license might result the immediate transfer and 
discharge residents which may create market instability and other adverse consequences furthermore certain states may allow citations one community impact other 
communities the state revocation suspension license citation given community could therefore impact our ability obtain new licenses renew existing licenses 
other communities which may also cause default under our loan lease agreements and trigger cross defaults may also trigger defaults under certain our credit 
agreements adversely affect our ability operate and obtain financing the future state were find that one community citation will impact another our communities 
this will also increase costs and result increased surveillance the state survey agency regulatory requirements increase whether through enactment new laws regulations 
changes the enforcement existing rules including increased enforcement brought about advocacy groups addition federal and state regulators our operations could 
adversely affected addition any adverse finding survey and inspection officials may serve the basis for false claims lawsuits private plaintiffs and may lead investigations 
under federal and state laws which may result civil and criminal penalties against the community individual 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing wide array referrals relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud health care providers including 
those the senior living industry and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources such anti fraud initiatives the health insurance portability and 
accountability act hipaa and the balanced budget act expanded the penalties for health care fraud addition with respect our participation federal health 
care reimbursement programs the government private individuals acting behalf the government may bring action under the false claims act alleging that health care 
provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment additional monetary civil penalties recently other health care providers have faced 
enforcement action under the false claims act the false claims act allows private individual with knowledge fraud bring claim behalf the federal government and earn 
percentage the federal government recovery because these incentives called whistleblower suits have become more frequent also any our communities exceeds its 
level care may subject private lawsuits alleging transfer trauma residents such allegations could also lead investigations enforcement officials which could result 
penalties including the closure communities the violation any these regulations may result the imposition fines other penalties that could jeopardize our business 
additionally operate communities that participate federal and state health care reimbursement programs including state medicaid waiver programs for assisted living 
communities the medicare skilled nursing facility benefit program and other healthcare programs such therapy and home health services other federal and state health care 
programs consequently are subject federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting causing presented claims for reimbursement which are false fraudulent 
are for items services that were not provided claimed similar state laws vary from state state and cannot sure that these laws will interpreted consistently 
keeping with past practices violation any these laws can result loss licensure claims for recoupment civil criminal penalties and exclusion health care providers 
suppliers from furnishing covered items services beneficiaries the applicable federal and state health care reimbursement program loss licensure may also cause 
default under our leases and loan agreements and trigger cross defaults 
are also subject certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements health care providers such the federal anti kickback law the stark laws and certain state 
referral laws the federal anti kickback law makes unlawful for any person offer pay solicit receive any remuneration directly indirectly overtly covertly 
cash kind for referring recommending for purchase any item service which eligible for payment under the medicare and medicaid programs authorities have interpreted 
this statute very broadly apply many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources patient referral were violate the federal anti kickback law 
may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such medicare and medicaid which may also cause default 
under our leases and loan agreements and trigger cross defaults adverse consequences may also result violate federal stark laws related certain medicare and medicaid 
physician referrals while endeavor comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation our senior living communities difficult predict how our revenues could 
affected were subject action alleging such violations are also subject federal and state laws designed protect the confidentiality patient health information the 
department health and human services hhs has issued rules pursuant hipaa relating the privacy such information rules that became effective april 
govern our use and disclosure health information certain hipaa covered communities established procedures comply with hipaa privacy requirements these 
communities were required compliance with the hipaa rule establishing administrative physical and technical security standards for health information april

lender foreclose upon the community communities securing such indebtedness the case lease cause the lessor terminate the lease each with consequent loss 
income and asset value furthermore some cases indebtedness secured both mortgage community communities and guaranty and one more our 
subsidiaries the event default under one these scenarios the lender could avoid judicial procedures required foreclose real property declaring all amounts 
outstanding under the guaranty immediately due and payable and requiring the respective guarantor fulfill its obligations make such payments the realization any these 
scenarios would have adverse effect our financial condition and capital structure additionally foreclosure any our properties could cause recognize taxable income 
even did not receive any cash proceeds connection with such foreclosure further because many our outstanding debt and lease documents contain cross default and crosscollateralization provisions default related one community could affect significant number our communities and their corresponding financing arrangements and leases 
the event such default may not able obtain waiver from the lender lessor terms acceptable favorable all which would have negative impact our 
capital structure and financial condition 
our indebtedness and long term leases could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability operate our business and our ability execute our growth strategy 
our level indebtedness and our long term leases could adversely affect our future operations and impact our stockholders for several reasons including without limitation 
may have little cash flow apart from cash flow that dedicated the payment any interest principal amortization required with respect outstanding 
increases our outstanding indebtedness leverage and long term leases will increase our vulnerability adverse changes general economic and industry conditions 
increases our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures expansions repositionings new 
our ability pay dividends our stockholders may limited 
our ability make payments principal and interest our indebtedness and make lease payments our leases depends upon our future performance which will subject 
general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our operations many which are beyond our control our business might not continue 
generate cash flow above current levels are unable generate sufficient cash flow from operations the future service our debt make lease payments our 
leases may required among other things seek additional financing the debt equity markets refinance restructure all portion our indebtedness sell selected 
assets reduce delay planned capital expenditures delay abandon desirable acquisitions these measures might not sufficient enable service our debt make lease 
payments our leases the failure make required payments our debt leases the delay abandonment our planned growth strategy could result adverse effect 
our future ability generate revenues and sustain profitability any contemplated financing refinancing sale assets might not available economically favorable terms 
addition certain our debt agreements contain extension options are not able satisfy the conditions precedent exercising these extension options our liquidity and 
financial condition could negatively impacted 
our existing credit facilities mortgage loans and lease arrangements contain covenants that limit restrict our operations and activities including our ability borrow 
additional funds and engage certain transactions without consent the applicable lender lessor and any default under such facilities loans arrangements could result 
the acceleration indebtedness termination the leases cross defaults under our other debt lease documents any which would negatively impact our liquidity and 
inhibit our ability grow our business and increase revenues 
our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain restrictions and covenants and require maintain satisfy specified financial ratios and coverage tests including maintaining 
prescribed net worth levels leverage ratios and debt service and lease coverage ratios consolidated basis and community communities basis based the debt lease 
securing the communities addition certain our leases require maintain lease coverage ratios lease portfolio basis each defined the leases and maintain

these restrictions and covenants may interfere with our ability obtain financing engage other business activities which may inhibit our ability grow our business and 
increase revenues fail comply with any these requirements then the related indebtedness could become immediately due and payable cannot assure you that could 
pay this debt became due addition certain our outstanding indebtedness and leases limit restrict among other things our ability and our subsidiaries ability borrow 
additional funds engage change control transaction dispose all substantially all our their assets engage mergers other business combinations without consent 
the applicable lender lessor 
our credit facilities mortgage loans and leases are secured our communities and certain cases guaranty and one more our subsidiaries therefore event 
default under the outstanding indebtedness leases subject cure provisions certain instances would give the respective lenders lessors applicable the right declare all 
amounts outstanding immediately due and payable terminate the lease foreclose collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness and leases and restrict our ability make 
additional borrowings under the outstanding indebtedness continue operate the properties subject the lease many our outstanding debt and lease documents contain crossdefault provisions that default under one these instruments would cause default under other debt and lease documents 
the substantial majority our lease arrangements are structured master leases under master lease may lease large number geographically dispersed properties through 
indivisible lease result difficult restructure the composition the portfolio economic terms the lease without the consent the landlord failure comply with 
medicare medicaid provider requirements default under several our master lease and debt financing instruments addition event default related individual 
property limited number properties within master lease portfolio would result default the entire master lease portfolio and could further trigger cross default provisions 
other outstanding debt and lease documents the event such default may not able obtain waiver from the lessor terms acceptable favorable all which 
would have negative impact our capital structure and financial condition and our ability generate future revenues and could interfere with our ability pursue our growth 
strategy 
certain our master leases and management agreements also contain radius restrictions which limit our ability own develop acquire new communities within specified distance 
from certain existing communities covered such agreements these radius restrictions could negatively affect our expansion development and acquisition plans 
mortgage debt and lease obligations expose increased risk loss property which could harm our ability generate future revenues and could have adverse tax effect 
mortgage debt and lease obligations increase our risk loss because defaults indebtedness secured properties pursuant the terms the lease may result foreclosure 
actions initiated lenders lessors and ultimately our loss the property securing any loans for which are default cause the lessor terminate the lease for tax purposes 
foreclosure any our properties would treated sale the property for purchase price equal the outstanding balance the debt secured the mortgage the 
outstanding balance the debt secured the mortgage exceeds our tax basis the property would recognize taxable income foreclosure but would not receive any cash 
proceeds which could negatively impact our earnings and liquidity further our mortgage debt and leases generally contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions and 
default one community could affect significant number our communities financing arrangements and leases 
addition our leases generally provide for renewal extension options and certain cases purchase options these options generally are based upon prescribed formulas but 
assurance that these rights will exercised the future that will able satisfy the conditions precedent exercising any such renewal extension purchase options 
furthermore the terms any such options that are based fair market value are inherently uncertain and could unacceptable unfavorable depending the circumstances 
the time exercise are not able renew extend our existing leases purchase the communities subject such leases prior the end the existing lease terms 
the terms such options are unfavorable unacceptable our business financial condition and results operations could adversely affected 
increases market interest rates could significantly increase the costs our unhedged debt and lease obligations which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings 
our unhedged floating rate debt and lease payment obligations and any unhedged floating rate debt incurred the future exposes interest rate risk therefore increases 
prevailing interest rates could increase our payment obligations which would negatively impact our liquidity and earnings 
increases the cost and availability labor including increased competition for shortage skilled personnel increased union activity would have adverse effect 
our profitability and our ability conduct our business operations 
our success depends our ability retain and attract skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day day operations each our communities each community 
has executive director responsible for the overall day day operations the community including quality care social services and financial performance depending upon the 
size the community each executive director supported community staff member who directly responsible for day day care the residents and either community staff 
regional support oversee the community sales marketing and community outreach programs other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible 
for food service healthcare services therapy services activities housekeeping and engineering compete with various health care service providers including other senior living 
providers retaining and attracting qualified and skilled personnel increased competition for shortage nurses therapists other trained personnel general inflationary 
pressures may require that enhance our pay and benefits package compete effectively for such personnel may not able offset such added costs increasing the rates 
charge our residents our service charges which would negatively impact our results operations turnover rates and the magnitude the shortage nurses therapists 
other trained personnel varies substantially from market market fail attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel our ability conduct our business operations 
effectively our ability implement our growth strategy and our overall operating results could harmed 
addition efforts labor unions unionize any our community personnel could divert management attention lead increases our labor costs and reduce our flexibility with 
respect certain workplace rules new election rules promulgated the national labor relations board went into effect april and will substantially change and expedite the 
union election process thereby limiting the time available for attempt persuade employees vote against representation experience increase organizing activity 
onerous collective bargaining agreement terms are imposed upon otherwise experience increase our staffing and labor costs our profitability and cash flows from 
operations would negatively affected 
have history losses and may not able achieve profitability 
have incurred net losses every year since our formation june given our history losses there can assurance that will able achieve and maintain 
profitability the future not effectively manage our cash flow and combined business operations going forward otherwise achieve profitability our stock price could 
adversely affected 
are unable expand renovate reposition redevelop our communities accordance with our plans our anticipated revenues and results operations could adversely 
affected 
are currently working projects that will expand renovate reposition redevelop number our existing senior living communities over the next several years these projects 
are various stages development and are subject number factors over which have little control these factors include the necessity arranging separate leases 
regulations cannot assure you that will elect undertake complete all our proposed expansion renovation repositioning and redevelopment projects that will not 
experience delays completing those projects addition may incur substantial costs prior achieving stabilized occupancy for each such project and cannot assure you that 
these costs will not greater than have anticipated also cannot assure you that any our expansion renovation repositioning redevelopment projects will economically 
successful our failure achieve our expansion renovation repositioning and redevelopment plans could adversely impact our growth objectives and our anticipated revenues and 
results operations 
may encounter difficulties acquiring communities attractive prices integrating acquisitions including our acquisition emeritus corporation with our operations 
which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
will continue selectively target strategic acquisitions opportunities arise the extent identify and complete any future acquisition opportunities the process 
identifying potential acquisition candidates completing acquisition transactions and integrating acquired communities into our existing operations may result unforeseen operating 
difficulties divert managerial attention require significant financial other resources these acquisitions and other future acquisitions may require incur additional 
indebtedness and contingent liabilities and may result unforeseen expenses compliance issues which may limit our revenue growth cash flows and our ability achieve 
profitability moreover any future acquisitions may not generate any additional income for provide any benefit our business addition cannot assure you that will 
able locate and acquire communities attractive prices locations that are compatible with our strategy that competition for the acquisition communities will not increase 
finally when are able locate communities and enter into definitive agreements acquire lease them cannot assure you that the transactions will completed failure 
complete transactions after have entered into definitive agreements may result significant expenses 
addition continue integrate the operations emeritus corporation which acquired july the failure integrate successfully and manage successfully the 
challenges presented the remaining integration process may result not achieving the anticipated benefits the acquisition furthermore may incur substantial additional 
unanticipated costs connection with the remaining integration process 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition communities could reduce our future profitability 
our growth strategy contemplates selected future acquisitions existing senior living operating companies and communities despite our extensive underwriting and due diligence 
procedures communities that have previously acquired may acquire the future may generate unexpectedly low returns may not meet risk profile that our investors find 
acceptable addition might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating any the acquired communities including contingent liabilities newly acquired 
communities might require significant management attention that would otherwise devoted our ongoing business for example community may require capital expenditures 
excess budgeted amounts may experience management turnover that higher than project these costs may negatively affect our future profitability 
competition for the acquisition strategic assets from buyers with greater financial resources lower costs capital than that have lower return expectations than 
could limit our ability compete for strategic acquisitions and therefore grow our business effectively 
several publicly traded and non traded real estate investment trusts reits have similar asset acquisition objectives along with greater financial resources and lower 
costs capital than are able obtain this may increase competition for acquisitions that would suitable making more difficult for compete and successfully 
implement our growth strategy there significant competition among potential acquirers the senior living industry including publicly traded and non traded reits and there can 
assurance that will able successfully implement our growth strategy complete acquisitions which could limit our ability grow our business effectively partially 
result tax law changes enacted through ridea now compete more directly with the various publicly traded healthcare reits for the acquisition senior housing properties 
may need additional capital fund our operations and finance our growth and may not able obtain terms acceptable all which may limit our ability 
grow 
continued expansion our business through the expansion renovation redevelopment and repositioning our existing communities the development new communities and the 
acquisition existing senior living operating companies and communities will require additional capital particularly were accelerate our expansion and acquisition plans 
financing may not available may available only terms that are not favorable addition certain our outstanding indebtedness and long term leases restrict 
among other things our ability incur additional debt are unable raise additional funds obtain them terms acceptable may have delay abandon some all 
our growth strategies further additional funds are raised through the issuance additional equity securities the percentage ownership our stockholders would diluted any

termination our resident agreements and vacancies the living spaces lease could adversely affect our revenues earnings and occupancy levels 
state regulations governing assisted living communities require written resident agreements with each resident several these regulations also require that each resident have the right 
terminate the resident agreement for any reason reasonable notice consistent with these regulations many our assisted living resident agreements allow residents terminate 
their agreements upon days notice unlike typical apartment leasing independent living arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods 
year longer many instances cannot contract with our assisted living residents stay those living spaces for longer periods time our retirement center resident agreements 
generally provide for termination the lease upon death allow resident terminate his her lease upon the need for higher level care not provided the community 
multiple residents terminate their resident agreements around the same time our revenues earnings and occupancy levels could adversely affected addition because the

significant investment time and money even eventually favorably determined 
these results could have material adverse effect our business and consolidated financial condition results operations and cash flows 
the cost and difficulty complying with increasing and evolving regulation and enforcement could have adverse effect our business operations and profits 
the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues evolve and intensify the amount and type laws and regulations affecting many which vary 
from state state addition many senior living communities are subject regulation and licensing state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory 
authorities several the states which operate may operate are prohibited from providing certain higher levels senior care services without first obtaining the 
appropriate licenses also several the states which operate intend operate assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities require certificate need 
before the community can opened the services existing community can expanded furthermore federal state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts 
enforcement these laws particularly with respect large for profit multi community providers like these requirements and the increased enforcement thereof could affect our 
ability expand into new markets expand our services and communities existing markets and any our presently licensed communities were operate outside its licensing 
authority may subject penalties including closure the community future regulatory developments well mandatory increases the scope and severity deficiencies 
determined survey inspection officials could cause our operations suffer are unable predict the future course federal state and local legislation regulation 
regulatory requirements increase whether through enactment new laws regulations changes the enforcement existing rules our earnings and operations could adversely 
affected 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like because the increase the number inspections surveys governmental authorities and 
consequent citations for failure comply with regulatory requirements also expend considerable resources respond federal and state investigations other enforcement 
action from time time the ordinary course business receive deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections surveys although 
most inspection deficiencies are resolved through agreed plan corrective action the reviewing agency typically has the authority take further action against licensed 
certified facility which could result the imposition fines imposition provisional conditional license suspension revocation license suspension denial 
admissions loss certification provider under federal health care programs imposition other sanctions including criminal penalties furthermore certain states may allow 
citations one community impact other communities the state revocation license given community could therefore impact our ability obtain new licenses renew 
existing licenses other communities which may also cause default under our leases trigger cross defaults trigger defaults under certain our credit agreements 
adversely affect our ability operate and obtain financing the future state were find that one community citation would impact another our communities this would also 
increase costs and result increased surveillance the state survey agency date none the deficiency reports received has resulted suspension fine other 
disposition that has had material adverse effect our revenues however the failure comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements the future could result material 
adverse effect our business whole 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing wide array referral relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud health care providers including 
those the senior living industry and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources such anti fraud initiatives some examples are the health insurance 
portability and accountability act hipaa the balanced budget act and the false claims act which gives private individuals the ability bring action behalf 
the federal government the violation any these laws regulations may result the imposition fines other penalties that could increase our costs and otherwise jeopardize 
our business under the deficit reduction act dra every entity that receives least million annually medicaid payments must have established written policies 
for all employees contractors agents providing detailed information about false claims false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws including the 
federal false claims act and similar state laws failure comply with this new compliance requirement may potentially give rise potential liability dra also creates incentive 
for states enact false claims laws that are comparable the federal false claims act 
additionally provide services and operate communities that participate federal and state health care reimbursement programs which makes subject federal and state laws 
that prohibit anyone from presenting causing presented claims for reimbursement which are false fraudulent are for items services that were not provided claimed 
similar state laws vary from state state and cannot sure that these laws will interpreted consistently keeping with past practice violation any these laws can result 
loss licensure civil criminal penalties and exclusion health care providers suppliers from furnishing covered items services beneficiaries the applicable federal and 
state health care reimbursement program loss licensure may also cause default under our leases and trigger cross defaults 
are also subject certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements health care providers such the federal anti kickback law the stark laws and certain state 
referral laws authorities have interpreted the federal anti kickback law very broadly apply many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources patient 
referral this could result criminal penalties and civil sanctions including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such medicare and medicaid which may also 
cause default under our leases and trigger cross defaults adverse consequences may also result violate federal stark laws related certain medicare and medicaid 
physician referrals while endeavor comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation our business difficult predict how our revenues could affected 
were subject action alleging such violations 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act fair housing act and fire safety and other regulations may require make unanticipated expenditures which could 
increase our costs and therefore adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
all our communities are required comply with the americans with disabilities act ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and 
commercial properties but generally requires that buildings made accessible people with disabilities compliance with ada requirements could require removal access barriers 
and non compliance could result imposition government fines award damages private litigants 
must also comply with the fair housing act which prohibits from discriminating against individuals certain bases any our practices would cause such individuals 
face barriers gaining residency any our communities additionally the fair housing act and other state laws require that advertise our services such way that promote 
diversity and not limit may required among other things change our marketing techniques comply with these requirements 
addition are required operate our communities compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations and food licensing 
certification requirements they may adopted governmental agencies and bodies from time time like other health care facilities senior living communities are subject 
periodic survey inspection governmental authorities assess and assure compliance with regulatory requirements surveys occur regular often annual annual 
schedule and special surveys may result from specific complaint filed resident family member one our competitors may required make substantial capital 
expenditures comply with those requirements 
capital expenditures have made comply with any the above date have been immaterial however the increased costs and capital expenditures that may incur order 
comply with any the above would result negative effect our earnings and financial condition 
significant legal actions and liability claims against excess insurance limits could subject increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities which may 
adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the senior living and healthcare services businesses entails inherent risk liability particularly given the demographics our residents including age and health and the services 
provide recent years well other participants our industry have been subject increasing number claims and lawsuits alleging that our services have resulted 
resident injury other adverse effects many these lawsuits involve large damage claims and significant legal costs many states continue consider tort reform and how will 
apply the senior living industry may continue faced with the threat large jury verdicts jurisdictions that not find favor with large senior living healthcare 
providers maintain liability insurance policies amounts and with the coverage and deductibles believe are adequate based the nature and risks our business historical 
experience and industry standards have formed wholly owned captive insurance company for the purpose insuring certain portions our risk retention under our general 
and professional liability insurance programs there can guarantee that will not have any claims that exceed our policy limits the future 
successful claim made against and not covered our insurance exceeds the policy limits our financial condition and results operations could materially and 
adversely affected some states state law may prohibit limit insurance coverage for the risk punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and 
litigation result may liable for punitive damage awards these states that either are not covered are excess our insurance policy limits also the above deductibles 
self insured retention are accrued based actuarial projection future liabilities these projections are inaccurate and there are unexpectedly large number successful 
claims that result liabilities excess our self insured retention our operating results could negatively affected claims against regardless their merit eventual outcome 
also could have material adverse effect our ability attract residents expand our business and could require our management devote time matters unrelated the day today operation our business also have renew our policies every year and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage exposing the volatility the insurance markets 
including the possibility rate increases there can assurance that will able obtain liability insurance the future available that such coverage will available 
acceptable terms 
overbuilding and increased competition may adversely affect our ability generate and increase our revenues and profits and pursue our business strategy 
the senior living industry highly competitive and expect that may become more competitive the future compete with numerous other companies that provide long term 
care alternatives such home healthcare agencies therapy services life care home community based service programs retirement communities convalescent centers and other 
independent living assisted living and skilled nursing providers including not for profit entities addition over the last several years there has been increase the construction 
new senior housing assets general regulatory and other barriers competitive entry the independent living and assisted living sectors the senior living industry are not 
substantial have experienced and expect continue experience increased competition our efforts acquire and operate senior living communities consequently may 
encounter increased competition that could limit our ability attract new residents raise resident fees expand our business which could have material adverse effect our 
revenues and earnings 
evidenced during the overbuilding the late the senior living industry newly constructed buildings may reduce the occupancy rates and some cases reduce the 
monthly rate previously existing communities are able obtain for their services this might result lower revenues for certain our communities faced with new supply while 
believe that many our markets are stable and should continue stable for the immediate future cannot certain that the effects period overbuilding will not affect our 
occupancy and resident fee rate levels the future nor can certain that another period overbuilding the future will not have the same effects moreover while believe that 
the new construction dynamics and the competitive environments the states which operate are substantially similar the national market taken whole the dynamics 
environment were significantly adverse one more those states would have disproportionate effect our revenues due the large portion our revenues that are 
generated those states

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation our financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the united states gaap requires make estimates and judgments that 
affect our reported amounts assets and liabilities revenues and expenses consider accounting estimate critical requires assumptions made that were uncertain 
the time the estimate was made and changes the estimate different estimates that could have been selected could have material impact our consolidated results 
operations financial condition have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect significant estimates and judgments 
self insurance liability accruals 
are subject various legal proceedings and claims that arise the ordinary course our business although maintain general liability and professional liability insurance 
policies for our owned leased and managed communities under master insurance program the company current policies provide for deductibles for each and every claim 
result are effectively self insured for claims that are less than the deductible amounts addition maintain large deductible workers compensation program and selfinsured employee medical program have secured our obligations related general liability professional liability and workers compensation programs with cash aggregating 
million deposits aggregating million and letters credit aggregating million december third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above program 
deductibles and retentions

directly either our corporate offices the communities cash received used pay the actual costs administering the program which include paid claims third party 
administrative fees network provider fees communication costs and other related administrative costs incurred claims are paid they are submitted the plan administrator 
outstanding losses and expenses for general liability and professional liability and workers compensation are estimated based the recommendations independent actuaries and 
management estimates outstanding losses and expenses for our self insured medical program are estimated based the recommendation our third party administrator and 
management estimates 
review the adequacy our accruals related these liabilities ongoing basis using historical claims actuarial valuations third party administrator estimates consultants 
advice from legal counsel and industry data and adjust accruals periodically estimated costs related these self insurance programs are accrued based known claims and projected 
claims incurred but not yet reported subsequent changes actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated information available changes self insurance reserves 
are recorded increase decrease expense the period that the determination made 
income taxes 
account for income taxes under the provisions accounting standards codification asc income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined 
based the difference between the financial statement and tax bases assets and liabilities using tax rates effect for the year which the differences are expected affect taxable 
income valuation allowances are established when necessary reduce deferred tax assets the amounts that are expected realized december and have 
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets approximately million and million respectively when determine that more likely than not that will able 
realize our deferred tax assets the future excess our net recorded amount adjustment the deferred tax asset would made and reflected income this determination will 
made considering various factors including the reversal and timing existing temporary differences tax planning strategies and estimates future taxable income exclusive 
the reversal temporary differences although are currently precluded under gaap from considering estimates future taxable income our analysis due our cumulative 
historical operating losses 
have elected the with and without approach regarding ordering windfall tax benefits determine whether the windfall tax benefit did reduce taxes payable the current year 
under this approach the windfall tax benefits would recognized additional paid capital only incremental tax benefit realized after considering all other tax benefits 
presently available 
lease accounting 
determine whether account for our leases either operating capital financing leases depending the underlying terms december operated 
communities under long term leases with operating capital and financing lease obligations the determination this classification complex and certain situations requires 
significant level judgment our classification criteria based estimates regarding the fair value the leased communities minimum lease payments effective cost funds the 
economic life the community and certain other terms the lease agreements communities under operating leases are accounted for our consolidated statements operations 
lease expenses for actual rent paid plus minus straight line adjustments for fixed estimated minimum lease escalators well amortization above below market rents and 
deferred gains for communities under capital and financing lease obligation arrangements liability established our balance sheets and corresponding long term asset 
recorded lease payments are allocated between principal and interest the remaining base lease obligations for capital lease assets the asset depreciated over the remaining lease 
term unless there bargain purchase option which case the asset depreciated over the useful life for financing lease assets the asset depreciated over the useful life the 
asset addition amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term the lease over the shorter their economic life the lease term sale leaseback transactions are 
recorded lease financing obligations when the transactions include form continuing involvement such purchase options 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
accounts receivable are reported net allowance for doubtful accounts and represent our estimate the amount that ultimately will realized cash the allowance for doubtful 
accounts was million both december and the adequacy our allowance for doubtful accounts reviewed ongoing basis using historical payment 
trends write off experience analyses receivable portfolios payor source and aging receivables well review specific accounts and adjustments are made the 
conditions could have impact the collection existing receivable balances future allowance calculations 
approximately and our resident fee revenues for the years ended december and respectively were derived from private pay customers and and 
our resident fee revenues for the years ended december and respectively were derived from services covered various third party payor programs including 
medicare and medicaid billings for services under third party payor programs are recorded net estimated retroactive adjustments any under reimbursement programs revenue

long lived assets and goodwill 
december and our long lived assets were comprised primarily billion and billion net property plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles 
respectively accounting for our property plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles apply the provisions asc property plant and equipment acquisitions are 
accounted for using the purchase method accounting and the purchase prices are assigned acquired assets and liabilities based their estimated fair values goodwill recorded 
connection with business combinations allocated the respective reporting unit and included our application the provisions asc intangibles goodwill and other 
asc december and had goodwill balances million and million respectively the decrease goodwill during the year ended december 
attributed the allocation goodwill communities sold identified assets held for sale the decrease was partially offset the impact current year changes the 
initial allocation fair values the assets acquired and liabilities for the acquisition emeritus 
test long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for recoverability annually during our fourth quarter whenever changes circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not recoverable recoverability asset group estimated comparing its carrying value the future net undiscounted cash flows expected 
generated the asset group this comparison indicates that the carrying value asset group not recoverable are required recognize impairment loss the 
impairment loss measured the amount which the carrying amount the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value when impairment loss recognized for assets 
held and used the carrying amount those assets permanently adjusted and depreciated over its remaining useful life during and evaluated long lived 
depreciable assets and determined that the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value these assets for all except small number communities estimated fair values were 
determined for these certain properties and recorded non cash asset impairment charges million million and million for and respectively these 
impairment charges are primarily due our decision sell the properties lower than expected performance the underlying communities and equal the amount which the carrying 
values the assets exceed the estimated fair value the case assets held for sale fair value less costs dispose 
test goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter whenever indicators exist that suggest that our goodwill may not recoverable factors consider important 
our analysis whether indicator impairment exists which could trigger impairment goodwill the future include significant decline our stock price for sustained period 
since the last testing date decline our market capitalization below net book value significant underperformance relative historical projected future operating results and 
significant negative industry economic trends first assess qualitative factors determine whether necessary perform two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
are not required calculate the fair value reporting unit unless the entity determines based qualitative assessment that more likely than not that its fair value less than 
its carrying amount the quantitative goodwill impairment test based upon comparison the estimated fair value the reporting unit which the goodwill has been assigned with 
the reporting unit carrying value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during our fourth quarter more frequently required the impairment test consists comparison the 
estimated fair value the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value the carrying amount exceeds its fair value impairment loss recognized for that difference 
estimating the fair value long lived assets groups and reporting units for purposes our goodwill impairment test generally use the income approach the income approach 
utilizes future cash flow projections that are developed internally any estimates future cash flow projections necessarily involve predicting unknown future and require significant 
management judgments and estimates arriving our cash flow projections consider our historic operating results approved budgets and business plans future demographic 
factors expected growth rates and other factors future events may indicate differences from management current judgments and estimates which could turn result future 
impairments future events that may result impairment charges include increases interest rates which could impact capitalization and discount rates differences the projected 
occupancy rates and changes the cost structure existing communities 
using the income approach estimate the fair value long lived assets groups and reporting units for purposes our goodwill impairment test make certain key assumptions 
those assumptions include future revenues and future facility operating expenses and future cash flows that would receive upon sale the communities using estimated 
capitalization rates corroborate the capitalization rates use these calculations with capitalization rates observable from recent market transactions 
where required future cash flows are discounted rate that consistent with weighted average cost capital from market participant perspective the weighted average cost 
capital estimate the overall after tax rate return required equity and debt holders business enterprise 
our annual assessment date october and december our estimated fair values our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and concluded 
based the first step process that there was impairment goodwill the fair value exceeded carrying value more than for each our reporting units with the exception 
our assisted living reporting unit the fair value exceeded the carrying value our assisted living reporting unit approximately goodwill allocated our assisted living 
reporting unit approximately million december determining the fair value reporting unit asset group involves the use significant estimates and 
assumptions which believe reasonable that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins 
used calculate projected future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates significant adverse changes our future revenues and operating margins significant changes the 
market for senior housing the valuation the real estate senior living communities well other events and circumstances including but not limited increased competition 
and changing economic market conditions including market control premiums could result changes fair value and the determination that all portion our goodwill 
impaired the fair value our assisted living reporting unit was estimated utilizing revenue growth rates ranging from expense growth rates from discount 
rates ranging from and capitalization rates ranging from 
our impairment loss assessment contains uncertainties because requires apply judgment estimate whether there has been decline the fair value our reporting units 
including estimating future cash flows and necessary the fair value our assets and liabilities periodically perform this assessment changes our estimates and 
assumptions may cause realize material impairment charges the future although make every reasonable effort ensure the accuracy our estimate the fair value our 
reporting units future changes the assumptions used make these estimates could result the recording impairment loss 
stock based compensation 
asc compensation stock compensation asc requires measurement the cost employee services received exchange for stock compensation based the grantdate fair value the employee stock awards this cost recognized compensation expense ratably over the employee requisite service period incremental compensation costs 
arising from subsequent modifications awards after the grant date must recognized when incurred 
certain our employee stock awards vest only upon the achievement performance targets asc requires recognition compensation cost only when achievement 
performance conditions considered probable consequently our determination the amount stock compensation expense requires significant level judgment estimating the 
probability achievement these performance targets additionally must make estimates regarding employee forfeitures determining compensation expense subsequent 
changes actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated information available 
litigation 
litigation inherently uncertain and the outcome individual litigation matters not predictable with assurance described note the consolidated financial statements 
are involved various legal actions and claims incidental the conduct our business which are comparable other companies the senior living and healthcare industries 
have established loss provisions for matters which losses are probable and can reasonably estimated other instances may not able make reasonable estimate any
