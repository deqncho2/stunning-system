defined below for purposes this bonus calculation non gaap operating income was defined 
our consolidated gaap income from operations before bonuses excluding acquisition related expenses

bonus plan for the named executive officers who participate this plan was structured pay bonuses

once the median employee was identified calculated the median employee total annual

both identifying the median employee and calculating the total annual compensation the 
median employee because believe such compensation measure representative our 
employee compensation and because believe that this compensation measures facilitates
