bid competition mac transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow 
cms contracts with third parties promote the integrity the medicare program through reviews 
quality concerns and detections and corrections improper payments qios for example are groups 
physicians and other health care quality experts that work behalf cms ensure that medicare pays only

compliance including correct coding and medical necessity and the amount overpayments and 
underpayments they identify cms limits the number claims that racs may audit limiting the number 
records that racs may request from hospitals based each provider claim denial rate for the previous year 
cms has implemented the rac program permanent nationwide basis but has not yet expanded the rac

recoveries resulting from rac reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes

managed medicare 
under the managed medicare program the federal government contracts with private health plans 
provide members with medicare part part and part benefits managed medicare plans can structured 
hmos ppos private fee for service plans the medicare program allows beneficiaries choose 
enrollment certain managed medicare plans the medicare prescription drug improvement and 
modernization act increased reimbursement managed medicare plans and expanded medicare 
beneficiaries health care options the health reform law reduced gradual basis through premium 
payments managed medicare plans such that cms managed care per capita premium payments generally 
approximate traditional medicare costs addition the health reform law requires managed medicare plans 
keep annual administrative costs lower than annual premium revenue the health reform law also 
implements fee payment adjustments based service benchmarks and quality ratings the economic 
environment and changing health reform efforts may result reduced premium payments from cms which may 
lead increased beneficiary premiums limits benefits which turn may cause decreased enrollment 
such plans 
medicaid 
medicaid programs are funded jointly the federal government and the states and are administered 
states under approved plans most state medicaid program payments are made under pps are based 
negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals medicaid reimbursement often less than hospital cost 
services the health reform law enacted requires states expand medicaid coverage all individuals 
under age with incomes the federal poverty level fpl and apply income 
disregard the eligibility standard that eligibility effectively extended those with incomes 
the fpl however states may opt out the expansion without losing existing federal medicaid funding 
number states including texas and florida have opted out the medicaid expansion some the states that 
opted out the medicaid expansion provisions are evaluating alternatives such waiver plans extend 
replace existing supplemental payment programs however the future the medicaid expansion uncertain 
result the federal elections 
because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the medicaid program often the 
state largest program states can expected adopt consider adopting legislation designed reduce their 
medicaid expenditures budgetary pressures have recent years resulted and likely will continue result 
decreased spending decreased spending growth for medicaid programs many states certain states 
which operate have adopted broad based provider taxes fund the non federal share medicaid programs 
many states have also adopted are considering legislation designed reduce coverage enroll medicaid 
recipients managed care programs and impose additional taxes hospitals help finance expand the 
states medicaid systems however for children the health reform law enacted requires states least 
maintain medicaid eligibility standards established prior the enactment the law until october 
federal funds under the medicaid program may not used reimburse providers for medical assistance 
provided treat certain provider preventable conditions each state medicaid program must deny payments 
providers for the treatment health care acquired conditions designated cms well other providerpreventable conditions that may designated the state 
congress has expanded the federal government involvement fighting fraud waste and abuse the 
medicaid program through the medicaid integrity program cms employs private contractors referred 
medicaid integrity contractors mics perform post payment audits medicaid claims and identify 
overpayments addition mics several other contractors and state medicaid agencies have increased their 
review activities the health reform law increases federal funding for the medicaid integrity program and 
expands the rac program scope include medicaid claims requiring all states enter into contracts with 
racs audit payments medicaid providers 
managed medicaid 
managed medicaid programs enable states contract with one more entities for patient enrollment care 
management and claims adjudication the states usually not relinquish program responsibilities for financing 
eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design generally contract directly with one the designated entities 
usually managed care organization the provisions these programs are state specific many states direct 
managed care plans pass through supplemental payments designated providers independent services 
rendered ensure consistent funding providers that serve large numbers low income patients 
cms began limiting these pass through payments medicaid managed plans and will ultimately prohibit such 
payments 
enrollment managed medicaid plans has increased recent years state governments seek control 
the cost medicaid programs however general economic conditions the states which operate may 
require reductions premium payments these plans which may reduce enrollment these plans 
accountable care organizations and bundled payment initiatives 
accountable care organization aco network providers and suppliers that work together 
invest infrastructure and redesign delivery processes attempt achieve high quality and efficient delivery 
services promoting accountability and coordination care acos are intended produce savings result 
improved quality and operational efficiency acos that achieve quality performance standards established 
hhs are eligible share portion the amounts saved the medicare program there are several types 
aco programs including the medicare shared savings program mssp which was established pursuant 
the health reform law and the next generation aco model 
the center for medicare medicaid innovation cmmi responsible for establishing demonstration 
projects and other initiatives order identify develop test and encourage the adoption new methods 
delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the medicare and medicaid programs while 
improving quality care for example providers participating bundled payment initiatives agree receive 
one payment for services provided medicare patients for certain medical conditions episodes care 
accepting accountability for costs and quality care rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing 
costs and penalizing providers costs exceed set amount these models are intended lead higher quality 
more coordinated care lower cost the medicare program hospitals may receive supplemental medicare 
payments owe repayments cms depending whether overall cms spending per episode exceeds falls 
below target specified cms and whether quality standards are met the cmmi has implemented voluntary 
bundled payment program known the bundled payment for care improvement bpci initiative more 
recently the cmmi implemented mandatory bundled payment program for hospitals selected geographic 
areas that focused orthopedic care and established similar mandatory program focused cardiac care that 
scheduled begin 
hhs continues focus shifting from traditional fee for service reimbursement models alternative 
payment models that tie reimbursement quality and value including bundled payment programs several 
private insurance companies have expressed their intent increasingly rely such reimbursement models 
which may increasingly shift financial risk providers 
disproportionate share hospital payments 
addition making payments for services provided directly beneficiaries medicare makes additional 
payments hospitals that treat disproportionately large number low income patients medicaid and 
medicare patients eligible receive supplemental security income disproportionate share hospital dsh 
payments are determined annually based certain statistical information required hhs and are paid 
percentage addition drg payments 
the health reform law reduced medicare dsh payments the amount they otherwise would have 
been absent the law the remaining the amount that would otherwise paid under medicare dsh 
effectively pooled and this pool reduced further each year formula that reflects reductions the national 
level uninsured who are under years age thus the greater the level coverage for the previously 
uninsured nationally the more the medicare dsh payment pool will reduced each dsh hospital then 
paid out the reduced dsh payment pool amount allocated based upon its estimated cost providing 
uncompensated care 
hospitals that provide care disproportionately high number low income patients may receive 
medicaid dsh payments the federal government distributes federal medicaid dsh funds each state based 
statutory formula the states then distribute the dsh funding among qualifying hospitals states have broad 
discretion define which hospitals qualify for medicaid dsh payments and the amount such payments the 
health reform law and subsequent legislation provide for reductions the medicaid dsh hospital program 
under current law medicaid dsh will reduced annually follows billion billion 
billion billion billion billion and and billion each cms 
issued final rule establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based the 
volume medicaid inpatients and levels uncompensated care each state under that rule states largely 
retained the ability manage the reduced allotments and allocate these cuts among providers within the state 
however due the delays the onset the reductions new methodology will required prior fiscal year 
tricare 
tricare the department defense health care program for members the armed forces for

all hospitals participating the medicare medicaid and tricare programs whether paid 
reasonable cost basis under pps are required meet certain financial reporting requirements federal and 
where applicable state regulations require the submission annual cost reports covering the revenues costs and 
expenses associated with the services provided each hospital medicare beneficiaries and medicaid 
recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject routine audits which 
may result adjustments the amounts ultimately determined due under these reimbursement 
programs these audits often require several years reach the final determination amounts due from 
under these programs providers also have rights appeal and common contest issues raised audits 
cost reports 
managed care and other discounted plans 
most our hospitals offer discounts from established charges certain large group purchasers health 
care services including managed care plans and private insurance companies admissions reimbursed 
commercial managed care and other insurers were and our total admissions for the years 
ended december and respectively managed care contracts are typically negotiated for 
terms between one and three years while generally received contracted annual average increases that were 
expected yield from managed care payers during there can assurance that will 
continue receive increases the future further not clear what impact any the increased obligations 
managed care payers and other health plans imposed the health reform law and any changes the 
repeal replacement the health reform law will have our ability negotiate reimbursement rates 
uninsured and self pay patients 
self pay revenues are derived from providing health care services patients without health insurance 
coverage and from the patient responsibility portion payments for our health care services that are not covered 
individual health insurance plan collection amounts due from individuals typically more difficult 
than collection amounts due from government commercial payers any increases uninsured individuals 
changes the payer mix greater adoption plan structures that result higher patient responsibility amounts 
could increase amounts due from individuals 
high percentage our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms for the 
year ended december approximately our admissions uninsured patients occurred through our 
emergency rooms the emergency medical treatment and labor act emtala requires any hospital that 
participates the medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every person 
who presents the hospital emergency room for treatment and the individual suffering from 
emergency medical condition either stabilize that condition make appropriate transfer the individual 
facility that can handle the condition the obligation screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions 
exists regardless individual ability pay for treatment the health reform law currently requires health 
plans reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided enrollees without prior authorization and without 
regard whether participating provider contract place the financial impact the obligation screen for 
and stabilize emergency medical conditions has been offset part provisions the health reform law that 
decrease the number uninsured individuals including requirements and incentives for individuals obtain 
and large employers provide insurance coverage 
electronic health record incentives 
the american recovery and reinvestment act arra provides for medicare and medicaid 
incentive payments for eligible hospitals and for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified 
ehr technology and provides for payment reductions for eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that not 
adopt and meaningfully use ehr technology the incentive payments are available for maximum period five 
six years depending the program through december approximately billion incentive 
payments have been made through the medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs eligible hospitals and 
eligible professionals 
hospital utilization 
believe the most important factors relating the overall utilization hospital are the quality and 
market position the hospital and the number and quality physicians and other health care professionals 
providing patient care within the facility generally believe the ability hospital market leader 
determined its breadth services level technology quality and condition the facilities emphasis 
quality care and convenience for patients and physicians other factors that impact utilization include the

competition 
generally other hospitals the communities serve provide services similar those offered our 
hospitals additionally recent years the number freestanding specialty hospitals surgery centers 
emergency departments urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers the geographic areas which 
operate has increased significantly result most our hospitals operate highly competitive 
environment some cases competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals some competing 
facilities are physician owned are owned tax supported government agencies and many others are owned 
not for profit entities that may supported endowments charitable contributions and tax revenues and 
are exempt from sales property and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available our hospitals 
and may provide the tax supported not for profit entities advantage funding capital expenditures 
certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities equipment and 
services that may not available most our hospitals also face competition from specialty hospitals and 
from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ascs for market share certain high margin services 
psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and therefore our 
psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals including the psychiatric units general 
acute care hospitals 
our strategies are designed ensure our hospitals are competitive believe our hospitals compete within 
local communities the basis many factors including the quality care ability attract and retain quality 
physicians skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals location breadth services 
technology offered quality and condition the facilities and prices charged hospitals must make public list 
their standard charges for items and services their policies for providing list such charges response 
inquiry have increased our focus operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more 
convenient service for patients and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians 
two the most significant factors the competitive position hospital are the number and quality 
physicians affiliated with employed the hospital although physicians may any time terminate their 
relationship with hospital operate our hospitals seek retain physicians with varied specialties the 
hospitals medical staffs and attract other qualified physicians believe physicians refer patients 
hospital the basis the quality and scope services renders patients and physicians the quality 
physicians the medical staff the location the hospital and the quality the hospital facilities equipment 
and employees accordingly strive maintain and provide quality facilities equipment employees and 
services for physicians and patients our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing 
physician alignment strategies such employing physicians acquiring physician practice groups and 
participating acos other clinical integration models 
another major factor the competitive position our hospitals our ability negotiate service contracts 
with purchasers group health care services managed care plans attempt direct and control the use 
hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals established gross charges addition employers and 
traditional health insurers continue attempt contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed 
care programs and discounts from established gross charges generally hospitals compete for service contracts 
with group health care services purchasers the basis price market reputation geographic location quality 
and range services quality the medical staff and convenience our future success will depend part 
our ability retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts 
favorable terms other health care providers may impact our ability enter into managed care contracts 
negotiate increases our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions for example some our 
competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans otherwise restrict the ability 
managed care companies contract with the trend toward consolidation among non government payers 
tends increase their bargaining power over fee structures addition health reform efforts such the health 
reform law creation the exchanges and limitations rescissions coverage and pre existing condition 
exclusions may lead non government payers increasingly demanding reduced fees being unwilling 
negotiate reimbursement increases most the plans offered through the exchanges provide for narrow 
networks that restrict the number participating providers tiered networks that impose significantly higher 
cost sharing obligations patients that obtain services from providers disfavored tier these trends may 
continue regardless potential repeal replacement changes the health reform law the importance 
obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community community depending the 
market strength such organizations 
state certificate need con laws which place limitations health care facility ability expand 
services and facilities make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes operations may also have the 
effect restricting competition currently operate health care facilities number states with con laws 
that require other types approvals for the establishment expansion certain facility types services 
before issuing con other approval these states consider the need for additional expanded health care 
facilities services those states that not require state approval that set relatively high levels 
expenditures before they become reviewable state authorities competition the form new services 
facilities and capital spending more prevalent see item business regulation and other factors 
and the health care industry whole face the challenge continuing provide quality patient care 
while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients changes medical technology existing and 
future legislation regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services private 
and government payers remain ongoing challenges 
admissions average lengths stay and reimbursement amounts continue negatively affected 
payer required pre admission authorization utilization review and payer pressure maximize outpatient and 
alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients the health reform law expanded the use 
prepayment review medicare contractors eliminating statutory restrictions their use increased 
competition admission constraints and payer pressures are expected continue meet these challenges 
intend expand and update our facilities acquire construct new facilities where appropriate enhance the 
provision comprehensive array outpatient services offer market competitive pricing private payer 
groups upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new expanded programs and services 
regulation and other factors 
licensure certification and accreditation 
health care facility construction and operation are subject numerous federal state and local regulations 
relating the adequacy medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures maintenance 
adequate records fire prevention rate setting and compliance with building codes and environmental 
protection laws facilities are subject periodic inspection governmental and other authorities assure 
continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation believe our health 
care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws each our acute care hospitals located the 
united states eligible participate medicare and medicaid programs and accredited the joint 
commission any facility were lose its medicare medicaid certification the facility would unable 
receive reimbursement from federal health care programs any facility were lose accreditation the facility 
would subject state surveys potentially subject increased scrutiny cms and likely lose payment 
from non government payers management believes our facilities are substantial compliance with current 
applicable federal state local and independent review body regulations and standards the requirements for 
licensure certification and accreditation are subject change and order remain qualified may become 
necessary for make changes our facilities equipment personnel and services the requirements for 
licensure certification and accreditation also include notification approval the event the transfer 
change ownership certain other changes failure provide required notifications obtain necessary 
approvals these circumstances can result the inability complete acquisition change ownership 
loss licensure lapses reimbursement other penalties 
certificates need 
some states where operate hospitals and other health care facilities the construction expansion 
health care facilities the acquisition existing facilities the transfer change ownership and the addition 
new beds services may subject review and prior approval notifications state regulatory 
agencies under con program such laws generally require the reviewing state agency determine the public 
need for additional expanded health care facilities and services failure provide required notifications 
obtain necessary state approvals can result the inability expand facilities complete acquisition change 
ownership other penalties 
state rate review 
some states have adopted legislation mandating rate budget review for hospitals have adopted taxes 
hospital revenues assessments licensure fees fund indigent health care within the state the aggregate 
indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected our results operations although not 
currently operate facilities states that mandate rate budget reviews cannot predict whether will 
operate such states the future whether the states which currently operate may adopt legislation 
mandating such reviews 
federal health care program regulations 
participation any federal health care program including the medicare and medicaid programs heavily 
regulated statute and regulation hospital fails substantially comply with the numerous conditions 
participation the medicare and medicaid programs performs certain prohibited acts the hospital 
participation the federal health care programs may terminated civil and criminal penalties may 
imposed required the bipartisan budget act civil monetary penalties were significantly increased 
beginning the penalties are required updated annually based updates the consumer 
price index 
anti kickback statute 
section the social security act known the anti kickback statute prohibits providers and others 
from directly indirectly soliciting receiving offering paying any remuneration with the intent generating 
referrals orders for services items covered federal health care program courts have interpreted this 
statute broadly and held that there violation the anti kickback statute just one purpose the 
remuneration generate referrals even there are other lawful purposes furthermore the health reform 
law provides that knowledge the law the intent violate the law not required violations the antikickback statute may punished criminal fine for each violation imprisonment civil 
money penalties per violation after taking into account updates and damages 
three times the total amount the remuneration and exclusion from participation federal health care 
programs including medicare and medicaid these civil monetary penalties will updated annually based 
changes the consumer price index addition submission claim for services items generated 
violation the anti kickback statute may subject additional penalties under the federal false claims act 
fca false fraudulent claim 
the oig among other regulatory agencies responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud abuse and 
waste the oig carries out this mission through nationwide program audits investigations and inspections 
the oig provides guidance the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and special 
fraud alerts these special fraud alerts not have the force law but identify features arrangements 
transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements transactions violate the antikickback statute other federal health care laws the oig has identified several incentive arrangements that 
constitute suspect practices including payment any incentive hospital each time physician refers 
patient the hospital the use free significantly discounted office space equipment facilities 
usually located close the hospital provision free significantly discounted billing nursing other staff 
services free training for physician office staff areas such management techniques and laboratory 
techniques guarantees which provide the physician income fails reach predetermined level the 
hospital will pay any portion the remainder low interest interest free loans loans which may 
forgiven physician refers patients the hospital payment the costs physician travel and 
expenses for conferences coverage the hospital group health insurance plans inappropriately low 
cost the physician payment for services which may include consultations the hospital which require 
few any substantive duties the physician purchasing goods services from physicians prices 
excess their fair market value rental space physician offices other than fair market value terms 
persons entities which physicians refer and physician owned entities frequently referred 
physician owned distributorships pods that derive revenue from selling arranging for the sale 
implantable medical devices ordered their physician owners for use procedures that physician owners 
perform their own patients hospitals ascs the oig has encouraged persons having information about 
hospitals who offer the above types incentives physicians report such information the oig 
the oig also issues special advisory bulletins means providing guidance health care 
providers these bulletins along with the special fraud alerts have focused certain arrangements that could 
subject heightened scrutiny government enforcement authorities including contractual joint venture 
arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those position refer business such 
physicians and those providing items services for which medicare medicaid pays and certain 
gainsharing arrangements the practice giving physicians share any reduction hospital costs 
for patient care attributable part the physician efforts 
addition issuing special fraud alerts and special advisory bulletins the oig issues compliance 
program guidance for certain types health care providers the oig guidance identifies number risk areas 
under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations these areas risk include compensation arrangements 
with physicians recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians 
authorized congress the oig has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories 
activities deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute currently there are statutory 
exceptions and safe harbors for various activities including the following certain investment interests space 
rental equipment rental practitioner recruitment personnel services and management contracts sale practice 
referral services warranties discounts employees group purchasing organizations waiver beneficiary 
coinsurance and deductible amounts managed care arrangements obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies 
investments group practices freestanding surgery centers ambulance replenishing and referral agreements for 
specialty services 
the fact that conduct business arrangement does not fall within safe harbor identified 
special fraud alert special advisory bulletin other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct 
business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute however such conduct and business arrangements 
may lead increased scrutiny government enforcement authorities 
have variety financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer influence the 
referral patients our hospitals other health care facilities and employed physicians including employment 
contracts leases medical director agreements and professional service agreements also have similar 
relationships with physicians and facilities which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers 
addition provide financial incentives including minimum revenue guarantees recruit physicians into 
the communities served our hospitals while endeavor comply with the applicable safe harbors certain 
our current arrangements including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other 
referral sources and persons and entities which refer patients not qualify for safe harbor protection 
although believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients 
have been structured comply with current law and available interpretations there can assurance 
regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the antikickback statute other applicable laws adverse determination could subject liabilities under the 
social security act and other laws including criminal penalties civil monetary penalties and exclusion from 
participation medicare medicaid other federal health care programs 
stark law 
the social security act also includes provision commonly known the stark law the stark law 
prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients entities with which they any their 
immediate family members have financial relationship these entities provide certain designated health 
services reimbursable medicare medicaid unless exception applies the stark law also prohibits 
entities that provide designated health services reimbursable medicare and medicaid from billing the 
medicare and medicaid programs for any items services that result from prohibited referral and requires the 
entities refund amounts received for items services provided pursuant the prohibited referral timely 
basis designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services clinical laboratory services 
and radiology services sanctions for violating the stark law include denial payment civil monetary penalties 
per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs failure refund 
amounts received result prohibited referral timely basis may constitute false fraudulent claim 
and may result civil penalties and additional penalties under the fca the statute also provides for penalty 
for circumvention scheme these penalties take into account updates will further 
updated annually based changes the consumer price index 
there are exceptions the self referral prohibition for many the customary financial arrangements 
between physicians and providers including employment contracts leases and recruitment agreements unlike 
safe harbors under the anti kickback statute with which compliance voluntary financial relationship must 
comply with every requirement stark law exception the arrangement violation the stark law 
although there exception for physician ownership interest entire hospital the health reform law 
prohibits physician owned hospitals established after december from billing for medicare medicaid 
patients referred their physician owners result the law effectively prevents the formation new 
physician owned hospitals that participate medicare medicaid while the health reform law grandfathers 
existing physician owned hospitals does not allow these hospitals increase the percentage physician 
ownership and significantly restricts their ability expand services 
through series rulemakings cms has issued final regulations implementing the stark law while 
these regulations were intended clarify the requirements the exceptions the stark law unclear how 
the government will interpret many these exceptions for enforcement purposes further not always 
have the benefit significant regulatory judicial interpretation the stark law and its implementing 
regulations attempt structure our relationships meet exception the stark law but the regulations 
implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex and cannot assure that every relationship complies 
fully with the stark law 
similar state laws 
many states which operate also have laws similar the anti kickback statute that prohibit payments 
physicians for patient referrals and laws similar the stark law that prohibit certain self referrals these state 
laws often apply regardless the source payment for care and little precedent exists for their interpretation 
enforcement these statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties well loss licensure 
other fraud and abuse provisions 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa broadened the scope certain 
fraud and abuse laws adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply all health 
benefit programs the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and 
statements medicare and medicaid false claims include but are not limited billing for services not 
rendered for misrepresenting actual services rendered order obtain higher reimbursement billing for 
unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud federal enforcement officials have the ability exclude 
from medicare and medicaid any business entities and any investors officers and managing employees 
associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud even the officer managing employee 
had knowledge the fraud criminal and civil penalties may imposed for number other prohibited 
activities including failure return known overpayments certain gainsharing arrangements billing medicare 
amounts that are substantially excess provider usual charges offering remuneration influence 
medicare medicaid beneficiary selection health care provider contracting with individual entity 
known excluded from federal health care program making accepting payment induce physician 
reduce limit services and soliciting receiving any remuneration return for referring individual for 
item service payable federal health care program like the anti kickback statute these provisions are 
very broad civil penalties may imposed for the failure report and return overpayment within days 
identifying the overpayment the date corresponding cost report due whichever later avoid 
liability providers must among other things carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement promptly 
return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports 
some these provisions including the federal civil monetary penalty law require lower burden 
proof than other fraud and abuse laws including the anti kickback statute civil monetary penalties 
per act after taking into account updates may imposed under the federal civil monetary 
penalty law these penalties will updated annually based changes the consumer price index some 
cases violations the civil monetary penalty law may result penalties three times the remuneration 
offered paid solicited received addition violator may subject exclusion from federal and state 
health care programs federal and state governments increasingly use the federal civil monetary penalty law 
especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden proof requirements under the anti kickback 
statute further individuals can receive for providing information medicare fraud and abuse that 
leads the recovery least medicare funds under the medicare integrity program 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws 
are subject state and federal laws that govern the submission claims for reimbursement and 
prohibit the making false claims statements one the most prominent these laws the fca which 
may enforced the federal government directly qui tam plaintiff whistleblower the 
government behalf the government may use the fca prosecute medicare and other government program 
fraud areas such coding errors billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports 
addition the fca covers payments made connection with the exchanges created under the health reform 
law those payments include any federal funds when private party brings qui tam action under the fca 
the defendant not made aware the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation makes 
determination whether will intervene defendant determined court law liable under the fca 
the defendant may required pay three times the actual damages sustained the government plus 
mandatory civil penalties between and for each separate false claim these penalties take into 
account updates will further updated annually based changes the consumer price index 
there are many potential bases for liability under the fca liability often arises when entity knowingly 
submits false claim for reimbursement the federal government the fca defines the term knowingly 
broadly though simple negligence will not give rise liability under the fca submitting claim with reckless 
disregard its truth falsity constitutes knowing submission under the fca and therefore may create 
liability submission claims for services items generated violation the anti kickback statute 
constitutes false fraudulent claim under the fca whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the 
position and some courts have held that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes such the stark 
law have thereby submitted false claims under the fca false claims under the fca also include the knowing 
and improper failure report and refund amounts owed the government timely manner following 
identification overpayment overpayment deemed identified when person has should have 
through reasonable diligence determined that overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment 
every entity that receives least million annually medicaid payments must have written policies for 
all employees contractors agents providing detailed information about false claims false statements and 
whistleblower protections under certain federal laws including the fca and similar state laws addition 
federal law provides incentive states enact false claims laws comparable the fca number states 
which operate have adopted their own false claims provisions well their own whistleblower 
provisions under which private party may file civil lawsuit state court have adopted and distributed 
policies pertaining the fca and relevant state laws 
hipaa administrative simplification and privacy and security requirements 
the administrative simplification provisions hipaa and implementing regulations require the use 
uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted 
received electronically these provisions are intended encourage electronic commerce the health care 
industry required the health reform law hhs the process adopting standards for additional 
electronic transactions and establishing operating rules promote uniformity the implementation each 
standardized electronic transaction addition hipaa requires that each provider use national provider 
identifier cms published final rule requiring the use updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and 
procedures known icd code sets health plans and providers including our hospitals were required 
transition the icd code sets october which required significant administrative changes 
the privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant hipaa extensively regulate the use and 
disclosure individually identifiable health information known protected health information and require 
covered entities including health plans and most health care providers implement administrative physical and 
technical safeguards protect the security such information certain provisions the security and privacy

there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives the federal and state levels 
addressing privacy and security concerns our facilities remain subject any federal state privacy related 
laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa these laws vary and could 
impose additional penalties for example the federal trade commission uses its consumer protection authority 
initiate enforcement actions response data breaches 
emtala 
all our hospitals the united states are subject emtala this federal law requires any hospital 
participating the medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every 
individual who presents the hospital emergency room for treatment and the individual suffering from 
emergency medical condition either stabilize the condition make appropriate transfer the individual 
facility able handle the condition the obligation screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists 
regardless individual ability pay for treatment there are severe penalties under emtala hospital 
fails screen appropriately stabilize transfer individual the hospital delays appropriate treatment 
order first inquire about the individual ability pay penalties for violations emtala include exclusion 
from participation the medicare program and civil monetary penalties these civil monetary penalties 
increased significantly were further adjusted and will increased annually based updates 
the consumer price index addition injured individual the individual family medical facility that 
suffers financial loss direct result hospital violation the law can bring civil suit against the 
hospital 
the government broadly interprets emtala cover situations which individuals not actually 
present hospital emergency room but present for emergency examination treatment the hospital 
campus generally hospital based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions are transported 
hospital owned ambulance subject certain exceptions least one court has interpreted the law also apply 
hospital that has been notified patient pending arrival non hospital owned ambulance emtala 
does not generally apply individuals admitted for inpatient services the government has expressed its intent 
investigate and enforce emtala violations actively believe our hospitals operate substantial 
compliance with emtala 
corporate practice medicine fee splitting 
some the states which operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from 
employing physicians practicing medicine for profit and making certain direct and indirect payments 
entering into fee splitting arrangements with health care providers designed induce encourage the referral 
patients the recommendation particular providers for medical products and services possible 
sanctions for violation these restrictions include loss license and civil and criminal penalties addition 
agreements between the corporation and the physician may considered void and unenforceable these statutes 
vary from state state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted the courts regulatory agencies 
health care industry investigations 
significant media and public attention has focused recent years the hospital industry this media and 
public attention changes government personnel and other factors have led increased scrutiny the health 
care industry except may disclosed our sec filings are not aware any material investigations 
the company under federal state health care laws regulations possible that governmental entities could 
initiate investigations litigation the future facilities operate and that such matters could result 
significant penalties well adverse publicity also possible that our executives and managers could 
included governmental investigations litigation named defendants private litigation 
our substantial medicare medicaid and other governmental billings result heightened scrutiny our 
operations continue monitor all aspects our business and have developed comprehensive ethics and 
compliance program that designed meet exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
because the law this area complex and constantly evolving governmental investigations litigation may 
result interpretations that are inconsistent with our industry practices 
public statements surrounding current investigations governmental authorities have taken positions 
number issues including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available that appear 
inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been 
challenged this manner some instances government investigations that have the past been conducted 
under the civil provisions federal law may now conducted criminal investigations 
both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus and coordination civil and 
criminal enforcement efforts the health care area the oig and the department justice doj have from 
time time established national enforcement initiatives targeting all hospital providers that focus specific 
billing practices other suspected areas abuse the health reform law includes additional federal funding 
million over years fight health care fraud waste and abuse including million federal fiscal 
year addition governmental agencies and their agents such macs fiscal intermediaries and carriers 
may conduct audits our health care operations private payers may conduct similar post payment audits and 
also perform internal audits and monitoring 
addition national enforcement initiatives federal and state investigations have addressed wide variety 
routine health care operations such cost reporting and billing practices including for medicare outliers 
financial arrangements with referral sources physician recruitment activities physician joint ventures and 
hospital charges and collection practices for self pay patients engage many these routine health care 
operations and other activities that could the subject governmental investigations inquiries for example 
have significant medicare and medicaid billings numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are 
referral sources our hospitals and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors certain our 
individual facilities have received and other facilities may receive government inquiries from and may 
subject investigation federal and state agencies any additional investigations the company our 
executives managers could result significant liabilities penalties well adverse publicity 
health care reform 
the health care industry subject changing political regulatory and other influences along with various 
scientific and technological initiatives recent years the congress and certain state legislatures have 
passed large number laws and regulations intended effect major change within the health care 
system the federal elections may result the repeal significant changes the replacement the 
health reform law the most prominent these reform efforts currently the health reform law affects how 
health care services are covered delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage reduced 
growth medicare program spending reductions medicare and medicaid dsh payments and the 
establishment programs that tie reimbursement quality and integration 
the health reform law expands coverage through combination public program expansion and private 
sector health insurance and other reforms expansion public program coverage has been driven primarily 
expanding the categories individuals eligible for medicaid coverage and permitting individuals with relatively 
higher incomes qualify number states including texas and florida have opted out the medicaid 
expansion provisions which they may without losing federal funding for states that have not participated 
the medicaid expansion the maximum income level required for individuals and families qualify for medicaid 
varies widely from state state some the states that have opted out the medicaid expansion are evaluating 
participating alternatives such waiver plans 
the expansion health coverage through the private sector result the health reform law has been 
driven new requirements applicable health insurers employers and individuals for example health 
insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits dropping coverage excluding persons based upon 
pre existing conditions denying coverage for any individual who willing pay the premiums for such 
coverage large employers are required provide health insurance benefits their full time employees pay 
penalty employee obtains government subsidized coverage through exchange individuals are required 
maintain health insurance for minimum defined set benefits pay tax penalty the cost obtaining 
health insurance through the exchanges subsidized the federal government for individuals and families 
below the fpl 
facilitate the purchase health insurance individuals and small employers the health reform law 
mandates that each state establish participate exchange default federally operated exchange 
health insurers participating exchange must offer set minimum benefits defined hhs and may 
offer more benefits however several insurers have limited ended their participation these marketplaces 
creating uncertainty regarding the long term viability the exchanges 
discussed item business sources revenue the health reform law provides for spending 
reductions for medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs also increasingly ties payment for 
services quality outcomes provides for the creation acos and creates incentives and other initiatives 
better coordinate patient care across settings and over time 
the health reform law also makes several significant changes health care fraud and abuse laws 
provides additional enforcement tools the government increases cooperation between agencies establishing 
mechanisms for the sharing information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for 
non compliance for example the health reform law tightens the rules for returning overpayments made 
governmental health programs and expands fca liability include failure timely repay identified 
overpayments the health reform law also prohibits newly created physician owned hospitals from billing for 
medicare patients referred their physician owners result the law effectively prevents the formation 
new physician owned hospitals that participate medicare and medicaid after december while the 
law grandfathers existing physician owned hospitals does not allow these hospitals increase the percentage 
physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability expand services 
the health reform law has had net positive effect the company date before considering the impact 
medicare reductions that began and expected that the law presently implemented will 
continue have meaningful contribution the company results operations however the company could 
affected efforts change repeal replace the health reform law and the potential instability the 
exchanges discussed item risk factors 
general economic and demographic factors 
the health care industry impacted the overall united states economy budget deficits federal state 
and local government entities have had negative impact spending for many health and human service 
programs including medicare medicaid and similar programs which represent significant payer sources for our 
hospitals anticipate that the federal deficit the growing magnitude medicare expenditures and the aging 
the united states population will continue place pressure federal health care programs other risks 
face during periods economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines the population 
covered under managed care agreements increased patient decisions postpone cancel elective and 
nonemergency health care procedures increases the uninsured and underinsured populations increased 
adoption health plan structures that shift financial responsibility patients and further difficulties our 
collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts 
compliance program 
maintain comprehensive ethics and compliance program that designed meet exceed applicable 
federal guidelines and industry standards the program intended monitor and raise awareness various 
regulatory issues among employees and emphasize the importance complying with governmental laws and 
regulations part the ethics and compliance program provide annual ethics and compliance training 
our employees and encourage all employees report any violations their supervisor ethics and compliance 
officer toll free telephone ethics line the health reform law requires providers implement core 
elements compliance program criteria established hhs timeline established hhs 
condition enrollment the medicare medicaid programs and may have modify our compliance 
programs comply with these new criteria 
antitrust laws 
the federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types conduct 
deemed anti competitive these laws prohibit price fixing market allocation bid rigging concerted refusal 
deal market monopolization price discrimination tying arrangements acquisitions competitors and other 
practices that have may have adverse effect competition violations federal state antitrust laws 
can result various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties antitrust enforcement the health care 
industry currently priority the federal trade commission and the doj believe are compliance 
with such federal and state laws but courts regulatory authorities may reach determination the future that 
could adversely affect our operations 
environmental matters 
are subject various federal state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge 
materials into the environment not believe that will required expend any material amounts 
order comply with these laws and regulations 
insurance 
typical the health care industry are subject claims and legal actions patients the ordinary 
course business subject most cases million per occurrence self insured retention our facilities are 
insured our owned insurance subsidiary for losses million per occurrence the insurance 
subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above retention level 
million per occurrence also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers 
for losses excess amounts insured our insurance subsidiary 
purchase from unrelated insurance companies coverage for cyber security incidents directors and 
officers liability and property loss amounts believe are adequate the cyber security and directors and 
officers liability coverage each include million corporate deductible addition will continue 
purchase coverage for our directors and officers ongoing basis the property coverage includes varying 
deductibles depending the cause the property damage these deductibles range from per claim 
the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents 
employees and medical staffs 
december had approximately employees including approximately parttime employees references herein employees refer employees our affiliates are subject various 
state and federal laws that regulate wages hours benefits and other terms and conditions relating employment 
december certain employees our domestic hospitals are represented various labor 
unions while elections are expected possible additional hospitals may unionize the future 
consider our employee relations good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially 
adversely affected our business results operations our hospitals like most hospitals have experienced 
rising labor costs some markets nurse and medical support personnel availability has become significant 
operating issue health care providers address this challenge have implemented several initiatives 
improve retention recruiting compensation programs and productivity 
our hospitals are staffed licensed physicians including both employed physicians and physicians who 
are not employees our hospitals some physicians provide services our hospitals under contracts which 
generally describe term service provide and establish the duties and obligations such physicians require 
the maintenance certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services any licensed physician 
may apply accepted the medical staff any our hospitals but the hospital medical staff and the 
appropriate governing board the hospital accordance with established credentialing criteria must approve

our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers 
the health care business highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other health care 
providers for patients has intensified recent years generally other hospitals the communities serve 
provide services similar those offered our hospitals addition cms publicizes its hospital compare 
website performance data related quality measures and data patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit 
connection with their medicare reimbursement federal law provides for the future expansion the number 
quality measures that must reported additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical 
transparency may have unanticipated impact our competitive position and patient volumes further every 
hospital must establish and update annually public listing the hospital standard charges for items and 
services any our hospitals achieve poor results results that are lower than our competitors these 
quality measures patient satisfaction surveys our standard charges are higher than our competitors our 
patient volumes could decline 
addition the number freestanding specialty hospitals surgery centers emergency departments urgent 
care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers the geographic areas which operate has increased 
significantly result most our hospitals operate highly competitive environment some the 
facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician owned are owned governmental agencies 
not for profit corporations supported endowments charitable contributions and tax revenues and can 
finance capital expenditures and operations tax exempt basis our hospitals face competition from 
competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies such employing physicians acquiring 
physician practice groups and participating acos other clinical integration models our hospitals compete 
with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share 
certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel ascs are better able compete this 
environment than our hospitals our hospitals may experience decline patient volume and may 
experience decrease margin even those patients use our ascs states that not require con other 
type approval for the purchase construction expansion health care facilities services competition 
the form new services facilities and capital spending more prevalent further our competitors are better 
able attract patients make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities 
and equipment recruit physicians expand services obtain favorable managed care contracts their facilities 
than our hospitals and ascs may experience overall decline patient volume see item business 
competition 
deterioration the collectability uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results 
operations 
the primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate the uninsured patient accounts and patient 
accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered the applicable agreement but 
patient responsibility amounts exclusions deductibles and copayments remain outstanding the provision for 
doubtful accounts relates primarily amounts due directly from patients medicare reimburses hospitals for 
eligible medicare bad debts eligible for reimbursement the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria 
including that the debt related unpaid deductible coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted 
collect the fees from the medicare beneficiary 
the amount the provision for doubtful accounts based upon management assessment historical 
write offs and expected net collections business and economic conditions trends federal and state 
governmental and private employer health care coverage the rate growth uninsured patient admissions and 
other collection indicators december our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 
approximately the billion patient due accounts receivable balance the sum the provision for 
doubtful accounts uninsured discounts and charity care increased from billion for 
billion for and billion for 
any increase the amount deterioration the collectability uninsured accounts receivable will 
adversely affect our cash flows and results operations our facilities may experience growth bad debts 
uninsured discounts and charity care result number factors including conditions impacting the overall 
economy and high unemployment result the federal elections the provisions the health reform 
law that have reduced the number uninsured individuals may repealed significantly changed even the 
health reform law remains effect will continue experience collectability issues and provide uninsured 
discounts and charity care for individuals residing states that choose not implement the medicaid expansion 
for undocumented aliens who are not permitted enroll exchange government health care programs and 
for certain others who may not have insurance coverage further some patients may choose enroll lower 
cost medicaid plans other insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels may also adversely 
affected the growth patient responsibility accounts result increases the adoption plan structures 
that shift greater responsibility for care individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible 
amounts 
changes government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues 
significant portion our patient volume derived from government health care programs principally 
medicare and medicaid specifically derived our revenues from the medicare and medicaid 
programs changes government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement receive and 
could adversely affect our business and results operations the health reform law has made significant 
changes medicare and medicaid and future health reform efforts efforts repeal significantly change 
the health reform law may impact these programs 
recent years legislative and regulatory changes have resulted limitations and some cases 
reductions levels payments health care providers for certain services under the medicare program the 
bca requires automatic spending reductions trillion for federal fiscal years through minus 
any deficit reductions enacted congress and debt service costs however the percentage reduction for 
medicare may not more than for fiscal year with uniform percentage reduction across all medicare 
programs these reductions have been extended congress through are unable predict what other 
deficit reduction initiatives may proposed congress whether congress will attempt suspend 
restructure the automatic budget cuts these reductions are addition reductions mandated the health 
reform law which provides for material reductions the growth medicare program spending including 
reductions medicare market basket updates and medicare dsh funding further from time time cms 
revises the reimbursement systems used reimburse health care providers including changes the drg 
system and other payment systems which may result reduced medicare payments for example cms has 
established what referred the two midnight rule under the rule services provided medicare 
beneficiaries are only payable inpatient hospital services when there reasonable expectation that the 
hospital care medically necessary and will required across two midnights absent unusual circumstances 
stays expected need fewer than two midnights hospital care will subject medical review qios 
case case basis providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with the two midnight rule may referred 
racs 
because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the medicaid program often 
state largest program some states have enacted may consider enacting legislation designed reduce their 
medicaid expenditures further many states have also adopted are considering legislation designed reduce 
coverage enroll medicaid recipients managed care programs and impose additional taxes hospitals 
help finance expand the states medicaid systems periods economic weakness may increase the budgetary 
pressures many states and these budgetary pressures may result decreased spending decreased spending 
growth for medicaid programs and chip many states some states that provide medicaid supplemental 
payments are reviewing these programs have filed waiver requests with cms replace these programs and 
cms has performed and continues perform compliance reviews some states programs which could result 
medicaid supplemental payments being reduced eliminated currently texas operates medicaid waiver 
program pursuant waiver that cms agreed extend through december texas has requested 
additional extension the waiver through september cannot predict whether the texas medicaid 
waiver program will further extended continue its current form guarantee that revenues recognized 
from the program will not decrease further legislation and administrative actions the federal level may 
significantly alter the funding for structure the medicaid program for example from time time 
congress considers proposals restructure the medicaid program involve block grants that would 
administered the states 
some cases commercial third party payers rely all portions medicare payment systems 
determine payment rates changes government health care programs that reduce payments under these 
programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third party payers 
current future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts changes laws regulations regarding 
government health care programs other changes the administration government health care programs and 
changes commercial third party payers response health care reform and other changes government 
health care programs could have material adverse effect our financial position and results operations 
our results operations may adversely affected the health reform law repealed replaced 
otherwise significantly changed are unable predict what any and when such changes will made 
the future 
the health reform law has reduced the number uninsured patients whom provide health care 
services has done primarily through the exchanges and medicaid expansion also however reduced our 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement including reductions market basket increases that took effect before 
the effective date the market reforms and medicaid expansion some those decreases were substantial 
nevertheless expected that the health reform law presently implemented will continue have 
meaningful contribution the company results operations 
however many insurers have exited the exchanges the markets served the company the extent 
some markets lack sufficient number insurers participating the exchanges could threaten the continued 
viability the exchanges those markets 
addition has been publicly reported that there are proposals being discussed congress and the 
administration repeal amend replace the law some those proposals include age based rather than 
income based tax credits well risk pools for those with pre existing conditions further there are 
proposals create block grants states for medicaid establish per capita caps state medicaid 
programs those block grants per capita caps could apply not only the medicaid expansion under the health 
reform law but also medicaid whole cannot predict whether any such repeal amend replace 
proposals any parts them will become law and they what their substance timing will the 
president the united states has also signed executive order that directs agencies minimize economic 
and regulatory burdens the health reform law unclear what regulations policies will proposed 
and implemented pursuant that executive order 
any the foregoing events were occur our results operations could materially and adversely 
affected 
our volume patients with commercial insurance declines are unable retain and negotiate 
favorable contracts with nongovernment payers including managed care plans our revenues may reduced 
nongovernment payers including hmos ppos and other managed care plans typically reimburse health 
care providers higher rate than medicare medicaid other government health care programs 
reimbursement rates are set forth contract when our facilities are network and payers utilize plan 
structures encourage require the use network providers revenues derived from nongovernment payers 
domestic only accounted for and our revenues for and respectively 
result our ability maintain increase patient volumes covered nongovernment payers and maintain 
and obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment payers significantly affects the revenues and operating 
results our facilities 
nongovernment payers including managed care payers continue demand discounted fee structures and 
the trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends increase their bargaining power over fee 
structures nongovernment payers may utilize plan structures such narrow networks and tiered networks that 
limit beneficiary provider choices impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care obtained 
from providers disfavored tier other health care providers may impact our ability enter into managed care 
contracts negotiate increases our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions for example 
some our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans otherwise restrict the 
ability managed care companies contract with our future success will depend part our ability 
retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts terms favorable 
not clear what impact any future health reform efforts the repeal changes the health reform 
law will have our ability negotiate reimbursement increases and participate plan networks favorable 
terms are unable retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans experience 
reductions payment increases amounts received from nongovernment payers our revenues may reduced 
our performance depends our ability recruit and retain quality physicians 
the success our hospitals depends part the number and quality the physicians the medical 
staffs our hospitals the admitting and utilization practices those physicians maintaining good relations with 
those physicians and controlling costs related the employment physicians although employ some 
physicians physicians are often not employees the hospitals which they practice and many the 
markets serve most physicians have admitting privileges other hospitals addition our hospitals such 
physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals any time may face increased challenges 
this area the physician population reaches retirement age especially there shortage physicians willing 
and able provide comparable services are unable provide adequate support personnel 
technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs those physicians and their 
patients they may discouraged from referring patients our facilities admissions may decrease and our 
operating performance may decline 
our hospitals face competition for staffing which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent the efforts abilities and experience our management and medical 
support personnel such nurses pharmacists and lab technicians well our physicians compete with 
other health care providers recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible 
for the daily operations each our hospitals including nurses and other nonphysician health care 
professionals some markets the availability nurses and other medical support personnel has been 
significant operating issue health care providers may required continue enhance wages and 
benefits recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel hire more expensive temporary 
contract personnel result our labor costs could increase also depend the available labor pool 
semi skilled and unskilled employees each the markets which operate certain proposed changes 
federal labor laws and the nlrb modification its election procedures could increase the likelihood 
employee unionization attempts the extent significant portion our employee base unionizes possible 
our labor costs could increase materially when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions 
whether such agreements are renewals first contracts there the possibility that strikes could occur during the 
negotiation process and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs addition 
the states which operate could adopt mandatory nurse staffing ratios could reduce mandatory nurse 
staffing ratios already place state mandated nurse staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and 
have adverse impact revenues are required limit admissions order meet the required ratios 
our labor costs increase may not able raise rates offset these increased costs because significant 
percentage our revenues consists fixed prospective payments our ability pass along increased labor costs 
constrained our failure recruit and retain qualified management nurses and other medical support 
personnel control labor costs could have material adverse effect our results operations

financial position and results operations 
our overall business results may suffer during periods general economic weakness 
budget deficits federal state and local government entities have had negative impact spending and 
may continue negatively impact spending for health and human service programs including medicare 
medicaid and similar programs which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals other risks face 
during periods economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines the population 
covered under managed care agreements patient decisions postpone cancel elective and nonemergency 
health care procedures including delaying surgical procedures potential increases the uninsured and 
underinsured populations and further difficulties collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables 
the industry trend toward value based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues 
there trend the health care industry toward value based purchasing health care services these 
value based purchasing programs include both public reporting quality data and preventable adverse events 
tied the quality and efficiency care provided facilities governmental programs including medicare 
currently require hospitals report certain quality data receive full reimbursement updates addition 
medicare does not reimburse for care related certain preventable adverse events also called never events 
the health reform law also prohibits the use federal funds under the medicaid program reimburse 
providers for medical assistance provided treat hacs federal fiscal year the hospitals 
with the worst risk adjusted hac rates the designated performance period receive reduction their 
inpatient pps medicare payments 
hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated hhs will receive reduction their 
inpatient pps operating medicare payments for all medicare inpatient discharges not just discharges relating 
the conditions subject the excess readmission standard the reduction payments hospitals with excess 
readmissions can for federal fiscal year and subsequent years 
hhs has implemented value based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces 
inpatient hospital payments for all discharges federal fiscal year and for subsequent years hhs 
pools the amount collected from these reductions fund payments reward hospitals that meet exceed 
certain quality performance standards established hhs hhs estimates that billion value based 
incentive payments will available hospitals federal fiscal year based achievement relative 
other hospitals and improvement relative the hospital own past performance hospitals that meet exceed 
the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value based purchasing program 
than they would have otherwise 
cms implemented five year mandatory bundled payment initiative for orthopedic services 
selected markets also established new mandatory bundled payment initiative that focused cardiac care 
and scheduled begin depending whether overall cms spending per episode exceeds falls 
below target specified cms and whether quality standards are met hospitals may receive supplemental 
medicare payments owe repayments cms mandatory participation demonstration projects particularly 
demonstrations with the potential affect payment may negatively impact our results operations 
many large commercial payers currently require hospitals report quality data and several commercial 
payers not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events further have implemented policy 
pursuant which not bill patients third party payers for fees expenses incurred due certain 
preventable adverse events 
expect value based purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement patient 
outcome measures become more common and involve higher percentage reimbursement amounts 
cms has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models which may include additional 
mandatory bundled other alternative payment programs and commercial insurers may also transition away 
from fee for service payment models are unable this time predict our future payments whether 
will subject payment reductions under these programs how this trend will affect our results operations

health care facilities often involves licensure approvals reviews and complex change ownership 
processes for medicare and other payers further many states have laws that restrict the conversion sale 
not for profit hospitals for profit entities these laws may require prior approval from the state attorney 
general advance notification the attorney general other regulators and community involvement attorneys

amounts due from payers estimates contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon 
the payment terms specified the related contractual agreements laws and regulations governing the medicare

made payer specific basis and are recorded based the best information available regarding management 
interpretation the applicable laws regulations and contract terms management continually reviews the 
contractual estimation process consider and incorporate updates laws and regulations and the frequent 
changes managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals have 
invested significant resources refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used 
make contractual allowance estimates have developed standardized calculation processes and related 
training programs improve the utility our patient accounting systems

medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every person who presents the 
hospital emergency room for treatment and the individual suffering from emergency medical condition 
either stabilize the condition make appropriate transfer the individual facility able handle the

individual ability pay for treatment federal and state laws and regulations including but not limited

that could result payments that are different from our estimates adjustments estimated medicare and
