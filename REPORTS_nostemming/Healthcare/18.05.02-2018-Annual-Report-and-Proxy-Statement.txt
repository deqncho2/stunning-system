short term cash incentive bonuses our executive compensation programs not include formulaic 
routine annual equity grants all our executive officers although each the last few fiscal years

principal elements compensation 
the compensation our neos for fiscal consisted base salary and stock options including 
stock options granted prior fiscal years that continued vesting during fiscal and with respect 
certain neos rsus the relative proportion these components have not been dictated any 
particular formula and the mix and amount compensation elements has been and will continue 
within the discretion and business judgment our compensation committee 
our compensation committee has structured these compensation programs attract new senior 
executives provide competitive levels more liquid and less volatile compensation through base 
salary and rsus continue foster ownership mentality and alignment with the long term interests 
stockholders through the use rsus and stock options and encourage the achievement key 
operational goals 
base salary provide base salaries our executive officers compensate them for services 
rendered day day basis and provide sufficient fixed cash compensation allow them fund 
their personal and household expenses while remaining focused their responsibilities veeva 
since our ipo veeva has maintained largely flat annual base salary structure for our executive 
officers during fiscal and after the compensation committee standardized the cash 
compensation for our senior vice president global customer services par with our other 
executive officers all our neos had annual base salary base salaries paid our 
neos for fiscal are reflected the summary compensation table below 
march our compensation committee increased the base salary level for our executive officers 
from acknowledge their contributions the business and increased level 
responsibility due our growth over the two years since the last base salary increase expect that 
our compensation committee will continue review base salary levels annually and may review them 
more frequently for example connection with promotion 
annual cash incentive bonuses with one exception described below have not offered 
short term cash incentive bonus program our neos since our ipo and our compensation 
committee again determined for fiscal not offer such program rather our board and 
compensation committee continue believe that our reliance equity compensation adequately 
facilitates the achievement corporate operational goals and aligns each neo with long term 
stockholder interest accordingly none our neos were paid any cash incentive bonus for fiscal 
veeva systems inc proxy statement 
executive compensation 
the one exception our policy not offering short term cash incentive bonuses was for the executive 
officer the role senior vice president global customer services however march our 
compensation committee consultation with our management determined that the executive the 
senior vice president global customer services role could adequately incentivized through stock 
options and rsus similar our other neos therefore the short term cash incentive bonus 
arrangement for our senior vice president global customer services currently lequient was 
permanently suspended 
ceo equity compensation with respect our chief executive officer gassner our 
compensation committee has purposefully placed strong emphasis long term incentive 
compensation the form stock options most effectively align his long term interests with those 
our stockholders prior completing our ipo october our compensation committee 
determined maintain simple executive compensation program for gassner that would continue 
foster ownership mentality heavily emphasizing long term equity compensation the form 
stock options over cash compensation 
march gassner was granted options purchase shares our common stock 
the pre ipo grant this grant began vesting over five year period beginning february 
through our fiscal year ending january and was intended provide his only long term 
incentive compensation for that five year period until january gassner had not been 
granted any additional long term incentive awards since the pre ipo grant was paid short term 
cash incentive bonus and received below market annual base salary similar all our other 
executive officers our board believes the pre ipo grant has appropriately and successfully 
compensated gassner lead our business and drive our success and has best aligned his 
interests with the long term interests our stockholders and our vision build lasting growing cloud 
company our board continues believe that this stage veeva growth appropriate 
evaluate grants for gassner five year cadence 
veeva systems inc proxy statement 
proxy statement 
equity awards grant stock options and rsus from time time our employees including our 
executive officers under our stock plans however our executive compensation programs not 
include formulaic routine annual equity grants all our executive officers all cases other than the 
recent grant our chief executive officer which involved options priced above the market price 
the grant date stock options allow our executive officers purchase shares our common stock 
price per share equal the fair market value our common stock the date grant our options 
typically have five year vesting schedule our compensation committee believes that options are 
inherently performance based because the holder benefits only our stock price increases following 
the option grant date aligning the option holder interest closely with those our stockholders 
addition our rsu awards provide shares that will issued upon satisfaction service period vesting 
conditions typically over four year vesting schedule our compensation committee believes that 
grant rsu awards serves effective retention tool for our executive officers because unvested 
awards are forfeited executive officer voluntarily leaves before the awards have vested and 
because they have more readily ascertainable cash value and provide greater liquidity than stock 
options believe that the combination stock options and rsus our long term equity program 
emphasizes ownership culture and rewards our executives for growing our business 
executive compensation 
accordingly after extensive review and deliberation the compensation committee and discussion 
with our board over approximately seven month period january upon the 
recommendation our compensation committee our board approved grant gassner 
options purchase aggregate shares our class common stock the new 
options with exercise price above the closing stock price that date the new options have 
exercise price per share which approximated the day average closing stock prices 
around our all time high closing stock price prior january the closing price our stock

subject any contractual vesting acceleration provisions moreover the new options reflect the 
continuation five year long term incentive compensation cycle for gassner and not begin 
vesting based upon the service based vesting conditions until gassner pre ipo grant options 
complete vesting through our fiscal year ending january the added features time based 
vesting that continue for seven years after grant stock price target vesting conditions that apply

veeva systems inc proxy statement 
executive compensation 
consistent with its long term focused approach described above our board intends that the new 
options will the only long term incentive awards that gassner granted until least 
the disclosure rules that apply the summary compensation table require that reflect the entire 
grant date fair value for the new options fiscal determining approve recommend 
respectively the new options grant our board and our compensation committee considered the fact 
that given its five year grant cycle for gassner and the delayed vesting commencement date the 
fair value the new options might more appropriately thought allocating the grant date fair 
value equal portions each the five fiscal years which the options will vest fiscal 
through fiscal the fair value allocated under that methodology each year the five year 
vesting period would have been 
keeping with the compensation approach applied our chief financial officer and president our 
compensation committee last granted equity awards these officers march the form 
stock options with longer than usual vesting periods each six years that time our chief financial 
officer and president each received options purchase shares our common stock which 
awards continue vest through our fiscal year ending january information about these 
stock options can found the outstanding equity awards fiscal year end table below 
neither our chief financial officer nor our president has been granted any additional equity awards 
since 
other neo equity compensation not have general practice making annual equity grants 
all our executive officers however fiscal our compensation committee granted rsus 
messrs faddis and lequient the compensation committee granted additional rsus faddis 
after observing that his cash compensation was below the percentile our peer group even 
factoring the annual cash value the vesting his rsus held prior the grant the compensation 
committee also granted lequient rsus connection with standardizing his compensation

president and cfo equity compensation with respect our chief financial officer and president 
our compensation committee has purposefully placed strong emphasis long term incentive 
compensation the form stock options most effectively align the officers long term interests with 
those our stockholders prior completing our ipo october our compensation committee 
determined maintain through the ipo and for some years thereafter simple executive 
compensation program for these executives that would continue foster ownership mentality 
heavily emphasizing long term equity compensation the form stock options over cash 
compensation not currently provide these executive officers any form compensation other 
than base salary and the stock options granted prior our ipo date our compensation 
committee the view that this compensation approach appropriate for these most senior 
executive officers 
executive compensation 
severance and change control benefits other than faddis none our executive officers 
currently eligible for any severance change control related benefits faddis offer letter with 
negotiated when was hired late provides that terminated without cause 
resigns for good reason within days prior months following change control then will 
vest all his then outstanding equity awards the same extent had remained employed for 
additional months from the date such termination resignation 
other compensation related policies 
executive officer recoupment policy 
have not adopted policy whether will make retroactive adjustments any cash equitybased incentive compensation paid our neos others where the payment was predicated upon 
the achievement financial results that were subsequently the subject restatement while 
not currently offer variable compensation based upon achievement financial results our 
compensation committee continues evaluate the adoption recoupment policy pending final 
sec rules the meantime intend comply with all applicable laws and regulations requiring any 
adjustments recovery incentive compensation 
stock ownership guidelines trading and hedging policies 
our corporate governance principles encourage our executive officers own veeva stock 
not however have stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers that require ownership 
specific amount veeva stock because our compensation committee believes that the stock and 
option holdings our executive officers are sufficient this time align their interests with those 
our stockholders however continue evaluate the usefulness and appropriateness such 
guidelines from time time our executive officers are subject our insider trading policy that 
prohibits among other things hedging transactions veeva stock pledging veeva stock and holding 
veeva stock margin account among other restrictions 
compensation policies and practices they relate risk management 
our compensation committee has reviewed our compensation related risks and does not believe that 
our compensation policies and practices encourage undue inappropriate risk taking create risks 
that are reasonably likely have material adverse effect veeva since our straight forward 
executive compensation programs continue foster ownership mentality emphasizing long term 
equity compensation over cash compensation 
tax and accounting considerations 
deductibility executive compensation 
section the code modified the tax cuts and jobs act tax act will limit the 
amount that may deduct from our federal income taxes for remuneration paid our executive 
officers one million dollars per executive officer per year unless certain requirements are met while 
our compensation committee mindful the benefit the deductibility compensation and 
will consider deductibility when analyzing potential compensation alternatives our compensation 
committee believes that should not constrained the requirements section where 
those requirements would impair flexibility compensating our executive officers manner that can 
best promote our corporate objectives therefore our compensation committee has not adopted

our subscription orders are generally billed beginning the subscription commencement date 
annual quarterly increments many our customers including many our large customers are 
billed quarterly basis and therefore substantial portion the value contracts billed 
veeva systems inc form 
quarterly basis will not reflected our deferred revenue the end any given quarter also 
because the terms orders for additional end users solutions are typically coterminus with the 
anniversary date the initial order for related solution the terms such orders for additional end 
users solutions can for relatively short periods time often less than one year and payment 
terms may also quarterly therefore the annualized value such orders that enter into with our 
customers will not completely reflected deferred revenue any single point time have 
also agreed from time time and may agree the future allow customers change the renewal 
dates their orders for example align more closely with customer annual budget process 
align with the renewal dates other orders placed other entities within the same corporate control 
group change payment terms from annual quarterly vice versa such changes typically 
result order less than one year necessary align all orders the desired renewal date 
and thus may result lesser increase deferred revenue than the renewal date adjustment had 
not occurred additionally coterminus order less than one year renews the same fiscal year 
which was originally signed and has annual billing terms the order will generate more deferred 
revenue that fiscal year than the annual contract value that order accordingly not believe 
that changes quarterly basis deferred revenue calculated billings metric commonly cited 
financial analysts that the sum the change deferred revenue plus revenue are accurate 
indicators future revenues for any given period time upon the adoption topic the 
calculated billings metric will the sum the change deferred revenue plus revenue minus the 
change unbilled accounts receivable however many companies that provide cloud based software 
report changes deferred revenue calculated billings key operating financial metrics and

veeva vault solutions are expected increase percentage subscription services revenues and 
total revenues going forward however compared veeva crm have less experience selling 
certain applications within veeva vault and veeva commercial cloud are also extending certain 
our solutions outside the life sciences industry north america and europe although certain our 
veeva vault applications have begun achieve meaningful market acceptance within the life sciences 
industry the extent that our more recently introduced solutions not continue achieve significant 
market acceptance our business and results operations may adversely affected 
customers that have least one our commercial cloud products veeva vault customers are those 
customers that have least one vault product many our veeva vault applications are used 
smaller earlier stage pre commercial companies some which may not reach the commercialization

current customers the end that quarter generally enter into single master subscription 
agreement with each customer although some instances affiliated legal entities within the same 
corporate family may enter into separate master subscription agreements divisions subsidiaries and 
operating units our customers often place distinct orders for our subscription services under the 
same master subscription agreement and not count such distinct orders new customers for 
purposes determining our total customer count with respect data services customers that have 
not purchased one our software solutions count distinct customer the party with master

new subscription orders typically have one year term and automatically renew unless notice 
cancellation provided advance customer adds end users solutions existing order 
such additional orders will generally coterminus with the anniversary date the initial order and 
result orders for additional end users solutions will commonly have initial term less than one 
year subscription orders are generally billed the beginning the subscription commencement date 
annual quarterly increments because the term orders for additional end users solutions 
commonly less than one year and payment terms may also quarterly the annualized value such 
orders that enter into with our customers will not completely reflected deferred revenue any 
single point time have also agreed from time time and may agree the future allow 
customers change the renewal dates their orders for example align more closely with 
customer annual budget process align with the renewal dates other orders placed other 
entities within the same corporate control group change payment terms from annual quarterly 
vice versa such changes typically result order less than one year necessary align all 
orders the desired renewal date and thus may result lesser increase deferred revenue than 
the adjustment had not occurred additionally coterminus order less than one year renews 
the same fiscal year which was originally signed and has annual billing terms the order will 
generate more deferred revenue that fiscal year than the annual contract value that order 
accordingly not believe that changes quarterly basis deferred revenue calculated 
billings metric commonly cited financial analysts that the sum the change deferred 
revenue plus revenue are accurate indicators future revenues for any given period time note that 
upon the adoption topic the calculated billings metric will the sum the change deferred 
revenue plus revenue minus the change unbilled accounts receivable

annual quarterly increments 
subscription services revenues are recognized ratably over the order term beginning when the

subcontractors perform our professional services engagements with customers our professional 
services engagements are primarily billed time and materials basis and revenues are typically 
recognized the services are rendered certain professional services revenues are based fixed 
fee arrangements and revenues are recognized based the proportional performance method 
some cases the terms our time and materials and fixed fee arrangements may require that defer 
the recognition revenue until contractual conditions are met those circumstances revenue

non gaap financial measures 
our public disclosures have provided non gaap measures which define financial 
information that has not been prepared accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the united states gaap addition our gaap measures use these non gaap measures 
internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and analyzing our financial results 
for the reasons set forth below believe that excluding the following items from our non gaap 
financial measures provides information that helpful understanding our operating results 
evaluating our future prospects comparing our financial results across accounting periods and 
comparing our financial results our peers many which provide similar non gaap financial 
measures 
stock based compensation expenses exclude stock based compensation expenses from 
our non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses that exclude from 
veeva systems inc form 
our internal management reporting processes also find useful exclude these expenses 
when assess the appropriate level various operating expenses and resource allocations 
when budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because varying 
available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety award types that 
companies can use under fasb asc topic believe excluding stock based 
compensation expenses allows investors make meaningful comparisons between our 
recurring core business operating results and those other companies 
amortization purchased intangibles incur amortization expense for purchased intangible 
assets connection with acquisitions certain businesses and technologies amortization 
intangible assets non cash expense and inconsistent amount and frequency because 
significantly affected the timing size acquisitions and the inherent subjective nature 
purchase price allocations because these costs have already been incurred and cannot 
recovered and are non cash expenses exclude these expenses for internal management 
reporting processes also find useful exclude these charges when assessing the 
appropriate level various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting 
planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use intangible assets 
contributed our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute our future 
period revenues well 
deferred compensation associated with the zinc ahead acquisition the zinc ahead share 
purchase agreement revised called for share purchase consideration deferred and 
paid rate one third the deferred consideration amount per year certain former zinc 
ahead employee shareholders and option holders who remain employed with each 
deferred consideration payment date accordance with gaap these payments are being 
accounted for deferred compensation and the expense recognized over the requisite 
service period view this deferred compensation expense unusual acquisition cost 
associated with the zinc ahead acquisition and find useful exclude order assess the 
appropriate level various operating expenses assist budgeting planning and forecasting 
future periods believe excluding this deferred compensation expense from our non gaap 
measures may allow investors make more meaningful comparisons between our recurring 
operating results and those other companies 
income tax effects the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses the 
income tax effects that are excluded from the non gaap measures relate the imputed tax

capitalization internal use software development expenses and the subsequent amortization 
the capitalized expenses capitalize certain costs incurred for the development 
computer software for internal use and then amortize those costs over the estimated useful life 
capitalization and amortization software development costs can vary significantly depending 
the timing products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
our internal management reporting processes exclude both the capitalization software which 
would otherwise result reduction net research and development operating expenses and 
the amortization capitalized software which would otherwise result increase cost 
subscription revenues when preparing budgets plans and reviewing internal performance 
moreover because the variety approaches taken and the subjective assumptions made 
other companies this area believe that excluding the effects capitalized software costs 
allows investors make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and 
those other companies 
limitations the use non gaap financial measures 
there are limitations using non gaap financial measures because non gaap financial 
measures are not prepared accordance with gaap and may different from non gaap financial 
measures provided other companies 
the non gaap financial measures are limited value because they exclude certain items that 
may have material impact upon our reported financial results addition they are subject inherent 
limitations they reflect the exercise judgments management about which items are adjusted 
calculate our non gaap financial measures compensate for these limitations analyzing current 
and future results gaap basis well non gaap basis and also providing gaap 
measures our public disclosures 
non gaap financial measures should not considered isolation from substitute for 
financial information prepared accordance with gaap encourage investors and others review 
our financial information its entirety not rely any single financial measure evaluate our
