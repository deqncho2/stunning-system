assumptions conditions you should consider your evaluation our financial condition and results operations with 
these policies judgments and estimates mind 
while describe our significant accounting policies the notes our consolidated financial statements 
appearing elsewhere this annual report form believe the following accounting policies are the most critical 
the judgments and estimates use the preparation our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
recognize revenue from product sales services rendered when persuasive evidence arrangement exists 
services have been rendered iii the price our client fixed determinable and collectability reasonably 
assured 
when enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables apply the accounting guidance for revenue 
arrangements with multiple deliverables and evaluate each deliverable determine whether represents separate unit 
accounting based the following criteria whether the delivered item has value the client standalone basis and 
the contract includes general right return relative the delivered item delivery performance the undelivered 
item considered probable and substantially our control revenue allocated each element arrangement based 
selling price hierarchy the selling price for deliverable based estimated selling prices esp vendor specific 
objective evidence third party evidence not available establish esp for the elements our arrangements based 
upon our pricing practices and class client the stated prices for the various deliverables our contracts are consistent 
across classes clients 
product revenue

risk management solutions under these contracts revenue generated through the following components

prescription medication revenue 
sell prescription medications directly healthcare organizations through our prescription fulfillment 
pharmacies prescription medication fees are based upon the prices stated client contracts for the prescription and include 
dispensing fee prescription medications are considered separate unit accounting prescription medication revenue 
including dispensing fees recognized when the product shipped the client for the periods presented substantially all 
our product revenue has been the form prescription medication revenue 
per member per month fees medication risk management services 
receive fixed monthly administrative fee for each member the program contracted for medication risk 
management services this fee which included product revenue our income statement recognized monthly 
basis medication risk management services are provided the services associated with the per member per month fees are 
considered separate unit accounting 
service revenue 
provide medication risk management services utilizing the mrm matrix technology alone without the related 
fulfillment services which are referred mrm service contracts began entering into these mrm service contracts 
the third quarter our mrm service contracts also include services provided the srx business which was 
acquired september the srx business provides mtm technology and services for medicare medicaid and 
commercial health plans which are referred mtm contracts 
also enter into contracts with healthcare organizations provide risk adjustment and pharmacy cost 
management services which include training client staff and providers about documentation and diagnosis coding 
analyzing clients data collection and submission processes and delivering meaningful analytics for understanding 
reimbursement complexities 
under the mrm service contracts mtm contracts and risk adjustment contracts there are generally four revenue 
generating components 
set fees 
our contracts for mrm and risk adjustment services often require customers pay non refundable set fees 
which are deferred and recognized over the estimated term the contract these fees are charged the beginning the 
customer relationship compensation for our efforts prepare the customer and configure its system for the data collection 
process the set activities not represent separate unit accounting they not have value apart from the broader 
mrm service contracts mtm contracts and risk adjustment contracts incremental direct costs associated with such set 
activities are also deferred and amortized over the shorter the estimated customer life stated contract period 
per member per month fees 
receive fixed monthly fee for each member the respective programs these services represent separate unit 
accounting and are offered independently from any other services revenue for these services recognized each month 
the services are performed per member per month fees mtm contracts are recognized comprehensive medication 
reviews are completed 
per transaction fee 
under our mtm contracts also receive transactional fees based fixed fee per comprehensive medication 
review revenue recognized comprehensive medication reviews are completed 
hourly consulting fees 
sometimes contract with clients perform various other services such services are billed time and 
materials basis agreed hourly rates consulting services represent separate unit accounting and are offered 
independently from any other services revenue for these services recognized time incurred the project 
table contents 
our pharmacy cost management services include subscription revenue from clients and revenues from drug 
manufacturers for the sale drug utilization data subscription revenue recognized monthly either flat fee 
percentage monthly transactions incurred data and statistics fees from drug manufacturers are recognized revenue when 
received due the unpredictable nature the payment amounts and because fees are not fixed and determinable until 
received 
addition receive hosting fees for srx cloud based platform used deliver mtm services and data analytics 
support pharmacies managing their value based contracts these hosting fees are recognized monthly either flat fee 
fixed monthly fee per user basis 
business combinations and contingent consideration 
acquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method accounting which requires that the purchase 
price allocated the net assets acquired their respective fair values any excess the purchase price over the estimated 
fair values the net assets acquired recorded goodwill amounts allocated contingent consideration are recorded 
the balance sheet the date acquisition based their relative fair values the purchase price allocation requires 
make significant estimates and assumptions especially the acquisition date with respect intangible assets although 
believe the assumptions and estimates have made are reasonable they are based part historical experience and 
information obtained from the management the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
account for contingent consideration accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business 
combination accounting rules part our consideration for the medliance and srx acquisitions were and are 
contractually obligated pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome future events therefore are required 
update our underlying assumptions each reporting period based new developments and record such contingent 
consideration liabilities fair value until the contingency resolved changes the fair value the contingent 
consideration liabilities are recognized each reporting period and included our consolidated statements operations 
examples critical estimates used valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include 
future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies 
the acquired company trade name and customer relationships well assumptions about the period time 
the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue used the combined company 
portfolio 
the probability meeting the future events and 
discount rates used determine the present value estimated future cash flows 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and different estimates were used the purchase price 
for the acquisition could allocated the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that have made 
addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy validity such estimates 
and such events occur may required record charge against the value ascribed acquired asset increase 
the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 
goodwill 
goodwill consists the excess purchase price over fair value net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill not amortized but tested for impairment annually gaap provides entity option perform qualitative 
assessment determine whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying 
amount prior performing the two step goodwill impairment test this the case the two step goodwill impairment test 
required more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit greater than its carrying amount the two step 
goodwill impairment test not required the two step goodwill impairment test required first the fair value the 
reporting unit compared with its carrying amount including goodwill the fair value the 
table contents 
reporting unit less than its carrying amount indication goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the 
entity must perform step two the impairment test measurement under step two impairment loss recognized for any 
excess the carrying amount the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value that goodwill the implied fair 
value goodwill determined allocating the fair value the reporting unit manner similar purchase price 
allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation the implied fair value the reporting unit goodwill 
factors generally consider important our qualitative assessment that could trigger step two impairment test 
include significant underperformance relative expected operating trends significant changes the way assets are used 
underutilization our tangible assets discontinuance certain products our clients changes the competitive 
environment and significant negative industry economic trends 
impairment long lived assets including other intangible assets 
long lived assets consist property and equipment software development costs and definite lived intangible 
assets long lived assets held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events changes business 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount the assets may not fully recoverable factors that consider 
deciding when perform impairment review include significant underperformance the business relation 
expectations significant negative industry economic trends and significant changes planned changes the use the 
assets impairment review performed evaluate long lived asset for recoverability compare forecasts 
undiscounted cash flows expected result from the use and eventual disposition the long lived asset its carrying value 
impairment loss would recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected result from the use 
asset are less than its carrying amount the impairment loss would based the excess the carrying value the 
impaired asset over its fair value determined based discounted cash flows 
although believe the carrying values our long lived assets are currently realizable future events could cause 
conclude otherwise
