individual contributions each these companies towards this combined focus are follows 
evident formed april provides comprehensive acute care electronic health record ehr solution thrive and related services for 
community hospitals and their physician clinics 
healthland provides comprehensive acute care ehr solution centriq and related services for community hospitals and their physician clinics 
trubridge focuses providing business management consulting and managed services along with its complete revenue cycle management 
rcm solution for all care settings regardless their primary healthcare information solutions provider 
aht provides comprehensive post acute care ehr solution and related services for skilled nursing and assisted living facilities 
our companies currently support approximately acute care facilities and approximately post acute care facilities with geographically 
diverse customer mix within the domestic community healthcare market the company has limited presence the international healthcare marketplace 
with one client the caribbean nation maarten 
our target market for our acute care solutions includes community hospitals with fewer acute care beds our primary focus within this defined 
target market hospitals with fewer beds which comprise approximately our acute care hospital ehr customer base our target market for 
our trubridge services includes community hospitals with fewer acute care beds the target market for our post acute care solutions consists over 
long term and skilled nursing facilities during generated revenues million from the sale our products and services 
industry dynamics 
the healthcare industry the largest industry the united states economy comprising approximately the gross domestic product 
according the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms cms estimates that fiscal total healthcare spending will reach 
trillion the estimated gross domestic product 
hospital services represents one the largest categories total healthcare expenditures comprising approximately total healthcare 
expenditures according the cms according the american hospital association aha hospital statistics edition there are 
approximately community hospitals the united states that are our target market hospitals with fewer beds with approximately 
those our primary area focus fewer acute care beds addition there market small specialty hospitals that focus discrete medical 
areas such surgery rehabilitation and long term acute care 
notwithstanding the size and importance the healthcare industry within the united states economy the industry constantly challenged 
changing economic dynamics increased regulation and pressure improve the quality healthcare these challenges are particularly significant for the 
hospitals our target market due their more limited financial and human resources and their dependency medicare and medicaid populations for 
substantial portion their revenue however believe healthcare providers can successfully address these issues with the help advanced medical 
information systems and our suite complementary services specific examples the challenges and opportunities facing healthcare providers include the 
following 
changing economic dynamics the economy the healthcare industry although not immune general macroeconomic conditions heavily 
impacted legislative and regulatory initiatives the federal and state governments these legislative and regulatory initiatives have particularly 
significant impact our customer base community hospitals typically generate significant portion their revenues from beneficiaries the medicare 
and medicaid programs consequently even small 
changes these federal and state programs have disproportionately larger effect community hospitals compared larger facilities where greater 
portions their revenues are typically generated from beneficiaries private insurance programs medicare and medicaid funding and reimbursements 
fluctuate year year and with the growth healthcare costs will continue scrutinized the federal and state governments attempt control the costs 
and growth the program the medicaid program which federal state program managed the individual states and dependent part funding from 
the states also continues experience funding issues due the increasing cost healthcare and limited state revenues 
mandatory cuts federal spending resulting from the budget control act the budget control act became effective march 
although medicaid specifically exempted from the cuts mandated the legislation the budget control act includes reduction federal 
medicare spending which has been achieved reduced reimbursements healthcare providers additionally the patient protection and affordable care 
act more commonly referred the affordable care act the aca has put into effect number provisions designed reduce medicare and 
medicaid program spending significant amounts the federal government seeks the future further limit deficit spending due fiscal restraints 
will likely continue cut entitlement spending programs such medicare and medicaid matching grants which will place further cost pressures 
hospitals and other healthcare providers furthermore federal and state budget shortfalls could lead potential reductions funding for medicare and 
medicaid further reductions reimbursements from medicare and medicaid could lead hospitals postponing expenditures information technology 
while legislative and regulatory initiatives are placing significant pressure medicare and medicaid reimbursements our customer base 
community hospitals also likely faced with increases demand for medicare and medicaid services expect that the demand for medicare and 
medicaid services will increase for the foreseeable future due the growing number people born during the post world war baby boom that are 
becoming eligible for medicare benefits age well states electing expand medicaid coverage under the provisions the aca the challenges 
posed this dual threat increased demand for medicare and medicaid services and downward pressure reimbursements are further complicated the 
shift away from volume based reimbursement towards value based reimbursement linking reimbursement quality measurements and outcomes 
compete the continually changing healthcare environment providers are increasingly using technology order help maximize the efficiency 
their business practices assist enhancing patient care and maintain the privacy and security patient information healthcare providers are 
placing increased demands their information systems accomplish these tasks believe that information systems must facilitate management 
patient information across administrative financial and clinical tasks information systems must also effectively interface with variety payor 
organizations within the increasingly complex reimbursement environment 
the american recovery and reinvestment act the federal government enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act 
the arra which included the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech hitech authorized the ehr 
incentive program which provided significant incentive funding physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using 
technology such our ehr solutions the level which healthcare providers must prove they are effectively utilizing such solutions order qualify for 
these incentives measured through escalating criteria designated meaningful use result our obtaining the required certifications and our 
track record with our hospital customers successfully achieving meaningful use the arra continues have positive impact our business and the 
businesses the community hospitals that comprise our target market 
continued push for improved patient care with the increased pressure reduce medical errors and improve patient safety driven part the 
general shift towards value based reimbursement hospitals are actively seeking information technology solutions for clinical decision support this 
migration toward clinical decision support solutions further supported the arra provisions the arra offered incentives for hospitals become 
meaningful users ehrs through september hospitals and healthcare providers that did not implement and demonstrate meaningful use ehrs 
october were penalized with lower medicare payment levels after that date 
the face decreasing revenue and increasing pressure improve patient care healthcare providers are need management tools and related 
services that increase efficiency the delivery healthcare services reduce medical errors effectively track the cost delivering services that 
those costs can properly managed and increase the speed and rate reimbursement hospital failure adequately invest modern medical 
information system could result fewer patient referrals cost inefficiencies lower than expected reimbursement increased malpractice risk and possible 
regulatory infractions 
despite challenging economic conditions believe the industry has increased and will continue increase its adoption information technology 
management tool particularly result the arra additionally believe that the 
industry will continue increase its utilization third party services that contribute the achievement these and other objectives necessary for success 
the current environment believe these dynamics should allow for future revenue growth for both our information technology solutions and our 
complementary suite services 
our solutions 
have tailored information technology solutions that effectively address the specific needs small and midsize hospitals due their smaller 
operating budgets community hospitals have limited financial and human resources operate manual inefficient information systems however these 
hospitals are expected achieve the same quality care and regulatory compliance larger hospitals placing them particularly difficult operating 
environment these pressures the operating environments community hospitals were increased with the passage the arra which 
addition providing incentives healthcare providers achieve meaningful use ehr has resulted lowered medicare payment levels for healthcare 
providers that have yet achieve meaningful use ehr

risk factors 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that face our business financial condition operating results and stock price can materially and 
adversely affected number factors whether currently known unknown including but not limited those described below any one more 
such factors could directly indirectly cause our actual financial condition and operating results vary materially from our past anticipated future 
financial condition operating results 
risks related our industry 
there significant uncertainty the healthcare industry both result recently enacted legislation and changing government regulation which may 
have material adverse impact the businesses our hospital clients and ultimately our business financial condition and results operations 
the healthcare industry subject changing political economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation 
healthcare facilities including our hospital clients during the past several years the healthcare industry has been subject increased legislation and 
regulation among other things reimbursement rates payment programs information technology programs and certain capital expenditures collectively 
the health reform laws 
the health reform laws contain various provisions which impact and our clients some these provisions have positive impact expanding 
the use electronic health records certain federal programs for example while others such reductions reimbursement for certain types providers 
have negative impact due fewer available resources the continued increase fraud and abuse penalties expected adversely affect participants 
the healthcare sector including 
among other things the health reform laws require nearly all individuals have health insurance provide for the expansion medicaid eligibility 
mandate material changes the delivery healthcare services and reduce the reimbursement paid for such services order generate savings the 
medicare program the health reform laws also modify certain payment systems encourage more cost effective quality based care and reduction 
inefficiencies and waste including through various tools address fraud and abuse 
the health reform laws will continue affect hospitals differently depending upon the populations they serve and their payor mix our target market 
community hospitals typically serve higher uninsured populations than larger urban hospitals and rely more heavily medicare and medicaid for 
reimbursement remains seen whether the increase the insured population for community hospitals will sufficient offset actual and proposed 
additional cuts medicare and medicaid reimbursements contained the health reform laws 
the health reform laws are leading significant changes the healthcare system but the full impact the legislation and further statutory and 
regulatory actions reform healthcare our business unknown result there can assurances that the legislation will not adversely impact 
either our operational results the manner which operate our business believe some healthcare industry participants have reduced their 
investments postponed investment decisions including investments our solutions and services 
various legislators have announced that they intend examine further proposals reform certain aspects the healthcare system healthcare 
providers may react these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals curtailing deferring investments including those for our 
systems and related services cost containment measures instituted healthcare providers result regulatory reform otherwise could result 
reduction the allocation capital funds such reduction could have adverse effect our ability sell our systems and related services the other 
hand changes the regulatory environment have increased and may continue increase the needs healthcare organizations for cost effective data 
management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems cannot predict what effect any such additional 
proposals healthcare reforms might have our business financial condition and results operations 
existing regulations mature and become better defined anticipate that these regulations will continue directly affect certain our products 
and services but cannot fully predict the effect this time have taken steps modify our products services and internal practices necessary 
facilitate our compliance with the regulations but there can assurance that will able timely complete manner achieving 
compliance with these regulations could costly and distract management attention and divert other company resources and any noncompliance 
could result civil and criminal penalties 
the healthcare industry heavily regulated the local state and federal levels our failure comply with regulatory requirements could create liability 
for result adverse publicity and negatively affect our business 
the healthcare industry heavily regulated and constantly evolving due the changing political legislative and regulatory landscapes some 
instances the impact these regulations our business direct the extent that are subject these laws and regulations ourselves however these 
regulations also impact our business indirectly number circumstances our solutions devices and services must capable being used our 
clients way that complies with those laws and regulations even though may not directly regulated the specific healthcare laws and regulations 
there significant number wide ranging regulations including regulations the areas healthcare fraud prescribing claims processing and 
transmission medical devices the security and privacy patient data the arra meaningful use program and interoperability standards that may 
directly indirectly applicable our operations and relationships the business practices our clients specific areas that are subject increased 
regulation include but are not limited the following 
healthcare fraud federal and state governments continue enhance regulation and increase their scrutiny over practices potentially involving 
healthcare fraud waste and abuse healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
our healthcare provider clients are subject laws and regulations regarding fraud and abuse that among other things prohibit the direct indirect payment 
receipt any remuneration for patient referrals arranging for recommending referrals other business paid for whole part these federal 
state healthcare programs federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding powers and remedies pursue suspected perceived fraud and abuse 
the effect this government regulation our clients difficult predict many the regulations applicable our clients and that may applicable 
including those relating marketing incentives offered connection with medical device sales may interpreted applied prosecutorial 
regulatory judicial authority manner that could broaden their applicability require our clients make changes their operations the way 
which they deal with such laws and regulations are determined applicable and fail comply with any applicable laws and 
regulations could subject civil and criminal penalties sanctions other liabilities including exclusion from government healthcare programs 
which could have material adverse effect our business results operations and financial condition even unsuccessful challenge regulatory 
prosecutorial authority our activities could result adverse publicity could require costly response from and could adversely affect our business 
results operations and financial condition 
prescribing the use our solutions physicians for electronic prescribing and electronic routing prescriptions via the surescripts network 
pharmacies governed federal and state laws states have differing regulations that govern the electronic transmission certain prescriptions and 
prescription requirements standards adopted the national council for prescription drug programs and regulations adopted the centers for medicare 
and medicaid services cms related eprescribing and the prescription drug program set forth implementation standards for the transmission 
electronic prescriptions these standards are detailed and broad and cover not only routing transactions between prescribers and pharmacies but also 
electronic eligibility formulary and benefits inquiries general regulations this area can burdensome and evolve regularly meaning that any 
potential benefits our clients from utilizing such solutions and services may superseded newly promulgated regulation that adversely affects our 
business model our efforts provide solutions that enable our clients comply with these regulations could time consuming and expensive 
claims processing and transmission our system electronically transmits medical claims physicians patients payors for immediate approval and 
reimbursement addition offer business management services that include the manual and electronic processing and submission medical claims 
healthcare providers patients payors for approval and reimbursement federal and state laws provide that violation for any person submit cause

our clients also accurate and complete however not follow those procedures and policies they are not sufficient prevent inaccurate 
claims from being submitted could subject substantial liability including but not limited civil and criminal liability additionally any such 
failure our billing and collection services comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect demand for our services and could force 
expend significant capital research and development and other resources address the failure 
most cases where are permitted calculate charges for our billing and collection services based percentage the collections that 
our clients receive result our services the extent that violations liability for violations these laws and regulations require intent may

abusive practices 
portion our business involves billing medicare claims behalf our clients effort combat fraudulent medicare claims the federal 
government offers rewards for reporting medicare fraud which could encourage others subject charge fraudulent claims including charges that 
are ultimately proved without merit 
discussed below the hipaa security and privacy standards also affect our claims transmission services since those services must structured and 
provided way that supports our clients hipaa compliance obligations 
regulation medical devices the united states food and drug administration the fda has determined that certain our solutions such our 
imagelink product are medical devices that are actively regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act amended other our solutions are 
deemed actively regulated medical devices the fda could subject extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing activities 
including pre market notification clearance complying with these medical device regulations time consuming and expensive and our marketing and 
other sales activities could subject unanticipated and significant delays further possible that the fda may become more active regulating 
software and medical devices that are used the healthcare industry are unable obtain the required regulatory approvals for any such software 
medical devices our short long term business plans for these solutions medical devices could delayed canceled and could face fda refusal 
grant pre market clearance approval products withdrawal existing clearances and approvals fines injunctions civil penalties recalls product 
corrections production suspensions and criminal prosecution fda regulation our products could increase our operating costs delay prevent the 
marketing new existing products and adversely affect our revenue growth 
security and privacy patient information federal state and local laws regulate the privacy and security patient records and the circumstances 
under which those records may released these regulations govern both the disclosure and use confidential patient medical record information and 
require the users such information implement specified security and privacy measures united states regulations currently place governing electronic 
health data transmissions continue evolve and are often unclear and difficult apply 
the united states hipaa regulations require national standards for some types electronic health information transactions and the data elements 
used those transactions security standards ensure the integrity and confidentiality health information and standards protect the privacy 
individually identifiable health information covered entities under hipaa which include healthcare organizations such our clients and our claims 
processing transmission and submission services are required comply with the privacy standards transaction regulations and security regulations 
moreover hitech and associated regulatory requirements extend many the hipaa obligations formerly imposed only upon covered entities business 
associates well business associate our clients who are covered entities are most instances already contractually required ensure 
compliance with the hipaa regulations they pertain the handling covered client data however the extension these hipaa obligations business 
associates law has created direct liability risk related the privacy and security individually identifiable health information 
evolving hipaa and hitech related laws regulations could restrict the ability our clients obtain use disseminate patient information this 
could adversely affect demand for our solutions and devices they are not designed timely manner order meet the requirements any new 
interpretations regulations that seek protect the privacy and security patient data enable our clients execute new modified healthcare 
transactions may need expend additional capital and software development and other resources modify our solutions address these evolving data 
security and privacy issues furthermore our failure maintain the confidentiality sensitive personal information accordance with the applicable 
regulatory requirements could damage our reputation and expose claims fines and penalties 
federal and state statutes and regulations have granted broad enforcement powers regulatory agencies investigate and enforce compliance with 
these privacy and security laws and regulations federal and state enforcement personnel have substantial funding powers and remedies pursue suspected 
perceived violations fail comply with any applicable laws regulations could subject civil penalties sanctions other liability

decisions purchase our software solutions our software solutions are not compliant with these evolving standards our market position and sales could 
impaired and may have invest significantly changes our software solutions 
interoperability standards our clients are concerned with and often require that our software and systems interoperable with other third party 
healthcare information technology systems market forces governmental regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that 
would apply our software and systems and our software and systems are not consistent with those standards could forced incur substantial 
additional development costs for example the hitech act contains interoperability standards that healthcare providers are required adhere order 
receive stimulus funds from the federal government under the arra compliance with these and related standards becoming competitive requirement 
and although combination our solutions has been certified meeting all such required interoperability standards date maintaining such compliance 
with these varying and evolving rules may result increased development costs and delays upgrading our client software and systems the extent these

codes when submitting claims for payment icd codes affect medical diagnosis and inpatient procedure coding for everyone covered hipaa not just 
those who submit medicare medicaid claims claims for services must use icd codes for medical diagnosis and inpatient procedures they will not 
paid while have successfully implemented the use icd codes within our products and services the possibility exists for similar future mandates

management overview 
historically have primarily sought revenue growth through sales healthcare systems and related services existing and new customers within 
our target market strategy that has resulted ten year compounded annual growth rate legacy revenues revenues related our legacy evident 
and trubridge operations approximately the end our most recently completed fiscal year important our potential for continued long term 
revenue growth our ability sell new and additional products and services our existing customer base including cross selling opportunities presented 
with 
the acquisition hhi believe that our combined customer base grows the demand for additional products and services including business 
management consulting and managed services will also continue grow supporting further increases recurring revenues also expect drive 
revenue growth from new product development that may generate from our research and development activities 
january marked important milestone for cpsi announced the completion our acquisition healthland holding inc hhi the first 
major acquisition the company history this acquisition expanded our footprint for servicing acute care facilities and introduced the post acute 
care segment adding significantly our already substantial recurring revenue base and further expanding our ability generate organic recurring revenue 
growth through additional cross selling opportunities now available within the combined company believe that the addition hhi and its clients and 
products has enhanced and will continue enhance our ability grow our business and compete the markets that serve 
our business model designed such that revenue growth materializes earnings and profitability growth are naturally bolstered through increased 
future margin realization once hospital has installed our solutions continue provide support services the customer ongoing basis and make 
available the customer our broad portfolio business management consulting and managed services the provision these services typically 
requires fewer resources than the initial system installation resulting increased overall gross margins 
also look increase margins through cost containment measures where appropriate for example during instituted several changes 
related our employee benefits offerings including spousal carve out for healthcare benefits additionally during the first quarter instituted 
limited time voluntary severance program offering those employees meeting certain predetermined criteria severance packages involving continuing 
periodic cash payments and healthcare benefits for varying periods depending upon the individual years service with the company lastly the 
acquisition hhi january presented with additional opportunities leverage the greater operating efficiencies the combined entity order 
drive further earnings and profitability growth the future 
turbulence the and worldwide economies and financial markets impacts almost all industries while the healthcare industry not immune 
economic cycles believe more significantly affected regulatory and national health projects than the economic cycles our economy 
additionally healthcare organizations with large dependency medicare and medicaid populations such community hospitals have been affected 
the challenging financial condition the federal government and many state governments and government programs accordingly recognize that 
prospective hospital customers often not have the necessary capital make investments information technology additionally response these 
challenges hospitals have become more selective regarding where they invest capital resulting focus strategic spending that generates return 
their investment despite these challenges believe healthcare information technology often viewed more strategically beneficial hospitals than 
other possible purchases because the technology offers the possibility quick return investment information technology also plays important role 
healthcare improving safety and efficiency and reducing costs additionally believe most hospitals recognize that they must invest healthcare 
information technology meet current and future regulatory compliance and government reimbursement requirements 
recent years there have been significant changes provider reimbursement the federal government followed commercial payers and 
state governments there increasing pressure healthcare organizations reduce costs and increase quality while replacing fee for service part 
enrolling advanced payment model this pressure could further encourage adoption healthcare and increase demand for business management 
consulting and managed services the future success these healthcare providers greatly dependent upon their ability engage patient populations 
and coordinate patient care across multitude settings while optimizing operating efficiency along the way 
american recovery and reinvestment act 
while ongoing financial challenges facing healthcare organizations have impacted and are expected continue impact the community hospitals 
that comprise our target market believe that the reduced reimbursement under the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra for 
those providers failing adopt qualifying ehrs will continue support demand for healthcare information technology and will have positive impact 
our business prospects through least 
while believe that the expanded requirements for continued compliance with meaningful use rules have resulted expanded replacement 
market for ehrs uncertain whether revenues generated from this replacement market will sufficient offset the impacts the overall accelerated 
adoption and increased penetration ehrs within our target market result our system sales revenues and profitability may materially and adversely 
affected during the short term 
similarly compliance with the meaningful use rules has accelerated the purchases incremental applications our existing customers 
consequently our penetration rates within our existing customer base for our current menu applications have increased significantly under the arra 
thereby significantly narrowing the market for add sales existing customers august the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
cms announced final rule that effectively delayed the requirement for stage three compliance from january january while 
believe that the stage three requirements provide significant opportunity for add sales revenues through the delay cms expected delay 
some the contract revenues previously anticipated and there risk further delays reductions the regulatory requirements imposed 
hospitals which could have adverse effect our revenues 
although are pursuing other strategic initiatives designed result system sales revenue growth the future the form selective expansion 
into english speaking international markets selective expansion within the bed hospital market and continued development new software 
applications such our business intelligence solution which provides community hospital leaders valuable insight into financial operational and clinical 
data there can guarantee that such initiatives will prove successful will benefit the company sufficiently timely fashion offset the short term

arrangements subtopic the codification these standards require that four basic criteria must met before revenues can recognized persuasive 
evidence that arrangement exists delivery has occurred services have been rendered the fee fixed and determinable and collectability 
reasonably assured the recognition revenue pursuant these criteria involves estimates and judgments regarding 
the allocation total arrangement consideration the various elements our multiple element arrangements including for certain elements 
estimates and judgments regarding vendor specific objective evidence vsoe fair value which base either the price charged when the 
same element sold separately the price established management having the relevant authority for element not yet sold

amount conduct quantitative goodwill impairment assessment the first step the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the fair value the 
reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company early adopted asu january which eliminates the second step 
the goodwill impairment analysis therefore the carrying amount the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the first step the goodwill impairment 
test impairment charge recognized for the amount which the carrying amount exceeds the total amount goodwill allocated that reporting unit 
the fair value the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the goodwill the reporting unit not considered impaired

significantly reducing the maximum timeframe over which customers must satisfy their full payment obligations purchasing our system second
