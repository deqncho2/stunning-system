growing healthcare access crisis for consumers 
consumers the united states are increasingly challenged obtain access affordable healthcare appropriate sites 
care when care most needed according merritt hawkins study the average lead time see primary care 
physician across various metro areas was days also believe issues around access are projected get worse study 
from ihs markit prepared for the association american medical colleges found that physician demand continues grow 
faster than supply resulting projected total physician shortfall physicians including shortage 
approximately primary care physicians believe this projection supported the survey america 
physicians which physicians describe themselves either over extended full capacity expected population 
growth and aging and the projected gap between supply and demand for access healthcare services will place additional 
pressure already overburdened healthcare system that lacks physician capacity and diagnoses appropriate access points 
this access crisis has resulted consumers either seeking care inappropriate more costly settings such 
hospital emergency rooms foregoing needed care entirely survey from the american college emergency 
physicians found that almost physicians polled stated that demands for care coordination including emergency department 
visits are increasing due increased difficulty finding arranging timely follow with primary care physicians and 
specialists the same survey physicians polled also noted that they believe their emergency department not 
adequately prepared for potentially substantial increases patient volume 
addition challenges finding care consumers also face challenges accessing the highest quality care owing 
reasons ranging from complexity symptoms the unusual nature disease physician expertise medical diagnoses are often 
incorrect study the mayo clinic published journal evaluation clinical practice showed that among sample 
cases that had been referred for second opinions cases the final diagnoses matched the primary diagnoses 
cases the final diagnoses refined the primary diagnoses and cases the final diagnoses were materially different than the 
primary diagnoses reducing unnecessary treatment related misdiagnosis has significant impact the quality and cost 
care patient receives 
healthcare cost burden and lack viable options for health plans and employers

study published the journal the american medical association estimates that approximately billion all 
healthcare spending was wasted due factors such the provision unnecessary services inefficient delivery care 
and inflated prices when consumers are forced seek care inappropriate and more costly sites care those cost 
inefficiencies impact not only the consumer but also the health plans and employers that ultimately bear all portion these 
costs 
the costs and associated burdens health plans employers and consumers are only expected increase centers for 
medicare and medicaid services cms estimates national health expenditures reached trillion approximately 
the gdp and will reach approximately gdp survey from milliman noted 
that healthcare costs for average american family four exceeded increase over 
survey the national business group health indicated that employers bear average their employees healthcare 
costs and cms forecasted employers spent approximately billion healthcare despite the significant amount 
dollars spent healthcare outcomes remain inferior relative those many other countries 
the unsustainable levels spending healthcare and extreme inefficiencies the system have driven increased 
focus employers and health plans control healthcare expenditures governments private insurance companies and selfinsured employers are implementing meaningful cost containment measures including shifting financial responsibility patients 
through higher pays and deductibles and delivering healthcare through alternative more cost effective methods according 
survey america health insurance plans ahip january

over million americans were enrolled hsa qualified high deductible health plans increase since the 
increasing shift financial responsibility patients coupled with increased pricing transparency has turn heightened 
beneficiary focus healthcare alternatives consumers take responsibility for larger share their healthcare costs and 
spend more healthcare services they are also demanding higher quality care greater control how and where they receive 
care increased convenience and more service for every dollar spent 
challenging environment for physicians constraining supply 
response increasing pressures physicians are reducing access healthcare multiple ways the survey 
america physicians indicated that physicians plan take steps limit access their practices including cutting back 
the number patients seen working part time closing their practices new members seeking non clinical jobs retiring 
notably surveyed physicians indicated they plan accelerate retirement given changes the healthcare environment 
study physicians for national health program showed medical billing paperwork and insurance related red tape cost the 
united states economy approximately billion which was wasted due inefficiency these constraints have 
driven physicians seek more control over the way they deliver care new and existing patients increase their income and 
reduce the amount time they spend administration

compensation report showed increase from the percent physicians transitioning cash only models

there risk that state authorities some jurisdictions may find that our contractual relationships with our 
physicians providing telehealth violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice medicine these laws generally prohibit the 
practice medicine lay persons entities and are intended prevent unlicensed persons entities from interfering with
