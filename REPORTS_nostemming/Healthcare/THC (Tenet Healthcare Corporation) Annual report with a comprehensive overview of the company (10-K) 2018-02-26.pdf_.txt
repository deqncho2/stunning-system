operations our uspi joint venture our uspi joint venture acquires and develops its facilities primarily through the formation joint ventures 
with physicians and healthcare systems subsidiaries the uspi joint venture hold ownership interests the facilities directly indirectly and operate the 
facilities day day basis through management services contracts believe that this acquisition and development strategy and operating model will 
enable our uspi joint venture continue grow because various industry trends have seen emerge recent years namely that consumers are 
increasingly selecting services and providers based cost and convenience well quality more procedures are shifting from inpatient outpatient 
settings payer reimbursements have become more closely tied performance quality and service metrics and healthcare providers are entering 
into joint ventures maximize effectiveness reduce costs and build clinically integrated networks 
the surgical facilities our uspi joint venture primarily specialize non emergency cases believe surgery centers and surgical hospitals offer 
many advantages patients and physicians including greater affordability predictability and convenience medical emergencies acute care hospitals 
often demand the unplanned use operating rooms and result the postponement delay scheduled surgeries disrupting physicians practices and 
inconveniencing patients outpatient facilities generally provide physicians with greater scheduling flexibility more consistent nurse staffing and faster 
turnaround time between cases addition many physicians choose perform surgery outpatient facilities because their patients prefer the comfort 
less institutional atmosphere and the convenience simplified admissions and discharge procedures 
new surgical techniques and technology well advances anesthesia have significantly expanded the types surgical procedures that are 
being performed surgery centers and have helped drive the growth outpatient surgery improved anesthesia has shortened recovery time minimizing 
post operative side effects such nausea and drowsiness thereby avoiding the need for overnight hospitalization many cases furthermore some states 
permit surgery centers keep patient for hours which allows for more complex surgeries previously performed only inpatient setting 
performed surgery center 
addition these technological and other clinical advancements changing payer environment has contributed the growth outpatient 
surgery relative all surgery performed government programs private insurance companies managed care organizations and self insured employers have 
implemented cost containment measures limit increases healthcare expenditures including procedure reimbursement furthermore self funded 
employers are looking curb annual increases their employee health benefit costs they continue shift additional financial responsibility patients 
through higher pays deductibles and premium contributions these cost containment measures have contributed the shift the delivery healthcare 
services away from traditional inpatient hospitals more cost effective alternate sites including surgical facilities believe that surgeries performed 
surgical facilities are generally less expensive than hospital based outpatient surgeries because lower facility development costs more efficient staffing 
and space utilization and specialized operating environment focused quality care and cost containment 
operate our uspi joint venture facilities structure our joint ventures and adopt staffing scheduling and clinical systems and protocols with 
the goal increasing physician productivity believe that this focus physician satisfaction combined with providing high quality healthcare

trends and strategies 
the healthcare industry general and the acute care hospital business particular have been experiencing significant regulatory uncertainty 
based large part legislative and administrative efforts significantly modify repeal and potentially replace the patient protection and affordable 
care act amended the health care and education reconciliation act affordable care act aca although difficult predict the 
full impact this regulatory uncertainty our future revenues and operations believe that our strategies will help address the following trends 
shaping the demand for healthcare services consumers employers and insurers are actively seeking lower cost solutions and better value they focus 
more healthcare spending patient volumes are shifting from inpatient outpatient settings due technological advancements and demand for care 
that more convenient affordable and accessible the industry migrating value based payment models with government and private payers shifting 
risk providers and consolidation continues across the entire healthcare sector 
driving growth our hospital systems are committed better positioning our hospital systems and competing more effectively the everevolving healthcare environment are focused improving operational effectiveness increasing capital efficiency and margins enhancing patient 
satisfaction growing our higher acuity inpatient service lines expanding patient access points and exiting businesses and markets that believe are 
longer strategic our long term growth recently announced enterprise wide cost reduction initiatives comprised primarily workforce reductions and 
the renegotiation contracts with suppliers and vendors which are intended lower annual operating expenses million anticipate achieving 
the full annualized run rate savings the end most the savings are expected achieved through actions within our hospital operations and 
other segment including eliminating regional management layer and streamlining corporate overhead and centralized support functions conjunction 
with these initiatives incurred restructuring charges related employee severance payments approximately million the three months ended 
december and expect incur additional such restructuring charges 
expansion our ambulatory care segment remain focused opportunities expand our ambulatory care segment through organic 
growth building new outpatient centers corporate development activities and strategic partnerships believe our uspi joint venture surgery centers and 
surgical hospitals offer many advantages patients and physicians including greater affordability predictability flexibility and convenience moreover 
due part advancements medical technology and due the lower cost structure and greater efficiencies that are attainable specialized outpatient 
site believe the volume and complexity surgical cases performed outpatient setting will continue steadily increase addition have 
continued grow our imaging and urgent care businesses through our uspi joint venture reflect our broader strategies offer more services

patient volumes have been constrained increased competition utilization pressure managed care organizations new delivery models that are designed

economic conditions and demographic trends certain our markets however also believe that targeted capital spending growth opportunities for 
our hospitals emphasis higher demand clinical service lines including outpatient services focus expanding our ambulatory care business and 
contracting strategies that create shared value with payers should help grow our patient volumes 
reducing our leverage december all our outstanding long term debt has fixed rate interest and the maturity dates our

the staggered maturities our debt allow refinance our debt over time nonetheless our long term objective lower our ratio debt adjusted

critical accounting estimates 
preparing our consolidated financial statements conformity with gaap must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 
reported our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates use general 
base the estimates historical experience and assumptions that believe reasonable given the particular circumstances which operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
consider our critical accounting estimates those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties require estimates that are more 
difficult for management determine and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas 
recognition net operating revenues including contractual allowances and provision for doubtful accounts 
accruals for general and professional liability risks 
accruals for defined benefit plans 
impairment long lived assets 
impairment goodwill and 
accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
recognize net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts the period which our services are performed net operating 
revenues before provision for doubtful accounts primarily consist net patient service revenues that are recorded based established billing rates 
gross charges less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances principally for patients covered medicare medicaid and managed care and 
other health plans well certain uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily prospective payment systems 
retrospectively determined cost based revenues under these programs which were more prevalent earlier periods and certain other payments such 
dsh dgme ime and bad debt expense which are based our hospitals cost reports are estimated using historical trends and current factors cost report 
settlements under these programs are subject audit medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review and can take several years 
until final settlement such matters determined and completely resolved because the laws regulations instructions and rule interpretations governing 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently the estimates recorded could change material amounts 
have system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements this results 
recording accruals reflect the expected final settlements our cost reports for filed cost reports record the accrual based those cost reports and 
subsequent activity and record valuation allowance against those cost reports based historical settlement trends the accrual for periods for which cost 
report yet filed recorded based estimates what expect report the filed cost reports and corresponding valuation allowance 
recorded previously described cost reports must generally filed within five months after the end the annual cost report reporting period after the 
cost report filed the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need adjusted

therefore are not displayed our consolidated statements operations hospitals are typically paid amounts that are negotiated with insurance companies 
are set the government gross charges are used calculate medicare outlier payments and determine certain elements payment under managed

category gross charges are what hospitals charge all patients prior the application discounts and allowances 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily prospective payment systems 
retrospectively determined cost based revenues under these programs which were more prevalent earlier periods and certain other payments such 
indirect medical education direct graduate medical education disproportionate share hospital and bad debt expense reimbursement which are based 
our hospitals cost reports are estimated using historical trends and current factors cost report settlements under these programs are subject audit 
medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review and can take several years until final settlement such matters determined and 
completely resolved because the laws regulations instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and 
change frequently the estimates recorded could change material amounts

payors involved diverse activities and subject differing economic conditions and not represent any concentrated credit risk thvg thvg 
maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the payors inability make payments accounts thvg assesses the 
reasonableness the allowance account based historic write offs the aging accounts and other current conditions furthermore management
