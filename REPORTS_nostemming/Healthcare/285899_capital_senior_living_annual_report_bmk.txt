nursing facility beds high construction costs limitations government reimbursement and start expenses

monitoring and reducing hospital use response hospitals are discharging patients earlier and referring elderly 
patients who may too sick frail manage their lives without assistance nursing homes and assisted

personnel are necessary successfully integrate those communities businesses into our existing operations 
the costs incurred reposition renovate newly acquired communities may not recovered undertaking acquisitions also may adversely impacted unforeseen liabilities attributable the prior operators those communities businesses against whom may have little recourse the success our

time two years more until the expansions are operating and producing revenue the consequence which 
could adverse impact our liquidity 
termination resident agreements and resident attrition could affect adversely our revenues and earnings 
state regulations governing assisted living facilities require written resident agreements with each resident 
most these regulations also require that each resident have the right terminate the resident agreement for 
any reason reasonable notice consistent with these regulations the resident agreements signed allow 
residents terminate their lease upon days notice thus cannot contract with residents stay for 
longer periods time unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods year longer our resident agreements generally provide for termination the 
lease upon death allow resident terminate their lease upon the need for higher level care not provided

critical accounting policies 
the preparation financial statements conformity with accounting principles generally accepted the 
united states requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported the 
accompanying financial statements and related notes management bases its estimates and assumptions historical experience observance industry trends and various other sources information and factors the results 
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates critical accounting policies are 
defined those that are reflective significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially could result 
materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management most difficult subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
resident and health care revenue recognized estimated net realizable amounts based historical 
experiences due from residents the period which the rental and other services are provided additionally 
substantially all community fees received from residents are non refundable and are recorded initially the 
company deferred revenue the deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents initial lease 
term which consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay the resident 
revenues from the medicaid program accounted for approximately the company revenue fiscal the company revenue fiscal and the company revenue fiscal 
during fiscal and and respectively the company communities were providers 
services under medicaid programs accordingly these communities were entitled reimbursement under the 
foregoing program established rates that were lower than private pay rates patient service revenue for medicaid patients was recorded the reimbursement rates the rates were set prospectively the applicable state 
upon the filing annual cost report none the company communities were providers services under 
the medicare program during fiscal 
laws and regulations governing the medicaid program are complex and subject interpretation the 
company believes that compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and not aware any pending threatened investigations involving allegations potential wrongdoing while such regulatory 
inquiries have been made compliance with such laws and regulations can subject future government review 
and interpretation well significant regulatory action including fines penalties and exclusion from the 
medicaid program 
affiliated management services revenue was recognized when earned and related the company providing 
certain management and administrative support services under management contracts which were terminated 
when the company acquired the member interests its unconsolidated joint ventures june 
community reimbursement revenue comprised reimbursable expenses from the non consolidated 
communities that the company operated under long term management agreements which were terminated when 
the company acquired the member interests its unconsolidated joint ventures june
