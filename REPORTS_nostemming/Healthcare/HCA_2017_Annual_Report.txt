medicaid 
medicaid programs are funded jointly the federal government and the states and are administered 
states under approved plans most state medicaid program payments are made under pps are based 
negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals medicaid reimbursement often less than hospital cost 
services the health reform law enacted requires states expand medicaid coverage all individuals 
under age with incomes effectively below the federal poverty level however states may opt 
out the expansion without losing existing federal medicaid funding number states including texas and 
florida have opted out the medicaid expansion some states use have applied use waivers granted 
cms implement expansion impose different eligibility enrollment restrictions otherwise implement 
programs that vary from federal standards the presidential administration and number members 
congress have indicated their intent increase state flexibility the administration medicaid programs 
including allowing states condition enrollment work other community engagement 
because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the medicaid program often the 
state largest program states can expected adopt consider adopting legislation designed reduce their 
medicaid expenditures budgetary pressures have recent years resulted and likely will continue result 
decreased spending decreased spending growth for medicaid programs many states certain states 
which operate have adopted broad based provider taxes fund the non federal share medicaid programs 
many states have also adopted are considering legislation designed reduce coverage enroll medicaid 
recipients managed care programs and impose additional taxes hospitals help finance expand the 
states medicaid systems however the health reform law requires states least maintain medicaid 
eligibility standards for children established prior the enactment the law until october

providers for the treatment health care acquired conditions designated cms well other providerpreventable conditions that may designated the state 
congress has expanded the federal government involvement fighting fraud waste and abuse the 
medicaid program through the medicaid integrity program cms employs private contractors referred 
medicaid integrity contractors mics perform post payment audits medicaid claims and identify 
overpayments addition mics several other contractors and state medicaid agencies have increased their 
review activities the health reform law increased federal funding for the medicaid integrity program and 
expanded the rac program scope include medicaid claims most states have implemented rac programs 
which vary state design and operation 
managed medicaid 
enrollment managed medicaid plans has increased recent years state governments seek control 
the cost medicaid programs managed medicaid programs enable states contract with one more entities 
for patient enrollment care management and claims adjudication the states usually not relinquish program 
responsibilities for financing eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design generally contract directly with 
one more the designated entities usually managed care organization the provisions these programs 
are state specific many states direct managed care plans pass through supplemental payments designated 
providers independent services rendered ensure consistent funding providers that serve large numbers 
low income patients however effort more closely tie funds delivery and outcomes cms began 
limiting these pass through payments managed medicaid plans and will ultimately prohibit such 
payments 
accountable care organizations and bundled payment initiatives 
accountable care organization aco network providers and suppliers that work together 
invest infrastructure and redesign delivery processes attempt achieve high quality and efficient delivery 
services promoting accountability and coordination care acos are intended produce savings result 
improved quality and operational efficiency acos that achieve quality performance standards established 
hhs are eligible share portion the amounts saved the medicare program there are several types 
aco programs including the medicare shared savings program mssp which was established pursuant 
the health reform law and the next generation aco model 
the center for medicare medicaid innovation cmmi responsible for establishing demonstration 
projects and other initiatives order identify develop test and encourage the adoption new methods 
delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the medicare and medicaid programs while 
improving quality care for example providers participating bundled payment initiatives agree receive 
one payment for services provided medicare patients for certain medical conditions episodes care 
accepting accountability for costs and quality care rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing 
costs and penalizing providers costs exceed set amount these models are intended lead higher quality 
more coordinated care lower cost the medicare program hospitals may receive supplemental medicare 
payments owe repayments cms depending whether overall cms spending per episode exceeds falls 
below target specified cms and whether quality standards are met the cmmi has implemented voluntary 
bundled payment program known the bundled payment for care improvement bpci initiative 
participation bundled payment programs generally voluntary but cms requires hospitals selected 
geographic areas participate bundling programs for specified orthopedic procedures 
hhs continues focus shifting from traditional fee for service reimbursement models alternative 
payment models that tie reimbursement quality and value including bundled payment programs several 
private third party payers have expressed their intent increasingly rely such reimbursement models which 
may increasingly shift financial risk providers 
disproportionate share hospital payments 
addition making payments for services provided directly beneficiaries medicare makes additional 
payments hospitals that treat disproportionately large number low income patients medicaid and 
medicare patients eligible receive supplemental security income disproportionate share hospital dsh 
payments are determined annually based certain statistical information required hhs and are paid 
percentage addition drg payments 
the health reform law reduced medicare dsh payments the amount they otherwise would have 
been absent the law the remaining the amount that would otherwise paid under medicare dsh 
effectively pooled and this pool adjusted each year formula that reflects changes the national level 
uninsured who are under years age thus the greater the level coverage for the previously uninsured 
nationally the more the medicare dsh payment pool will reduced each dsh hospital paid out the 
dsh payment pool amount allocated based upon its estimated cost providing uncompensated care 
hospitals that provide care disproportionately high number low income patients may receive 
medicaid dsh payments the federal government distributes federal medicaid dsh funds each state based 
statutory formula the states then distribute the dsh funding among qualifying hospitals states have broad 
discretion define which hospitals qualify for medicaid dsh payments and the amount such payments the 
health reform law and subsequent legislation provide for reductions the medicaid dsh hospital program 
however congress has delayed the implementation these reductions until under the budget bill signed 
into law february medicaid dsh payments will reduced billion and billion per 
year from through 
tricare 
tricare the department defense health care program for members the armed forces for 
inpatient services tricare reimburses hospitals based drg system modeled the medicare inpatient 
pps for outpatient services tricare reimburses hospitals based pps that similar that utilized for 
services furnished medicare beneficiaries 
annual cost reports 
all hospitals participating the medicare medicaid and tricare programs whether paid 
reasonable cost basis under pps are required meet certain financial reporting requirements federal and 
where applicable state regulations require the submission annual cost reports covering the revenues costs and 
expenses associated with the services provided each hospital medicare beneficiaries and medicaid 
recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject routine audits which 
may result adjustments the amounts ultimately determined due under these reimbursement 
programs these audits often require several years reach the final determination amounts due from 
under these programs providers also have rights appeal and common contest issues raised audits 
cost reports 
managed care and other discounted plans 
most our hospitals offer discounts from established charges certain large group purchasers health 
care services including managed care plans and private health insurers admissions reimbursed commercial 
managed care and other insurers were and our total admissions for the years ended 
december and respectively managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms 
between one and three years while generally received contracted annual average increases from 
managed care payers during there can assurance that will continue receive increases the 
future further not clear what impact any health reform efforts the federal and state levels 
consolidation within the third party payer industry and vertical integration among third party payers and health 
care providers will have our ability negotiate reimbursement rates 
uninsured and self pay patients 
self pay revenues are derived from providing health care services patients without health insurance 
coverage and from the patient responsibility portion payments for our health care services that are not covered 
individual health plan collection amounts due from individuals typically more difficult than 
collection amounts due from government health care programs private third party payers any increases 
uninsured individuals changes the payer mix greater adoption health plan structures that result higher 
patient responsibility amounts could increase amounts due from individuals 
high percentage our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms for the 
year ended december approximately our admissions uninsured patients occurred through our 
emergency rooms the emergency medical treatment and labor act emtala requires any hospital that 
participates the medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every person 
who presents the hospital emergency room for treatment and the individual suffering from 
emergency medical condition either stabilize that condition make appropriate transfer the individual 
facility that can handle the condition the obligation screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions 
exists regardless individual ability pay for treatment addition health insurers are required 
reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided enrollees without prior authorization and without regard 
whether participating provider contract place the financial impact the obligation screen for and 
stabilize emergency medical conditions has been offset part provisions the health reform law that 
decrease the number uninsured individuals however congress eliminated the financial penalty 
associated with the individual mandate effective january difficult predict the impact this 
change but may result fewer individuals electing purchase health insurance 
hospital utilization 
believe the most important factors relating the overall utilization hospital are the quality and 
market position the hospital and the number and quality physicians and other health care professionals 
providing patient care within the facility generally believe the ability hospital market leader 
determined its breadth services level technology quality and condition the facilities emphasis 
quality care and convenience for patients and physicians other factors that impact utilization include the 
growth local population local economic conditions and market penetration managed care programs

competition 
generally other hospitals the communities serve provide services similar those offered our 
hospitals additionally recent years the number freestanding specialty hospitals surgery centers 
emergency departments urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers the geographic areas which 
operate has increased significantly result most our hospitals operate highly competitive 
environment some cases competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals some competing 
facilities are physician owned are owned tax supported government agencies and many others are owned 
not for profit entities that may supported endowments charitable contributions and tax revenues and 
are exempt from sales property and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available our hospitals 
and may provide the tax supported not for profit entities advantage funding capital expenditures 
certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities equipment and 
services that may not available most our hospitals also face competition from specialty hospitals and 
from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ascs for market share certain high margin services 
psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and therefore our 
psychiatric hospitals and units compete with both local and regional hospitals including the psychiatric units 
general acute care hospitals 
our strategies are designed ensure our hospitals are competitive believe our hospitals compete within 
local communities the basis many factors including the quality care ability attract and retain quality 
physicians skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals location breadth services 
technology offered quality and condition the facilities and prices charged hospitals must make public list 
their standard charges for items and services their policies for providing list such charges response 
inquiry have increased our focus operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more 
convenient service for patients and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians 
two the most significant factors the competitive position hospital are the number and quality 
physicians affiliated with employed the hospital although physicians may any time terminate their 
relationship with hospital operate our hospitals seek retain physicians with varied specialties the 
hospitals medical staffs and attract other qualified physicians believe physicians refer patients 
hospital the basis the quality and scope services renders patients and physicians the quality 
physicians the medical staff the location the hospital and the quality the hospital facilities equipment 
and employees accordingly strive maintain and provide quality facilities equipment employees and 
services for physicians and patients our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing 
physician alignment strategies such employing physicians acquiring physician practice groups and 
participating acos other clinical integration models 
another major factor the competitive position our hospitals our ability negotiate service contracts 
with group purchasers health care services managed care plans attempt direct and control the use 
hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals established gross charges similarly employers and 
traditional health insurers continue attempt contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed 
care programs and discounts from established gross charges generally hospitals compete for service contracts 
with group purchasers health care services the basis price market reputation geographic location 
quality and range services quality the medical staff and convenience our future success will depend 
part our ability retain and renew our contracts with third party payers and enter into new contracts 
favorable terms other health care providers may impact our ability enter into contracts with third party payers 
negotiate increases our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions for example some our 
competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans otherwise restrict the ability 
managed care companies contract with increasing vertical integration efforts involving third party payers 
and health care providers may increase these challenges moreover the trend toward consolidation among private 
third party payers tends increase payer bargaining power over fee structures addition health reform 
efforts such the health reform law creation the exchanges and limitations rescissions coverage 
and pre existing condition exclusions may lead private third party payers increasingly demanding reduced 
fees being unwilling negotiate reimbursement increases most the health plans offered through the 
exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number participating providers tiered networks that 
impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations patients that obtain services from providers 
disfavored tier these trends may continue regardless potential repeal replacement changes the 
health reform law the importance obtaining contracts with group purchasers health care services varies 
from community community depending the market strength such organizations 
state certificate need con laws which place limitations health care facility ability expand 
services and facilities make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes operations may also have the 
effect restricting competition currently operate health care facilities number states with con laws 
that require other types approvals for the establishment expansion certain facility types services 
before issuing con other approval these states consider the need for additional expanded health care 
facilities services those states that not require state approval that set relatively high levels 
expenditures before they become reviewable state authorities competition the form new services 
facilities and capital spending more prevalent see item business regulation and other factors 
and the health care industry whole face the challenge continuing provide quality patient care 
while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients changes medical technology existing and 
future legislation regulations and interpretations and contracting for provider services third party payers 
remain ongoing challenges 
admissions average lengths stay and reimbursement amounts continue negatively affected 
third party payer pre admission authorization requirements utilization review and pressure maximize 
outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients increased competition 
admission constraints and third party payer pressures are expected continue meet these challenges 
intend expand and update our facilities acquire construct new facilities where appropriate enhance the 
provision comprehensive array outpatient services offer market competitive pricing group purchasers 
health care services upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new expanded programs and services 
regulation and other factors 
licensure certification and accreditation 
health care facility construction and operation are subject numerous federal state and local regulations 
relating the adequacy medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures maintenance 
adequate records fire prevention rate setting building codes and environmental protection facilities are 
subject periodic inspection governmental and other authorities assure continued compliance with the 
various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation believe our health care facilities are properly 
licensed under applicable state laws each our acute care hospitals located the united states eligible 
participate medicare and medicaid programs and accredited the joint commission any facility were 
lose its medicare medicaid certification the facility would unable receive reimbursement from federal 
health care programs any facility were lose accreditation the facility would subject state surveys 
potentially subject increased scrutiny cms and likely lose payment from private third party payers 
management believes our facilities are substantial compliance with current applicable federal state local and 
independent review body regulations and standards the requirements for licensure certification and 
accreditation are subject change and order remain qualified may become necessary for make 
changes our facilities equipment personnel and services the requirements for licensure certification and 
accreditation also include notification approval the event the transfer change ownership certain 
other changes failure provide required notifications obtain necessary approvals these circumstances can 
result the inability complete acquisition change ownership loss licensure lapses 
reimbursement other penalties 
certificates need 
some states where operate hospitals and other health care facilities the construction expansion 
health care facilities the acquisition existing facilities the transfer change ownership and the addition 
new beds services may subject review and prior approval notifications state regulatory 
agencies under con program such laws generally require the reviewing state agency determine the public 
need for additional expanded health care facilities and services failure provide required notifications 
obtain necessary state approvals can result the inability expand facilities complete acquisition change 
ownership other penalties 
state rate review 
some states have adopted legislation mandating rate budget review for hospitals have adopted taxes 
hospital revenues assessments licensure fees fund indigent health care within the state the aggregate 
indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected our results operations although not 
currently operate facilities states that mandate rate budget reviews cannot predict whether will 
operate such states the future whether the states which currently operate may adopt legislation 
mandating such reviews 
federal health care program regulations 
participation any federal health care program including the medicare and medicaid programs heavily 
regulated statute and regulation hospital fails substantially comply with the numerous conditions 
participation the medicare and medicaid programs performs certain prohibited acts the hospital 
participation the federal health care programs may terminated civil and criminal penalties may 
imposed civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based updates the consumer price index and were 
recently increased under the bipartisan budget act 
anti kickback statute 
section the social security act known the anti kickback statute prohibits providers and others 
from directly indirectly soliciting receiving offering paying any remuneration with the intent generating 
referrals orders for services items covered federal health care program courts have interpreted this 
statute broadly and held that there violation the anti kickback statute just one purpose the 
remuneration generate referrals even there are other lawful purposes furthermore the health reform 
law provides that knowledge the law the intent violate the law not required violations the antikickback statute may punished criminal fines per violation imprisonment substantial 
civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject annual adjustment based updates the consumer 
price index and damages three times the total amount the remuneration and exclusion from 
participation federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid addition submission 
claim for services items generated violation the anti kickback statute may subject additional 
penalties under the federal false claims act fca false fraudulent claim 
the oig among other regulatory agencies responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud abuse and 
waste the oig carries out this mission through nationwide program audits investigations and inspections 
the oig provides guidance the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and special 
fraud alerts these special fraud alerts not have the force law but identify features arrangements 
transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements transactions violate the antikickback statute other federal health care laws the oig has identified several incentive arrangements that 
constitute suspect practices including payment any incentive hospital each time physician refers 
patient the hospital the use free significantly discounted office space equipment facilities 
usually located close the hospital provision free significantly discounted billing nursing other staff 
services free training for physician office staff areas such management techniques and laboratory 
techniques guarantees which provide the physician income fails reach predetermined level the 
hospital will pay any portion the remainder low interest interest free loans loans which may 
forgiven physician refers patients the hospital payment the costs physician travel and 
expenses for conferences coverage the hospital group health insurance plans inappropriately low 
cost the physician payment for services which may include consultations the hospital which require 
few any substantive duties the physician purchasing goods services from physicians prices 
excess their fair market value rental space physician offices other than fair market value terms 
persons entities which physicians refer and physician owned entities frequently referred 
physician owned distributorships pods that derive revenue from selling arranging for the sale 
implantable medical devices ordered their physician owners for use procedures that physician owners 
perform their own patients hospitals ascs the oig has encouraged persons having information about 
hospitals who offer the above types incentives physicians report such information the oig 
the oig also issues special advisory bulletins means providing guidance health care 
providers these bulletins along with the special fraud alerts have focused certain arrangements that could 
subject heightened scrutiny government enforcement authorities including contractual joint venture 
arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those position refer business such 
physicians and those providing items services for which medicare medicaid pays and certain 
gainsharing arrangements the practice giving physicians share any reduction hospital costs 
for patient care attributable part the physician efforts 
addition issuing special fraud alerts and special advisory bulletins the oig issues compliance 
program guidance for certain types health care providers the oig guidance identifies number risk areas 
under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations these areas risk include compensation arrangements 
with physicians recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians 
authorized congress the oig has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories 
activities deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute currently there are statutory 
exceptions and safe harbors for various activities including the following certain investment interests space 
rental equipment rental practitioner recruitment personnel services and management contracts sale practice 
referral services warranties discounts employees group purchasing organizations waiver beneficiary 
coinsurance and deductible amounts managed care arrangements obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies 
investments group practices freestanding surgery centers ambulance replenishing and referral agreements for 
specialty services 
the fact that conduct business arrangement does not fall within safe harbor identified 
special fraud alert special advisory bulletin other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct 
business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute however such conduct and business arrangements 
may lead increased scrutiny government enforcement authorities 
have variety financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer influence the 
referral patients our hospitals other health care facilities and employed physicians including employment 
contracts leases medical director agreements and professional service agreements also have similar 
relationships with physicians and facilities which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers 
addition provide financial incentives including minimum revenue guarantees recruit physicians into 
the communities served our hospitals while endeavor comply with the applicable safe harbors certain 
our current arrangements including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other 
referral sources and persons and entities which refer patients not qualify for safe harbor protection 
although believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients 
have been structured comply with current law and available interpretations there can assurance 
regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the antikickback statute other applicable laws adverse determination could subject liabilities under the 
social security act and other laws including criminal penalties civil monetary penalties and exclusion from 
participation medicare medicaid other federal health care programs 
stark law 
the social security act also includes provision commonly known the stark law the stark law 
prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients entities with which they any their 
immediate family members have financial relationship these entities provide certain designated health 
services reimbursable medicare medicaid unless exception applies the stark law also prohibits 
entities that provide designated health services reimbursable medicare and medicaid from billing the 
medicare and medicaid programs for any items services that result from prohibited referral and requires the 
entities refund amounts received for items services provided pursuant the prohibited referral timely 
basis designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services clinical laboratory services 
and radiology services sanctions for violating the stark law include denial payment substantial civil 
monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs failure refund 
amounts received result prohibited referral timely basis may constitute false fraudulent claim 
and may result civil penalties and additional penalties under the fca the statute also provides for penalty 
for circumvention scheme these penalties are updated annually based changes the consumer price index 
there are exceptions the self referral prohibition for many the customary financial arrangements 
between physicians and providers including employment contracts leases and recruitment agreements unlike 
safe harbors under the anti kickback statute with which compliance voluntary financial relationship must 
comply with every requirement stark law exception the arrangement violation the stark law 
although there exception for physician ownership interest entire hospital the health reform law 
prohibits physician owned hospitals established after december from billing for medicare medicaid 
patients referred their physician owners result the law effectively prevents the formation new 
physician owned hospitals that participate medicare medicaid while the health reform law grandfathers 
existing physician owned hospitals does not allow these hospitals increase the percentage physician 
ownership and significantly restricts their ability expand services 
through series rulemakings cms has issued final regulations implementing the stark law while 
these regulations were intended clarify the requirements the exceptions the stark law unclear how 
the government will interpret many these exceptions for enforcement purposes further not always 
have the benefit significant regulatory judicial interpretation the stark law and its implementing 
regulations attempt structure our relationships meet exception the stark law but the regulations 
implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex and cannot assure that every relationship complies 
fully with the stark law 
similar state laws 
many states which operate also have laws similar the anti kickback statute that prohibit payments 
physicians for patient referrals and laws similar the stark law that prohibit certain self referrals these state 
laws often apply regardless the source payment for care and little precedent exists for their interpretation 
enforcement these statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties well loss licensure 
other fraud and abuse provisions 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa broadened the scope certain 
fraud and abuse laws adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply all health 
benefit programs the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and 
statements medicare and medicaid false claims include but are not limited billing for services not 
rendered for misrepresenting actual services rendered order obtain higher reimbursement billing for 
unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud federal enforcement officials have the ability exclude 
from medicare and medicaid any business entities and any investors officers and managing employees 
associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud even the officer managing employee 
had knowledge the fraud criminal and civil penalties may imposed for number other prohibited 
activities including failure return known overpayments certain gainsharing arrangements billing medicare 
amounts that are substantially excess provider usual charges offering remuneration influence 
medicare medicaid beneficiary selection health care provider contracting with individual entity 
known excluded from federal health care program making accepting payment induce physician 
reduce limit services and soliciting receiving any remuneration return for referring individual for 
item service payable federal health care program like the anti kickback statute these provisions are 
very broad civil penalties may imposed for the failure report and return overpayment within days 
identifying the overpayment the date corresponding cost report due whichever later avoid 
liability providers must among other things carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement promptly 
return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports 
some these provisions including the federal civil monetary penalty law require lower burden 
proof than other fraud and abuse laws including the anti kickback statute substantial civil monetary penalties 
may imposed under the federal civil monetary penalty law these penalties will updated annually based 
changes the consumer price index some cases violations the civil monetary penalty law may result 
penalties three times the remuneration offered paid solicited received addition violator may 
subject exclusion from federal and state health care programs federal and state governments increasingly 
use the federal civil monetary penalty law especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden 
proof requirements under the anti kickback statute further individuals can receive for providing 
information medicare fraud and abuse that leads the recovery least medicare funds under the 
medicare integrity program 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws 
are subject state and federal laws that govern the submission claims for reimbursement and 
prohibit the making false claims statements one the most prominent these laws the fca which 
may enforced the federal government directly qui tam plaintiff whistleblower the 
government behalf the government may use the fca prosecute medicare and other government program 
fraud areas such coding errors billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports 
addition the fca covers payments made connection with the exchanges created under the health reform 
law those payments include any federal funds when private party brings qui tam action under the fca 
the defendant not made aware the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation makes 
determination whether will intervene defendant determined court law liable under the fca 
the defendant may required pay three times the actual damages sustained the government plus 
substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim these penalties are updated annually based 
changes the consumer price index 
there are many potential bases for liability under the fca liability often arises when entity knowingly 
submits false claim for reimbursement the federal government the fca defines the term knowingly 
broadly though simple negligence will not give rise liability under the fca submitting claim with reckless 
disregard its truth falsity constitutes knowing submission under the fca and therefore may create 
liability submission claims for services items generated violation the anti kickback statute 
constitutes false fraudulent claim under the fca whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the 
position and some courts have held that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes such the stark 
law have thereby submitted false claims under the fca false claims under the fca also include the knowing 
and improper failure report and refund amounts owed the government timely manner following 
identification overpayment overpayment deemed identified when person has should have 
through reasonable diligence determined that overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment 
every entity that receives least million annually medicaid payments must have written policies for 
all employees contractors agents providing detailed information about false claims false statements and 
whistleblower protections under certain federal laws including the fca and similar state laws addition 
federal law provides incentive states enact false claims laws comparable the fca number states 
which operate have adopted their own false claims provisions well their own whistleblower 
provisions under which private party may file civil lawsuit state court have adopted and distributed 
policies pertaining the fca and relevant state laws 
hipaa administrative simplification and privacy and security requirements 
the administrative simplification provisions hipaa and implementing regulations require the use 
uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment 
transactions submitted received electronically addition hipaa requires that each provider use national 
provider identifier these provisions are intended encourage electronic commerce the health care industry 
hhs the process adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules 
promote uniformity the implementation each standardized electronic transaction 
the privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant hipaa extensively regulate the use and

technical safeguards protect the security such information certain provisions the security and privacy 
regulations apply business associates entities that handle protected health information behalf covered

there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives the federal and state levels 
addressing privacy and security concerns our facilities remain subject any federal state privacy related 
laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa these laws vary and could 
impose additional penalties for example the federal trade commission uses its consumer protection authority 
initiate enforcement actions response data breaches 
emtala 
all our hospitals the united states are subject emtala this federal law requires any hospital 
participating the medicare program conduct appropriate medical screening examination every 
individual who presents the hospital emergency room for treatment and the individual suffering from 
emergency medical condition either stabilize the condition make appropriate transfer the individual 
facility able handle the condition the obligation screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists 
regardless individual ability pay for treatment there are severe penalties under emtala hospital 
fails screen appropriately stabilize transfer individual the hospital delays appropriate treatment 
order first inquire about the individual ability pay penalties for violations emtala include exclusion 
from participation the medicare program and civil monetary penalties these civil monetary penalties are 
adjusted annually based updates the consumer price index addition injured individual the 
individual family medical facility that suffers financial loss direct result hospital violation 
the law can bring civil suit against the hospital 
the government broadly interprets emtala cover situations which individuals not actually 
present hospital emergency room but present for emergency examination treatment the hospital 
campus generally hospital based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions are transported 
hospital owned ambulance subject certain exceptions least one court has interpreted the law also apply 
hospital that has been notified patient pending arrival non hospital owned ambulance emtala 
does not generally apply individuals admitted for inpatient services the government has expressed its intent 
investigate and enforce emtala violations actively 
corporate practice medicine fee splitting 
some the states which operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from 
employing physicians practicing medicine for profit and making certain direct and indirect payments 
entering into fee splitting arrangements with health care providers designed induce encourage the referral 
patients the recommendation particular providers for medical products and services possible 
sanctions for violation these restrictions include loss license and civil and criminal penalties addition 
agreements between the corporation and the physician may considered void and unenforceable these statutes 
vary from state state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted the courts regulatory agencies 
health care industry investigations 
significant media and public attention has focused recent years the hospital industry this media and 
public attention changes government personnel and other factors have led increased scrutiny the health 
care industry except may disclosed our sec filings are not aware any material investigations 
the company under federal state health care laws regulations possible that governmental entities could 
initiate investigations litigation the future facilities operate and that such matters could result 
significant penalties well adverse publicity also possible that our executives and managers could 
included governmental investigations litigation named defendants private litigation 
our substantial medicare medicaid and other governmental billings result heightened scrutiny our 
operations continue monitor all aspects our business and have developed comprehensive ethics and 
compliance program that designed meet exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
because the law this area complex and constantly evolving governmental investigations litigation may 
result interpretations that are inconsistent with our industry practices 
public statements surrounding current investigations governmental authorities have taken positions 
number issues including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available that appear 
inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been 
challenged this manner some instances government investigations that have the past been conducted 
under the civil provisions federal law may now conducted criminal investigations 
both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus and coordination civil and 
criminal enforcement efforts the health care area the oig and the department justice doj have from 
time time established national enforcement initiatives targeting all hospital providers that focus specific 
billing practices other suspected areas abuse the health reform law includes additional federal funding 
million over years fight health care fraud waste and abuse including million federal fiscal 
year addition governmental agencies and their agents such macs fiscal intermediaries and carriers 
may conduct audits our health care operations private third party payers may conduct similar post payment 
audits and also perform internal audits and monitoring 
addition national enforcement initiatives federal and state investigations have addressed wide variety 
routine health care operations such cost reporting and billing practices including for medicare outliers 
financial arrangements with referral sources physician recruitment activities physician joint ventures and 
hospital charges and collection practices for self pay patients engage many these routine health care 
operations and other activities that could the subject governmental investigations inquiries for example 
have significant medicare and medicaid billings numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are 
referral sources our hospitals and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors certain our 
individual facilities have received and other facilities may receive government inquiries from and may 
subject investigation federal and state agencies any additional investigations the company our 
executives managers could result significant liabilities penalties well adverse publicity 
health care reform 
the health care industry subject changing political regulatory and other influences along with various 
scientific and technological initiatives recent years the congress and certain state legislatures have 
passed large number laws and regulations intended effect major change within the health care 
system including the health reform law the health reform law affects how health care services are covered 
delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage reduced growth medicare program 
spending reductions medicare and medicaid dsh payments and the establishment programs that tie 
reimbursement quality and integration however there uncertainty regarding the future the health 
reform law the presidential administration and number members congress have expressed their intent 
repeal make significant changes the health reform law its implementation interpretation 
congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate maintain health insurance effective 
january further the president the united states signed executive order that directs agencies 
minimize economic and regulatory burdens the health reform law which may result additional changes 
how the law implemented 
currently structured the health reform law expands coverage through combination public program 
expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms expansion public program coverage has been 
driven primarily expanding the categories individuals eligible for medicaid coverage and permitting 
individuals with relatively higher incomes qualify number states including texas and florida have 
opted out the medicaid expansion provisions which they may without losing federal funding for states 
that have not participated the medicaid expansion the maximum income level required for individuals and 
families qualify for medicaid varies widely from state state some states are using waivers granted cms 
expand their medicaid programs impose different eligibility enrollment restrictions otherwise 
implement programs that vary from federal standards 
the expansion health coverage through the private sector result the health reform law has been 
driven new requirements applicable health insurers employers and individuals for example health 
insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits dropping coverage excluding persons based upon 
pre existing conditions denying coverage for any individual who willing pay the premiums for such 
coverage large employers are required provide health insurance benefits their full time employees pay 
penalty employee obtains government subsidized coverage through exchange although individuals are 
required maintain health insurance for minimum defined set benefits elimination the penalty associated 
with this mandate may impact the number individuals who elect purchase health insurance 
health insurers participating exchange must offer set minimum benefits defined hhs and 
may offer more benefits for individuals and families below the federal poverty level the cost 
obtaining health insurance through the exchanges subsidized the federal government however several 
health insurers have limited ended their participation these marketplaces creating uncertainty regarding the 
long term viability the exchanges 
discussed item business sources revenue the health reform law provides for spending 
reductions for medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs also increasingly ties payment for 
services quality outcomes provides for the creation acos and creates incentives and other initiatives 
better coordinate patient care across settings and over time 
the health reform law also makes several significant changes health care fraud and abuse laws 
provides additional enforcement tools the government increases cooperation between agencies establishing 
mechanisms for the sharing information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for 
non compliance for example the health reform law tightens the rules for returning overpayments made 
governmental health programs and expands fca liability include failure timely repay identified 
overpayments the health reform law also prohibits newly created physician owned hospitals from billing for 
medicare patients referred their physician owners result the law effectively prevents the formation 
new physician owned hospitals that participate medicare and medicaid while the law grandfathers existing 
physician owned hospitals does not allow these hospitals increase the percentage physician ownership 
and significantly restricts their ability expand services 
the health reform law has had net positive effect the company date before considering the impact 
medicare reductions that began and expected that the law presently implemented will 
continue have meaningful contribution the company results operations however the company could 
affected efforts change repeal replace the health reform law and the potential instability the 
exchanges discussed item risk factors 
general economic and demographic factors 
the health care industry impacted the overall united states economy budget deficits federal state 
and local government entities have had negative impact spending for many health and human service 
programs including medicare medicaid and similar programs which represent significant payer sources for our 
hospitals anticipate that the federal deficit the growing magnitude medicare expenditures and the aging 
the united states population will continue place pressure government health care programs other risks 
face during periods economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines the 
population covered under managed care agreements increased patient decisions postpone cancel elective 
and nonemergency health care procedures including delaying surgical procedures potential increases the 
uninsured and underinsured populations increased adoption health plan structures that shift financial 
responsibility patients and further difficulties collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible 
amounts 
compliance program 
maintain comprehensive ethics and compliance program that designed meet exceed applicable 
federal guidelines and industry standards the program intended monitor and raise awareness various 
regulatory issues among employees and emphasize the importance complying with governmental laws and 
regulations part the ethics and compliance program provide annual ethics and compliance training 
our employees and encourage all employees report any violations their supervisor ethics and compliance 
officer toll free telephone ethics line 
antitrust laws 
the federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types conduct 
deemed anti competitive these laws prohibit price fixing market allocation bid rigging concerted refusal 
deal market monopolization price discrimination tying arrangements acquisitions competitors and other 
practices that have may have adverse effect competition violations federal state antitrust laws 
can result various sanctions including criminal and civil penalties antitrust enforcement the health care 
industry currently priority the federal trade commission and the doj believe are compliance 
with such federal and state laws but courts regulatory authorities may reach determination the future that 
could adversely affect our operations 
environmental matters 
are subject various federal state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge 
materials into the environment not believe that will required expend any material amounts 
order comply with these laws and regulations 
insurance 
typical the health care industry are subject claims and legal actions patients the ordinary 
course business subject most cases million per occurrence self insured retention our facilities are 
insured our owned insurance subsidiary for losses million per occurrence the insurance 
subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above retention level 
million per occurrence also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers 
for losses excess amounts insured our insurance subsidiary 
purchase from unrelated insurance companies coverage for cyber security incidents directors and 
officers liability and property loss amounts believe are adequate the cyber security and directors and 
officers liability coverage each include million corporate deductible addition will continue 
purchase coverage for our directors and officers ongoing basis the property coverage includes varying 
deductibles depending the cause the property damage these deductibles range from the 
affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents 
employees and medical staffs 
december had approximately employees including approximately parttime employees references herein employees refer employees our affiliates are subject various 
state and federal laws that regulate wages hours benefits and other terms and conditions relating employment 
december certain employees our domestic hospitals are represented various labor 
unions while elections are expected possible additional hospitals may unionize the future 
consider our employee relations good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially 
adversely affected our business results operations our hospitals like most hospitals have experienced 
rising labor costs some markets nurse and medical support personnel availability has become significant 
operating issue health care providers address this challenge have implemented several initiatives 
improve retention recruiting compensation programs and productivity 
our hospitals are staffed licensed physicians including both employed physicians and physicians who 
are not employees our hospitals some physicians provide services our hospitals under contracts which 
generally describe term service provide and establish the duties and obligations such physicians require 
the maintenance certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services any licensed physician 
may apply accepted the medical staff any our hospitals but the hospital medical staff and the 
appropriate governing board the hospital accordance with established credentialing criteria must approve 
acceptance the staff members the medical staffs our hospitals often also serve the medical staffs 
other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one our hospitals any time 
may required continue enhance wages and benefits recruit and retain nurses and other 
medical support personnel hire more expensive temporary contract personnel result our labor costs 
could increase also depend the available labor pool semi skilled and unskilled employees each 
the markets which operate recent changes the national labor relations board the nlrb its 
election procedures could increase the likelihood employee unionization attempts the extent significant 
portion our employee base unionizes our costs could increase materially addition the states which 
operate could adopt mandatory nurse staffing ratios could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already 
place state mandated nurse staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have adverse impact 
revenues are required limit patient admissions order meet the required ratios

our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers 
the health care business highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other health care 
providers for patients has intensified recent years generally other hospitals the communities serve 
provide services similar those offered our hospitals addition cms publicizes its hospital compare 
website performance data related quality measures and data patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit 
connection with their medicare reimbursement federal law provides for the future expansion the number 
quality measures that must reported additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical 
transparency may have unanticipated impact our competitive position and patient volumes further every 
hospital must establish and update annually public listing the hospital standard charges for items and 
services any our hospitals achieve poor results results that are lower than our competitors these 
quality measures patient satisfaction surveys our standard charges are higher than our competitors our 
patient volumes could decline 
addition the number freestanding specialty hospitals surgery centers emergency departments urgent 
care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers the geographic areas which operate has increased 
result most our hospitals operate highly competitive environment which may put pressure our pricing 
high margin services transition outpatient facilities and may also place pressure the company strategy 
for volume growth some the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician owned are owned 
governmental agencies not for profit corporations supported endowments charitable contributions and 
tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations tax exempt basis recent consolidations 
not for profit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure there also increasing consolidation 
the third party payer industry including vertical integration efforts among third party payers and health care 
providers health care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies such 
employing physicians acquiring physician practice groups and participating acos other clinical integration 
models other industry participants such large employer groups and their affiliates may intensify competitive 
pressure and affect the industry ways that are difficult predict 
our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery 
centers for market share certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel ascs are 
better able compete this environment than our hospitals our hospitals may experience decline patient 
volume and may experience decrease margin even those patients use our ascs states that not 
require con other type approval for the purchase construction expansion health care facilities 
services competition the form new services facilities and capital spending more prevalent further our 
competitors are better able attract patients make capital expenditures and maintain modern and 
technologically upgraded facilities and equipment recruit physicians expand services obtain favorable thirdparty payer contracts their facilities than our hospitals and ascs may experience overall decline 
patient volume see item business competition 
deterioration the collectability uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results 
operations 
the primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate the uninsured patient accounts and patient 
accounts for which the primary third party payer has paid the amounts covered the applicable agreement but 
patient responsibility amounts exclusions deductibles and copayments remain outstanding the provision for 
doubtful accounts relates primarily amounts due directly from patients medicare reimburses hospitals for 
eligible medicare bad debts eligible for reimbursement the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria 
including that the debt related unpaid deductible coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted 
collect the fees from the medicare beneficiary 
the amount the provision for doubtful accounts based upon management assessment historical 
write offs and expected net collections business and economic conditions trends federal and state 
governmental and private employer health care coverage the rate growth uninsured patient admissions and 
other collection indicators december our allowance for doubtful accounts represented the 
billion patient due accounts receivable balance the sum the provision for doubtful accounts uninsured 
discounts and charity care increased from billion for billion for and 
billion for 
any increase the amount deterioration the collectability uninsured accounts receivable will 
adversely affect our cash flows and results operations our facilities may experience growth bad debts 
uninsured discounts and charity care result number factors including conditions impacting the overall 
economy and high unemployment congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the health 
reform law individual mandate effective january which may result fewer individuals electing 
purchase health insurance the presidential administration and number members congress continue 
make other efforts repeal significantly change the health reform law even the health reform law 
remains effect will continue experience collectability issues and provide uninsured discounts and 
charity care for individuals residing states that choose not implement the medicaid expansion for 
undocumented aliens who are not permitted enroll exchange government health care programs and for 
certain others who may not have insurance coverage further some patients may choose enroll lower cost 
medicaid plans other health insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels may also adversely 
affected the growth patient responsibility accounts result increases the adoption health plan 
structures that shift greater responsibility for care individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and 
deductible amounts 
changes government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues 
significant portion our patient volume derived from government health care programs principally 
medicare and medicaid specifically derived our revenues from the medicare and medicaid 
programs changes government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement receive and 
could adversely affect our business and results operations the health reform law has made significant 
changes medicare and medicaid and future health reform efforts efforts repeal significantly change 
the health reform law may impact these programs 
recent years legislative and regulatory changes have resulted limitations and some cases 
reductions levels payments health care providers for certain services under the medicare program 
congress has established automatic spending reductions that extend through however the percentage 
reduction for medicare may not more than for fiscal year with uniform percentage reduction across all 
medicare programs are unable predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may proposed 
congress these reductions are addition reductions mandated the health reform law which provides 
for material reductions the growth medicare program spending including reductions medicare market 
basket updates and medicare dsh funding further from time time cms revises the reimbursement systems 
used reimburse health care providers including changes the drg system and other payment systems 
which may result reduced medicare payments for example under site neutrality policy certain items and 
services provided off campus provider based departments that were formerly paid under the outpatient pps 
are now paid under the physician fee schedule subject certain exceptions 
because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the medicaid program often 
state largest program some states have enacted may consider enacting legislation designed reduce their 
medicaid expenditures further many states have also adopted are considering legislation designed reduce 
coverage enroll medicaid recipients managed care programs and impose additional taxes hospitals 
help finance expand the states medicaid systems periods economic weakness may increase the budgetary 
pressures many states and these budgetary pressures may result decreased spending decreased spending 
growth for medicaid programs and chip many states some states that provide medicaid supplemental 
payments are reviewing these programs have filed waiver requests with cms replace these programs and 
cms has performed and continues perform compliance reviews some states programs which could result 
medicaid supplemental payments being reduced eliminated for example december cms 
announced that will phase out funding for designated state health programs under certain types medicaid 
waivers further legislation and administrative actions the federal level may significantly alter the funding for 
structure the medicaid program for example from time time congress considers proposals 
restructure the medicaid program involve block grants that would administered the states 
some cases private third party payers rely all portions medicare payment systems determine 
payment rates changes government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may 
negatively impact payments from private third party payers 
current future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts changes laws regulations regarding 
government health care programs other changes the administration government health care programs and 
changes private third party payers response health care reform and other changes government health 
care programs could have material adverse effect our financial position and results operations 
our results operations may adversely affected health care reform efforts particularly efforts 
repeal replace otherwise significantly change the health reform law are unable predict what 
any and when such changes will made the future 
the health reform law represents significant shift the way health care services are delivered covered 
and reimbursed although reduced our medicare and medicaid reimbursement the health reform law also 
reduced the number uninsured patients whom provide health care services primarily through the 
exchanges and medicaid expansion however many insurers have exited the exchanges the markets served 
the company the extent some markets lack sufficient number health insurers participating the 
exchanges could threaten the continued viability the exchanges those markets 
addition the presidential administration and number members congress continue attempt 
repeal amend replace the law make significant changes its implementation congress 
eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate effective january difficult 
predict the impact this change but may result fewer individuals electing purchase health insurance 
further the president the united states has also signed executive order that directs agencies minimize 
economic and regulatory burdens the health reform law which may result additional changes how 
the law implemented cms has indicated that intends increase flexibility state medicaid programs 
including expanding the scope waivers under which states may implement medicaid expansion provisions 
impose different eligibility enrollment restrictions otherwise implement programs that vary from federal 
standards there uncertainty regarding whether when and how the health reform law may further 
changed changes congress government agencies could eliminate alter provisions beneficial and 
difficult predict the impact changes other health care industry participants government efforts 
repeal change the health reform law may have adverse effect our business results operations cash 
flow capital resources and liquidity 
our volume patients with private health insurance coverage declines are unable retain and 
negotiate favorable contracts with private third party payers including managed care plans our revenues 
may reduced 
private third party payers including hmos ppos and other managed care plans typically reimburse health 
care providers higher rate than medicare medicaid other government health care programs 
reimbursement rates are set forth contract when our facilities are network and payers utilize plan 
structures encourage require the use network providers revenues derived from private third party 
payers domestic only accounted for and our revenues for and 
respectively result our ability maintain increase patient volumes covered private third party payers 
and maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third party payers significantly affects the revenues 
and operating results our facilities 
private third party payers including managed care plans continue demand discounted fee structures and 
the trend toward consolidation among payers tends increase their bargaining power over fee structures payers 
may utilize plan structures such narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices 
impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care obtained from providers disfavored tier 
other health care providers may impact our ability enter into managed care contracts negotiate increases 
our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions for example some our competitors may 
negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans otherwise restrict the ability managed care plans 
contract with addition increasing negotiating leverage private third party payers alignment efforts 
between third party payers and health care providers may also result other competitive advantages such 
greater access performance and pricing data our future success will depend part our ability retain 
and renew our third party payer contracts and enter into new contracts terms favorable cost reduction 
strategies large employer groups and their affiliates may also limit our ability negotiate favorable terms 
our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure not clear what impact any future health 
reform efforts the repeal changes the health reform law will have our ability negotiate 
reimbursement increases and participate third party payer networks favorable terms are unable 
retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third party payers experience reductions payment increases 
amounts received from third party payers our revenues may reduced 
our performance depends our ability recruit and retain quality physicians 
the success our hospitals depends part the number and quality the physicians the medical 
staffs our hospitals the admitting and utilization practices those physicians maintaining good relations with 
those physicians and controlling costs related the employment physicians although employ some 
physicians physicians are often not employees the hospitals which they practice and many the 
markets serve most physicians have admitting privileges other hospitals addition our hospitals such 
physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals any time may face increased challenges 
this area the physician population reaches retirement age especially there shortage physicians willing 
and able provide comparable services are unable provide adequate support personnel 
technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs those physicians and their 
patients they may discouraged from referring patients our facilities admissions may decrease and our 
operating performance may decline 
our hospitals face competition for staffing which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent the efforts abilities and experience our management and medical 
support personnel such nurses pharmacists and lab technicians well our physicians compete with 
other health care providers recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible 
for the daily operations each our hospitals including nurses and other nonphysician health care 
professionals some markets the availability nurses and other medical support personnel has been 
significant operating issue health care providers may required continue enhance wages and 
benefits recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel hire more expensive temporary 
contract personnel result our labor costs could increase also depend the available labor pool 
semi skilled and unskilled employees each the markets which operate certain proposed changes 
federal labor laws and the nlrb modification its election procedures could increase the likelihood 
employee unionization attempts the extent significant portion our employee base unionizes possible 
our labor costs could increase materially when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions 
whether such agreements are renewals first contracts there the possibility that strikes could occur during the 
negotiation process and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs addition 
the states which operate could adopt mandatory nurse staffing ratios could reduce mandatory nurse 
staffing ratios already place state mandated nurse staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and 
have adverse impact revenues are required limit admissions order meet the required ratios 
our labor costs increase may not able raise rates offset these increased costs because significant 
percentage our revenues consists fixed prospective payments our ability pass along increased labor costs 
constrained our failure recruit and retain qualified management nurses and other medical support 
personnel control labor costs could have material adverse effect our results operations 
may unable attract hire and retain highly qualified and diverse workforce including key 
management 
the talents and efforts our employees particularly our key management are vital our success our

highly qualified employees particularly not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest

may continue negatively impact spending for health and human service programs including medicare 
medicaid and similar programs which represent significant third party payer sources for our hospitals 
anticipate that the federal deficit the growing magnitude medicare expenditures and the aging the united 
states population will continue place pressure government health care programs other risks face during 
periods economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines the population covered 
under managed care agreements increased patient decisions postpone cancel elective and nonemergency 
health care procedures including delaying surgical procedures potential increases the uninsured and 
underinsured populations increased adoption health plan structures that shift financial responsibility 
patients and further difficulties collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible receivables 
the industry trend toward value based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues 
there trend the health care industry toward value based purchasing health care services these 
value based purchasing programs include both public reporting quality data and preventable adverse events 
tied the quality and efficiency care provided facilities governmental programs including medicare 
currently require hospitals report certain quality data receive full reimbursement updates addition 
medicare does not reimburse for care related certain preventable adverse events also called never events 
the health reform law also prohibits the use federal funds under the medicaid program reimburse 
providers for medical assistance provided treat hacs the hospitals with the worst risk adjusted hac 
rates the designated performance period receive reduction their inpatient pps medicare payments 
hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated hhs will receive reduction their 
inpatient pps operating medicare payments for all medicare inpatient discharges not just discharges relating 
the conditions subject the excess readmission standard the reduction payments hospitals with excess 
readmissions can hospital base payments 
hhs has implemented value based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces 
inpatient hospital payments for all discharges federal fiscal year and for subsequent years hhs 
pools the amount collected from these reductions fund payments reward hospitals that meet exceed 
certain quality performance standards established hhs hhs estimates that billion value based 
incentive payments will available hospitals federal fiscal year based achievement relative 
other hospitals and improvement relative the hospital own past performance hospitals that meet exceed 
the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value based purchasing program 
than they would have otherwise 
cms has developed several alternative payment models that are intended reduce costs and improve 
quality care for medicare beneficiaries examples alternative payment models include bundled payment 
models which depending whether overall cms spending per episode exceeds falls below target 
specified cms and whether quality standards are met hospitals may receive supplemental medicare 
payments owe repayments cms generally participation bundled payment programs voluntary but 
cms requires hospitals selected markets participate bundled payment initiative for orthopedic services 
participation mandatory voluntary demonstration projects particularly demonstrations with the potential 
affect payment may negatively impact our results operations 
many large private third party payers currently require hospitals report quality data and several private 
third party payers not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events further have 
implemented policy pursuant which not bill patients third party payers for fees expenses incurred 
due certain preventable adverse events 
expect value based purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement patient 
outcome measures become more common and involve higher percentage reimbursement amounts 
cms has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models which may include additional 
bundled payment programs and private third party payers may also transition away from fee for service 
payment models are unable this time predict our future payments whether will subject 
payment reductions under these programs how this trend will affect our results operations but could 
negatively impact our revenues

health care facilities especially hospitals that fail accurately timely diagnose are treating have

state efforts regulate the construction expansion health care facilities could impair our ability 
operate and expand our operations 
some states particularly the eastern part the country require health care providers obtain prior

certain capital expenditures make changes services bed capacity giving approval these states 
consider the need for additional expanded health care facilities services currently operate health care 
facilities number states with con laws that require other types approvals for the establishment 
expansion certain facility types services the failure obtain any required con other required approval 
could impair our ability operate expand operations any such failure could turn adversely affect our

component our business strategy acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses may 
encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities other businesses result competition from other purchasers 
that may willing pay purchase prices that are higher than believe are reasonable some states require 
cons order acquire hospital other facility expand facilities services addition the acquisition 
health care facilities often involves licensure approvals reviews and complex change ownership 
processes for medicare and other payers further many states have laws that restrict the conversion sale 
not for profit hospitals for profit entities these laws may require prior approval from the state attorney 
general advance notification the attorney general other regulators and community involvement attorneys 
general states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions 
involving the sale not for profits under their general obligations protect the use charitable assets these 
conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus the appropriate valuation the assets divested 
and the use the proceeds the sale the non profit seller and may include consideration commitments for 
capital improvements and charity care the purchaser also the increasingly challenging regulatory and 
enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability acquire health care businesses they are found 
have material unresolved compliance issues such repayment obligations resolving compliance issues well 
completion oversight review approval processes could seriously delay even prevent our ability 
acquire hospitals other businesses and increase our acquisition costs 
may unable timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that acquire with

and other health care businesses that acquire may have unknown contingent liabilities including liabilities 
for failure comply with health care and other laws and regulations medical and general professional liabilities 
workers compensation liabilities and tax liabilities although typically exclude significant liabilities from 
our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters could experience 
difficulty enforcing those obligations experience liability excess any indemnification obtained otherwise
