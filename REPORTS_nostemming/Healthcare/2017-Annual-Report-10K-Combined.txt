applicable percentage admissions threshold all medicare patients discharged from the ltch during the cost reporting period 
see business government regulations overview and state government reimbursements long term acute care 
hospital medicare reimbursement percent rule 
because these rules are complex and are based the volume medicare admissions from other referring hospitals 
percent our overall medicare admissions cannot predict with any certainty the impact our future net operating revenues 
and profitability compliance with these regulations expect many our ltchs will experience adverse financial impact 
when implementation the medicare percentage admissions thresholds goes back into effect our ltchs have cost reporting 
periods that commence various dates throughout the calendar year therefore the application the lower percentage admissions 
thresholds could staggered depending how cms implements the new statutory relief any event the regular percentage 
admissions thresholds would not effect for all our affected ltchs until october the earliest and would not 
experience potential payment adjustments the regular percentage thresholds until after medicare cost reports are filed for cost 
reporting periods that include october 
our ltchs fail maintain their certifications ltchs our facilities operated hihs fail qualify hospitals 
separate from their host hospitals our net operating revenues and profitability may decline

meet certain conditions participation enroll and seek payment from the medicare program ltch including among 
other things maintaining average length stay for medicare patients excess days ltch that fails maintain this 
average length stay for medicare patients excess days during single cost reporting period generally allowed 
opportunity show that meets the length stay criteria during subsequent cure period the ltch can show that meets 
the length stay criteria during this cure period will continue paid under the ltch pps the ltch again fails meet 
the average length stay criteria during the cure period will paid under the general acute care ipps rates generally lower

similarly our hihs must meet conditions participation the medicare program which include additional criteria 
establishing separateness from the hospital with which the hih shares space our ltchs hihs fail meet maintain the 
standards for certification ltchs they will receive payment under the general acute care hospitals ipps which generally 
lower than payment under the system applicable ltchs payments rates applicable general acute care hospitals would 
result our ltchs receiving significantly less medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their patient services 
decreases medicare reimbursement rates received our outpatient rehabilitation clinics may reduce our future net operating 
revenues and profitability 
our outpatient rehabilitation clinics receive payments from the medicare program under fee schedule the medicare access

developed each state which have facilities typically however professional corporations owned and controlled licensed 
professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ physicians therapists furnish professional 
services also some states hospitals are permitted employ physicians 
some states also prohibit entities from engaging certain financial arrangements such fee splitting with physicians 
therapists the laws relating fee splitting also vary from state state and are not fully developed generally these laws restrict 
business arrangements that involve physician therapist sharing medical fees with referral source but some states these 
laws have been interpreted extend management agreements between physicians therapists and business entities under some 
circumstances 
believe that the company current and planned activities not constitute fee splitting the unlawful corporate practice 
medicine contemplated these state laws however there can assurance that future interpretations such laws will 
not require structural and organizational modification our existing relationships with the practices court regulatory body 
determines that have violated these laws new laws are introduced that would render our arrangements illegal could

the medicare program reimburses for services furnished medicare beneficiaries which are generally persons age 
and older those who are chronically disabled and those suffering from end stage renal disease net operating revenues generated 
directly from the medicare program represented approximately and the company net operating revenues for 
the years ended december and respectively the principal causes the decrease medicare net operating 
revenues percentage our total net operating revenues are the acquisitions concentra june and physiotherapy 
march which both have significantly lower relative percentage medicare net operating revenues compared 
our historical business prior the acquisitions since the percentage net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare 
program has been historically higher our long term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation segments compared our outpatient 
rehabilitation and concentra segments anticipate that the percentage net operating revenues generated directly from the 
medicare program will continue decrease the extent growth our outpatient rehabilitation and concentra segments outpaces 
growth our long term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation segments 
the medicare program reimburses various types providers including ltchs irfs and outpatient rehabilitation providers 
using different payment methodologies those payment methodologies are complex and are described elsewhere this report

patient criteria 
the bba enacted december establishes dual rate ltch pps for medicare patients discharged from 
ltch specifically for medicare patients discharged cost reporting periods beginning after october ltchs 
will reimbursed the ltch pps standard federal payment rate only immediately preceding the patient ltch admission 
the patient was discharged from subsection hospital generally short term acute care hospital paid under ipps and either 
the patient stay included least three days intensive care unit icu coronary care unit ccu the subsection 
hospital the patient was assigned ltc drg for cases receiving least hours ventilator services the ltch 
addition paid the ltch pps standard federal payment rate the patient discharge from the ltch may not include 
principal diagnosis relating psychiatric rehabilitation services for any medicare patient who does not meet these criteria 
the ltch will paid lower site neutral payment rate which will the lower the ipps comparable per diem payment 
rate capped the drg payment rate plus any outlier payments percent the estimated costs for services 
the site neutral payment rate for those patients not paid the ltch pps standard federal payment rate subject 
transition period during the transition period applicable hospital cost reporting periods beginning after october 
through september blended rate will paid for medicare patients not meeting the new criteria that equal 
the site neutral payment rate amount and the standard federal payment rate amount for discharges cost reporting 
periods beginning after october only the site neutral payment rate will apply for medicare patients not meeting the 
new criteria for hospital cost reporting periods beginning after october through september the ipps 
comparable per diem payment amount including any applicable outlier payment used determine the site neutral payment rate 
will reduced after any annual payment rate update 
addition for cost reporting periods beginning after october qualifying discharges from ltch will 
continue paid the ltch pps standard federal payment rate unless the number discharges for which payment made 
under the site neutral payment rate greater than the total number discharges from the ltch for that period the 
number discharges for which payment made under the site neutral payment rate greater than then beginning the 
next cost reporting period all discharges from the ltch will reimbursed the site neutral payment rate the bba 
requires cms establish process for ltch subject only the site neutral payment rate reinstated for payment under 
the dual rate ltch pps 
payment adjustments including the interrupted stay policy and the percent rule discussed below apply ltch 
discharges regardless whether the case paid the standard federal payment rate the site neutral payment rate however 
short stay outlier payment adjustments not apply cases paid the site neutral payment rate cms calculates the annual 
recalibration the ltc drg relative payment weighting factors using only data from ltch discharges that meet the criteria 
for exclusion from the site neutral payment rate addition cms applies the ipps fixed loss amount for high cost outliers 
site neutral cases rather than the ltch pps fixed loss amount cms calculates the ltch pps fixed loss amount using only 
data from cases paid the ltch pps payment rate excluding cases paid the site neutral rate for fiscal year the ipps 
fixed loss amount set and the ltch pps fixed loss amount 
medicare market basket adjustments 
the aca instituted market basket payment adjustment ltchs fiscal year the market basket update will 
reduced the aca specifically allows these market basket reductions result less than payment update and 
payment rates that are less than the prior year 
percent rule 
the percent rule downward payment adjustment that applies the percentage medicare patients discharged 
from ltchs who were admitted from referring hospital regardless whether the ltch ltch satellite located with 
the referring hospital exceeds the applicable percentage admissions threshold during particular cost reporting period specifically 
the payment rate for only medicare patients above the percentage admissions threshold are subject downward payment 
adjustment for medicare patients above the applicable percentage admissions threshold the ltch reimbursed rate 
equivalent that under general acute care hospital ipps which generally lower than ltch pps rates cases that reach outlier 
status the referring hospital not count toward the admissions threshold and are paid under ltch pps 
current law amended the century cures act precludes cms from applying the percent rule for freestanding 
ltchs cost reporting years beginning before july and for discharges occurring after october and before 
october addition current law applies higher percentage admissions thresholds under the percent rule for most 
hihs and satellites for cost reporting years beginning before july and effective for discharges occurring after 
october and before october for freestanding ltchs the percentage admissions threshold suspended during 
the relief periods for most hihs and satellites the percentage admissions threshold raised from during the relief 
periods the special case rural ltchs ltchs located with urban single hospital ltchs located with msa 
dominant hospital the referral percentage was raised from grandfathered hihs are exempt from the percent rule 
regulations 
for fiscal year cms adopted regulatory moratorium the implementation the percent rule result the 
percent rule does not apply until discharges occurring after october after the expiration the regulatory 
moratorium described above our ltchs whether freestanding hih satellite will subject downward payment 
adjustment for any medicare patients who were admitted from located non located hospital and that exceed the 
applicable percentage admissions threshold all medicare patients discharged from the ltch during the cost reporting period 
these regulatory changes have the potential cause adverse financial impact the net operating revenues and profitability 
many these hospitals for discharges after october 
short stay outlier policy 
cms established different payment methodology for medicare patients with length stay less than equal five sixths 
the geometric average length stay for that particular ltc drg referred short stay outlier sso for discharges 
before october sso cases were paid based the lesser the average cost the case the msltc drg specific per diem amount multiplied the patient length stay iii the full ltc drg payment per 
diem rate derived from blending the ltc drg specific per diem amount with per diem rate based the general 
acute care hospital ipps 
the sso rule also had category referred very short stay outlier which applied cases with length stay that 
less than the average length stay plus one standard deviation for the same drg under ipps referred the called 
ipps comparable threshold the ltch payment for very short stay outlier cases was equivalent the general acute care hospital 
ipps per diem rate 
for fiscal year cms adopted changes the sso policy such that all sso cases discharged after october 
are paid based per diem rate derived from blending the ltc drg specific per diem amount with per diem 
rate based the general acute care hospital ipps the fourth option under the prior policy under this policy the length 
stay sso case increases the percentage the per diem payment amounts based the full ltch drg standard 
federal payment rate increases and the percentage the payment based the ipps comparable amount decreases addition 
the very short stay outlier category was eliminated 
expiration moratorium new ltchs ltch satellite facilities and ltch beds 
federal law imposed temporary moratorium the establishment and classification new ltchs ltch satellite 
facilities and the increase ltch beds existing ltchs satellite facilities through september subject certain 
exceptions result the expiration the moratorium qualifying hospitals may now classified new ltchs ltch 
satellite facilities and existing ltchs may increase their bed count

our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues from medicare 
therapy caps 
outpatient therapy providers reimbursed under the medicare physician fee schedule have been subject annual limits for 
therapy expenses for example for the calendar year beginning january the annual limit outpatient therapy services 
was for combined physical and speech language pathology services and for occupational therapy services the 
bipartisan budget act repealed the annual limits outpatient therapy 
the annual limits for therapy expenses historically did not apply services furnished and billed outpatient hospital 
departments however the medicare access and chip reauthorization act and prior legislation extended the annual 
limits therapy expenses hospital outpatient department settings through december the application annual limits 
hospital outpatient department settings sunset december 
prior calendar year all therapy claims exceeding are subject manual medical review process the 
threshold applied physical therapy and speech therapy services combined and separately applied occupational therapy 
cms will continue require that appropriate modifier included claims over the current exception threshold indicating 
that the therapy services are medically necessary beginning and each calendar year thereafter the threshold amount 
for claims requiring manual medical review will increase the percentage increase the medicare economic index 
critical accounting matters 
contractual adjustments 
net operating revenues include amounts estimated reimbursable medicare and medicaid under prospective 
payment systems and provisions cost reimbursement and other payment methods addition are reimbursed nongovernmental payors using variety payment methodologies amounts receive for treatment patients covered these 
programs are generally less than the standard billing rates contractual allowances are calculated and recorded through our internally 
developed systems our long term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation segments our billing system automatically calculates 
estimated medicare reimbursement and associated contractual allowances for non governmental payors our long term acute 
care segment manually calculate the contractual allowance for each patient based upon the contractual provisions associated 
with the specific payor for non governmental payors our inpatient rehabilitation segment monitor payors historical closed 
paid claims data and apply those payment rates the existing patient population the net payments are converted into per diem 
rates the per diem rates are applied unpaid patient days determine the expected payment and contractual adjustment 
recorded adjust the recorded amount agree with the expected payment quarterly update our analysis historical closed 
paid claims our outpatient rehabilitation and concentra segments perform provision testing using internally developed 
systems monitor our payors historical paid claims data and compare against the associated gross charges the difference 
determined percentage gross charges and applied against gross billing revenue determine the contractual allowances
