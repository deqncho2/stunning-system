renewal future revenue that contract the amount total backlog associated with existing multi year contract may significantly 
vary year year solely based the status renewal and have significant impact the amount revenue attributable that 
contract year over year comparison additionally large multi study deals may include provisions under which the customer 
contracts for smaller amount subscription services they start the contract and the amount ramps over the life the contract 
the result initial large increase total subscription backlog that does not equate proportional increase revenue the

may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from two sources subscription revenues which are 
comprised subscription fees from customers utilizing the company cloud based solutions and professional services 
such training implementation consulting interface creation trial configuration data testing reporting procedure 
documentation and other customer specific services the company recognizes revenues when all the following conditions 
are satisfied 
persuasive evidence arrangement exists 
service has been delivered the customer 
amount the fees paid the customer fixed determinable and 
collection the fees reasonably assured probable 
subscription 
the company derives its subscription revenues from multi study and single study arrangements that grant the customer 
the right utilize its cloud based solutions for specified term multi study arrangements grant the customer the right manage 
predetermined number clinical trials simultaneously for term typically ranging from one five years single study 
arrangements allow customers use the company solutions per trial basis 
revenues from subscription arrangements are recognized ratably over the term the arrangement beginning with the 
commencement the arrangement term which generally aligned with the date the company cloud based solutions are 
made available the customer the term the arrangement includes optional renewal periods such renewal periods are 
likely exercised 
professional services

consulting professional services not result significant alterations the underlying solutions revenues are recognized 
using proportional performance method services are rendered

price esp determine the selling price for its subscriptions when sold multiple element arrangements the company 
unable establish vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for these subscriptions and third party evidence tpe not 
practical alternative due differences features and functionality compared with other companies offerings determine 
esp for subscription services the company utilizes internal pricing tool that provides price quotes for all potential new

compliance and evaluate pricing data periodic basis this evaluation includes the review actual historical pricing data 
market conditions consideration and the review pricing strategies and practices any necessary pricing modification made 
the pricing tool supported the result such evaluation 
the company has determined that its professional services have standalone value because those services are sold 
separately other vendors historical analysis standalone sales these services indicates sufficiently narrow price 
range the company has established vsoe for its professional services 
the company allocates the arrangement consideration among subscription and professional services deliverables based 
their relative fair values 
revenues for deliverables under subscriptions are recognized ratably over the term the arrangement beginning with the 
commencement the arrangement term which generally aligned with the date the company cloud based solutions are 
made available the customer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met revenues for deliverables under 
professional services are recognized using proportional performance method services are rendered 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue consists billings payments received advance revenue recognition and recognized the 
revenue recognition criteria are met amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded accounts receivable and deferred 
revenue the company invoices its customers accordance with the terms the underlying contract usually installments 
advance the related service period accordingly the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value 
outstanding arrangements payment terms are typically net days but some cases longer deferred revenue that 
expected recognized during the subsequent month period recorded current deferred revenue and the remaining 
portion noncurrent deferred revenue
