industry trends and opportunities 
healthcare expenditures continue escalate and consume large proportion the gdp presenting challenges for 
payers who wish contain and reduce costs while also promoting quality healthcare outcomes these aims are the same across 
all risk entities including commercial health plans and government healthcare programs such medicaid and medicare 
within the commercial market health plans sell policies directly individuals the open market via health insurance 
exchanges contract with employers underwrite their employees care contract with self insured employers oversee 
benefit administration their employees this market also includes growing number risk bearing provider sponsored plans 
that operate and market health plan benefits according cms nhe projections private health insurance covered approximately 
million individuals cost trillion 
several commercial health plans also offer government sponsored lines business including partnering with medicare medicaid 
and chip oversee care delivery for beneficiaries enrolled those programs government managed care grew out pressures 
contain the growth state and federal program spending and address general concerns about healthcare access most 
states managed care currently the predominant delivery system for medicaid july all states except three had some 
form managed care place including the district columbia among the medicaid programs states plus the district 
columbia with comprehensive risk based mcos states reported that more their medicaid beneficiaries were 
enrolled mcos july more states continue carve out complex populations well behavioral health services 
into mco contracts the medicaid programs states plus the district columbia that opted expand medicaid eligibility 
levels pursuant the aca states were using mcos cover newly eligible adults july those states 
states covered more than beneficiaries this group through risk based managed care unclear this time how 
all efforts congress repeal and replace the aca could affect any the state expansions potential future growth 
medicaid lives and expenditures congress continues debate proposals repeal major portions the aca including the 
aca marketplace and medicaid coverage expansions well other proposals fundamentally restructure medicaid 
financing structure the implications these proposals remain unclear 
similarly managed care health plans also continue assume risk for medicare lives with the kaiser family foundation estimating 
that all medicare beneficiaries million lives were enrolled medicare advantage plan hms also 
continues serve government sponsored agencies legacy fee for service programs the state and federal level these plans 
are generally reliant and susceptible the government appropriations process that determines their budget and governs the 
number beneficiaries they serve 
according the cms nhe projections medicare programs covered approximately million people cost 
approximately billion and medicaid chip covered approximately million people costing approximately billion 
altogether projected that the government programs serve covered approximately million people total cost 
approximately trillion 
cms projects medicaid spending and enrollment will grow and respectively over chip spending 
expected grow over and chip enrollment expected increase over commercial 
and government health plans continue focus strategies contain costs across their different lines business will 
continue focus serving them and meeting their evolving needs regardless the program coordinating benefits among 
growing number healthcare payers and ensuring that claims are paid appropriately represents enormous challenge for our 
customers and ongoing opportunity for 
regulatory environment 
the market for cost containment solutions large and growing driven increasing healthcare costs and payment complexities 
for medicare and medicaid are projected pay approximately the nation healthcare expenditures and serve 
over million beneficiaries many these beneficiaries are enrolled managed care plans which have the responsibility for 
both patient care and claim adjudications since have provided state medicaid agencies with services identify third 
parties with primary liability for medicaid claims and since have provided similar services medicaid managed care 
plans 
congress enacted the dra and created the medicaid integrity program under the social security act increase the 
government capacity prevent detect and address fraud waste and abuse the medicaid program later that year congress 
passed the tax relief and health care act which established the medicare rac program hdi was awarded one the 
first contracts under the program october cms made new round awards and again were awarded region 
these measures both the federal and state level have strengthened our ability identify and recover erroneous payments 
behalf our customers 
the aca was signed into law included many provisions impacting healthcare delivery and payment programs including 
employer sponsored health coverage expansion the medicaid program health insurance exchanges with premium subsidies 
and payment integrity efforts congress considered the revision repeal some all the aca options that have 
been considered include issuing block grants establishing per capita caps for state medicaid populations and looking 
program design alternatives for future enrollment criteria will monitor aca related changes they develop and assess their 
potential impact well any opportunities they may present for our customers and for

government spending these programs and the current healthcare financing system and the need for our solutions and 
services within that existing framework our success company based offering solutions and services that improve the 
ability our customers identify and recover revenue that would otherwise lost often result procedural inefficiencies 
and complexities the healthcare delivery and payment system however the need for our solutions and services the price 
customers are willing pay for them and the scope and profitability our contracts could negatively affected number 
factors including but not limited 
lower than projected growth medicare and medicaid programs and expenditures 
the simplification the healthcare benefit and payment system through legislative regulatory changes the federal 
state level for example legislative changes impacting the scope mandatory audits limiting reducing the amount 
reviewable claims and the look back period for review areas where conduct audits 
changes the level federal government spending due budgetary deficit considerations including the continuance 
existing programs well budgetary pressures that may drive changes the state level 
the transition healthcare beneficiaries from fee for service plans value based plans 
unanticipated reductions the scope healthcare program benefits such for example state decisions eliminate 
coverage optional medicaid populations services shifting lives into managed care plans 
modifications provider billing behavior and habits often response the success our solutions and services 
changes that reduce healthcare spending 
customer improvements and enhancements their internal healthcare claims and billing processes 
the adoption healthcare plans with significantly higher deductibles 
limits placed ongoing program integrity initiatives including the medicare rac program and 
legislative healthcare reforms and developments including the absence near term compliance deadlines effected the 
aca the possible repeal modification the aca and other legislative actions reduce program eligibility services 
reform medicaid spending 
for example during and our recovery audit services under hdi medicare rac contract were limited because 
significant delays procurement activities for the new medicare rac contract awards resulting from part the cancellation 
the original and second procurements following the denial pre award protests and ongoing litigation regarding certain payment 
terms proposed cms part the new medicare rac proposals response the delays cms allowed the medicare rac 
contractors including hdi perform active recovery auditing through july and certain limited administrative activities 
including collections related findings through january 
october cms announced the new medicare rac contract awards including the award rac region our wholly 
owned subsidiary under the new medicare rac contracts cms implemented modified adr limits that reduces the adr 
requirement the modified adr limits which cms first announced january reduction from the 
adr limit established for the hdi medicare rac contract addition april cms instituted sliding scale policy adjusting 
adr limits based provider denial rate after three day adr cycles january cms further modified this methodology 
indicating that underpayments identified the rac would precluded from the sliding scale policy these changes have 
significant impact the volumes claims that medicare racs are permitted review for inpatient providers and reduces their 
ability identify overpayments and underpayments under the new medicare rac contracts hms currently waiting for cms 
operationalize the sliding scale under the new medicare rac contract which expected increase the current adr limit 
requirement less than the limit that was previously set under the prior contracts 
further connection with our first medicare rac contract cms announced that would settle with hospitals willing 
withdraw inpatient status claims currently pending the rac appeals process offering pay hospitals for all eligible 
claims they had billed medicare june cms notified hdi that based the initial lists finalized settlements hdi 
owed cms approximately million due adjustments contingency fees under our existing medicare rac contract hdi 
previously advised cms that disagrees with cms interpretation the contract and that cms does not have the contractual 
right among other things require refunding fees already paid addition september cms announced that would 
extend opportunity for another round settlements for hospitals that were eligible for but did not choose participate the 
settlement with cms offering pay for all eligible claims they had billed medicare the implication these 
settlements related the claims for which hdi already has been paid remains uncertain 
although not anticipate that our new medicare rac contract will represent significant portion our business going 
forward our medicare rac contract still represents future business opportunity for however there could material 
negative impact our future revenue the extent that any final determination amounts owed cms under hdi 
medicare rac contract materially exceeds our accrued reserves for such appeals are required increase decrease 
our contractually required reserves with respect pending appeals due changes appeal performance changes data 
provided from other entities the rac process other related factors iii are required repay portion prior fees

the consolidated financial statements include the company accounts and transactions and those the company wholly 
owned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated consolidation 
use estimates 
the preparation the consolidated financial statements conformity with gaap requires management make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets and liabilities and disclosure contingent assets and 
liabilities the date the financial statements and the reported amounts revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period actual results could differ from those estimates 
iii cash and cash equivalents 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity three months less cash equivalents

lives the assets utilizing the straight line method hms amortizes leasehold improvements straight line basis which 
typically five ten years equipment leased under capital leases depreciated over the shorter the term the lease 
and the estimated useful life the equipment capitalized software costs relate software that acquired developed 
for internal use while the application development stage all other costs develop software for internal use either the 
preliminary project stage post implementation stage are expensed incurred amortization capitalized software 
calculated straight line basis over the expected economic life land not depreciated

asset such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized and charged earnings measured 
the amount which the carrying value the asset group exceeds the fair value the assets the company did not 
recognize any impairment charges related property and equipment during the years ended december 
intangible assets 
the company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed business combination based upon their acquisition date 
fair values most instances there not readily defined listed market price for individual assets and liabilities acquired 
connection with business including intangible assets the company determines fair value through various valuation 
techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party independent appraisals 
considered necessary significant assumptions used those techniques include but are not limited growth rates discount 
rates customer attrition rates expected levels revenues earnings cash flows and tax rates the use different valuation 
techniques and assumptions are highly subjective and inherently uncertain and result actual results may differ materially 
from estimates 
all the company intangible assets are subject amortization and are amortized using the straight line method over their 
estimated period benefit estimated useful lives are follows 
useful life 
years 
intangible assets 
customer relationships 
restrictive covenants 
trade names

such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized and charged earnings measured the 
amount which the carrying value the asset group exceeds the fair value the assets the company did not recognize

goodwill the excess acquisition costs over the fair values assets and liabilities acquired businesses during the 
measurement period which one year from the acquisition date the company may record adjustments the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset goodwill upon the conclusion the measurement period 
any subsequent adjustments are recorded earnings 
goodwill subject periodic assessment for impairment the company assesses goodwill for impairment annual 
basis june each year more frequently event occurs changes circumstances would more likely than 
not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying amount assessment goodwill impairment the hms 
holdings corp entity level the company operates single reporting unit the company has the option perform 
qualitative assessment determine impairment more likely than not have occurred when the optional qualitative 
assessment goodwill impairment performed significant judgment required the assessment qualitative factors 
including but not limited evaluation macroeconomic conditions they relate our business industry and market 
trends well the overall future financial performance our reporting units and future opportunities the markets 
which they operate the company can support the conclusion that more likely than not that the fair value reporting 
unit greater than its carrying amount using the optional qualitative assessment then the company would not need 
perform the two step impairment test the company cannot support such conclusion the company does not elect 
perform the qualitative assessment then the first step the goodwill impairment test used identify potential impairment 
comparing the fair value the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company completed the 
annual impairment test june using the optional qualitative assessment and determined impairment existed 
there were impairment charges related goodwill during the years ended december 
viii income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable temporary differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases this method also requires the recognition future 
tax benefits for net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
expected apply taxable income the years which those temporary differences are expected recovered 
settled the effect deferred tax assets and liabilities change tax rates recognized income expense the 
period that includes the enactment date valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets the extent their 
realization not more likely than not uncertain income tax positions are accounted for prescribing minimum recognition 
threshold that tax position required meet before being recognized the financial statements although the company 
believes that has adequately reserved for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties can provide 
assurance that the final tax outcome these matters will not materially different the company makes adjustments 
these reserves accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such the 
closing tax audit the refinement estimate the extent that the final tax outcome these matters different 
than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes the period which such 
determination made and could have material impact our financial condition and operating results

costs incurred plus the negotiated fee earned revenue time and materials contracts recognized based hours 
worked and expenses incurred addition some the company contracts may include customer acceptance provisions 
formal customer sign off not always necessary recognize revenue provided hms objectively demonstrates that the 
criteria specified the acceptance provision are satisfied due the range products and services that hms provides and 
the differing fee structures associated with each type contract revenue may recognized irregular increments 
portion our revenue recorded net estimate future revenue adjustments with offsetting entry accounts 
receivable allowance based historical patterns billing adjustments length operating and collection cycle and 
customer negotiations behaviors and payment patterns changes these estimates are recorded revenue the period 
change 
estimated liability for appeals

payments providers these contracts permit providers the right appeal hms claim findings and pursue additional 
appeals the initial appeal found favor hms customer the appeal process established under the medicare rac 
contract with cms includes five levels appeals and resolution appeals can take substantial time resolve hms records 
liability for findings which have been adjudicated favor providers and estimated liability based the amount 
revenue that subject appeals and which are probable being adjudicated favor providers following their 
successful appeal the company estimate based the company historical experience 
the total estimated liability for appeals balance million december and december 
respectively includes million and million respectively medicare rac claim findings which have been 
adjudicated favor providers and million and million respectively the company estimate the potential 
amount medicare rac repayments that are probable being adjudicated favor providers following successful 
appeal additionally the total estimated liability for appeals balance includes million and million related 
commercial customers claim appeals the provision included the estimated liability for appeals offset revenue 
the company consolidated statements income 
the extent the amount returned providers following successful appeal exceeds less than the amount

company customer contracts including modifications the medicare rac contract may require the company apply 
different assumptions that could materially affect both the company revenue and estimated liability for appeals future 
periods
