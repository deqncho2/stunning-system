and greater name recognition these communities than our clinics and they may have stronger relations 
with physicians these communities whom rely for patient referrals because the barriers entry 
are not substantial and current customers have the flexibility move easily new healthcare service 
providers believe that new outpatient physical therapy competitors can emerge relatively quickly 
our concentra segment occupational health services consumer health and veteran healthcare 
business face highly fragmented and competitive environment the primary competitors that provide 
occupational health services have typically been independent physicians hospital emergency departments

item risk factors 
addition the factors discussed elsewhere this form the following are important factors which 
could cause actual results events differ materially from those contained any forward looking statements 
made behalf 
risks related our business 
there are changes the rates methods government reimbursements for our services our net operating 
revenues and profitability could decline 
approximately our net operating revenues for the year ended december our 
net operating revenues for the year ended december and our net operating revenues for 
the year ended december came from the highly regulated federal medicare program 
recent years through legislative and regulatory actions the federal government has made 
substantial changes various payment systems under the medicare program president obama signed into 
law comprehensive reforms the healthcare system including changes the methods for and amounts 
medicare reimbursement additional reforms other changes these payment systems including 
modifications the conditions qualification for payment bundling payments cover both acute and 
post acute care the imposition enrollment limitations new providers may proposed could 
adopted either congress cms revised regulations are adopted the availability methods and 
rates medicare reimbursements for services the type furnished our facilities could change some 
these changes and proposed changes could adversely affect our business strategy operations and financial 
results addition there can assurance that any increases medicare reimbursement rates 
established cms will fully reflect increases our operating costs 
conduct business heavily regulated industry and changes regulations new interpretations existing 
regulations violations regulations may result increased costs sanctions that reduce our net operating 
revenues and profitability 
the healthcare industry subject extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating 
facility and professional licensure including certificates need conduct operations including 
financial relationships among healthcare providers medicare fraud and abuse and physician self referral 
iii addition facilities and services and enrollment newly developed facilities the medicare 
program payment for services and safeguarding protected health information 
both federal and state regulatory agencies inspect survey and audit our facilities review our 
compliance with these laws and regulations while our facilities intend comply with existing licensing 
medicare certification requirements and accreditation standards there can assurance that these 
regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met any given time 
determination any these regulatory authorities that facility not compliance with these 
requirements could lead the imposition requirements that the facility takes corrective action 
assessment fines and penalties loss licensure medicare certification accreditation these 
consequences could have adverse effect our company 
addition there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts both 
federal and state government agencies relating the healthcare industry the ongoing investigations 
relate among other things various referral practices cost reporting billing practices physician 
ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals the future different interpretations enforcement 
these laws and regulations could subject allegations impropriety illegality could require 
make changes our facilities equipment personnel services and capital expenditure programs these 
changes may increase our operating expenses and reduce our operating revenues fail comply with 
these extensive laws and government regulations could become ineligible receive government 
program reimbursement suffer civil criminal penalties required make significant changes 
our operations addition could forced expend considerable resources responding any related 
investigation other enforcement action 
full implementation the medicare percent rule applicable ltchs will have adverse effect our 
future net operating revenues and profitability 
under the percent rule the medicare payment rate for ltchs subject downward payment 
adjustment the percentage medicare patients discharged from ltch who were admitted from 
referring hospital regardless whether the ltch ltch satellite located with the referring 
hospital exceeds applicable percentage admissions threshold during particular cost reporting period 
cases admitted ltch excess the applicable percentage admissions threshold are reimbursed 
rate equivalent that under ipps ipps rates are generally lower than ltch pps rates cases that 
reach outlier status the discharging hospital not count toward the admission threshold and are paid 
under ltch pps 
ltchs that are operated hihs hih satellites are subject payment reductions for those 
medicare patients admitted from their host hospitals excess the applicable percentage admissions 
threshold and from other referring hospitals excess the applicable percentage admissions threshold 
ltchs that are operated freestanding facilities are subject payment reduction for those medicare 
patients admitted from other referring hospitals excess the applicable admissions threshold 
grandfathered hihs are excluded from the medicare percentage admissions threshold regulations for 
cost reporting periods beginning after october one percentage threshold applies the 
ltch whole regardless hih freestanding status for each referring hospital all locations 
current law provides relief the form higher percentage admissions thresholds for specific 
categories ltchs that previously obtained relief under the medicare medicaid and schip extension 
act mmsea pub amended full implementation the medicare percentage 
admissions thresholds under the percent rule will not into effect for all ltchs except 
grandfathered hihs until discharges after october see business government 
regulations overview and state government reimbursements long term acute care hospital 
medicare reimbursement percent rule 
because these rules are complex and are based the volume medicare admissions from other 
referring hospitals percent our overall medicare admissions cannot predict with any certainty 
the impact our future net operating revenues and profitability compliance with these regulations 
expect many our ltchs will experience adverse financial impact when full implementation the 
medicare percentage admissions thresholds goes into effect our ltchs have cost reporting periods that 
commence various dates throughout the calendar year therefore the application the lower 
percentage admissions thresholds could staggered depending how cms implements the new 
statutory relief any event the regular percentage admissions thresholds would not effect for all 
our affected ltchs until october the earliest and would not experience potential payment 
adjustments the regular percentage thresholds until after medicare cost reports are filed for cost 
reporting periods that include october 
our ltchs fail maintain their certifications ltchs our facilities operated hihs fail qualify 
hospitals separate from their host hospitals our net operating revenues and profitability may decline 
december operated ltchs all which are currently certified medicare 
ltchs ltchs must meet certain conditions participation enroll and seek payment from the 
medicare program ltch including among other things maintaining average length stay for 
medicare patients excess days ltch that fails maintain this average length stay for 
medicare patients excess days during single cost reporting period generally allowed 
opportunity show that meets the length stay criteria during subsequent cure period the ltch 
can show that meets the length stay criteria during this cure period will continue paid under 
the ltch pps the ltch again fails meet the average length stay criteria during the cure period 
will paid under the general acute care ipps rates generally lower than the rates under the 
ltch pps such ltchs may not able classified ltchs until the moratorium over 
september 
similarly our hihs must meet conditions participation the medicare program which include 
additional criteria establishing separateness from the hospital with which the hih shares space our 
ltchs hihs fail meet maintain the standards for certification ltchs they will receive 
payment under the general acute care hospitals ipps which generally lower than payment under the 
system applicable ltchs payments rates applicable general acute care hospitals would result 
our ltchs receiving significantly less medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their 
patient services 
implementation additional patient facility criteria for ltchs that limit the population patients eligible 
for our hospitals services change the basis which are paid could adversely affect our net operating revenue 
and profitability 
the bba establishes dual rate ltch pps adding site neutral payment rate for 
medicare patients who not meet specified criteria specifically for medicare patients discharged cost 
reporting periods beginning after october ltchs are reimbursed under ltch pps only 
immediately preceding the patient ltch admission the patient was discharged from subsection 
hospital generally short term acute care hospital paid under ipps and either the patient stay 
included least three days intensive care unit icu coronary care unit ccu the patient was 
assigned ltc drg for cases receiving least hours ventilator services the ltch 
addition paid the ltch pps standard federal payment rate the patient discharge from the 
ltch may not include principal diagnosis relating psychiatric rehabilitation services for any 
medicare patient who does not meet these new criteria the ltch will paid site neutral payment 
rate which will the lower the ipps comparable per diem payment rate capped the drg 
payment rate plus any outlier payments percent the estimated costs for services for cost 
reporting periods beginning after october payment for all discharges from ltch the 
future may subject the site neutral payment limitation unless the number discharges for which 
payment made under the ltch pps payment rate greater than the total number discharges 
for the ltch for that period reinstatement payment under the dual rate ltch pps may available 
but cms has not yet published details this reinstatement process the application the new 
site neutral payment rates under ltch pps may reduce our operating revenues 
cannot predict whether congress cms will adopt additional patient level criteria the future 
adopted how such criteria would affect our ltchs implementation additional patient facility 
criteria that may limit the population patients eligible for our ltchs services change the basis 
which are paid could adversely affect our net operating revenues and profitability see business 
government regulations overview and state government reimbursements long term acute 
care hospital medicare reimbursement 
decreases medicare reimbursement rates received our outpatient rehabilitation clinics may reduce our 
future net operating revenues and profitability 
our outpatient rehabilitation clinics receive payments from the medicare program under fee 
schedule the medicare access and chip reauthorization act requires that payments under the 
fee schedule adjusted starting based performance new merit based incentive payment 
system and beginning incentives for participation alternative payment models the specifics 
the merit based incentive payment system and incentives for participation alternative payment models 
will subject future notice and comment rule making unclear what impact any the meritbased incentive payment system and incentives for participation alternative payment models will have 
our business and operating results but any resulting decrease payment may reduce our future net 
operating revenues and profitability 
outpatient therapy services reimbursed under the medicare physician fee schedule are subject 
annual limits under exceptions process the annual limits medicare enrollee person acting 
behalf the medicare enrollee able request exception from the therapy caps the provision 
therapy services deemed medically necessary therapy cap exceptions are available automatically 
for certain conditions and case case basis upon submission documentation medical necessity 
the exception process has been extended congress several times most recently the medicare access 
and chip reauthorization act extends the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through 
december the exception process will expire december unless further extended 
congress there can assurance that congress will extend further date the implementation 
the therapy caps has not had material adverse effect our business however the exception process 
not renewed our future net operating revenues and profitability may decline 
the nature the markets that concentra serves may constrain its ability raise prices rates sufficient 
keep pace with the inflation its costs 
rates reimbursement for work related injury illness visits concentra occupational health 
services business are established through legislative regulatory process within each state that 
concentra serves currently states have fee schedules pursuant which all healthcare providers are 
uniformly reimbursed the fee schedules are determined each state and generally prescribe the 
maximum amounts that may reimbursed for designated procedure the states without fee schedules 
healthcare providers are generally reimbursed based usual customary and reasonable rates charged 
the particular state which the services are provided given that concentra does not control these 
processes may subject financial risks individual jurisdictions reduce rates not routinely 
raise rates reimbursement manner that keeps pace with the inflation concentra costs service 
concentra veteran healthcare business reimbursement rates are generally set according the 
capitated monthly rate based the number then enrolled patients that cboc evolving legislative 
and regulatory changes aimed improving veteran access care the wake department veterans 
affairs scandals none which involved concentra cbocs could result fewer patients enrolling 
cbocs federal legislation that permits certain veterans receive their health care outside the 
department veterans affairs facilities for example may reduce demand for services some 
concentra cbocs moreover changes the methods manner amounts compensation payable for 
concentra services including amounts reimbursable the cbocs under its agreements with the 
department veterans affairs due legislative other changes shifting budget priorities could 
result lower reimbursement for services provided concentra cbocs concentra may receive lower 
payments from the veterans health administration fewer eligible veterans are considered live within 
the catchments its cbocs these trends could have adverse effect our financial condition and 
results operations 
our irfs fail comply with the rule admissions our irfs are limited due changes the

our financial condition and results operations 
fail compete effectively with other hospitals clinics medical centers and healthcare providers the 
local areas serve our net operating revenues and profitability may decline 
the healthcare business highly competitive and compete with other hospitals rehabilitation 
clinics medical centers and other healthcare providers for patients are unable compete effectively 
the specialty hospital outpatient rehabilitation and occupational health services businesses our ability 
retain customers and physicians maintain increase our revenue growth price flexibility control 
over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may compromised and our net operating revenues 
and profitability may decline 
many our specialty hospitals operate geographic areas where compete with least one other 
hospital that provides similar services 
our outpatient rehabilitation clinics face competition from variety local and national outpatient 
rehabilitation providers including physician owned physical therapy clinics dedicated locally owned and 
managed outpatient rehabilitation clinics and hospital university owned affiliated ventures well 
national and regional providers select areas other competing outpatient rehabilitation clinics local 
areas serve may have greater name recognition and longer operating histories than our clinics the 
managers these competing clinics may also have stronger relationships with physicians their 
communities which could give them competitive advantage for patient referrals because the barriers 
entry are not substantial and current customers have the flexibility move easily new healthcare service 
providers believe that new outpatient physical therapy competitors can emerge relatively quickly 
concentra primary competitors have typically been independent physicians hospital emergency 
departments and hospital owned hospital affiliated medical facilities because the barriers entry 
concentra geographic markets are not substantial and its current customers have the flexibility move 
easily new healthcare service providers new competitors concentra can emerge relatively quickly 
the markets for concentra consumer health and veteran healthcare businesses are also fragmented and 
competitive concentra competitors are better able attract patients expand services their 
facilities than concentra concentra may experience overall decline revenue similarly competitive 
pricing pressures from our competitors could cause concentra lose existing future cboc contracts 
with the department veterans affairs which may also cause concentra experience overall decline 
revenue 
future cost containment initiatives undertaken private third party payors may limit our future net operating 
revenues and profitability 
initiatives undertaken major insurers and managed care companies contain healthcare costs 
affect our profitability these payors attempt control healthcare costs contracting with hospitals and 
other healthcare providers obtain services discounted basis believe that this trend may 
continue and may limit reimbursements for healthcare services insurers managed care companies 
from whom receive substantial payments reduce the amounts they pay for services our profit margins 
may decline may lose patients choose not renew our contracts with these insurers lower 
rates 
fail maintain established relationships with the physicians the areas serve our net operating 
revenues may decrease 
our success partially dependent upon the admissions and referral practices the physicians the 
communities our hospitals and our outpatient rehabilitation clinics serve and our ability maintain good 
relations with these physicians physicians referring patients our hospitals and clinics are generally not 
our employees and many the local areas that serve most physicians have admitting privileges 
other hospitals and are free refer their patients other providers are unable successfully 
cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these physicians our hospitals admissions and clinics 
businesses may decrease and our net operating revenues may decline 
could experience significant increases our operating costs due shortages healthcare professionals 
union activity 
our specialty hospitals are highly dependent nurses our outpatient rehabilitation division highly 
dependent therapists for patient care and concentra highly dependent upon the ability its 
affiliated professional groups recruit and retain qualified physicians and other licensed providers the 
market for qualified healthcare professionals highly competitive have sometimes experienced 
difficulties attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel cannot assure you will able 
attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals the future additionally the cost attracting and 
retaining qualified healthcare personnel may higher than anticipate and result our profitability 
could decline 
addition united states healthcare providers are continuing see increase the amount 
union activity though cannot predict the degree which will affected future union activity 
there are continuing legislative proposals that could result increased union activity could experience 
increase labor and other costs from such union activity 
our business operations could significantly disrupted lose key members our management team 
our success depends significant degree upon the continued contributions our senior officers 
and other key employees and our ability retain and motivate these individuals currently have 
employment agreements place with three executive officers and change control agreements and 
non competition agreements with several other officers many these individuals also have significant 
equity ownership our company not maintain any key life insurance policies for any our 
employees the loss the services certain these individuals could disrupt significant aspects our 
business could prevent from successfully executing our business strategy and could have material 
adverse effect our results operations 
conducting our business are required comply with applicable laws regarding fee splitting and the 
corporate practice medicine 
some states prohibit the corporate practice medicine that restricts business corporations from 
practicing medicine through the direct employment physicians from exercising control over medical 
decisions physicians some states similarly prohibit the corporate practice therapy the laws 
relating corporate practice vary from state state and are not fully developed each state which 
have facilities typically however professional corporations owned and controlled licensed 
professionals are exempt from corporate practice restrictions and may employ physicians therapists 
furnish professional services also some states hospitals are permitted employ physicians 
some states also prohibit entities from engaging certain financial arrangements such 
fee splitting with physicians therapists the laws relating fee splitting also vary from state state 
and are not fully developed generally these laws restrict business arrangements that involve physician 
therapist sharing medical fees with referral source but some states these laws have been interpreted 
extend management agreements between physicians therapists and business entities under some 
circumstances 
believe that the company current and planned activities not constitute fee splitting the 
unlawful corporate practice medicine contemplated these state laws however there can 
assurance that future interpretations such laws will not require structural and organizational 
modification our existing relationships with the practices court regulatory body determines that 
have violated these laws new laws are introduced that would render our arrangements illegal 
could subject civil criminal penalties our contracts could found legally invalid and 
unenforceable whole part could required restructure our contractual arrangements 
with our affiliated physicians and other licensed providers 
the frequency workplace injuries and illnesses continues decline concentra results may negatively 
affected 
approximately concentra revenue was generated from the treatment review 
workers compensation claims the past decade the number workers compensation claims has 
decreased which concentra primarily attributes improvements workplace safety improved risk 
management employers and changes the type and composition jobs during the economic 
downturn the number employees with workers compensation insurance substantially decreased 
although the number covered employees has increased more recent years the employment rate has 
increased adverse economic conditions can cause the number covered employees decline which can 
cause further declines workers compensation claims addition because the greater access health 
insurance and the fact that the united states economy has continued shift from manufacturing based 
service based economy along with general improvements workplace safety workers are generally 
healthier and less prone work injuries increases employer sponsored wellness and health promotion 
programs spurred part the aca have led fitter and healthier employees who may less likely 
injure themselves the job concentra business model based part its ability expand its 
relative share the market for the treatment and review claims for workplace injuries and illnesses 
workplace injuries and illnesses decline greater rate than the increase total employment total 
employment declines greater rate than the increase incident rates the number claims the 
workers compensation market will decrease and may adversely affect concentra business 
concentra loses several significant employer customers its results may adversely affected 
concentra results may decline loses several significant employer customers one more

significant employer customers due competitive pricing pressures other reasons the loss several 
significant employer customers could cause material decline concentra profitability and operating

significant legal actions could subject substantial uninsured liabilities 
physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject increasing number 
legal actions alleging malpractice product liability related legal theories many these actions involve 
large claims and significant defense costs are also subject lawsuits under federal and state

claims act the plaintiff relators are the former ceo and two former case managers ssh evansville 
and the defendants currently include the company ssh evansville subsidiary the company serving 
common paymaster for its employees and physician who practices ssh evansville the plaintiffrelators allege that from until april ssh evansville discharged patients too early held 
patients too long improperly discharged patients and readmitted them from short stay hospitals 
coded diagnoses admission and admitted patients for whom long term acute care was not medically 
necessary they also allege that the defendants engaged retaliation violation federal and state law 
the second amended complaint replaces prior complaint that was filed under seal september 
and served the company february after federal magistrate judge unsealed 
january all deadlines the case had been stayed after the seal was lifted order allow the 
government time complete its investigation and decide whether not intervene june 
the united states department justice notified the district court its decision not intervene the 
case and the district court thereafter approved case management plan imposing certain deadlines 
december the defendants filed motion dismiss the second amended complaint 
multiple grounds one basis for the motion dismiss was the false claims act public disclosure bar 
which disqualifies qui tam actions that are based fraud already publicly disclosed through enumerated 
sources unless the relator original source the affordable care act enacted march 
altered the public disclosure bar language the false claims act among other things giving the 
united states the right oppose dismissal case based the public disclosure bar their motion 
dismiss the defendants contended that the public disclosure bar applies because substantially the same 
conduct the plaintiff relators have alleged had previously been publicly disclosed including new 
york times article and prior qui tam case second basis for the defendants motion dismiss was that 
the plaintiff relators did not plead their claims with sufficient particularity required the federal 
rules civil procedure 
then based the affordable care act changes the public disclosure bar language the false 
claims act the united states filed notice asserting veto the defendants use the public disclosure 
bar for claims arising from conduct from and after march the defendants filed briefs challenging 
the united states contention that the statutory changes gives unfettered right veto the applicability 
the public disclosure bar september the district court partially granted and partially 
denied the defendants motion dismiss ruled that the plaintiff relators alleged substantially the same 
conduct had been publicly disclosed and that the plaintiff relators are not original sources that the 
public disclosure bar requires dismissal all non retaliation claims arising from conduct before march 
the district court also ruled that the statutory changes the public disclosure bar gave the united 
states the power veto its applicability claims arising from conduct and after march and 
therefore did not dismiss those claims based the public disclosure bar however the district court 
ruled that the plaintiff relators did not plead certain their claims relating interrupted stay 
manipulation and premature discharging patients with the requisite particularity and dismissed those 
claims the district court declined dismiss the plaintiff relators claims arising from conduct from and 
after march relating delayed discharging patients and upcoding and the plaintiff relators 
retaliation claims the company intends vigorously defend this action but this time the company

generally persons age and older those who are chronically disabled and those suffering from end stage 
renal disease net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare program represented 
approximately and our consolidated net operating revenues for the years ended 
december and respectively the principal causes the decrease medicare net 
operating revenues percentage our total net operating revenues are the acquisitions concentra 
june and physiotherapy march which both have significantly lower relative 
percentage medicare net operating revenues compared our historical business prior the 
acquisitions since the percentage net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare 
program have been historically higher our specialty hospitals segment compared our outpatient 
rehabilitation and concentra segments anticipate that the percentage net operating revenues 
generated directly from the medicare program will continue decrease the extent growth our 
outpatient rehabilitation and concentra segments outpaces growth our specialty hospitals segment 
the medicare program reimburses our ltchs irfs and outpatient rehabilitation providers using 
different payment methodologies those payment methodologies are complex and are described elsewhere

patient criteria 
the bba enacted december establishes dual rate ltch pps for medicare 
patients discharged from ltch specifically for medicare patients discharged cost reporting periods 
beginning after october ltchs will reimbursed the ltch pps standard federal 
payment rate only immediately preceding the patient ltch admission the patient was discharged 
from subsection hospital generally short term acute care hospital paid under ipps and either 
the patient stay included least three days intensive care unit icu coronary care unit ccu 
the subsection hospital the patient was assigned ltc drg for cases receiving least 
hours ventilator services the ltch addition paid the ltch pps standard federal 
payment rate the patient discharge from the ltch may not include principal diagnosis relating 
psychiatric rehabilitation services for any medicare patient who does not meet these criteria the ltch 
will paid lower site neutral payment rate which will the lower the ipps comparable per

the estimated costs for services 
the bba provides for transition the site neutral payment rate for those patients not paid 
the ltch pps standard federal payment rate during the transition period applicable hospital cost 
reporting periods beginning after october and before september blended 
rate will paid for medicare patients not meeting the new criteria that equal the site neutral

the total number discharges from the ltch for that period the number discharges for which 
payment made under the site neutral payment rate greater than then beginning the next cost 
reporting period all discharges from the ltch will reimbursed the site neutral payment rate the 
bba requires cms establish process for ltch subject only the site neutral payment 
rate reinstated for payment under the dual rate ltch pps

admissions threshold during particular cost reporting period specifically the payment rate for only 
medicare patients above the percentage admissions threshold are subject downward payment 
adjustment for medicare patients above the applicable percentage admissions threshold the ltch 
reimbursed rate equivalent that under general acute care hospital ipps which generally lower

current law amended the century cures act precludes cms from applying the percent 
rule for freestanding ltchs cost reporting years beginning before july and for discharges 
occurring after october and before october addition current law applies higher 
percentage admissions thresholds under the percent rule for most hihs for cost reporting years 
beginning before july and effective for discharges occurring after october and before 
october for freestanding ltchs the percentage admissions threshold suspended during the 
relief periods for hihs the percentage admissions threshold raised from during the relief

hih satellite will subject downward payment adjustment for any medicare patients who were 
admitted from located non located hospital and that exceed the applicable percentage

these regulatory changes will have adverse financial impact the net operating revenues and 
profitability many these hospitals for discharges after october

critical accounting matters 
contractual adjustments 
net operating revenues include amounts estimated reimbursable medicare and 
medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions cost reimbursement and other payment 
methods addition are reimbursed non governmental payors using variety payment 
methodologies amounts receive for treatment patients covered these programs are generally less 
than the standard billing rates contractual allowances are calculated and recorded through our internally 
developed systems our specialty hospitals segment our billing system automatically calculates estimated 
medicare reimbursement and associated contractual allowances for non governmental payors our 
specialty hospitals segment either manually calculate the contractual allowance for each patient based 
upon the contractual provisions associated with the specific payor where have relatively 
homogeneous patient population monitor individual payors historical closed paid claims data and 
apply those payment rates the existing patient population the net payments are converted into per 
diem rates the per diem rates are applied unpaid patient days determine the expected payment and 
contractual adjustment recorded adjust the recorded amount agree with the expected payment 
quarterly update our analysis historical closed paid claims our outpatient rehabilitation and 
concentra segments perform provision testing using internally developed systems whereby 
monitor payors historical paid claims data and compare against the associated gross charges this 
difference determined percentage gross charges and applied against gross billing revenue 
determine the contractual allowances for the period additionally these contractual percentages are 
applied against the gross receivables the balance sheet determine that adequate contractual reserves 
are maintained for the gross accounts receivables reported the balance sheet account for any 
difference additional contractual adjustments gross revenues arrive net operating revenues 
the period that the difference determined believe the processes used recording our contractual 
adjustments described above have resulted reasonable estimates determined consistent basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all our accounts receivable are related providing healthcare services patients 
collection these accounts receivable our primary source cash and critical our financial 
performance our primary collection risks relate non governmental payors who insure these patients 
and deductibles payments and self insured amounts owed the patient deductibles payments 
and self insured amounts are immaterial portion our net accounts receivable balance 
december deductibles payments and self insured amounts owed patients accounted for 
approximately our net accounts receivable balance before doubtful accounts our general policy 
verify insurance coverage prior the date admission for patient admitted our specialty hospitals 
the case our outpatient rehabilitation clinics and concentra medical centers verify insurance 
coverage prior their first visit our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts calculated 
applying reserve allowance based upon the age account balance this method based our 
historical cash collections experience and write off experience and periodically assessed light any 
changes such experience collections are impacted the effectiveness our collection efforts with 
non governmental payors and regulatory administrative disruptions with the fiscal intermediaries that 
pay our governmental receivables 
estimate bad debts for total accounts receivable within each our operating units believe our 
policies have resulted reasonable estimates determined consistent basis have historically

altered the public disclosure bar language the false claims act among other things giving the
