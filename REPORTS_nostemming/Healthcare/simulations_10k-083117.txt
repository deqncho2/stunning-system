membraneplus was released october similar dddplus membraneplus simulates laboratory experiments but this case the experiments are for 
measuring permeability drug like molecules through various membranes including several different standard cell cultures caco mdck well 
artificially formulated membranes pampa the value such simulations derives from the fact that when the permeabilities the same molecules are 
measured different laboratories using supposedly the same experimental conditions the results are often significantly different these differences are 
caused complex interplay factors how the experiment was set and run membraneplus simulates these experiments with their specific experimental 
details and this enables scientists better interpret how results from specific experimental protocols can used predict permeability human and animals

admet predictor 
admet absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity predictor chemistry based computer program that takes molecular structures 
drawings molecules represented various formats inputs and predicts approximately different properties for them average rate over 
compounds per hour modern laptop computer this capability allows chemists generate estimates for large number important molecular properties 
without the need synthesize and test the molecules well generate estimates unknown properties for molecules that have been synthesized but for 
which only limited number experimental properties have been measured thus chemist can assess the likely success large number existing 
molecules company chemical library well molecules that have never been made providing their molecular structures either drawing them 
using tool such our medchem designer software automatically generating large numbers molecules using various computer algorithms including 
those embedded our medchem studio software 
for many years admet predictor has been top ranked for predictive accuracy multiple peer reviewed independent comparison studies while generating its 
results high throughput rate although the state the art this type software does not enable identifying the best molecule series does allow early 
screening molecules that are highly likely fail potential drug candidates the worst molecules which usually the majority chemical library 
before synthesizing and testing them thus millions virtual compounds can created and screened day compared potentially months years 
work actually synthesize and test much smaller number actual compounds 
the most recent release admet predictor version was released august this new version features completely redesigned and modernized 
interface well number new capabilities enhance the performance and user friendliness the program addition have integrated number 
medchem studio features into the new admet predictor and created tighter integration between the two programs when medchem studio license 
obtained along with admet predictor license 
the optional admet modeler module admet predictor enables scientists use their own experimental data quickly create proprietary high quality 
predictive models using the same powerful machine learning methods use build our top ranked property predictions pharmaceutical companies expend 
substantial time and money conducting wide variety experiments new molecules each year generating large databases experimental data using this

potential new markets for machine learning 
are currently investigating applications our sophisticated machine learning engine outside our normal pharmaceutical markets date have 
conducted several proof concept studies including building predictive models for missile aerodynamic force and moment coefficients function 
missile geometry mach number and angle attack classifying identifying missiles and other objects from radar tracking data mapping jet engine 
compressor performance predict when maintenance might required and classifying patients healthy experiencing some disease state genetic 
disorder evidenced magnetic resonance imaging mri the brain other potential applications for this modeling engine have also been identified however 
our focus date has been primarily these areas 
believe our proprietary machine learning software engine has wide variety potential applications and intend pursue funding develop customized 
tools further monetize our investment this technology expanding our markets beyond the life sciences and chemistry addition are examining 
variety expanded capabilities add the basic modeling engine accommodate even larger data sets big data analytics and new applications 
medchem designer 
medchem designer was launched was initially molecule drawing program sketcher but now has capabilities exceeding those other 
molecule drawing programs because its integration with both medchem studio and admet predictor provide medchem designer for free because 
believe that the long run will help increase demand for admet predictor and medchem studio and because most other existing molecule drawing 
programs are also provided for free our free version includes small set admet predictor best class property predictions allowing the chemist modify 
molecular structures and then see few key properties very quickly with paid admet predictor license the chemist would see the entire approximately 
predictions that are available over copies medchem designer have been downloaded scientists around the world date 
when used with license for admet predictor medchem designer becomes novo molecule design tool with researcher can draw one more 
molecular structures then click the admet predictor icon and have approximately properties for each structure calculated seconds including our 
proprietary admet risk index researchers can also click icon generate the likely metabolites molecule and then predict all the properties 
those metabolites from admet predictor including each their admet risk scores this important because metabolite molecule can 
therapeutically beneficial harmful even though the parent molecule not 
our proprietary admet risk score provides single number that tells the chemist how many default threshold values for various predicted properties were 
crossed violated each structure thus single number the chemist can instantly compare the effects different structural changes many 
dimensions the ideal score zero however low score greater than zero might acceptable depending what property caused the points 
assigned the number too high greater than the molecule not likely successful drug the default rules can modified and new rules 
can added the user include any desired rule set based any combination calculated descriptors predicted properties and user inputs chemists 
attempt modify structures improve one property they often cause others become unacceptable without admet risk the chemist would have 
individually examine many key properties for each new molecule and its metabolites determine whether any them became unacceptable result 
changing the structure 
medchem studio 
medchem studio has been integrated into the admet predictor platform but can still licensed separately without requiring license for admet predictor 
medchem studio powerful software tool that used both for data mining and for novo design new molecules its data mining role medchem studio 
facilitates searching large chemical libraries find molecules that contain identified substructures and enables rapid identification clusters classes 
molecules that share common substructures have now merged medchem studio with admet predictor that either program can entered through the 
same interface and the communication between the two programs enhanced through the seamless integration both technologies believe this will 
enhance the attractiveness both admet predictor and medchem studio medicinal and computational chemists 
while medchem designer can used refine small number molecules medchem studio can used create and screen with admet predictor very 
large numbers molecules down few promising lead candidates medchem studio has features that enable generate new molecular structures using 
variety novo design methods when medchem studio used with admet predictor and medchem designer the combination which refer our 
admet design suite believe the programs provide unmatched capability for chemists search through large libraries compounds that have 
undergone high throughput screening experiments find the most promising classes groups molecules with large common part their structures and 
molecules that are active against particular target addition medchem studio can take interesting but not acceptable molecule and using variety 
design algorithms quickly generate many thousands millions high quality analogs similar new molecules these molecules can then screened using 
admet predictor find molecules that are predicted both active against the target and acceptable variety admet properties demonstrated 
the power the admet design suite during two nce new chemical entity projects wherein designed lead molecules inhibit the growth the 
plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite one study and lead molecules that were able inhibit two targets the same time cox and cox each 
case announced ahead time that were attempting this and reported the results when the projects were complete every molecule 
designed and had synthesized hit their targets both projects clearly demonstrating the power the admet design suite

dilisym 
the dilisym software quantitative systems pharmacology qsp program that has been development since qsp software models are based the 
fundamental understanding complex biological pathways disease processes and drug mechanisms action integrating information from experiments and 
forming hypotheses for the next experimental model dilisym deals with the propensity for some drug molecules induce temporary permanent changes 
biological functions within liver cells hepatocytes that can result damage the liver some drugs cause temporary changes liver function but the body 
soon compensates and liver function returns normal other drugs cause liver function permanently decline they continue taken the dilisym 
software models variety interactions within the hepatocytes determine whether particular drug molecule interrupts normal signaling pathways 
manner induce injury the cells 
nafldsym 
where dilisym used investigate the likelihood that known drug molecule would cause injury the liver nafldsym concerned with liver that 
already diseased excess fat and investigated the likelihood that various molecules might provide beneficial therapeutic benefits treat cure the disease 
dilisym can considered shrink wrap software product usable across many companies and drug development projects nafldsym the other hand 
requires modification for each number different mechanisms action that potential new drug compounds could use treat the disease and 
customized tool used consulting projects for each new client project 
contract research and consulting services 
our scientists and engineers have expertise drug absorption via various dosing routes oral intravenous ocular nasal pulmonary and dermal 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics they have attended over scientific meetings worldwide the past four years often speaking and presenting 
frequently conduct contracted consulting studies for large customers including the five largest pharmaceutical companies who have particularly difficult 
problems and who recognize our expertise solving them well for smaller customers who prefer have studies run our scientists rather than license 
our software and train someone use the demand for our consulting services has been steadily increasing and have expanded our consulting teams 
meet the increased workload 
continue working five year consulting agreement with major research foundation implement platform for coordinating the data generated global 
teams engaged model based drug development 
currently are working with the fda two research collaboration agreements rcas the funded efforts for long acting injectable microspheres and the 
unfunded ivivc effort both described above under gastroplus also successfully completed the third year our funded collaboration for ocular dosing just 
after the end 
pharmacometric modeling 
have reputation for high quality analyses and regulatory reporting data collected during preclinical experiments well clinical trials new and 
existing pharmaceutical products typically working drug projects per year traditionally the model based analysis clinical trial data was different 
from the modeling analysis offered gastroplus the former relied more statistical and semi mechanistic models whereas the latter based very 
detailed mechanistic models statistical models rely direct observation and mathematical equations that are used fit data collected across multiple studies 
along with describing the variability within and between patients mechanistic models are based detailed understanding the human body and the 
chemistry the drug and involve mathematical and scientific representation the phenomena involved drug dissolution precipitation absorption distribution 
metabolism and elimination collectively the models guide drug formulation design and dose selection beginning the and other regulatory 
agencies began emphasize the need push mechanistic pbpk modeling and simulation into clinical pharmacology and have seen the benefit having 
our clinical pharmacology team the cognigen division and our scientists our lancaster california simulations plus division working together achieve this 
goal 
product development 
development our software focused expanding product lines designing enhancements our core technologies and integrating existing and new 
products into our principal software architecture and platform technologies intend continue offer regular updates our products and continue look 
for opportunities expand our existing suite products and services 
date have developed products internally sometimes also licensing acquiring products portions products from third parties these arrangements 
sometimes require that pay royalties third parties intend continue license otherwise acquire technology products from third parties when 
makes business sense currently have one license agreement with biovia san diego division dassault systemes france formerly known 
accelrys inc pursuant which small royalty paid biovia from revenues each license for the metabolite module admet predictor this license 
agreement continues perpetuity and either party has the right terminate 
entered into exclusive software licensing agreement with tsrl inc aka therapeutic systems research laboratories tsrl pursuant 
which tsrl licensed certain software technology and databases and paid royalties tsrl may and tsrl entered into 
termination and nonassertion agreement pursuant which the parties agreed terminate the exclusive software licensing agreement result the 
company obtained perpetual right use certain source code and data and tsrl relinquished any rights and claims any gastroplus products and any 
claims royalties other payments under that agreement and agreed pay tsrl total consideration all payments have now been made 
april our payment obligation being amortized constant rate per quarter until completely amortized after which further 
expense will incurred date this has resulted expense savings over compared the royalty payments that would have been paid tsrl 
paid consistent with past practices 
marketing and distribution 
distribute our products and offer our services north america south america europe japan australia new zealand india singapore taiwan and the 
people republic china 
market our pharmaceutical software and consulting services through attendance and presentations scientific meetings exhibits trade shows seminars 
pharmaceutical companies and government agencies through our website and using various communication channels our database prospects and 
customers various scientific meetings around the world each year there are numerous presentations and posters presented which the reported research

supporting its use wide range preclinical and clinical studies 
our sales and marketing efforts are handled primarily internally with our scientific team and several senior management staff assisting our marketing and sales 
staff with trade shows seminars and customer trainings both online and site believe that this more effective than completely separate sales team for 
several reasons customers appreciate talking directly with software developers and consulting scientists who can answer wide range depth technical 
questions about methods and features our scientists and engineers gain appreciation for the customer environment and problems and believe 
the relationships build through scientist scientist contact are stronger than relationships built through salesperson scientist contacts also have one 
independent distributor japan and two independent representatives china who also sell and market our products with support from our scientists and 
engineers 
provide support the gastroplus user group japan which was organized japanese researchers early group scientists 
europe and north america organized another gastroplus user group following the example set japan nearly members have joined this group date

competition 
our pharmaceutical software and services business compete against number established companies that provide screening testing and research 
services and products that are not based simulation software there are also software companies whose products not compete directly with but are 
sometimes closely related ours our competitors this field include some companies with financial personnel research and marketing resources that are 
larger than ours our management believes there currently significant competitive threat gastroplus however spite high barrier entry one 
could developed over time our new pkplus software product will compete with one major and few minor software programs however the capabilities and 
design features pkplus along with more affordable licensing are expected generate significant interest medchem studio medchem designer and 
admet predictor admet modeler operate more competitive environment several other companies presently offer simulation modeling software 
simulation software based services the pharmaceutical industry believe dilisym and nafldsym enjoy unique market position with significant 
competition 
major pharmaceutical companies conduct drug discovery and development efforts through their internal development staffs and through outsourcing smaller 
companies generally need outsource greater percentage this research thus compete not only with other software suppliers but also with the inhouse development teams some the larger pharmaceutical companies 
although competitive products exist both new licenses and license renewals for gastroplus have continued grow believe that enjoy dominant market 
share this segment believe our admet predictor admet modeler medchem studio medchem designer dddplus membraneplus pkplus kiwi 
dilisym and nafldsym software offerings are each unique their combination capabilities and intend continue market them aggressively 
believe the key factors our ability successfully compete this field are our ability continue invest research and development and develop 
and support industry leading simulation and modeling software and related products and services effectively predict activities and admet related behaviors 
new drug like compounds design new molecules with acceptable activity and admet properties develop and maintain proprietary database results 
physical experiments that serve basis for simulated studies and empirical models attract and retain highly skilled scientific and engineering team 
aggressively our products and services our global market and develop and maintain relationships with research and development departments 
pharmaceutical companies universities and government agencies 
addition actively seek strategic acquisitions expand the pharmaceutical software and services business and explore opportunities aerospace and

item risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing 
our business also subject the risks that affect many other companies such competition technological obsolescence labor relations general 
economic conditions geopolitical changes and international operations operate rapidly changing environment that involves number risks some 
which are beyond our control additional risks not currently known that currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and 
our liquidity the risks described below could cause our actual results differ materially from those contained the forward looking statements have made 
this annual report form the information incorporated herein reference and those forward looking statements may make from time time 
note these factors for investors permitted the private securities litigation reform act you should understand that not possible predict 
identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following complete discussion all potential risks uncertainties 
certain risks related our marketplace and environment 
our ability sustain increase revenues will depend upon our success entering new markets continuing increase our customer base and 
deriving additional revenues from our existing customers 
our products are currently used primarily molecular modeling and simulation specialists pharmaceutical biotechnology agrotech cosmetics and 
government research organizations one component our overall business strategy derive more revenues from our existing customers expanding their 
use our products and services such strategy would have our customers utilize our scientific informatics platforms and our tools and components leverage 
vast amounts information stored both corporate databases and public data sources order make informed scientific and business decisions during the 
research and development process addition seek expand into new markets and new areas within our existing markets acquiring businesses 
these markets attracting and retaining personnel knowledgeable these markets identifying the needs these markets and developing marketing programs 
address these needs successfully implemented these strategies would increase the usage our software and services biologists chemists engineers 
and informaticians operating within our existing pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical customers well new customers other industries 
however our strategies are not successfully implemented our products and services may not achieve market acceptance penetration targeted new 
departments within our existing customers new industries result may incur additional costs and expend additional resources without being able 
sustain increase revenue 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may continue lead fewer potential customers for our products and 
services 
significant portion our customer base consists pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
industries may result fewer customers for our products and services although the industry consolidation that has taken place over the past years has not 
prevented our business from growing date one the parties consolidation uses the products services our competitors may lose existing 
customers result such consolidation 
increasing competition and increasing costs within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may affect the demand for our products and 
services which may affect our results operations and financial condition 
our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers demand for our products impacted continued demand for their products and our customers research 
and development costs demand for our customers products could decline and prices charged our customers for their products may decline result 
increasing competition including competition from companies manufacturing generic drugs addition our customers expenses could continue increase 
result increasing costs complying with government regulations and other factors decrease demand for our customers products pricing pressures 
associated with the sales these products and additional costs associated with product development could cause our customers reduce research and 
development expenditures although our products increase productivity and reduce costs many areas because our products and services depend such 
research and development expenditures our revenues may significantly reduced 
health care reform and restrictions reimbursement may affect the pharmaceutical biotechnology and industrial chemical companies that 
purchase license our products services which may affect our results operations and financial condition 
the continuing efforts government and third party payers the markets serve contain reduce the cost health care may reduce the profitability 
pharmaceutical biotechnology and industrial chemical companies causing them reduce research and development expenditures because some our 
products and services depend such research and development expenditures our revenues may significantly reduced cannot predict what actions 
federal state private payers for health care goods and services may take response any health care reform proposals legislation 
face strong competition the life science market for computer aided design modeling and simulation software and for cheminformatics 
products 
the market for our computer aided design modeling and simulation software products for the life science market intensely competitive currently face 
competition from other scientific software providers larger technology and solutions companies house development our customers and academic and 
government institutions and the open source community some our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories certain segments 
our industry than and could have greater financial technical marketing research and development and other resources many our competitors offer 
products and services directed more specific markets than those target enabling these competitors focus greater proportion their efforts and 
resources these markets some offerings that compete with our products are developed and made available lower cost government organizations and 
academic institutions and these entities may able devote substantial resources product development and also offer their products users for little 
charge could also face competition from open source software initiatives which developers provide software and intellectual property free over the 
internet addition some our customers spend significant internal resources order develop their own software moreover intend leverage our 
scientific informatics platform order enable our customers more effectively utilize the vast amounts information stored both their databases and 
public data sources order make informed scientific and business decisions during the research and development process this strategy could lead 
competition from much larger companies that provide general data storage and management software there can assurance that our current potential 
competitors will not develop products services technologies that are comparable superior render obsolete the products services and technologies 
offer there can assurance that our competitors will not adapt more quickly than technological advances and customer demands thereby 
increasing such competitors market share relative ours any material decrease demand for our technologies services may have material adverse effect 
our business financial condition and results operations 
are subject pricing pressures some the markets serve 
the market for computer aided design modeling and simulation products for the life science industry intensely competitive although the average price our 
software licenses has increased slightly remained relatively constant for fiscal and may experience decline the future response 
increased competition and general adverse economic conditions this market may required modify our pricing practices changes our pricing 
model could adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
our operations may interrupted the occurrence natural disaster other catastrophic event our primary facilities 
our research and development operations and administrative functions are primarily conducted our facilities lancaster california buffalo new york and 
research triangle park north carolina although have contingency plans effect for natural disasters other catastrophic events the occurrence such 
events could still disrupt our operations for example our lancaster california facility located state that particularly susceptible earthquakes any 
natural disaster catastrophic event our facilities the areas which they are located could have significant negative impact our operations 
our insurance coverage may not sufficient avoid material impact our financial position results operations resulting from claims 
liabilities against and may not able obtain insurance coverage the future 
maintain insurance coverage for protection against many risks liability the extent our insurance coverage under continuous review and modified 
deem necessary despite this insurance possible that claims liabilities against may have material adverse impact our financial position 
results operations addition may not able obtain any insurance coverage adequate insurance coverage when our existing insurance coverage 
expires for example not carry earthquake insurance for our facilities lancaster california because not believe the costs such insurance are 
reasonable relation the potential risk for our part california 
changes government regulation practices relating the pharmaceutical biotechnology industries including potential health care reform 
could decrease the need for the services provide 
governmental agencies throughout the world but particularly the strictly regulate the drug development process our business involves helping 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others navigate the regulatory drug approval process accordingly many regulations and often new 
regulations are expected result higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries however some 
changes regulations such relaxation regulatory requirements the introduction streamlined expedited drug approval procedures increase 
regulatory requirements that have difficulty satisfying that make our services less competitive could eliminate substantially reduce the demand for our 
services 
any negative commentaries made any regulatory agencies any failure comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could 
harm our reputation and operating results and compliance with new regulations and guidance may result additional costs 
any negative commentaries made any regulatory agencies any failure our part comply with applicable regulations could result the termination 
ongoing research the disqualification data for submission regulatory authorities this could harm our reputation our prospects for future work and our 
operating results our operations are found violate any applicable law other governmental regulations might subject civil and criminal penalties 
damages and fines any action against for violation these laws even successfully defend against could cause incur significant legal 
expenses divert our management attention from the operation our business and damage our reputation 
many our contracts are fixed price and may delayed terminated reduced scope for reasons beyond our control may underprice 
overrun cost estimates with these contracts potentially resulting financial losses 
many our contracts provide for services fixed price fee for service with cap basis and accordingly bear the financial risk initially underprice 
our contracts otherwise overrun our cost estimates addition these contracts may terminated reduced scope either immediately upon notice 
cancellations may occur for variety reasons and often the discretion the client the loss reduction scope delay large contract the loss 
delay multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business although our contracts frequently entitle receive the costs winding down the 
terminated projects well all fees earned the time termination some contracts also entitle predetermined termination fee and 
irrevocably committed costs expenses 
could experience breach the confidentiality the information hold the security our computer systems 
operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts client data routine element our business collect analyze and 
retain substantial amounts data pertaining the clinical study data analysis conduct for our clients unauthorized third parties could attempt gain entry 
such computer systems for the purpose stealing data disrupting the systems believe that have taken appropriate measures protect them from 
intrusion and continue improve and enhance our systems this regard but the event that our efforts are unsuccessful could suffer significant harm 
our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require keep confidential the information generated from these studies the event the 
confidentiality such information was compromised could suffer significant harm 
impairment goodwill other intangible assets may adversely impact future results operations 
have intangible assets including goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles our balance sheet due our acquisitions businesses the initial 
identification and valuation these intangible assets and the determination the estimated useful lives the time acquisition involve use management 
judgments and estimates these estimates are based among other factors input from accredited valuation consultants reviews projected future income 
cash flows and statutory regulations the use alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased decreased the estimated fair value our 
goodwill and other intangible assets that could potentially result different impact our results operations the future growth and operating results our 
business are not strong anticipated and our market capitalization declines this could impact the assumptions used calculating the fair value 
goodwill other indefinite lived intangibles the extent goodwill other indefinite lived intangibles are impaired their carrying value will written down 
its implied fair value and charge will made our income from continuing operations such impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our 
operating results august the carrying amount goodwill and other intangibles was our consolidated balance sheet 
certain risks related our operations 
software defects malfunctions our products could hurt our reputation among our customers result delayed lost revenue and expose 
liability 
our business and the level customer acceptance our products depend upon the continuous effective and reliable operation our software and related 
tools and functions the extent that defects cause our software malfunction and our customers use our products interrupted our reputation could suffer 
and our revenue could decline delayed while such defects are remedied may also subject liability for the defects and malfunctions third party 
technology partners and others with whom our products and services are integrated 
delays the release new enhanced products services undetected errors our products services may result increased cost 
delayed market acceptance our products and delayed lost revenue 
achieve market acceptance new enhanced products services can require long development and testing periods which may result delays 
scheduled introduction any delays the release schedule for new enhanced products services may delay market acceptance these products 
services and may result delays new customer orders for these new enhanced products services the loss customer orders addition new 
enhanced products services may contain number undetected errors bugs when they are first released although extensively test each new 
enhanced software product service before released the market there can assurance that significant errors will not found existing future 
releases result the months following the introduction certain releases may need devote significant resources correct these errors there can 
assurance however that all these errors can corrected 
are subject risks associated with the operation global business 
derive significant portion our total revenue from our operations international markets during the years ended august and 
and respectively our total revenue was derived from our international operations our global business may affected local economic 
conditions including inflation recession and currency exchange rate fluctuations addition political and economic changes including international conflicts 
including terrorist acts throughout the world may interfere with our our customers activities particular locations and result material adverse effect our 
business financial condition and operating results potential trade restrictions exchange controls adverse tax consequences and legal restrictions may affect 
the repatriation funds into the also could subject unexpected changes regulatory requirements the difficulties compliance with wide 
variety foreign laws and regulations potentially negative consequences from changes interpretations and foreign tax laws import and export 
licensing requirements and longer accounts receivable cycles certain foreign countries these risks individually the aggregate could have adverse 
effect our results operations and financial condition for example are subject compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments foreign government officials for the purpose 
obtaining retaining business while our employees distributors and agents are required comply with these laws cannot sure that our internal policies 
and procedures will always protect from violations these laws despite our commitment legal compliance and corporate ethics the occurrence 
allegation these types risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results operations 
the drug discovery and development services industry highly competitive 
our clinical pharmacology division often competes for business not only with other clinical research organization cros but also with internal discovery and 
development departments within our larger clients who may have greater resources than ours also compete with universities and teaching hospitals for 
outsourced services compete based variety factors including 
reputation for time quality performance 
reputation for regulatory compliance 
expertise and experience multiple specialized areas 
scope and breadth service and product offerings across the drug discovery and development spectrum 
ability provide flexible and customized solutions support our clients drug discovery and development needs 
price value 
technological expertise and efficient drug development processes 
financial stability 
accessibility client data through secure portals and 
ability acquire process analyze and report data accurate manner 
not compete successfully our business could suffer increased competition might lead price and other concessions that might adversely affect our 
operating results the drug discovery and development services industry has continued see trend towards consolidation particularly among biotechnology 
companies who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies this trend continues likely produce more competition among the 
larger companies and cros generally with respect both clients and acquisition candidates addition while there are substantial barriers entry for large 
global competitors with broad based services small specialized entities considering entering the cro industry will continue find lower barriers entry and 
private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities acquire and consolidate these companies thus further increasing possible competition more 
generally our competitors others might develop technologies services products that are more effective commercially attractive than our current future 
technologies services products that render our technologies services products less competitive obsolete competitors introduce superior 
technologies services products and cannot make enhancements ours remain competitive our competitive position and turn our business 
revenue and financial condition would materially and adversely affected the aggregate these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness our 
technologies services products and could adversely affect our financial results 
potential changes and international tax law 
the there are several proposals reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration these proposals include reducing the corporate 
statutory tax rate broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination reduction deductions exclusions and credits implementing territorial regime 
taxation limiting the ability corporations deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings modifying the foreign tax credit rules and 
reducing the ability defer tax offshore earnings these other changes the tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect 
our profitability 
contract research services create risk liability 
cro face range potential liabilities which may include 
errors omissions reporting study detail preclinical studies that may lead inaccurate reports which may undermine the usefulness 
study data from the study which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support inhibit studies from proceeding the next 
level testing and 
risks associated with our possible failure properly care for our clients property such research models records work progress other 
archived materials 
contractual risk transfer indemnifications generally not protect against liability arising from certain our own actions such negligence misconduct 
could materially and adversely affected are required pay damages bear the costs defending any claim that outside any contractual 
indemnification provision party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations the damage beyond the scope level insurance coverage also 
often contractually indemnify our clients subject limitation liability similar the way they indemnify and may materially adversely affected 
have fulfill our indemnity obligations furthermore there can assurance that nor party required indemnify will able maintain such 
insurance coverage either all terms acceptable 
upgrading our software could result implementation issues and business disruptions 
recent years implemented project refactor our software programs doing face the possibility that existing users will find the software 
unacceptable new users may not interested they have been the past versions translation errors might introduce new software bugs that will not 
caught 
the drug discovery and development industry has history patent and other intellectual property litigation and might involved costly 
intellectual property lawsuits 
the drug discovery and development industry has history patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue accordingly 
face potential patent infringement suits companies that have patents for similar products and methods used business other suits alleging infringement 
their intellectual property rights legal proceedings relating intellectual property could expensive take significant time and divert management attention 
from other business concerns whether win lose not prevail infringement lawsuit brought against might have pay substantial 
damages including treble damages and could required stop the infringing activity obtain license use technology unfavorable terms 
may not able successfully develop and market new services and products 
may seek develop and market new services and products that complement expand our existing business service offerings cannot guarantee that 
will able identify new technologies interest our customers even are able identify new technologies interest may not able 
negotiate license agreements acceptable terms all are unable develop new services and products and create demand for those newly 
developed services and products our future business results operations financial condition and cash flows could adversely affected 
ability incur debt could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 
august had borrowed debt and have need fund normal operations the foreseeable future however should circumstances 
require incur debt and lender could not found provide that debt this could have significant adverse effect our business including making 
more difficult for obtain financing favorable terms limiting our ability capitalize significant business opportunities and making more vulnerable
