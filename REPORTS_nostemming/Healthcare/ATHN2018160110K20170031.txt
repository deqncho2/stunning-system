operate highly competitive industry and are not able compete effectively our business and operating results will harmed 
the provision third parties medical billing and practice management services medical practices has historically been dominated small service 
providers who offer highly individualized services and high degree specialized knowledge applicable many cases limited medical specialty 
limited set payers limited geographical area anticipate that the software statistical and database tools that are available such service providers 
will continue become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could adversely affected 
electronic health records ehr and practice management software for medical groups and health systems has historically been dominated large 
well financed and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused software solutions some these entities are now offering hosted services 
software service models under which software centrally administered and these vendors may also provide administrative and billing services the 
size financial strength and 
table contents 
breadth offerings the larger entities are increasing result continued consolidation both the information technology and healthcare industries 
expect large integrated technology companies continue become more active our markets both through acquisition and internal investment 
costs fall and technology improves increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape favor competitors with greater scale than 
possess addition few smaller companies have started providing single instance internet based software using model similar ours the offerings 
these smaller companies may reduce the perceived competitive advantage our services and impact our market share further while the market for patient 
engagement population health and care coordination services growing and not yet dominated small group vendors with significant resources 
our patient engagement population health and care coordination services face competition from wide variety market participants for example certain 
health systems have developed their own patient portals population health and care coordination systems fail distinguish our patient engagement 
population health and care coordination offerings from the other options available healthcare providers the demand for and market share those 
offerings may decrease 
regard our epocrates branded services compete with other companies for users the types drug and clinical reference tools that offer and 
for budget dollars from our pharmaceutical managed care and market research clients compete within broad industry healthcare content providers 
for the attention healthcare professionals who can choose use mobile online print media reference clinical information companies providing 
clinical content include medscape division webmd llc and uptodate inc division wolters kluwer health competition from each these 
sources clinical reference content may lead loss our existing network members and reduction the rate which attract new members for our

companies including webmd that help such companies market their products programs and services healthcare professionals our market research 
business competes with numerous companies that recruit physicians participate surveys variety formats well the recruitment arms market 
research companies that have assembled their own survey panels healthcare professionals the extent competing channels are available access 
healthcare professionals including physicians the value our interactive services our clients reduced 
some our current large competitors such allscripts healthcare solutions inc cerner corporation epic systems corporation mckesson corp 
and quality systems inc and its subsidiary nextgen healthcare information systems llc have greater name recognition longer operating histories and 
significantly greater resources than result our competitors may able respond more quickly and effectively than can new changing 
opportunities technologies standards client requirements expect face new competitors continue develop and offer services for the 
inpatient market addition current and potential competitors have established and may the future establish cooperative relationships with vendors 
complementary products technologies services increase the availability their products the marketplace current future competitors may 
consolidate improve the breadth their products directly competing with our integrated offerings accordingly new competitors alliances may emerge 
that have greater market share larger client bases greater breadth and volume data more widely adopted proprietary technologies broader offerings 
greater marketing expertise greater financial resources and larger sales forces than have which could put competitive disadvantage further 
light these advantages even our services are more effective than the product service offerings our competitors current potential clients might 
select competitive products and services lieu purchasing our services increased competition likely result pricing pressures which could 
negatively impact our sales profitability market share face competition from new niche vendors who offer stand alone products and services and 
from existing enterprise vendors including those currently focused software solutions which have information systems place with clients our target 
markets these existing enterprise vendors may now the future offer promise products services with less functionality than our services but offer 
ease integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships 
the market for cloud based services for healthcare information technology may not develop substantially further may develop more slowly than 
expect harming the growth our business 
the market for cloud based services for healthcare information technology remains narrowly based and uncertain whether these services will 
achieve and sustain the high levels demand and market acceptance anticipate our success will depend substantial extent the willingness 
enterprises large and small increase their use cloud based services general and for their revenue clinical and patient cycles particular many 
enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may 
reluctant unwilling switch cloud based service furthermore some enterprises may reluctant unwilling use cloud based services because 
they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability among other things the technology delivery model associated with 
these services enterprises not perceive the benefits our services then the market for these services may not expand much develop quickly 
expect either which would significantly adversely affect our business financial condition operating results 
table contents 
changes the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services cause our existing contracts terminate and negatively impact the 
process negotiating future contracts 
the healthcare industry evolves changes our member client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services result the termination 
existing contracts certain services provided under existing contracts and make more difficult negotiate new contracts terms that are acceptable 
for example the current trend toward consolidation healthcare providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts terminate 
independent practices are merged into hospital systems such larger healthcare organizations may also have their own practice management services and 
health systems reducing demand for our services similarly client and vendor consolidation results fewer larger entities with increased bargaining 
power and the ability demand terms that are unfavorable these trends continue cannot assure you that will able continue maintain 
expand our client base negotiate contracts with acceptable terms maintain our current pricing structure and our revenues may decrease 
general reductions expenditures healthcare companies reductions such expenditures within market segments that serve could have 
similar impacts with regard our interactive services such reductions may result from among other things reduced governmental funding for healthcare 
decrease the number the market exclusivity available new drugs coming market government regulation private initiatives that affect the 
manner which healthcare providers interact with patients pharmaceutical companies payers other healthcare industry participants limitations 
advertising physicians required disclosure payments made them adverse changes business economic conditions affecting healthcare 
payers providers the pharmaceutical industry other healthcare companies that purchase our interactive services changes the design health

our failure provide services timely high quality manner 
failure our clients adopt maintain effective business practices 
actions third party payers medical claims reduce reimbursement 
government regulations and government other payer actions inaction reducing delaying reimbursement and 
reduction client revenue resulting from increased competition other changes the marketplace for physician services 
changes economic conditions and government requirements may increase the likelihood several these factors for example patients who have 
lost health insurance coverage due unemployment who face increased deductibles imposed financially struggling employers insurers could reduce 
the number visits those patients make our clients patients without health insurance with reduced coverage may also default their payment 
obligations higher rate than patients with coverage added financial stress our clients could lead their acquisition bankruptcy which could cause 
the termination some our service relationships further despite the cost benefits that believe our services provide prospective clients may wish 
delay contract decisions due implementation costs reluctant make any material changes their established business methods based upon the 
economic climate with reduction tax revenue state and federal government healthcare programs including reimbursement programs such medicaid 
initiatives under the patient protection and affordable care act which refer the aca may reduced eliminated which could negatively 
impact the payments that our clients receive 
also although currently estimate our expected client life for clients athenahealth branded services years this only estimate and

assure you that members our epocrates network and other epocrates branded services clients will continue participate our existing programs beyond 
the terms their existing contracts that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs that offer our clients revenue decreases for

client meet our respective implementation responsibilities 
even implementation has begun there can assurance that will recognize revenue timely basis all from our efforts implementation 
for given client may canceled addition implementation may delayed the target dates for completion may extended into the future for 
variety reasons including the needs and requirements the client delays with payer processing and the volume and complexity the implementations 
awaiting our work implementation periods are extended our provision our athenahealth services upon which realize most our revenues will

multiple deliverables and may subject delays over which have little control including those that result from that client need for internal 
approvals 
these factors may contribute fluctuations our quarterly operating results particularly during any period which our sales volume relatively low

including the accounting for income taxes forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements well classification the statement cash flows 
adopted this standard january using modified retrospective approach which requires the cumulative effect initially applying the standard 
recorded adjustment the opening balance retained earnings the annual reporting period that includes the date initial application and 
which resulted cumulative effect increase million retained earnings and deferred tax assets upon adoption now recognize all excess tax 
benefits and tax deficiencies income tax expense benefit the income statement longer present excess tax benefits within cash flows from 
financing activities but instead present these cash flows cash flows from operating activities the consolidated statements cash flows prior adoption 
the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies were recorded additional paid capital and excess tax benefits were not recorded until they were able 
utilized addition elected longer calculate estimate expected forfeitures and began recognizing forfeitures they occurred including 
cumulative effect decrease million retained earnings january with the offset increase additional paid capital 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
revenue from contracts with customers 
new revenue recognition guidance which was issued march and amended thereafter effective for public companies for annual reporting 
periods beginning after december including interim periods within those reporting periods the new revenue standard outlines single 
comprehensive model for entities use accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition 
guidance including industry specific guidance addition the new standard provides guidance accounting for certain revenue related costs including 
costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling contract 
while the impact this standard will vary across our industry peers our unique market strategy centered around charging percentage our 
clients collections for our services within athenaone deals combined with our offering that essentially provides series integrated services and our 
clients ability terminate our services fixed number days notice without significant penalty will result additional complexity our pattern 
revenue recognition compared the current revenue recognition pattern have reached conclusions key accounting assessments and are substantially 
complete with the implementation new processes for the accounting under the new standard these new processes include implementing new information 
technology system and creating additional internal controls over financial reporting 
under today accounting standards the criterion impacting the timing our revenue recognition the requirement fees either fixed 
determinable therefore not recognize revenue for many athenaone based business services deals until these collections are posted the fees are not 
fixed determinable until such time the new guidance does not limit the recognition revenue only fees that are fixed determinable instead the 
standard focuses recognizing revenue value transferred customers the impact our athenaone services offering revenue recognition and 
reporting model that reflects revenue recognized over time rather than delaying the recognition revenue until the point time which the fees 
charged become determinable for athenaone arrangements will estimate the value the consideration will earn over the remaining contractual 
period our services are provided and recognize the fees over the term this estimation will typically involve predicting the amounts our clients will 
ultimately collect associated with the services they provide with the assistance athenanet because most our contracts require our clients provide 
fixed number days notice prior terminating our services our contractual term resets daily requiring estimate the amount consideration 
paid over the continuously changing period during which our contracts are legally enforceable and are providing services such believe 
certain estimates required measure athenaone based revenue under the new standard will significant estimates

under the new standard certain costs obtain contract and our contract fulfillment costs which currently expense will deferred and amortized 
over the period contract performance longer period generally the expected client life renewals are expected costs obtain contract primarily 
relate commissions paid employees and third parties and contract fulfillment costs primarily relate the implementation client 
the new standard provides companies with two implementation methods companies can choose adopt the standard retrospectively and apply the 
guidance each prior reporting period presented alternatively modified retrospective adoption methodology permitted whereby the cumulative 
impact all prior periods would recorded retained earnings other impacted balance sheet line items january the date adoption 
under this method previously presented years financial positions and results would not adjusted however certain disclosures are required 
presented for comparability prior years results plan adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method 
under the modified retrospective adoption method have elected retroactively adjust only those contracts that not meet the definition 
completed contract the date initial application result our initial adjustments costs obtain and costs fulfill contract may not indicative 
future capitalization amounts once the new revenue standard effective addition upon adoption the deferred implementation revenue balance 
associated with past implementation costs will longer recognized over the client life and such balance net tax will adjusted and recorded

anticipate that the new revenue standard will have material impact our consolidated balance sheet upon adoption resulting from the 
requirement capitalize certain commissions and contract fulfillment costs which currently expense incurred and from the removal substantially 
all the deferred revenue balances associated with past implementation fees for which million recorded december compared our 
current accounting believe that the seasonality associated with the timing when claims are submitted our clients and when our clients receive

operating financing while the income statement reflects lease expense for operating leases and amortization and interest expense for financing leases 
leases with term months less will accounted for similar existing guidance for operating leases addition the new lease guidance requires
