since the end last year have held the view that asset mar

peaking growth momentum tighter financial conditions higher vola

set counter tariffs chinese goods duty 
suggests deteriorating risk reward profile for markets 
likely implemented early september after public hearings 
late august july the administration further indicated 
lowered our index targets both europe and last 
that was ready apply tariffs all chinese goods imported into 
month late june lowered our rolling index targets 
the which stands 
europe thought the political events italy and newsflow 
around trade protectionism suggested deteriorating risk profile 
our public policy strategist michael zezas has been arguing 
for equities our new msci europe index target implying 
lately this recent newsflow suggests that escalatory cycle tit 
downside from current levels was driven material cut our

assessing the impact trade protectionism 
europe 
europe potentially more exposed global escalation trade frictions than its peers face value chinese and economies companies are likely the 
most impacted the protectionist trade measures being 
discussed far the bulk announced and potential tariffs are aimed directly chinese imports however 
saw global escalation trade frictions europe 
could potentially more exposed than its other regional 
peers two reasons why 
msci emu has tended show relatively higher correlation our economists global trade leading indicator compared other regions over the last and period provide 
more context around this point exhibit shows the correlation 
our economists global trade leading indicator gtli with msci 
emu consensus and eps for number different 
regions make two points 
over the last year and year periods emu 
did show the highest correlation any region changes 
europe more international than most other stock markets 
our gtli however this not true over the last five years 
regions line with the euro area relatively high current account 
with the region posting much lower sensitivity perhaps this 
surplus from macro perspective the region equity market also 
reflecting the fact that the region has traded broadly 
highly international arguably more than any other major region 
sideways for much that period accommodative mone 
this makes potentially more exposed than its peers were 
tary policy artificially distorted asset valuations this cycle 
see more significant and globally oriented escalation trade fric 
going forward would expect this correlation revert 
tion exhibit use data from our global exposure guide 
long run levels central banks have started normalising 
show that revenues for companies europe comes 
monetary policy 
from overseas versus for the for japan for the 
addition comparing our gtli changes consensus 
and for look purely european companies direct 
have also looked the correlation with 
exposure the find that they generate sales and also 
eps find that for the latter emu correlation actually 
incur costs from the region 
tends lower than other regions although differing 
levels market earnings composition may distort the data

our economists have laid out scenarios for the eventual out 
gauging the impact european equities under our economists 
come the trade disputes their report last week our econo 
different scenarios group our economists scenarios for the 
mists explored the eventual outcomes the ongoing trade disputes 
eventual outcomes trade disputes into broad groupings and dis 
under scenarios the first scenario covers the tariffs that have been 
cuss the impact european equities under each these groupings 
implemented announced far and the remaining three are escalatory scenarios involving responses actions from its key trading 
status quo escalation given the slightly positive newsflow 
partners 
trade late last week think fair say that are currently between our economists first and second scenarios 
status quo tariffs steel and aluminium addition 
status quo and escalation the current circumstances fit with our 
tariffs imports from china and vice versa 
base case view european equities late june lowered our 
index targets due deteriorating risk reward profile given 
escalation imposes tariffs imports from 
recent newsflow trade protectionism and italy 
china and tariffs autos imports from europe china 
responds imposing tariff imports and 
significant escalation full blown escalation laid out our 
europe imposes broad based tariff all imports 
mid year outlook the bear case for european equities would involve 
significant escalation trade tensions amidst backdrop slower 
significant escalation imposes tariffs all 
growth and higher inflation trade uncertainty rose the level 
imports from china which met tariff all goods china 
our economists significant full blown escalation scenarios will 
and tariffs all goods europe 
likely have negative impact growth and lead big upside surprises inflation our bear case index target for msci europe

october given that autos the fourth largest end market our 
some industries products are directly affected larger companies 
sector tariffs broad based auto imports could pose significant 
electrical equipment may have more flexibility supply chain 
issues for capital goods companies terms both the ability the 
ability redirect production other facilities see greater 
auto industry invest manufacturing capacity and pricing and 
risks the electrical segment versus machinery due availability 
volume dynamics for auto components the exhibit below shows the

companies within our sector most directly exposed autos but

appreciate that saw with the oil gas downturn there 
could well meaningful indirect impact too several regions may

our view the most likely near term consequences for the industry 
far the tariff debates and news flow has primarily been related 
from the introduction tariffs july include immediate 
the and china however recent weeks have seen the 
reduction gross margin for products entering the from china and 
impose tariff steel and tariff aluminium products

devices 
siemens has indicated that would honour the order booking price 
agreed customers whereas for consumer health philips has 
while the and chinese markets are arguably the most important 
indicated willingness pass the increased cost the consumer 
markets for many medtech companies the the largest and 
under the belief that competitors would face increased costs well 
most profitable medical device market the world while china 
overall any company responses are likely take time implement 
offers the biggest growth opportunity over the medium long term 
given the complexities involved adapting supply chains well the 
the extent manufacturing products done the china and 
uncertainty implicit any trade negotiations however some mitiga 
shipped the other limited based company commentary 
tion through redirecting product could possible the short term 
therefore implications tariffs announced far have been limited 
this would not the case with europe many the corporates 
despite the recent escalation china trade tensions and pro 
have spoken state that the market supplied with products 
posed introduction tariffs the sector valuation has increased fur 
made european countries furthermore europe included the 
ther and note that medical devices are not immune further 
tariff debate then there are more limited options for shifting produc 
tariff increases with this backdrop are surprised that valuations 
tion regions without tariffs one the mitigating options some 
have run new highs suggesting that the potential for more negative 
corporates have identified 
china tariff developments not priced make the 
observation that there are number stocks for which china and 
trade tariffs escalate and medical devices are included this 
europe are major production hub for the market such philips 
could highly problematic for many our companies that have sig
