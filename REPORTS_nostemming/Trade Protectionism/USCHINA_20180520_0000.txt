what our assessment the outcome the may negotiations progress 
easing trade tensions appears mutually beneficial the has made 
headway deficit reduction which long desired goal the current 
administration while china avoids proposed section tariffs and wins time for 
further negotiations this supports our long standing view that the temporary 
trade dispute will escalate over time through negotiation both sides plan 
work implementing agriculture and energy purchases and continue 
negotiate manufacturing and service trade bilateral investment and 
intellectual property protection coming months 
where could china increase imports goods estimate potential 
increase chinese purchases goods with rise 
agriculture imports particularly beef the near term followed energy 
primarily lng and then non high tech manufactured goods such aerospace 
chemicals and non electrical machinery efforts achieve deficit reduction 
beyond that could face constraints such protection sensitive hightech exports 
what could reasonable time frame expect transition period 
years for china incremental purchases materialize view 
time needed for capacity expansion exporting sectors and given the 
historical experience from japan trade frictions 
would affect china other trading partners the potential surge imports 
from the could lead increasing competition for economies with leading 
market shares the aforementioned sectors this suggests pressures brazil 
australia and uruguay china beef market australia qatar and the uae 
china lng imports and tech oriented economies asia and the 
china manufacturing imports 
how would this affect china economy and policy direction the progress 
line with our base case our mid year outlook and see manageable impact 
china will likely opt for non disruptive approach with gradual shift 
products its incremental imports while easing trade tensions and above trend 
global growth remain supportive china export growth cushioning the impact 
its balance and reserves with pre emptive policy fine tuning over the 
past month expect manageable pace deleveraging with milder 
deceleration broad credit growth yoy year end 
now bringing china debt gdp near stabilization

what our assessment the negotiations result 
the china joint statement staves off escalation the and china concluded the 
may trade talks with joint statement which they agreed take measures 
reduce the trade deficit having china purchase more american goods the 
statement specified that china will meaningfully increase imports agriculture and 
energy products and the will send delegation china for further consultations 
both sides also agreed create favorable conditions increase trade manufactured 
goods and services promote cooperation intellectual property protection and 
encourage two way investment after the joint statement the chinese delegation and 
top officials stated separately that the two countries agreed not launch trade 
war and put the proposed tariffs hold 
supporting our long standing view that this not trade war but temporary trade 
dispute that will escalate over time through negotiation see this joint statement 
benign progress ease trade tensions the two sides are focusing the variable 
that both are willing change reduction the trade deficit this echoes our longstanding view that the and china will eventually negotiate deal that will bring 
about gradual and non disruptive adjustment the trade relationship thereby limiting 
the impact trade frictions economic growth 
our public policy strategist michael zezas believes this joint statement more 
ceasefire than peace treaty questions remain how china could increase 
imported goods from the without purchasing more sensitive goods 
hence the section tariff decision the will likely delayed rather than 
allowed expire keeping the option escalation alive 
that said michael sees some near term progress that mutually beneficial the one 
hand the made progress deficit reduction which long desired goal the 
current administration the other hand china avoids section proposed tariffs 
and wins time for further negotiations while remaining committed its signature 
economic development initiatives made china 
what could the next step believe both sides could continue negotiate the 
coming months specifically believe china could offer increase purchases 
manufactured goods and services cut tariffs cars and consumer goods allow wider 
market access the financial and manufacturing sectors and enhance protection 
intellectual property rights ipr return china may seek cooperation the 
following issues some which could agreed upon the final deal 
loosening the trade ban for selected chinese tech companies 
boost bilateral investment particular china may ask for more access 
the technology and construction sectors 
dropping the proposed section tariffs chinese goods 
where could china increase imports goods 
there was indication the joint statement the size the cut the trade deficit 
according bloomberg may top officials asked china reduce the deficit 
least the first round trade talks beijing two weeks ago 
our view would unrealistic for china make additional purchases 
goods two years without meaningful distortion its existing international 
trade position with other economies that would have impact more than 
china balance payments eroding its already slipping current account surplus 
gdp less disruptive approach would for china shift 
purchases goods its incremental imports has been adding more than 
imports per year but products account for less than onetenth that amount 
estimate that china could increase goods imports from the 
with rise agricultural imports the near term followed energy and then nonhigh tech manufactured goods cut beyond that amount could require relaxation 
controls high tech exports china option which the has appeared 
show little interest the current trade talks 
agriculture china agriculture imports increased led oil 
seeds grain and beef the domestic consumption upgrade trend remains 
strong see china transition high income lower tier cities bigger richer 
more eager spend may chinese consumers will probably opt for 
foreign protein rich meat and the growth demand for agriculture imports will 
likely sustained assume the incremental growth will solely focused 
goods from the could cut the china trade deficit believe 
beef could key beneficiary given that china share beef exports was 
merely and only china beef imports came from the 
exhibit meanwhile exhibit the weights cereal including corn 
wheat sorghum fruit nuts and dairy products china agriculture imports 
have also increased notably over the past decade suggesting room for further 
imports from the contrast room for further increases soybean imports 
from the could relatively small given that china already took 
annual soybean exports last year exhibit which met china import 
demand during the north american harvest season oct mar 
energy the has run trade surplus liquefied natural gas lng along with 
deficit crude oil petroleum products exhibit believe china will 
primarily increase imports lng products and lesser extent crude oil 
china total lng imports increased with only from the 
equivalent the annual increase total lng exports this means china 
could potentially increase lng imports from the exhibit while 
the amount could even larger the could resolve its logistics bottleneck 
meanwhile eia estimates that crude oil production will rise from 
given that china crude oil imports from the already increased 
and assuming similar pace increase production china 
could increase its crude oil imports from the the next years 
manufacturing china purchases this sector will hinge future china trade 
talks believe that from complementary perspective chemicals aerospace 
non electrical machinery and high tech products such communications 
equipment semiconductors measuring instruments etc have potential they are 
the key products with demonstrated comparative advantage while their export 
share china still relatively small exhibit our view could easier for 
china raise imports aerospace chemicals and non electrical machinery while 
increase imports high tech products could trickier due disputes 
china total imports aerospace chemicals and non electrical machinery 
increased while imports high tech products rose

what could reasonable time frame 
our view any trade deficit reduction likely conducted gradual pace 
avoid adverse short term impacts addition expecting that large disruptions 
global trade flows will avoided anticipate sufficiently long transition period for 
china increase imports from the mainly due time needed for capacity 
adjustments indeed our estimate potential increase chinese 
purchases implies that the aggregate production the exporting sectors should rise 
assuming the does not cut exports other trading partners this number 
would much higher for number aforementioned key sectors moreover most 
these key sectors are either capital intensive like energy and airplanes land intensive 
like agriculture which might make difficult engineer short term bump 
production 
case study japan auto trade suggests meaningful time lag between deal and 
apparent changes trade flows may the requested that japanese 
automakers sell cars through their own distribution channels and japan agreed 
set purchasing plan for foreign made auto parts the called voluntary 
plan subsequently jan the requested the purchase 
passenger cars and the revision non tariff barriers affecting types 
automobiles and auto parts which japan largely agreed however was not until 
that auto parts exports japan started increase significantly the time 
between the bilateral agreement and meaningful adjustment trade flows was around 
two years 
this context expect the final deal feature gradual increase chinese 
purchase goods and services possibly over period two three years

how would this affect china economy and policy direction 
believe the impact china would manageable 
first believe china will likely opt for non disruptive approach with gradual 
shift products its incremental imports while easing trade tensions and 
above trend global growth should remain supportive china export growth 
which could cushion the impact its current account thus maintain our 
forecast that china current account surplus will narrow modestly gdp 
and exhibit 
second believe policymakers pledge liberalize capital account could invite 
more capital inflows providing support reserves and cny indeed china 
balance payments has turned positive since due reduced capital 
outflows over the past months exhibit 
meanwhile the impact domestic industries should limited the increased 
imports will largely complementary trade for example china incremental 
imports agriculture products will likely align with its growing demand for organic 
goods amid consumption upgrades 
this context maintain our view that china gdp growth could moderate 
and dragged public and property investment amid mild policy 
tightening while continued strength net exports private consumption and private 
investment should provide partial offset see china economics mid year outlook 
slower but sustainable may 
policy implications have held the view that policy tightening has been flexible and 
countercyclical this cycle and the fine tuning over the past month has been 
preemptive move view external uncertainty rather than turn policy direction 
the china joint statement could potentially ease bilateral trade tensions 
expect manageable pace deleveraging with milder deceleration broad credit 
growth yoy year end now bringing china debt gdp near
