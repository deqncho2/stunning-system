recent stock underperformance has made valuation look 
reasonable despite tariff risk upgrading equal weight 
tariff risk more than priced are upgrading bfb equal weight 
valuation looks reasonable after significant recent stock underperformance 
following weak eps and the market pricing tariff risk our view that tariff 
risk can have sizeable impact bfb results and stock price short term with 
announced tariffs most them around one quarter bfb sales mix 
far while the tariff situation volatile this note quantify that 
current likely tariffs pose potential base case eps impact risk the 
months post implementation exhibit with greater detail the body this 
note this analysis assume tariffs are passed consumers volume 
price demand elasticity and margins lost volume the 
tariffs may temporary expect the margin impact near bfb 
level with cutbacks less likely however believe the very 
large correction bfb stock underperforming mega cap well growth 
peers nearly bps since its near peak may more than prices 
tariff risk not expect tariffs still place longer term our 
scenario analysis exhibit shows hypothetical dcf value destruction from 
tariffs depending different time frames from dcf standpoint tariffs 
these countries perpetuity have theoretical impact bfb stock 
although the real world implications are above this for the high multiple stock 
unchanged base case eps impact number countries have announced 
implemented tariffs bourbon whiskey products with tariffs the 
mexico turkey already place and canada china pending early july with

potential scenarios for investors judge the fundamental impact bfb and resulting

ntm eps impact first below illustrate the ntm eps impact potential tariffs 
across these regions based the current tariff levels outlined make number 
assumptions our analysis assume that tariffs will levied bfb wholesale 
sales given retail prices are much higher than bfb wholesale pricing with 
distributor retailer markups assume the impact retail pricing about times 
bfb wholesale price tariff would impact retail prices assume 
volume demand elasticity higher pricing line with what bfb has indicated with 
typically lower demand elasticity heightened this case lack price increases 
for most competing spirits brands from margin perspective believe impact 
close bfb corporate gross margin the range corporate gross 
margins plausible given bfb management less likely change investment 
levels for tariff impact that could short lived longer term tariffs last cuts 
would more likely based these assumptions show below estimate
