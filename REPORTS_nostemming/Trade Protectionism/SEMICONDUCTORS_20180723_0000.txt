turn yellow flag red 
our alphawise quarterly survey distributors points 
broad based growth continuing while cyclical 
conditions remain amplified tariff uncertainty represents 
potential risk demand that could lead inventory 
unwind and correction stocks 
fundamentals this quarter should but recent tariffs increase the risk 
analog mcu stock underperformance for the second half the year 
expect see solid results guidance from broad based companies this 
earnings season demand remains strong amplified some extent the 
cyclicality the semi cycle lead times have continued stretch due 
constraints especially areas such capacitors and resistors the pace 
double ordering has remained elevated have been flagging these cyclical 
risks for number quarters now but semiconductor stocks have remained 
resilient fundamental performance though decelerating from continues 
come line slightly above expectations that said the present tariffrelated uncertainty metals steel and aluminum and the china front 
imports potentially rising next month could represent the 
demand shock that leads inventory unwind the semi supply chain 
this stage the cycle think the potential further semi stock 
outperformance limited multiples remain capped and earnings upside 
more measured contrast significant beats raises saw last year the 
other hand even the slightest whiff the demand front could lead 
significant decline stocks favor companies with more defensive 
characteristics like high margins and fcf adi overweight over companies with 
more commodity exposure and lower margins underweight addition 
think connector companies tel overweight and aph equal weight will begin 
screen more attractive relative basis given less pronounced cycle 
influences compared analog mcu 
survey results suggest strong business conditions with majority 
respondents expecting growth the june quarter distribution expectations for 
analog climbed slightly with expecting growth from 
the same quarter last year mcu expectations for declined slightly with 
respondents now expecting sales down from the prior

mcus expect sequential growth and for connectors 
double ordering indications remained elevated though down slightly 
from all time highs while lead times continued stretch and constraints 
persisted the quarter these results remain counter recent messaging from 
semi companies with regard lead times and double ordering note that the 
double ordering probably most relevant narrow group components passives and specialty memories but those shortages typically lead some 
inventory build through the supply chain while the survey results should bode 
well for results outlooks they indicate heightened risk excess 
continuing build through the supply chain signs continued double ordering 
and lead time extension could elevate risks for order slowdown for 
semiconductor companies later this year early next year result 
remain selective our approach investing the group
