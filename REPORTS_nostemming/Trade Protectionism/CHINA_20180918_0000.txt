chinese goods the tariff rate will initially from september 
but will rise from january the administration has said may 
impose further tariffs additional chinese goods tariffs all 
goods imports from china china takes retaliatory measures yesterday 
china foreign ministry reportedly said that china will take necessary 
countermeasures the latest developments affirm our view that protracted 
escalatory cycle has been underway see global economics global supply chain 
impact who most exposed jul 
what the impact china gdp growth and domestic policy have held 
the view that policymakers have turned defensive easing view rising trade 
tensions and corresponding supply chain disruptions the base case tariff 
starting from next week and starting january 
chinese goods expect policymakers take more fiscal and monetary 
easing measures keep the economy the path soft landing yoy 
and that said bear case where the 
adopts universal tariff all chinese goods the cumulative drag 
growth could rise and policymakers may provide meaningful stimulus 
package partially offset the growth shock 
the tariff additional billion chinese goods starting 
next monday could drag down china growth annually based 
our simulation from the global input output model see global 
economics trade tensions chipping away growth sep the 
growth impact relatively manageable our view chinese policymakers 
will likely remain defensive easing path support modest rebound 
infrastructure investment growth from cushioning the potential 
slowdown exports and corporate capex expect broad credit growth 
rebound slightly yoy end now the back 
policy boost banks balance sheet lending faster issuance 
local government bonds and projects approvals and more flexible shadow 
banking tightening this context maintain our view slight growth

located the end this report 
that said the tariff goods starting from january could 
push the cumulative growth drag assuming the higher tariff would 
sustained this context authorities want maintain gdp growth 
more meaningful fiscal and monetary easing needed lift broad credit 
growth end the government could widen the fiscal 
deficit currently month trailing basis with tax 
cuts subsidies the corporate sector and consumers and double the issuance 
local government special bonds support infrastructure investment 
meanwhile policymakers could continue boost banks balance sheet lending 
capability and slow the pace shadow bank tightening 
should the impose universal tariff all chinese goods china growth 
could dragged down assuming policymakers would reduce 
the tariff shock growth half broad credit growth would need 
jump end with meaningful fiscal stimulus package and 
considerable monetary easing the government could widen the fiscal deficit 
gdp with more meaningful cut vat corporate tax and consumption 
tax and higher subsidy private corporates and more than double the annual 
quota local government special bonds issued boost infrastructure investment 
the monetary front policymakers may manage the pace financial clean 
efforts and adopt more measures engineer material rebound lending growth 
what could potential impact china policy while the tariff widely 
expected and thus may have limited impact currency expect the upcoming 
tariff could bring some depreciation pressures for cny amid rising downside risks 
growth and divergence and china monetary policy both cny neer and 
cnyusd have depreciated since september when public comment period 
tariffs ended but the administration signaled further tariff measures despite 
weaker trade weighted dollar depreciated the same period however 
think material one off devaluation unlikely view risks from self fulfilling 
stress outflows and financial instability 
what could china potential countermeasures china announced four proposed 
tariff lists goods imports from the august with tariff rates potential countermeasure tariff hikes chinese goods 
think the chinese government might split tariffs into two stages match the 
announced tariff measures additional tariff rate from september higher 
from january
