recent headlines have highlighted the potential for increased trade restrictions 
through factor analysis study equity reactions trade news focusing 
march through june when news surrounding possible trade restrictions 
began pick generally not find evidence widespread trade impact 
risk adjusted performance sectors and cohorts since march suggestive 
trade risk influence exhibit less trade sensitive sectors such utilities and 
real estate have outperformed whereas more trade sensitive sectors such 
industrials and materials have lagged 
these results are not definitive however since other drivers such 
flattening yield curve may contributing more compelling evidence trade 
influencing equity returns would come from detecting equity risk factor that 
correlated with returns assets known trade sensitive 
based principal components analysis pca industry returns find that 
there are key risk factors that have emerged since march that recent 
industry risks are correlated with pre march industry risks trade risk can only 
systematically affecting equities through preexisting risk factors 
constructed trade risk factor using returns trade sensitive 
currencies commodities and equity indexes from pca these trade sensitive 
assets obtained the main trade risk driver since march exhibit dollar 
strengthening and equity declines contribute positively this factor returns 
even among trade sensitive assets there has not been strong common 
driver returns since march the main risk factor explains only the risk 
indicative low correlations among the assets also these correlations have not 
strengthened compared with prior period 
not find evidence systematic trade risk equities from march 
june our trade risk factor modestly correlated with market returns likely through global equity market correlation but uncorrelated with any 
other risk factors from the industry pca

correlations with the largest equities all stocks had negative 
correlations trade risk but some stocks had much higher trade risk 
correlations than others see exhibit and exhibit respectively for screens 
our equity strategy colleagues think the lack systematic trade risk exposure 
potentially creates poor risk reward asymmetry for some sectors headed into 
earnings season contributing their recent downgrade tech underweight

executive summary 
during the recent period heightened news around actual and potential trade 
restrictions some sectors with greater trade sensitivity industrials and materials 
underperformed those with less trade sensitivity utilities and reits risk adjusted 
basis however there are other returns such for financials that not necessarily fit 
the pattern well other possible explanations such interest rate moves for the 
putative trade effects 
obtain more definitive result how trade risk has recently impacted equities 
looked for systematic risk factor equity industry returns that looked for 
evidence return series factor that distinctive from other known risks such 
equity market returns affects large number industries and related trade 
this used technique called principal components analysis the covariance 
matrix daily industry returns since march 
each principal component represents different combination industry returns 
uncorrelated from other principal components and explains part the risk the 
industries did not find any emerging new principal component the march june 
period that was not already present and least strong the pre march 
period thus there evidence new risk factor from trade any other source 
since trade headlines began pick 
trade risk can still impact existing risk factors however and test this constructed 
trade risk factor using the returns trade sensitive assets these assets include 
currencies commodities country equity indexes and yield curve slope for asian and 
australian equity markets also included returns from the day ahead well 
same day returns since these returns may influenced news out the that 
took place after they are closed for the prior day 
even among this select group assets however correlations have not generally risen 
the march june period compared with the pre march period they have not 
become more entrained with each other trade headlines became more prominent 
find single factor that best captures the movement these trade sensitive assets 
used principal components their correlation matrix the trade sensitive assets 
and focused the first principal component 
the first principal component the trade sensitive assets only explains 
correlation indicating relatively weak interrelation the asset returns this period 
can described having positive sensitivity dollar strengthening and negative 
sensitivity equity index returns when the dollar strengthens versus other currencies 
the set chose when the equity indexes decline the trade risk factor rises for 
robustness constructed similar factor that only used the out assets with 
the highest median absolute correlations each other the results from this version 
are essentially the same for the full set 
correlations between the main driver trade sensitive asset risk and principal 
components equity industry returns were low and statistically insignificant indicating 
that there equity industry risk factor that being influenced this trade risk 
factor the only exception for first principal component corresponding overall 
market risk negatively correlated with this factor but this likely due overall 
global equity risk factor rather than being specifically about trade the explanatory 
power our trade risk factor its squared low for the market trade does not 
therefore appear widespread systematic risk for equities since march 
since trade risk appears idiosyncratic for equities present looked which 
stocks among the largest market cap the had the largest and smallest 
correlations the trade risk factor constructed each the stocks the 
correlation was negative they all tend decline when trade risk rises for the mostsensitive stocks the correlation was less while for the least sensitive stocks 
was more stocks the most correlated group exhibit hail from industrial 
semiconductor industries those the least correlated group tend come from more 
domestic industries like utilities and reits exhibit 
equity strategy implications 
given the risk adjusted returns noted exhibit and the increase trade headlines 
since march the lack trade specific emerging risk factor was bit surprising and 
suggests that the more defensive sector leadership the market has seen during that 
period may due factors beyond just trade concerns tariffs live and 
companies are forced incorporate their effects into forward guidance the lack 
trade specific equity market reactions date may create downside risk for equities and 
sectors most levered trade this asymmetric downside risk one the principal 
reasons why our equity strategy team has downgraded tech underweight see 
weekly warmup they see forthcoming guidance during earnings season 
potential catalyst for the pricing fundamental risk from rising trade barriers the 
companies noted exhibit have shown some stock price sensitivity rising trade 
concerns but our strategy team downgrade predicated additional companies with 
fundamental risk not having been fully repriced for this rising risk factor 
connections developing trade risk scenarios 
our public policy team sees this analysis fitting into the ongoing trade risk picture 
trade event risk calendar should continue heavy 
events moving from threats actual action 
economic data points may come trade risk events soon they should start 
reflecting the real economic impact these actions 
see vicious cycle that could gain enough steam move this from idiosyncratic 
systemic 
exhibit stocks that are most correlated with trade sensitive assets since march are skewed 
toward industrials and semiconductor companies

identify trade risk factor that best combines effects from all these tradesensitive assets run principal components analysis pca the matrix 
correlations all the trade sensitive assets with each other due the wide range 
volatilities the assets more appropriate use the correlation matrix than the 
covariance matrix for this analysis 
pca the risk this case correlation decomposed into distinct components each 
made some combination the individual assets the first principal component 
the one that explains the largest fraction risk correlation equities this 
usually the market return factor and the weights are related equity betas 
for the trade sensitive assets the first principal component only explains risk 
correlation this fraction much smaller than what typically observed for equities 
alone and consistent with the low correlations observed for trade sensitive assets 
the first principal component has positive weights currency pairs where the direction 
each units foreign currency per dollar indicating that the trade risk factor 
tends rise when the dollar strengthens against other currencies exhibit 
addition the factor has negative weights country equity index returns trade risk 
increases correspond negative equity index returns 
commodity returns and changes yield curve slope had low weights this trade risk 
factor the latter suggesting that the flattening yield curve may not closely 
connected with trade risk also interesting that the next day return for japan equities 
has strong weight whereas the same day return for china equities has strong weight 
this indicates that the japanese equity market has primarily been reacting news 
trade whereas the chinese market has been trading more its own news rather than 
prior day trade news
