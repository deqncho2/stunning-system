geopolitical escalations risk eroding the near term 
gains fiscal expansion our economists forecast that the combined effects 
tax reform and increased government spending would boost growth 
this year however these gains risk being eroded tariffs nearly place 
china the and nafta partners example think the recent steel 
aluminum action likely set motion escalation that will result auto 
tariffs while still think each situation eventually ends with relatively benign 
trade agreement these interim escalations and disruptions could give back 
substantial portion these expected gains worse circuit breaker the 
escalatory trade cycle isn found soon another erosion possible gas 
prices remain elevated which iran related sanctions contribute taken 
together policy actions aren exerting reliably positive influence the 
economy near term which could undercut investor confidence 
the aggregate policy initiatives are not sufficient overcome our caution 
key markets equities see cyclical top forming this year the 
market starts reflecting decelerating earnings growth showing tax 
benefits are already accounted for corporate credit remain cautious and 
leverage remains elevated rates see lower year yields and flatter

now serving the vegetable course 
are policy actions helping hurting markets that the key question get from 
investors our answer they are longer helping and help needed across key 
asset classes 
reiterating our dessert before the vegetables thesis risk markets reflected 
mostly upside from the policy agenda rightfully our view the 
administration delivered tax cut driven fiscal stimulus while deferring the more 
challenging aspects its platform trade and geopolitical confrontation the former 
the debate wasn about whether tax cuts would boost growth but rather how much 
and how fleeting the impact would this was decidedly positive skew and hence 
cheap fuel for risk markets 
but now appears markets got their dessert first the uncertainties the 
administration broader agenda have moved beyond the hypothetical trade 
negotiations with nafta china and the partners are live are tariffs and 
escalatory feedback loop that may soon bring auto tariffs into scope pulling out the 
iran deal removes some oil supply supports higher gas prices and drags growth 
while none these items its own has large impact gdp they are starting 
add levels that neutralize least substantial portion the near term expected

consistent with prior guidance deleveraging does not appear popular use tax

back the view that tax reform will incentivize big wave voluntary delevering 
argued that confidence tends one the largest drivers debt growth cycle 
and have been skeptical that companies will suddenly choose behave 
conservatively and delever balance sheets environment solid growth where 
animal spirits are rising and when companies just got the largest tax cut decades 
companies will delever once they are forced through credit cycle almost 
always the case while only have one quarter the books post tax reform 
corporate behavior least far seems validate our thinking 
based preliminary results for our investment grade corporate credit universe 
note the following points 
gross leverage was roughly flat the quarter and still sits near record high 
levels the top companies which had the most offshore trapped cash which will 
refer our repatriation universe did see debt decline about the quarter 
bonds matured that were not refinanced however the rest our universe 
increased debt enough offset that total debt still rose which 
prevented leverage for the broad universe from falling and although earnings growth 
was very strong this quarter ebitda grew much smaller while still solid 
ebitda still growing slower that total debt the very least can say that 
corporate leverage remains unprecedented levels for non recessionary

tracking individual tax cuts withholding consumption supply 
key takeaways 
individuals appear over withholding thereby limiting the boost 
discretionary income from tax cuts 
this risks weaker than expected growth consumption and treasury 
supply both tailwinds usts 
while that income should return investors unclear this would 
drive reliable boost consumption for investors anchor saving 
deleveraging are also options and use that money would influenced 
the broader economic and political context the times 
data received for the first four months suggest there possibility that 
consumers have chosen over withhold their taxes given the uncertainty 
surrounding the tax cuts and jobs act federal receipts for individual income taxes 
through april have risen relative the same four month period 
rolling month basis individual federal tax receipts have risen while fiscal ytd 
receipts are 
the increase individual receipts more than offsetting the significant decline 
federal corporate tax receipts during the same periods due individual receipts 
representing about the combined figure over the last five calendar years 
during the first four months combined individual and corporate tax receipts 
rose relative the same period rolling month basis combined 
receipts have risen while fiscal tyd receipts are 
portion the greater individual tax receipts are likely due stronger 
employment stronger capital gains however the remaining increase may 
unintended consequence the uncertainty associated with the salt deduction and 
some cases the definition taxable income the state level rather than run the risk 
incurring material liability consumers may over withholding avoid any 
potential tax payment and associated penalty when filing 
the administration appears aware this development april the 
department the treasury issued statement encouraging taxpayers check their 
withholding amount the release specifically urged taxpayers visit the irs 
withholding calculator determine how many withholding allowances claim the 
purpose the paycheck checkup was allow employees keep more their hard 
earned money 
believe there are three potentially important themes that could impact markets 
should tax receipt data continue exceed expectations due individual overwithholding 
the potential for smaller increase treasury supply should tax receipts 
continue exceed expectations believe that the treasury would most likely 
respond via reduction total bill issuance 
weaker consumption discretionary spending the consumers most likely 
impacted the decision over withhold are concentrated higher income 
brackets given the greater uncertainty associated with the salt deduction and 
some cases the definition taxable income the state level historically higherincome consumers drive greater proportion overall consumption purposeful 
reduction consumer after tax take home pay among higher income consumers 
may result stable declining big ticket purchases well overall levels 
consumption there may some evidence that this already playing out given 
that auto sales and existing home sales are flat negative the first four months 
relative the same periods any reduction growth relative 
elevated expectations has the potential catch both the federal reserve and the 
forecaster community off guard 
the potential but guarantee payback implications for are less 
clear the conventional thinking would that some the expected consumption 
and increase treasury supply gets pushed into the tax legislation 
better understood and consumers become more comfortable withholding the 
lower rates however even consumers did withhold and avoided tax 
liability are line for tax rebate it not entirely clear whether they will 
choose consume save deleverage some combination the above the 
evolution the and global economy and any changes the political landscape 
following the mid term elections will likely impact those consumer decisions

impact for the treasury market 
the need for less treasury supply the near term even were occur primarily 
treasury bills could offset portion the concerns markets that the tax cuts would 
result substantially larger near term deficits the same time any material 
disappointment growth relative elevated market and federal reserve expectations 
could result full year growth estimates being downgraded the year progresses 
lower growth estimates may undermine the fed confidence that inflation will remain 
above its target over the medium term potentially challenging the fed 
anticipated hiking path and beyond 
believe that portion the underperformance treasury securities has 
been due the following two views late cycle tax cut stimulus fiscal stimulus will 
result growth that will overshoot expectations thereby increasing inflation and 
increased treasury supply will require greater price concessions however any change 
circumstance that challenges either these narratives should positive for the 
medium term outlook for treasuries line with the team current expectation 
more favorable backdrop for duration between now and the end 
tracking trade stepping the escalator 
key takeaways 
expect that trade policy actions will ultimately preserve something 
close the status quo but first induce substantial uncertainty and erode the 
growth uplift from fiscal policy 
steel aluminum tariff waivers have expired reaction and counterreaction autos appear next which elevate risks while negotiated 
agreement quotas with limited economic impact worked 
steel aluminum actions nafta partners also underscore our view that 
deal appears beyond reach though still don see withdrawal 
the status with china remains uncertain with key questions unanswered and 
potential escalations lingering 
you been paying attention the public statements officials negotiating 
trade the past few weeks you forgiven for thinking gone from conflict 
peace and back again this spring saw many escalatory statements from the 
administration followed conciliatory ones recent weeks and finally back 
escalatory the administration announcement was proceeding with preparations 
for section tariffs 
rather than get caught the rhetoric prefer observing the pattern behavior 
this reveals steady escalation trade tension offsets the uplift growth from fiscal 
policy albeit temporarily escalation remains the most likely outcome our view 
across current trade conflicts 
looking for circuit breaker with the section steel aluminum 
tariffs set kick does escalation toward auto tariffs the has already 
announced its intention respond the action with tariffs variety 
products the had previously signaled would then respond with foreign auto 
import tariffs given the announcement last week that the president instructed 
commerce secretary ross begin the process auto tariffs under section 
think investors should place serious probability the implementation those 
tariffs these likely carry more substantial impact than steel actions about 
gdp growth the for example see what the ripple effect march 
while not clear precisely how this escalatory cycle will broken 
anticipate deal with quotas could represent temporary break 
china cease fire not peace treaty interpreted the joint communication 
between the and china agreement for deficit reduction through increased 
chinese purchases agricultural and energy products just one step forward 
long process that caution appears warranted the continued preparations 
implement section tariffs june eliciting response from china claiming 
the had gone back its word course trade deal with china was far from 
completed even before section was brought back into scope particular given 
that agricultural and energy purchases appeared our view fall short the 
billion deficit reduction demands while the tariff threat could part 
negotiating tactics ahead more planned talks think investors should make 
their imposition part their base case should those talks fail produce 
substantial progress hence even while still see eventual escalation 
the likely outcome interim growth headwinds for both the and china economies 
possible 
nafta delayed gratification our nafta navigator argued that 
resolution was unlikely this case has been reinforced items that further 
tighten already narrow window for execution the passage time 
without reported negotiation progress the imposition steel and aluminum 
tariffs mexico canada which should further complicate the process hence

trade deficit cause solution trade escalation 
despite these escalations why continue argue negotiated relatively 
moderate outcomes are more likely than smoot hawley like outcome because 
see opportunity for negotiation the metric that the appears care 
most about bilateral trade deficits 
for example key goal the current administration escalating trade 
tensions with china was address its bilateral trade deficit many investors have 
expressed confusion about this point justifiably arguing that this metric 
alone doesn intrinsically mean unfair relationship exists rather they argue 
more likely just describes the nature the china economic relationship one 
where export oriented china needs access markets much 
consumers need china lower cost goods but maintain that this the key 
question for investors will negotiated settlement avoid trade war with china 
our view has been and continues yes 
the key reason knowing the focus the trade deficit may misplaced 
explains both the cause and potential solution the problem that because 
china can hypothetically singularly focus deficit reduction measures without 
materially disrupting its economic structure the short term more centralized 
economy possible direct and ramp specific purchases exports 
hence recent news highlighting china focus meeting the us deficit reduction 
targets both not surprising and affirms our view that trade conflict with china 
will limited duration and economic impact 
tracking geopolitics the drag from iran 
there much broader debate about the potential drawbacks and benefits the 
withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal yet one concrete takeaway for investors our 
view this helps keeps gas prices elevated the near term paraphrase our 
economics team that eats into the tax cut benefit the near term 
the basic mechanics are follows with the out the deal policy would revert 
promptly sanctioning companies and countries who buy oil from iran the could 
carve out allowances and some countries who are less reliant the financial 
system could largely ignore the sanctions and purchase iranian oil anyway but 
any case there likely for meaningful portion oil consumers less supply 
choose from while can precisely quantify that our oil and energy research team 
notes that even small impact should help support prices current levels despite 
nearly oil appreciation ytd given very low global inventories 
this translates higher gas prices year over year about cents higher holding that 
constant our economists expect consumers will have redirect about 
purchases toward gasoline this roughly the benefit individuals from lower 
withholding from tax cuts about per the join committee taxation
