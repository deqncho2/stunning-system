china overweight steel cement underweight copper expect the supply 
impact for steel and cement from environmental controls will help support 
prices high levels due the larger area impacted under china new pollution control plan believe steel and cement company earnings are 
less cyclical and more sustainable than the market thinks due supply 
discipline copper likely used macro play saw past cycles 
our current top picks are baosteel and shares both angang and 
anhui conch key picks are jiangxi copper shares and zijin shares 
downgraded 
australia overweight coal mineral sands and individual stock opportunities 
underweight nickel mineral resources with expansion strategy lithium 
key pick despite our negative view lithium largely due valuation 
support see here other calls include iluka driven mineral sands being 
late cycle commodity where expect further pricing tailwinds whitehaven coal 
still shows valuation support and catalysts approaching our key western 
areas the nickel space driven downside risk the nickel price see here 
and lack valuation support 
japan overweight steel oil mitsubishi materials stock risk off 
market our investment preference for steel oil over nonferrous stocks 
themes steel sector are production recovery from operational problems 
and metal spread improvement within the nonferrous industry mitsubishi 
materials has the highest exposure copper with sensitivity 
cents copper price change the company copper price assumption for 
which calculating from the current spot price 
implies negative impact roughly total 
india selective buyers the ferrous side are jspl given 
volume cagr led capacity ramp and strong domestic demand are 
relative sail given its rich valuation and high leverage

march november tangshan will need cut back production 
while handan will cut back addition tangshan and handan recently 
announced output cuts local blast furnaces over july august 
and over july september bid meet their annual air pollution 
control target estimate steel production was already near the maximum level 
june from the current high utilization rate via the use more scrap and high grade iron 
ore and expect decline july from the environmental measures

impact shantytown redevelopment policy changes for steel and cement per 
century news group june the china development bank cdb tightening 
funding for shantytown redevelopments since the chinese government shantytown 
redevelopment target units intact per cdb our property team expects 
little impact new starts and property investment see their recent note residential 
property accounts for steel and cement demand assume 
decrease property new starts would only see limited impact steel

upside risk the government allows looser liquidity than before cushion the 
potential impact from trade tensions expect building materials industries such 
steel and cement benefit our economics team expects china shift its policy stance 
from tightening bias neutral the face increased trade tensions policymakers 
could adopt reserve requirement ratio rrr cuts open market injections higher loan

our top picks 
baosteel 
unlike construction steel such rebar section steel baosteel flat product 
not directly affected construction activity baosteel downstream markets 
are autos appliances and electrical equipment which are more related 
consumer demand and more sustainable the long term believe 
baosteel employee stock incentive plan which includes management 
employees implies that the company 
incentivized have high profitability key kpis high dividends and high equity 
price over the period the wisco consolidation should start 
improve wisco profitability the company has good dividend policy with 
payout 
angang 
angang similar baosteel leading flat steel product producer angang 
located outside the winter cuts zone and can benefit from both volume and 
price increases 
anhui conch 
see earnings upside from rising prices eastern and southern china 
management guided during result briefing that plans more 
have future growth china has restricted new cement capacity the company 
has good dividend policy with payout

japan steel industry focus points 
investment scenario themes are production recovery from operational 
problems and metal spread improvement stock specific factors will become 
increasingly important onward once fundamentals have recovered believe 
blast furnaces faced various issues operations weather conditions that 
depressed production and earnings despite the solid demand environment the two 
blast furnaces nssm jfe beside kobe steel which suspended one blast furnace unit 
expect volume growth but think the market would need see the 
impact production growth materializing quarterly earnings before expectations can 
improve nssm guidance for due out results will key gauging the 
firm views 
terms steel material asp the approx ton increase since has 
mainly been improvements export prices with domestic prices likely rising only 
ton estimate the cost increase for key steel raw materials the 
same period and considering also the rise secondary raw 
materials improvements the metal spread still have long way attribute 
this situation chiefly the pricing structure which not based supply demand but 
rather system reflecting fluctuations raw materials prices which has caused 
time lag steel material price hikes the negative impact tight supplies price talks 
within the framework business practices with japanese clients while expect 
costs tied the key steel raw materials fall ton 
the inevitable increase other costs means whether the firms can keep steel material 
prices for flat yoy levels minimum during price talks with the autos 
industry bears watching outcomes likely late august cases where further 
recovery the metal spread likely earnings expectations should turn sharply 
mitsubishi material mitsubishi materials has the highest exposure copper with 
sensitivity cents copper price change the company copper price 
assumption for which calculating from the current spot price 
implies negative impact roughly total the more 
flexible stance than evident date involving more aggressive expansion the business 
portfolio and particular focus the downstream strategy positive but remains 
the case that earnings expectations hinge heavily macroeconomic trends 
top that given added concerns about growth the fixed cost burden due 
forward investment expect earnings expectation will not improve also need

firm flat steel prices are now broadly par the import parity price the historical 
average premium which further supports our price outlook expect long
