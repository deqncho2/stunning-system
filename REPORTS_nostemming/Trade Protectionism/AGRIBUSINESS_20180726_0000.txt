china trade dispute has favored brazil prices since april soybeans 
chicago have fallen decline south america cotton spreads have 
also increased and the same period and slc shares have rallied 
one the few pure plays the most affected agri commodities 
back basics supply demand dictate prices and chicago will recover china 
will need producers remain profitable and maintain the global balance 
this means prices least above other regions can sell premium 
forecast recovery least also supported lower global 
inventories after the drought argentina and higher brent 
but south american premium unsustainable believe current 
excessive rearrangements global trade should reduce the bargaining 
power local producers estimate disputes are far from over 
and think early assume china fees will remain the long term trade 
news supported slc and reversion could drive the opposite way 
downgrading slc from agri risky business depends 
weather global politics and commodities historically farmers trade 
discount nav but slc premium after rally since when sold land and announced extra dividends trading nav would 
already recognize that slc better company but valuation has overshot 
fundamentals our new from assumes valuation 
normalizes higher level than before but still see downside 
remain agro farming ebitda but valuation given 
the amount land argentina our based asset quality and 
nav discount historically could change with dairy acquisition higher 
land liquidity necessary before grains become key driver but ethanol energy 
results brazil are the key catalyst raising from 
remain remain positive tailwinds from the replacement 
cycle even commodity recovery with potential upside farmer 
sentiment from the recently announced farm aid package and

point producers will make long term investment decisions based current policies 
shorter term investments can made american producers are able switch 
alternative cultures that are less exposed china such corn still think the 
current uncertain environment and commodity prices not incentivize the opening

continue depend imports and the discount chicago south america

higher freight costs impact production costs

the country especially fuel the government agreed with the truckers union 
cut diesel prices subsidized the government and the definition minimum 
freight table 
extent the increase unknown general expected that new rates will increase 
freight costs however the definition minimum freight prices raises legal 
issues and the supreme court expected rule the end august the lack 
visibility what freight costs will has partly suspended the commercialization and 
freight services currently inventories are increasing the farms soybeans are not 
delivered and the harvest the second corn crop evolves order maintain activity 
some cargo reportedly being transported old freight prices some reports say that 
cargo 
bad for agri companies this not only affects the transportation cost commodities 
but also make inputs more expansive and can cause delays planting fertilizers are 
being stocked ports moreover the situation has also prevented brazilian 
producers from monetizing the large premiums future negotiations 
are halt slc sells soybeans the farm gate and this point estimate

cotton and corn slc books freight costs under selling expenses 
soybean outlook for

round tariffs went into effect july this has largely not been surprise and 
investors typically associate agco the preferred way play relative strength
