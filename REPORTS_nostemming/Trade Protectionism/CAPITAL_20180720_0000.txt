beat and late cycle names hold better than short cycle names 
tariffs emerging theme calls initial comments the impact 
tariffs implemented july affecting products are mixed the 
whole impacts are still towards the modest end the scale though there 
are concerns around potentially more significant impact the additional 
under consideration comes through the relatively unaffected names 
grainger has passed price increases offset tariff related supplier 
inflation kone expects limited impacts iii volvo also offset tariff cost 
increases through price and skf cited price increases through the value chain 
compensate the negative impacts abb saw headwinds from import risks 
electrical steel from japan korea the and exposure where product 
trafficking isn covered natural hedging alfa laval noted some impact 
profitability the full implementation tariffs moves forward iii danaher 
highlighted the sum number small impacts across all the businesses 
dover cited tariff headwinds for electrolux noted the potential next 
round tariffs not its current outlook but was risk and while fastenal 
not overly concerned about the direct impact from current tariffs bigger 
issue potential headwinds from additional measures 
the industrial cycle growth good and most management teams remain 
confident growth clear positive with sandvik skf and abb 
base orders the majority commentary the industrial cycle bullish 
with alfa laval calling out good underlying growth base orders and good 
development the business cycle fastenal saw the highest growth rates 
far this cycle iii grainger sees sign slowdown skf has seen 
prolonged period growth with growth tough comps uri 
remains confident the cycle and sees legs left the cycle net net there has 
been clear skew strong growth prints and positive outlook

positive comments 
grainger not covered have been able pass through price increases did see 
some supplier inflation the quarter partially due tariffs and able pass 
through price while maintaining market competitiveness 
kone not big impact most the business service first say that have 
remember that the majority our business the particular maintenance 
installation activities clear that there will some impact and that there some 
impact from tariffs don expect that material but some impact 
volvo covered harald hendrikse been able offset raw mat tariff cost 
increases through price action with suppliers and customers raw materials continue 
increase price and cost for like last year managed compensate that little bit 
more with commercial negotiations with suppliers this year also managed offset the 
balance lot hard work being done internally offset cost increases from raw 
material tariffs and have work with the price realization well cannot 
sit still squeezed between that have work both sides the equation and that 
what 
skf little spare capacity the price increases will pushed through the value 
chain too early say exactly how this would play out but the means for many 
the customers not that there enormous capacity waiting take the slack from 
price increases you would get from china many cases these are being pushed 
through the value chain and you seeing higher possibility the market where actually 
prices are going long term how much this will redirected too early say 
many these products are for the particular markets not always finished products 
talking about components about steel the steel market big market and for 
still too early say what kind effect this will 
neutral comments 
assa abloy currently trying pass price increases see further increase for 
material prices mainly the steel side and mainly the now also with the import 
tariffs kicking from europe versus you will see important further increase 
material prices still the but speak are also further increasing prices 
wabco covered courtney yakavonis don know the impact yet not position 
exactly understand the impact from tariffs and know what product will affected 
don buy raw material ourselves buy through our supply chain and don know 
where our suppliers are sourcing material from what more complex for the current 
negotiation between the and china what products would have pay duty enter 
china from the vice versa because export quite bit products from china 
the the form abs products vacuum pumps and what good with 
though that you know are only assemblers doesn take huge amount 
time for build new assembly line for abs but not new location but also 
investment disturbance that can avoid would right now are kind waiting 
see exactly what going happen and anything happens whether will affect those 
products not for the moment don see 
negative comments 
abb import risks around steel from japan and korea into the buy materials all 
around the globe within raw materials speciality steel and electric steel are key 
differentiating elements our motors and transformers abb has the highest level energy 
efficiency any competitor and one driver the use very sophisticated electric and steel 
grades these are only produced couple suppliers around the world japan and 
korea need make sure have access that and very clear these steels are 
hit with import tariff our operating activities for example this would have 
tightening effect 
abb built natural hedging but still exposed some trafficking products ship 
around the world have global supply chain have gone long way build 
natural hedging position where sell but still have some traffic products going 
around the world and that might impacted now the mitigating situation for couple 
quarters have specific task force that works the impact the tariff made 
our government relations people our supply chain people really their toes helping 
navigate and understand first what are really facing and then have whole 
scenario set mitigating actions ranging from natural hedging switching from raw 
material ready made product import that have abb prepared navigate these 
waters but very clear the current uncertainties keep busy 
alfa laval some impact profitability have significant flows going between the 
china europe all directions and the full implementation tariffs step step 
step moves forward there will some impact our profitability however also 
work with the assumption that have opportunities both terms how direct our 
internal flows goods within the company and our opportunities for pricing towards end 
market but certainly should some effects come from the tariffs the future will 
have opportunities mitigate that this point time don judge the tariff 
major issue for how our margins will develop the coming quarters 
danaher covered steve beuchaw tariffs will have impact eps 
tariffs sort the early days don feel that the crosshairs what 
they really going after there one business danaher that has significant impact 
but bunch little impacts across all the businesses and that adds that roughly 
sort quarter impact really thinking about countermeasures four ways 
price thinking about supply chain changes iii thinking about modification our 
manufacturing location because getting hit tariffs both ways into china 
china into the and there are opportunities seek exemptions around certain areas 
around the tariffs they actually just outlined the process that think between 
those four categories including price will take couple quarters think able 
bring that number down think the broader question does have larger impact 
the macro environment and that that more that outside the realm specialty 
dover covered sawyer rice raw mat headwind for which partially 
the result tariffs the industrial platform performance was more mixed they are 
more subjected material costs and tariff issues the raw mats headwind mixed 
number which got tariff there and got price escalation 
electrolux impact from first wave tariffs unsure second wave start 
with the section tariffs which mainly impacted our steel and aluminum that 
captured our raw material outlook for the year the section tariffs that came into 
force here beginning july will affect our net cost efficiency for this year what 
currently place the range for the rest this year the most recent 
list not yet confirmed not yet place little bit difficult 
accurately assess what the impact talking about potential tariffs wide 
range components and products expect the impact this year goes into effect 
relatively limited but and that not fully included our current outlook have 
say because don really know exactly what going happen yet 
fastenal cogs from china may able shift some taiwan vietnam 
relates the and this point just beating inflation generally 
speaking with regards that one relates and think there couple 
threads here one the first that has been talked about there not huge impact 
now that had chance kind see how our products are being affected 
will probably stick with about cogs perhaps being affected that although 
places haven necessarily expected sort indirect shipments things like ball 
bearings and welding consumables and things like that but pretty small number 
don think particularly meaningful and stops there not overly concerned about 
the direct impact tariffs think the question you really getting what happens 
with the other should they into effect and honestly this point not 
sure mean hard speculate that you can make case that cogs may 
come from china directly and indirectly but only guessing the indirect piece again 
that more art than science figuring that one out don assume that everything that 
get from china will tariffed that would pull the number down the impact down and 
course would expect able shift product perhaps from china taiwan 
vietnam other sources 
industrial cycle company comment tracker 
alfa cycle still positive the reason why talk about the base business projects 
come and without any necessarily linked individual cycles changes the 
market order get some sense the underlying pace and demand development 
think the base business helps judge where things are heading and that why talk 
about this quarter saw develop well and basically drives the conclusion 
that the business cycle least this quarter has been good one and thought 
was particularly interesting given the non repeat situation food water 
business indicator for was positive 
fastenal highest growth rates the cycle far highest growth rates have seen 
yet this cycle though worth noting that fasteners june grew which the 
fastest rate seen this cycle 
grainger signs slowdown well through the quarter haven seen any signs 
slowdown this point 
skf feel cycle plateaued growth mode have seen strong growth for 
prolonged period now the business cycle curve which can rename the plateau 
now last year grew for the full year which equaled was equally distributed 
over the quarters that first half year have grown and this second quarter 
you heard which course very pleasing also knowing that have significantly 
higher comparison values this year the daily effect just minor the quarter have 
half day more you would comparison last year 
uri covered courtney yakavonis still confident cycle today the news about 
our strong financial results our continued confidence the cycle and our many avenues 
for profitable growth still feel really good about the end market and you can see 
through all our actions feel that this that have legs left this cycle and 
excited about that 
wabco healthy growth out europe and lot factors point towards the 
continuously nice growing region right now pretty solid path europe not used 
very strong cycles with incredible upside gdp growth but are very healthy 
which has been rich progressively the average age the fleet still pretty high one 
year above the historical average for would say there are still lot factors that 
point towards the continuously nice growing region there however all know that 
someone just said times are pretty uncertain would say even strange sometimes and 
nobody knows exactly what ahead europe and the world particularly related those 
barriers trade barriers that could established that would obviously all know
