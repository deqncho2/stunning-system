europe plans impose tariffs whiskey have led 
investor questions the sensitivity european spirits 
companies hypothetical response acknowledging the 
difficulty predicting how trade issues will ultimately pan 
out set out framework for european stock exposure 
henry 
sensitivity how hypothetical tariffs could affect spirits imports from 
following tariffs aluminum and steel imposed the the has said 
plans put import tariffs some products this includes whiskey 
but excludes beer and wine investor feedback has focused the potential 
risk response spirits imports into the the biggest spirits market 
value this something have view though morgan stanley 
strategists have recently covered trade issues here that said are able 
provide sensitivity analysis the european spirits stocks individual exposure 
the and the potential impact purely illustrative tariff scenario 
point out that imported spirits tend more premium and have lower price 
sensitivity than average emphasize the many moving parts here this report 
should seen merely mathematical exercise and the sensitivities not 
inform our stock risk reward profiles 
who the most exposed the 
the accounts for and diageo and pernod sales respectively 
diageo more exposed the than pernod but also has more locally 
produced brands net exposure products only sales 
for pernod estimate that the its portfolio that comes from the 
could affected mainly jameson ireland and absolut sweden remy and 
hennessy the mostly import their brands from france while campari 
exposure the imported brands from the are limited only 
its portfolio 
pernod could see the biggest headwind tariffs only affect imports 
line with the prior analysis our colleague brown forman exposure 
proposed tariffs hypothetically assuming import tariffs spirits 
and price elasticity would imply cuts group eps for diageo and for 
pernod our sensitivity analysis page varies the price elasticity other factors 
include scope move production bottling operations soil but spirits 
with many appellations like cognac scotch tequila have strict specifications

what could done mitigate potential impact aside from increasing prices 
apply the wto the world trade organisation supported the and the has 
previously fought many cases where imported spirits faced higher taxes than domestic 
products wto cases have typically taken some time resolve 
build inventories brown forman assuming that tariffs will hit its exports europe 
and has built inventories its own distribution market while spirits can kept under 
good conditions for long time warehouse this only temporary solution which 
could mitigate the impact for one two quarters maximum our view but presents 
some risks brown forman covered dara mohsenian see his latest report 
here 
move production bottling when allowed law moving local production has 
been done for many mainstream spirits products smirnoff produced locally the 
and the same for many liqueurs like malibu kahlua however the brand equity 
many premium spirits partly relies them being viewed superior imported products 
nothing would prevent diageo pernod from moving production ciroc ketel one 
absolut the but there the risk this could viewed negatively consumers 
and affect the brand equity alternative would perform the final stage 
production locally which bottling thereby creating jobs and limiting the impact 
potential tariffs 
local bottling not always possible however products specific origin 
appellation such cognac scotch and tequila have bottled and labeled 
france scotland and mexico respectively irish whiskey could bottled outside 
ireland being shipped bulk containers and still called irish whiskey the 
value irish whiskey exports sold the 
spirits and tariffs what has been said far 
this situation evolving and tariffs have not been 
implemented yet provide below some background 
information tariffs developments the spirits sector 
june the european commission confirmed would introduce tariffs 
about billion worth goods the tariff american whiskey 
could imposed early june latest statement here 
ulrich adam director general trade group spirits europe told the spirits 
business the and spirits sectors are closely intertwined appreciate the 
commission efforts normalise relations and secure positive 
outcome however regret that this has not materialised for now today can 
only take note the decision and hope there will further escalation 
tensions here 
june mexico imposed tariff bourbon while canada has proposed 
tariff which may imposed july turkey has proposed tariff 
all distilled spirits which set come into force june china has 
announced plans for tariff whiskey 
illustration how potential tariffs could work and hypothetical 
sensitivity eps 
potential import tariff would not mean that retail prices would 
bottle various taxes federal states local excise already account for and 
potential tariffs would the manufacturer price excluding transportation costs and 
the wholesaler retailer margins there would lot moving parts but given 
that this theoretical exercise and can draw concrete conclusions try 
simplify applying the tariffs our company net sales the 
the tariff situation remains fluid this analysis theoretically assume demand 
elasticity practice this would likely less our view since premium 
spirits contribution margin using the same assumptions for the three 
companies and tariffs each company respective exposure european union 
spirits imports into the this table only assume tariffs will imposed 
spirits and not tequila canadian whisky for instance but the principle would stay 
the same 
our sensitivity shows the potential tariffs could and headwinds diageo 
campari and pernod group eps respectively using demand elasticity price

flexibility production bottling than other categories like scotch think diageo
