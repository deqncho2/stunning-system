safeguard measures lend 
helping hand 
with details safeguard measures released the european 
steel market set tighten across most products thus 
providing much needed relief for european margins 
arcelormittal outokumpu favoured plays this dynamic 
severstal most exposed among russian producers 
provisional safeguard measures take effect tomorrow the european 
commission published the details provisional safeguard measures that will 
take effect starting thursday july summary measures include 
global tariff quota with quota based average imports over the past 
years product categories including both carbon and stainless steel finished 
products imports exceeding the above quotas would face tariff 
some exceptions exemptions but overall impact material expected 
based the published documents the commission will target product 
categories covering most finished products those measures appear exclude 
semi finished products such slabs moreover certain developing countries 
with share imports will exempt quotas will calculated 
first come first served basis and tariffs will kick when quotas are met 
countries whose products would most impacted include brazil china india 
turkey russia ukraine and vietnam 
market tightening ahead arcelormittal top pick among carbon steel producers 
based our initial calculation ytd steel imports across all categories and 
without taking into consideration any exemptions are annualizing above 
the prior year average see exhibit this the context total market size 
finished steel apparent consumption this means theory 
that the physical market set tighten from this point onwards this turn 
should help stabilize not improve steel spreads and benefit carbon 
steelmakers arcelormittal remains our top pick across our coverage universe 
trading ebitda and spot prices 
russian steel overall minimal impact severstal most exposed nlmk remains 
top pick estimate that severstal sold steel into europe 
not know the split finished semi finished products but the figure 
was hot rolled products this therefore our best guess the 
exposed portion for the company however even paying tariff 
those volumes would mean ebitda impact spot ebitda 
less than and reality would far less importantly appears that 
semi finished products are exempt from these measures for nlmk and evraz 
see minimal impact nlmk sold into europe which almost all 
its slab its belgian nbh and danish dansteel facility evraz sold into

pick with flexible access market and attractive valuation fcf yield 
outokumpu most levered stainless although slabs imports from indonesia 
remain risk based the data stainless steel imports need drop 
from levels experienced during not taking into account exemptions see 
exhibit and this would provide meaningful support profitability the

however may challenge reach the upper end that range 
because there appears restrictions the import slabs the latter 
leaves opening for tsingshan operations indonesia capacity
