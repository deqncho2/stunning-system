tariffs against might pull 
down flat rolled volumes 
about steel product exports canada and 
mexico imports exports steel decline due 
section and subsequent international response think 
flat rolled and stainless volumes may negatively 
impacted but longs and pipe tube may benefit 
canadian and mexican tariffs the may have larger effect steel 
export volumes canada mexico and the recently announced their intention 
set reciprocal tariffs exports products including steel response 
the government decision exclude the countries from its section 
tariff exemptions reciprocal tariffs can mex could significantly lower steel 
exports from the since the vast majority exports steel typically goes 
these two countries for context the exported million short 
ton mst steel mill products those mst went canada and 
mst went mexico 
than vice versa since canada and mexico could theoretically buy cheaper 
tariff free steel from the global market the balance steel trade between the 
and can mex relatively even the imported mst steel 
incl semi finished mst exports can mex however tariffs are 
added both sides the market might head towards new equilibrium since 
steel import flows from can mex are likely continue given the attractive 
import spreads the other hand exports these countries are likely 
affected since can mex can turn other sources 
stress testing the balance understand possible outcomes stress tested 
the market supply demand balance for different levels reductions 
exports and imports compared levels assume that apparent demand 
will grow yoy then add scenarios with varying assumptions for yoy 
reductions imports the outcome section and exports the result 
retaliatory tariffs from can mex and assume that production will adjust 
solve for the balance for description the assumptions each scenario 
and detailed outcomes see exhibit the only accounted for 
steel exports left out the analysis 
flat rolled and stainless volumes may negatively impacted but longs and 
pipe tube could see volume benefits most scenarios production flat 
rolled steel may decline see exhibit given the fairly high ratio exports 
imports ratio see exhibit but long products may benefit pipe tube 
due heavy reliance imports and limited exports may outsized 
beneficiary and conversely stainless relatively small mst category may see 
some volume erosion

these mutual duties are suspended may not help exports much the 
section tariffs stay place for all other countries and domestic prices 
relatively high can mex may continue look for cheaper international steel 
order reduce their exposure 
only stress testing and not forecasting since there are some shortcomings 
this framework importantly this framework mainly illustrative since does 
not embed actual ytd net imports from can mex some scenarios 
assume that exports fall zero which fairly aggressive our view more 
likely that some exports will remain due integrated supply chains etc 
within each scenario assume that imports all steel products regardless 
shape and end use fall the same amount which simplifying assumption 
additionally assume that net supply semi finished isn affected 
either imports continue under quota tariff regime domestic capacity ramp 
offsets any quota limitation
