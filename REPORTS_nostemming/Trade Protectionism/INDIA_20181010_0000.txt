expect ongoing trade protectionist measures have 
limited direct impact india interest think india could 
leverage its position and gain export market share 
improving the competitiveness domestic manufacturing 
trade protectionist measures have increased frequency with the latest round 
action the imposing tariff chinese imports there 
increased concern about the possible impact trade tension global growth 
and india growth trajectory indeed exports goods services account for 
gdp and have important bearing the overall growth outlook 
india runs the ninth largest trade surplus with the but its exports center 
commodity traditional sectors india trade surplus with stands 
whereas china moreover the composition 
imports shows that those from india are mainly the commodity category 
traditional industries marine products precious stones textiles 
near term impact india stem from the indirect channel slower global 
growth our view the likelihood direct impact india through targeted 
trade measures low the impact likely stem from the indirect channel 
global growth slows response increasing trade protectionist measures our 
global team believes that the starting point strong global growth provides 
cushion however they believe that implementation import tariffs will chip 
away growth and trigger policy response estimate impact 
india gdp growth trade protectionist measures intensify 
trade tension could create opportunity think the current environment 
can provide opportunity for india attract based companies that are 
looking diversify production base away from china and maintain 
competitiveness against the dual headwinds higher unit labour costs and 
increased risks trade protectionist measures from the our analysis shows 
revealed comparative advantage rca for india segments such exports 
precious stones marine products chemicals and mineral fuels wherein 
could leverage its position and gain market share further the correction the 
real effective exchange rate will also aid improving the competitiveness 
indian exports 
but benefits will depend other factors such scale infrastructure 
support believe that harnessing the full potential any such substitution 
and increasing market share sustained basis will ultimately depend 
enabling factors such scale and efficiency infrastructure and removal 
domestic bottlenecks

yes products india has higher rca and china has been targeted recent tariff round likely products where either india has higher rca but 
lower share imports than china india has similar rca and product targeted recent tariff round 
rupee depreciation aid export competitiveness but medium term issues need 
addressed too believe the recent depreciation the currency cpi adjusted
