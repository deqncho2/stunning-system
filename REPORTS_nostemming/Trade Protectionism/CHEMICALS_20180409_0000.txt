contract tariff 
thoughts 
the march contract price settled flat with the 
increase pushed april this was inline with ihs expectations 
more sentiment than consensus eps issue after further 
review reiterate that any tariff unlikely 
materially impact markets and producer margins 
with the march contract settling flat versus the nominated price 
increase polyethylene prices have now likely peaked for and the long 
awaited down cycle should begin the coming months expect the next 
couple months contract negotiations similar nature ask for 
increase but ultimately hope expect settle flat for long you can 
ultimately expect the combination new capacity from chem exxon 
and indorama exceed demand growth and lead modest price declines 
from today average contract price the end the year recall prices were forecast end believe that the equity 
market prices far worse outcome and think the risk reward attractive 
take the over this course the above likely influenced either 
direction the pace ramp the new assets the operating rates 
existing assets what level unplanned outages will have spreads with 
asian markets 
believe that the overall debate likely settled once and for 
all early the third quarter but likely later than the fourth quarter 
particular believe that investors will focus the second derivative 
sequential monthly contract price changes and the bottom will likely called 
any price declines begin decelerate and ultimately flatten out remain 
the view that upcycle will begin soon and could continue for 
multiple years the absence economic slowdown there limited new 
capacity coming online after very little new project activity proceeded 
from once oil prices declined and existing projects began announce 
material capex overruns and timing delays the major increase nitrogen 
valuations once prices bottomed out interesting predicate for what could 
happen once the bottom called though such multiple expansion not our 
base case for any number reasons 
potential chinese tariff unlikely have material impact china proposed 
retaliatory tariff includes certain grades polyethylene but focuses 
mostly ldpe non commodity grades lldpe and does not include hdpe 
china substantial importer all three grades but hdpe and lldpe remain 
particularly tight from global perspective present surprise china 
not targeting these grades importantly there not much incremental ldpe

capacity coming the until the end when just over million will 
likely have come online from dow formosa and sasol should tariff actually 
through would expect china minimize purchases the impacted 
grades from the and purchase them instead from middle east producers 
some which could jvs which turn will lead greater exports 
south east asia where the redirected middle eastern product would have 
gone originally there could some friction initially trade flows rebalance 
ihs markit estimates that total chinese imports were 
million about the total exported from the the majority 
chinese imports from the have been hdpe ldpe exports represented 
total exports china importantly the impacted trade codes 
discussed below represent about one fourth the exported china 
particular china has attached proposed tariff codes 
and generally ldpe products china 
imported these products from the refers 
specialty grade lldpe china imported these products 
from the are polyolefin elastomer and polyolefin plastomer 
products which are non commodity grades polyethylene china 
imported these products from the

cracker remains offline for planned maintenance work that expected last
