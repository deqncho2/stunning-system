trade tariffs most and least 
vulnerable asia tech stocks 
the announced plans impose tariffs 
goods from china presents risk the technology sector 
asia and could lead higher production costs higher prices 
for finished products and market share shifts assess 
potential pressure points from this development 
section implementation risk technology multiples and earnings 
asia china turn has announced its intention impose tariffs 
imports which seem less proportionate the context its total exports 
the implying measured response that may prove less worrisome than 
headline news today however the stock level does mean that some 
companies may hit with tariffs and given the day duration for the 
trade representative ustr report back details specific areas impacted 
the tariffs the uncertainty may continue pressure stock multiples 
three potential outcomes see margin risk for companies with 
manufacturing based china for their products sold the the cost 
burden import duties could trickle down the supply chain further 
exacerbated weaker usd list exhibit the companies our coverage 
that have the highest exposure exports the with iphones and pcs 
topping the list demand dampened for tech products due the 
inflationary effect the cost those goods and hence manufacturing activity 
longer term and iii market share shifts china imposition tariffs crimp 
demand for products but turn may benefit chinese suppliers 
likely more disrupted than asia the global technology industry dominated 
companies which use the global trade framework move their goods 
through their international supply chains many technology companies make 
more their revenues overseas than within the and many depend nonus markets like china part their long term growth plans such 
technology firms are potentially most disrupted this situation refer our 
previous note global technology the risk protectionism not priced and 
underappreciated mar 
risk benefit aapl and samsung generally have the ability pass costs 
over time their supply chains and companies such hon hai pegatron 
merry may more sensitive tariffs they have less pricing power and rely 
production the however potential tariffs china products 
could favor some sectors such the china smartphone supply chain which 
could see share gains within china

section what stake for asian tech 
less aggressive trade measures than feared but may not matter for tech stocks 
measured response from china appears underway which looks substantially less 
than proportionate the and could potentially result fewer negative 
repercussions for growth both countries however from stock perspective are 
period uncertainty with day process for the ustr identify which part the 
tech supply chain becomes subject the tariffs and day comment period before 
the tariffs become final however time and uncertainty may continue put stocks 
multiples under pressure this context identify stocks asia that are most and 
least impacted from potential trade tariffs 
many companies cover have significant exposure the through raw materials 
component sourcing and manufacturing although not all them provide visibility 
the magnitude sensitivity the origins these materials their products tariffs raise 
the input costs for products they reduce supply from china the 
substantially tax good portion supply into the and result overall prices 
domestic prices rise although some companies might absorb higher costs this could 
lead decline demand china for goods produced the and slow down usbased revenues for companies supplying the via china china sells over 
haver analytics worth technology product the annually largely 
concentrated mobile finished products where estimate rise 
costs associated with the tariff hike the case aapl supply chain alone 
while expect some the asian tech companies our coverage pass cost 
increases their suppliers and customers over time they face higher sourcing costs 
this the case for smartphones pcs for instance others may struggle offset 
these headwinds which chinese made goods will attract tariffs still unclear but 
see three ways the tariffs could affect the asian tech sector

import tariffs affecting costs 
tech tariff potential implications higher costs the proposed tariffs will likely 
cover broad range tech categories including electronic goods this turn could 
affect consumption demand consumers higher costs are passed these 
costs could also factor the cost companies incur they seek restructure their 
supply chains reduce related costs almost all smartphone vendors have 
manufacturing facilities china including apple and samsung apple outsources the 
manufacturing all its iphones factories china which are operated foxconn 
pegatron and wistron beijing based lenovo the world second largest maker which 
acquired ibm computer business another example such the impact 
such tariffs applied could significant and companies with factories china most 
affected 
the majority technology companies asia not have local manufacturing 
footprint and therefore would negatively affected tariffs goods made 
china imported into the this would make their products more expensive the 
such smartphones and pcs and relatively less competitive they compete head tohead with made goods 
and share shift any tariffs imposed china goods could crimp demand for 
products and lead the potential risk some share shift globally our view for 
example non mobile semiconductor chip companies such mediatek sunny 
optical may benefit the chinese market their chinese customers benefit from 
more expensive competing products addition manufacturing enterprises moving 
production out china places like vietnam such samsung partly due rising 
labor costs well the perception increased restrictions foreign companies and 
products within china such the battery sale ban within china could also benefit

potential beneficiaries from chinese tariffs goods 
benefit see samsung smic jcet and mediatek beneficiaries any potential 
share gains from tariffs products the chinese market these are implemented 
they would likely have positive impact domestic smartphone brand sales within 
china their growth tied closely chinese brands production volumes the impact 
tsmc would likely neutral given its global exposure also see potential for 
modest benefits for companies like lge and lgd operating industries with 
competition from china for products sold the such tvs and smartphone 
screens 
what about aapl our hardware analyst katy huberty believes that the practical 
risk restrictive tariffs for apple lower than the headline risk for two reasons 
moving production the where has never been based would prove 
difficult within reasonable time horizon and cost framework our view most 
importantly apple produces billion consumer electronics devices annually 
leveraging china large low cost labor force and expertise labor based 
manufacturing and tooling capabilities for such high volume device production 
the very low probability event that apple was forced this don see the 
move significantly additive the labor market apple would likely 
accelerate the use automation reduce labor costs 
our bias believe apple and other consumer electronics makers would 
carved out any action given the company very large commitment based 
investment and employment 
refer katy note for more details tech hardware pulse what investors are asking 
the risk restrictive trade measures aapl and ntnx analyst day preview mar 
that said there low probability worst case scenario where apple sourcing 
components from chinese component suppliers would risk from restrictive trade 
policies mainly relates the section investigation such scenario would 
involve the levying tariffs number chinese made products well 
restriction investment chinese entities 
worse case scenario believe apple would forced either keep the status 
quo and pay the likely high tariffs chinese made products the detriment 
margins shift the source its components based suppliers which again would 
likely lead higher component costs and lower margins while apple has done some 
the latter already such adding based intel second source cellular chips 
full scale replacement its supply chain based manufacturers would prove 
not only costly but also time consuming and the event there were restrictions placed 
investment chinese entities there lower probability apple would able 
work with its asia based supply chain partners build manufacturing facilities the 
although note taiwanese manufacturing partner foxconn announced plans 
build plant wisconsin last year 
higher tariffs affecting demand 
higher tariffs will mean higher costs and turn higher prices for consumers also 
see risk for measures taken finished products pricing reflect higher 
manufacturing costs result tariffs the impact product pricing due tariff 
increases input materials would hard quantify but clearly negative many 
contracts the sector also not contain clauses that allow companies pass 
increases material costs and rarely hedges are place short term 
much the mobile supply chain outsourced meaning final assembly plants 
will import subassemblies with substantial manufacturing based china
