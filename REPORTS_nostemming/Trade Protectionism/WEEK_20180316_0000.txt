the announcement steel and aluminum tariffs the has raised concerns 
over potential escalation broader trade tensions this week look the 
implications for latin america and find that the direct impact from the 
tariffs seems quite limited not only steel and aluminum shipments the 
account for small share total exports but the region also relatively closed 
trade fact most the region major economies run small deficits vis vis 
the mexico the exception the country highly exposed because the 
far its main trading partner because more open and also tightly 
integrated into the north america manufacturing complex thus leaving more 
vulnerable any disruptions the supply chain while the international 
response the tariffs has been measured far any escalation that hurts 
prospects for the ongoing synchronized global expansion which could put 
downward pressure commodities would represent more worrisome 
development for the region after all commodities represent the largest share 
the region export basket almost the total once stripping mexico and 
they also are important determinant investment trends external balances 
and varying degrees fiscal receipts 
what new 
brazil although the ipca was published this week well was the igp 
that caught our attention agricultural wholesale prices swung back into positive 
territory which could mean consumer prices are next argentina this week the 
authorities kept the more cautious approach monetary policy holding rates 
unchanged and sending hawkish message undoubtedly the february 
inflation print explains this move for the most part regulated price hikes took 
monthly inflation colombia congressional elections and 
presidential primaries were held sunday the presidential contest should 
become fiercer the number candidates narrows down following the 
primaries regarding congress the fragmented composition from the current 
legislature remained party obtained more than seats finally 
macro high frequency indicators paint mixed picture for early retail sales 
were over annual lifted auto sales but manufacturing trailed 
expanding shy besides some polls indicating that the front runner 
mexico presidential race lead may widening bit january industrial output 
stalled after strong late while february antad sales maintained 
moderate uptrend quiet week for chile the data front but not the 
political arena new administration was inaugurated and quickly announced 
some modest austerity measures the tune gdp while promising 
unveil initiative simplify the tax code some point this year the first 
signs from the growth front peru for were bit soft even january gdp 
topped expectations the eight month long string sequential expansion

what next 
brazil next week all eyes will again inflation when the ipca will 
published and this will important data point for the bcb their ongoing 
debate the inflation outlook and its rates path argentina will 
carefully watching the gdp report for the final quarter which expect 
show deceleration growth and the balance payments figures for the 
same period which should shed further light the rapidly widening current 
account deficit colombia all eyes are the monetary policy decision 
banrep although think the march meeting non event light recent 
guidance from authorities stating that the easing cycle done for now the 
official start the campaign period the end march approaches mexico 
brings the economic activity indicator for january which should see slowdown 
from the strength seen late and inflation for the first half march 
which should have limited implications for near term policy given that banxico 
set comfortably high forecast for the first quarter look for fourth 
quarter gdp and balance payments reports chile external accounts 
remain manageable with the current account deficit near gdp while the 
first growth signs from show the recovery gaining ground the central bank

see exhibit and global macro outlook stronger for longer december

terms trade function gains commodity prices have played role the 
jump regional exports but that only part the story volumes have also staged 
brisk recovery see exhibit the bulk the growth export volumes over the past 
year brazil came from three main commodities namely oil soybeans and iron 
ore while domestic output for these three items rose for different reasons stronger 
external demand played role keeping prices elevated throughout the year fiscal 
consolidation one argentina chief challenges and brisk export growth helping 
export taxes shot the first two months the year thanks mainly 
shipments soy products for mexico the jump exports record highs contributed 
prop the economy particularly during the first half last year time when 
the inflation shock put pressure consumers and uncertainty weighed investment

yet protectionist measures now may calling into question the prospects for 
further gains trade early march the administration announced its plan 
impose tariffs steel and aluminum imports and respectively while 
remains seen whether the tariffs are the first step towards more disruptive 
protectionist push scenario our team argues that unlikely the case the 
move still raised concerns about broader trade tensions with its negative implications 
for global trade and activity see policy brief trade policy how tense can get

context are unlikely have material impact our constructive outlook for the

tariffs hard see hit more than percentage points global growth 
second the importance trade driver the global economy has diminished

highlighting that for long both the steel and aluminum sectors have been the center

protectionism without leading broader escalation and last the world keeps 
opening eleven countries excluding the signed the trans pacific partnership for 
example and europe moving forward with its free trade deals with mexico and 
canada course our global team benign assessment could change particularly 
any escalation trade tensions leads financial market jitters

remarkably high even accounting for the fact that some 
the value mexico exports represents imported content 
against this backdrop encouraging that both canada and mexico were excluded 
from the tariffs which bodes well for the prospects nafta talks and supporting our 
view that prolonged negotiations the most likely outcome see mexico can still 
make deal week ahead latin america january 
the view that the region direct vulnerability tariffs limited becomes even 
clearer when taking close look the relative importance the steel and aluminum 
sectors latin america not large steel aluminum exporter the thus 
suggesting that the recent protectionist measures are likely have more relevant 
adverse sectorial rather than macro consequences even still quite modest argentina 
brazil and mexico top the list terms exposure with steel and aluminum 
representing and total exports the respectively nevertheless 
this minimal gdp terms the cumulative amount the three countries amounts 
just their combined gdp see exhibit argentina being hit marginally from 
macro perspective tariffs biodiesel steel and aluminum impacting some major 
industrial enterprises that specialize these products for brazil steel and aluminum 
exports the represent exports the but this accounts for just 
its total exports and only gdp indeed for south america even the largest 
exports the not represent large share its gdp for instance brazil biggest 
export the oil but mere billion argentina billion chemicals 
highlight the small impact that further escalation from the could have those 
countries see exhibit colombia stands out marginally the region with billion 
oil exports and chile with billion cooper but think that these products raw materials which not fit the political narrative industrialization outsourcing 
and job losses are unlikely targets should further escalation occur even for 
mexico which tops the list terms gdp the steel and aluminum tariff 
would directly shave off just under off from gdp growth based our 
calculations look more extreme example tariff applied the car 
sector mexico largest industry whose exports top billion annually just the

whether the steel and aluminum tariffs lead broader global protectionism posing 
greater risk commodity prices depends the international response which 
far seems measured our colleague elga bartsch argues that the proper 
historical context the measures announced date and the counter measures 
considered seem less harsh than the rhetoric would suggest see sunday start the 
tide isn turning trade march specifically she looks parallels the 
steel tariffs under president bush which europe responded with highly 
targeted measures rather than broad based barriers the tariffs were lifted within two 
years before the european duties took effect today looking the list drawn the 
european commission recent weeks points once again targeted response 
importantly elga considers that any wto compatible response does not necessarily 
imply escalation 
the response from latin america any likely similarly measured considering 
that the remains among the most important export destinations for most major latin 
american economies and key regional ally thus avoiding any escalation tensions 
likely priority more specifically see any potential response limited 
targeted tariffs actions aimed helping local industry more directly such fiscal 
incentives historically the response such tariff hikes was initiate countermeasures however believe that the brazilian administration which has been holding 
more orthodox policy stance unlikely hike tariffs steel protect domestic 
producers which already have import barrier brazil will most likely resort the 
wto which currently holds the presidency try solve any disputes with the 
also believe that the argentina administration with its pro trade stance will use 
the available wto channels rather than escalate tensions for chile colombia and peru 
which have free trade agreements with the think unlikely that they will 
create tensions the current status quo serves them well granting them free access 
the consumer market while being politically out the radar 
the case mexico recent history suggests that the response any would highly 
targeted one relevant precedent from when response the blocking 
mexican trucks from circulating the move that was not consistent with nafta 
mexico applied tariffs nearly items worth some billion ranging from 
apples cheese and pet food importantly the measures excluded imports 
foodstuffs that are staples the local diet such corn consistent with preference 
for carefully tailored actions rather than across the board barriers indeed given that 
mexico net steel importer response mirroring the tariffs seems unlikely the 
probable outcome would lift local prices contributing erode exporters 
competitive edge key sectors like automobiles and machinery that despite demands 
the country steel chamber favor measures prevent potential influx 
what they call unfair imports more forceful response from mexico moreover would 
add noise ongoing nafta negotiations which are the priority mexican 
policymakers given the centrality the trade agreement its manufacturing sector 
which tightly integrated into the north american supply chain 
bottom line 
the announcement steel and aluminum tariffs the has raised concerns 
potential escalation broader trade tensions with negative implications for financial 
markets and global growth for latin america the direct impact from the tariffs 
seems quite limited not only steel and aluminum shipments the account for 
small share total exports but the region relatively closed trade fact most 
the region major economies run small deficits vis vis the with the exception 
mexico which highly exposed not just because the far its main trading partner 
but also because more open and tightly integrated into the north america 
manufacturing complex thus leaving more vulnerable any disruptions the supply 
chain while the international response the tariffs has been measured far any 
escalation that hurts prospects for further synchronized global expansion and that 
could put downward pressure commodities would represent more worrisome
