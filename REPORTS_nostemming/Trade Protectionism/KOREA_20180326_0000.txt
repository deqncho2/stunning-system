between korea major trading partners spillover broader global trade

exports historically make only korea exports and gdp 
underlying global demand conditions are more important recent events suggest

and the korea free trade agreement successfully renegotiated 
how will section affect korea korea exports china are for 
intermediate use which means some may end the sectors with larger 
share catering intermediate use china would more exposed these 
include manufactures computers electronics optical products and chemicals 
however the impact korea gdp growth likely limited ppt 
growth impact from recent trade friction quite contained however shift 
protectionist push scenario would create downside risk our base case every 
slowdown korea exports growth would reduce gdp growth 
equity strategy better but still looks tough the kospi has traded 
back down the mid trade headwinds have been stronger than the 
geopolitical tailwind despite more clarity the korea fta the china 
situation more important sentiment since korea remains large exporter 
intermediary goods china the kospi unlikely reach our bear case 
but getting back looks difficult unless three conditions emerge 
the north korean geopolitical situation leans meaningfully sustainable deescalation the sector not affected trade issues and fundamentals 
show upside policy reform takes more favorable tack 
the downtrend consensus kospi eps has slowed down and 
remained flat recent weeks results season nearing hence the

trade friction how much spillover 
taking stock recent developments 
korea export momentum has shown sustained strength with january february export 
volume rising yoy adjusted for chuseok and jan feb export 
value rising yoy adjusted for chuseok meanwhile export 
value the first days march also rose respectable yoy however concerns 
have arisen about the sustainability the trade cycle owing trade friction since the 
start this year between the and its trading partners plus the impact may have 
sentiment and interconnected global production chains 
recall that earlier this year the had announced safeguard measures solar panels 
and washers well tariffs steel and aluminium also just last week the 
further announced plans impose tariffs goods from china 
based section investigation into china intellectual property practices 
strategic sectors identified the made china plan such advanced tech 
products automated machinery robotics aerospace aeronautical equipment maritime 
equipment modern rail equipment electric new energy vehicles power equipment 
agricultural equipment and pharmaceuticals may amongst the industries which 
could have tariffs imposed 
meanwhile china has far responded measured way imposing levy 
close products including fruits wine steel pipes pork and 
recycled aluminium 
moderate impact global economy unless protectionist 
push scenario ensues setting the framework for thinking 
through the impact korea 
given the strong starting point global capex momentum morgan stanley global 
team believes that the impact trade friction global growth should relatively 
moderate unless move into protectionist push scenario with the imposing 
further aggressive and broad based tariff measures and trade partners responding 
commensurately see global insight disruption decoded global economics and 
strategy protectionism risks what next march 
nonetheless the announcement recent trade measures means that trade friction 
likely persist this context lay out the framework thinking through what the 
impact may for korea should trade tension escalate further the impact for korea 
will likely come through few transmission conduits exhibit 
bilateral trade friction between korea and 
spillover from trade friction between korea other major trading partners such 
the and china

some sectors may more exposed than others but and large think the overall

trade disputes not uncommon bilateral trade friction between 
korea and has typically not affected korea trade trajectory 
overall note that trade disputes are not uncommon the history korea 
according the korea international trade association kita korea has faced 
incidents trade investigations from countries since and such cases 
resulted actual implementations duties with them still effect between 
korea and the there have been trade incidents involving anti dumping 
countervailing subsidies and safeguard measures these trade disputes affected export 
segments including steel chemicals machinery textiles paper and pulp and 
electrical electronic devices however these products make only korea 
exports and korea gdp exhibit thus korea trade disputes have 
typically not affected korea overall export trajectory which still more dependent 
global demand conditions exhibit 
any case recent developments point possible relief korea trade issues 
statement today korea trade ministry suggests that korea exemption from 
tariffs steel and aluminium temporary till may would made permanent 
return quota would set for korea steel exports sales 
average 
addition agreement the principles the korea fta renegotiations also 
appears have been reached whilst korea gets maintain its stance regarding the 
opening its markets for agricultural products and other sensitive areas

indeed with regard korea exports sectors where larger share output feeds into 
intermediate use china would likely relatively more exposed exhibit the 
sectors with the top two highest share output going into china intermediate use are 
manufacturers computers electronics and optical products 
manufacturers chemicals chemical products 
however think the overall macro impact korea from section likely 
limited our economist for china robin xing estimates that china exports could 
reduced translating into drag china gdp growth 
should the implement tariffs chinese products all else equal 
this means the spillover from china export growth slowdown korea gdp growth 
likely limited less than based our estimates

broader global trade spillover from protectionist push 
scenario what would have more material impact korea 
our base case korea export growth cycle stays healthy but transitions from 
earlier acceleration phase phase where largely cruises along before 
moderating into against this global backdrop korea gdp growth would hover 
yoy yoy before decelerating more evidently yoy 
the real estate market also slows down further 
far see the growth impact from bilateral trade issues staying relatively 
contained shift toward more aggressive protectionist push scenario what would 
create downside risks our base case here estimate that every decline 
korea export growth goods and services would reduce korea gdp growth 
with the balance sheet still overextended any downside risks export growth 
would place the growth burden fiscal and structural policy response 
equity strategy 
mixed bag for the kospi waiting trade negotiations 
rating appears done base case but 
shown the macro section above trade policy playing out tougher but still 
within expectations while response from china was also manageable level msci 
korea from march has been harder hit than other asian markets msci 
asia japan for the same period which should reflect korean trade 
performance being potentially more vulnerable relative basis china trade 
frictions nonetheless our base case targeted use believe the kospi should 
stay above impact macro conditions and corporate earnings should 
manageable 
for the near term expect continued volatile trading for the kospi but not 
expect reach our bear case level barring more serious trade frictions and 
the geopolitical situation turning more unfavorable

the less likely event broader global trade fallout from protectionist 
push scenario korea relatively more risk within asia 
however were move the broader global trade fallout scenario explained 
the economics section above there should pressure industries and stocks that 
could affected escalated china trade frictions and the possible ripple effects 
from hence further rating could expected with the kospi possibly 
approaching our bear case target 
sectors with high output china more risk the tech sector appears 
the most exposed and also most risk other sectors with high output exposure should 
relatively less affected because they are less important targets 
commentary the tech sector shawn kim korea tech sector shows the 
highest output china with intermediate use for manufacture computer 
electronic and optical products being share total output for the 
respective sector while korea also major exporter the and hence tech 
presents the highest risk within both the base case and aggressive use scenario 
our asia pacific tech analyst shawn kim published report trade issues 
which mentioned three potential outcomes margin contraction risk 
dampening demand and shift market share the overall view that the 
likely more disrupted than asia with samsung having the ability pass 
costs over time refer asia pacific technology trade tariffs most and least 
vulnerable asia tech stocks mar for more details 
commentary the chemicals sector kyle kim impact the korean chemicals 
sector arising from potential trade war between china and the may 
complex and less obvious our view china accounts for global 
demand growth and currently market share imports china for certain 
mainstay chemical products such and remains low hence does 
not look major target for the tariff war for now though this may change 
since expect see aggregate tons capacity come online 
the the next three years largely for purposes exports asia china 
imported tons and self sufficiency remains 
chemicals get targeted recognize there could some short term benefits for 
korean chemicals market share eventually however the trade balance should 
balanced becase chemicals should enjoy more pricing flexibility given cost advantages 
over korean peers and exports elsewhere china the other hand the worst case 
overall reduced industrial production the targets imports chinese finished goods 
could lead uncertainties related overall chemical demand many korea chemical 
exports china are utilized intermediaries for finished goods for exports elsewhere 
commentary the steel sector kyle kim the recently announced steel export 
quota the tons that will exempt from steel tariffs should have 
limited impact our covered steel companies posco and hyundai steel and 
more impact pipe makers with anti dumping duties having been put place 
the past years exports the have naturally declined across the companies 
major products such hrc crc and plates these products now 
account for only total exports the from volumes 
have fallen below levels volumes pipe related steel the other 
hand expanded from tons response the demand 
for octg oil country tubular goods from the rise crude oil prices they are 
likely directly affected the quotas 
lower export volumes could affect cargo volumes tech and high value added 
manufacturing exporters are affected terms export volume this would lead 
lower trade value growth this turn could affect cargo revenue and our analyst 
covering korean airlines jay lee stated her recent report though not our base 
case scenario emergence protectionism may become downside risk cargo 
revenue cargo revenue decline routes would reduce operating 
profit for korean air and for asiana air refer korea transportation lock 
profit move kal jan for more details

equipment manufacturers are sectors with high chinese output exposure but believe

what expect upside from low base but still 
looks tough 
how the trade issue plays out especially between the and china should key 
factor for the market until there more clarity this area expect choppy kospi 
performance but think the kospi looks unlikely reach our bear case level 
unless there broader global trade fallout from protectionist push scenario 
and geopolitical conditions turn toward severe escalation again 
there more clarity the korea fta but the china situation more important 
sentiment because korea remains large exporter intermediary goods china 
assuming our base case targeted use section which currently the case the 
key factor follow should whether the tech sector gets affected and what 
magnitude difficult know this time what the ramifications are for the tech 
sector should difficult recover rapidly but also downside does look limited 
this juncture 
with the kospi trading down near recent lows lean more toward gradual recovery 
the index our base case reiterate that remains tough level 
reach the near term and stick with our views weak and slightly better 
continue have more lukewarm view kospi the street and from regional 
standpoint korea remains underweight 
below are some the factors which focus aside from trade 
issues 
north korean geopolitical situation summit meetings are coming april and 
may with the results from those meetings determining the future direction the north 
korean geopolitical situation this stage think still too early tell whether 
the situation has transitioned from temporary escalation new equilibrium 
sustainable escalation 
our base case assume status quo whereby north korea does not 
denuclearise and action reaction various parties leads uneasy equilibrium 
which oscillates between temporary escalation and escalation refer south 
korea geopolitical risk escalation mar for more details 
tech stocks namely samsung electronics how samsung and the tech stocks react 
from here still remains key driver for the kospi aside from the trade issue there 
also anticipation samsung stock split see little evidence that stock splits bring 
rating hence should fundamentals that need seen please refer 
samsung electronics upcoming stock split everything you need know mar 
for more details 
policy reform direction upcoming gubernatorial elections the political situation 
remains fluid with the ruling party and opposition party having different positions 
towards the constitutional reform proposal announced the president office was 
announced the public march and was submitted the national assembly 
march view the parties disparate positions constitutional reform this 
should mean political instability leading uncertain reform policy implementation until 
gubernatorial elections which when the constitutional amendment bill put 
for public voting
