nafta time after timeline 
see progress toward resolution that keeps the north american free trade 
agreement nafta intact yet still see potential for twists turns and delays after 
examining the state play identify key takeaways 
the administration limited the possibility congressional pressure and 
likely congressional procedure from successfully pursuing bilateral deal with 
mexico 
don have confidence that canada the and mexico will able agree 
trilateral deal time have the final text completed october 
failure meet this deadline does not make nafta away the administration 
not likely able terminate nafta and the current deal will remain place 
while negotiations continue 
our view nafta remains trilateral deal either canada joins deal before october 
result this round negotiations current nafta stands and negotiations 
continue 
what the timeline for nafta from here next deadline 
october 
the current timeline results from confluence factors the current mexican 
obrador takes office december and the administration needs meet its 
obligations under the process outlined the trade promotion authority tpa order 
meet the deadline the administration notified congress august its 
intention enter into deal within days allowing the president sign the deal 
november the next hurdle have the final text the deal completed and sent 
congress days before the deal signed october

the administration notified congress that intended enter deal with mexico and 
willing canada unclear this point whether congress would allow the 
administration pursue bilateral deal without canada more that below but 
what clear that all three parties are working toward deal right now 
pursuant the timeline above final text deal with canada mexico and the 
would need finalized october order meet mexico goal all parties 
signing agreement december 
what are the main points contention between the and 
canada 
canada dairy management program chapter dispute panels cultural 
access and possibly steel and aluminum tariffs 
while not all the details the negotiations are public appears that the debate has 
come down canada dairy management program the trying gain more access 
canada markets the chapter dispute panels the wants eliminate canada 
wants maintain and cultural protection for canadian media firms there also the 
question steel and aluminum tariffs both canada and mexico would like those 
removed but times appears they are being discussed separate issue 
press reports indicate that canada largely approves the agreement between the 
and mexico and therefore only needs work out the remaining issues between the 
and canada but some new wrinkles have appeared reportedly mexico said will only 
agree the plan for procurement issues canada does mexico economy minister 
ildefonso guajardo also has said considers what the and mexico have right now 
understanding rather than agreement and that nafta won completed 
until canada completes the talks reality all three partners are still working 
toward final deal 
what happens the three parties not come deal 
october 
the president has said multiple times that canada did not join the deal between 
the and mexico would attempt terminate nafta and pursue bilateral deal 
with mexico but can will that happen 
the may attempt withdraw from nafta but open question 
whether this can done without the consent congress 
wrote detail nafta can still make deal open constitutional 
question whether the executive branch can terminate nafta without the assent 
congress the able leave the nafta agreement itself six months after the 
executive branch notifies the other partners intent leave however congress has 
constitutional authority regulate commerce with foreign nations and may attempt 
block the administration through legislative means through the courts piie 
the executive branch were able pull the out nafta without congressional 
approval the implementation act that congress passed enact nafta would still 
effect the heart the commercial and tariff sections would cease have effect and 
the administration could take few different paths set new tariffs set both the 
most favored nation mfn levels applicable all members the wto but many 
provisions the nafta implementation act government procurement labor and 
environmental conditions arbitration proceedings among others would still effect 
unless congress acted change them 
the administration could pursue bilateral agreement with mexico but 
also not clear that the administration could complete agreement using 
current tpa authority 
trade representative robert lighthizer notified congress may the 
administration intent initiate negotiations with canada and mexico regarding 
modernization nafta and stated that the administration would consult closely with 
congress developing its negotiating positions and making sure those positions are 
consistent with congress stated principles several members congress and many 
trade experts have pointed out that entering deal with just mexico not accordance 
with the notification the administration made congress the outset these 
negotiations and therefore member congress could challenge its use the trade 
promotion authority pass their implementation bill using the fast track process 
congress acts disallow the use fast track authority which can done either 
the committee level the floor either house the administration could pursue 
the passage the implementation bill the mexico agreement through regular 
order regular order means that there not time limit passing the bill can 
amended and can filibustered the senate pursuing implementation bill 
through regular order injects additional uncertainty into the process which why the 
tpa process exists 
three parties could let current nafta stand and continue negotiate 
the current push get deal done was instigated mexico order get signed 
deadline has been created may negotiators were trying get deal done order 
allow time for the congress vote this year but the deadlines are 
procedurally arbitrary trade deals often take years complete and they could 
continue working the interim current nafta still exists furthermore our latam 
the negotiations 
wild card could the administration use the auto tariffs 
leverage 
the administration continues argue that tariffs auto and auto part 
imports could imposed canada and mexico nafta negotiations are 
unsatisfactory the commerce department investigation into whether auto 
imports have impact national security has not yet been released but the 
threat these tariffs lingers over several countries including canada and mexico 
the question then returns congress would implementing tariffs all 
auto imports create the market and economic pressure that would force them 
act take away the executive branch ability use section however the 
threat tariffs might not effective leverage the administration believes 
not canada believes congress would act tariffs were enacted that there 
would enough public market reaction force the administration reconsider 
china expected escalation 
with new talks between china and the the horizon don see near term 
circuit breaker 
president trump comments last week that favors the next round tariffs 
going into effect should not have been surprise our view that are 
protectionist push scenario toward china and that all tariff announcements should 
taken seriously 
recent news supports this view trade talks between china and the did not 
produce any signs progress and there are reports current public 
negotiations 
the president also said friday that would willing forward with tariffs 
additional billion chinese goods which would bring the total amount 
goods tariffed essentially all goods that the united states imports from china 
billion 
our view the trade conflict with china will escalate until there significant market 
economic reaction this could include all announced tariffs 
what the next step the trade conflict billion 
the next round expected tariffs tariffs billion chinese exports the 
the preliminary product list was published july and august the president 
announced that would increase the proposed rate from those goods 
august china announced its intentions tariff billion exports china 
and released list products too with different tariff rates and 
previous rounds china retaliatory tariffs have gone into effect the same day 
those the united states 
late august the office the trade representative ustr held public hearing 
receive comments the tariff product list and written comments had have been 
submitted september the final list products could announced any day 
after that for previous rounds has been about one two weeks after the final 
comment date and then the tariffs went into effect about two weeks after that 
not know the exact date the announcement but the administration has signaled 
coming soon 
what types goods are being tariffed consumer goods come 
into play 
the peterson institute international economics provides useful summaries the 
types products being affected this round they determined that the goods 
targeted the billion round are consumer goods including computers 
billion furniture billion seats billion lamps lighting and parts billion 
travel bags billion and agricultural and food products billion the tariffs are 
hitting consumer goods largely because those are the imports from china that were left 
tariff after the previous rounds which largely avoided them for the retaliatory 
tariffs the institute determined that the major industries targeted china retaliatory 
tariffs are machinery mechanical appliances electrical equipment billion 
chemicals billion and wood and articles wood pulp and paper billion 
exhibit tariffs will increasingly affect consumer goods from china

what the expected impact growth global 
growth 
our economists modeled the impact these tariffs global and china gdp 
taking policy responses into account using their input output model trade tensions 
chipping away growth september they write that the next round import 
tariffs which expect implemented will chip away growth and trigger policy 
response following the policy response they estimate that the final global growth 
impact will with china growth affected while growth affected 
note that this analysis not able capture the second round effects

source morgan stanley research the initial modeled growth impact derived from the simulation results from the global input output model expect 
that the initial growth impact will result policy response from china where policy makers will lift broad credit growth and fiscal deficit cushion the 
impact growth which results final impact 
will congress step take away the executive branch 
authority impose section tariffs not likely the near 
term 
opposed the section tariffs where bills have been introduced take away 
the executive branch powers impose tariffs based national security there less 
evidence congress interested pushing back the administration agenda regarding 
china trade issues see grading the midterms therefore not think 
likely that congress steps any time soon unless there significant market reaction 
economic drag there more consternation the areas being affected tariffs 
response 
wild card can the executive branch withdraw the from the 
wto unilaterally practically speaking probably not 
much like the debate over whether the office the president has the power 
withdraw from nafta withdrawal from the wto open question the has 
never terminated free trade agreement the agreement creating the wto the 
marrakesh agreement states that any member may withdraw from the agreement 
six months after notifying the director general the wto however when the 
entered the wto congress passed implementing bill the uruguay round 
agreements act approving the agreement and making the changes law 
necessary implement the agreement the executive branch cannot nullify law 
and therefore the implementing act would still effect there process 
place that every five years congress has the opportunity withdraw approval 
the wto chooses but congress has not engaged the process 
introducing bill recent years and the next review not until the 
administration did choose pursue this action would likely the courts 
decide congress could take proactive action codify tariff rates 
july was reported that the administration advisers had drafted bill that 
allowed the executive branch determine tariff levels without congressional 
approval and ignore the wto principles that guide tariff rates outside free 
trade agreements while the white house said there was plan roll out the 
legislation the fact that the administration drafted bill demonstrates the point 
congress would have grant that authority and has not shown any intent 
auto tariffs risks rebounding 
much uncertain about the administration threat impose tariff all auto 
and auto part imports while still think auto tariffs have been pushed out beyond 
believe risks are rebounding for the and other countries 
consider 
talks with the are just beginning and focused the easiest achieve items 
discussions linger the could revert auto tariff threats 
the has rejected offer eliminate their auto tariffs saying was not 
good enough and has increased rhetoric toward the recent weeks 
the administration has used the threat auto tariffs against other countries 
including canada and mexico and has recently signaled wants open trade talks 
with japan 
our view still believe that auto tariffs are out the base case for the for 
but see risks growing auto tariffs remain possibility for other countries 
where trade talks stand between the and 
concrete progress yet 
trade representative robert lighthizer and european trade commissioner cecilia 
malmstrom met briefly monday and called their talks constructive they plan 
meet again the end the month hold staff level talks october and meet again 
november finalize outcomes number areas specifically technical barriers 
trade 
august malmstrom said the was willing drop its car tariffs the 
did the same but president trump rejected that not good enough 
the agreement between president trump and european commission president juncker 
july stated that they would work toward zero tariffs zero non tariff barriers and 
zero subsidies non auto industrial goods the comments from malmstrom 
members the european parliament seemed beyond that include auto tariffs 
but there were details and she did not specify whether deal would include the 
current duty the imposes imports light trucks regardless the president 
later that day interview said that the offer was not good enough the meeting 
monday malmstrom appeared step back from her offer and europe current 
position that malmstrom will need the approval the member states before 
further talks autos 
the risk for these talks the time they may take and that the 
administration and the will impasse that risks further escalation 
from the 
the and the went through rounds formal talks over three years negotiating 
the transatlantic trade and investment partnership this positive way because 
great deal work has already been done but also shows how long trade negotiations 
can take the real risk that the negotiators come impasse over the scope the 
negotiations that they take longer than the administration willing allow 
then auto tariffs could come back into play 
what could lead tariffs other countries for leverage 
trade disputes the next step escalation 
the administration continues discuss the threat auto tariffs 
important piece leverage against many countries including canada and 
possibly japan 
the commerce department report its investigation into whether auto and auto part 
imports constitute threat national security not due until february but could 
released before then timing remains unclear but could this fall the same statute 
section was used implement the steel and aluminum tariffs that case the 
tariffs went into place against all countries and then waivers were provided for some 
could similar case here the administration decides forward with the tariffs 
they could into effect for some countries while others receive waivers they have 
acquiesced the administration requests
