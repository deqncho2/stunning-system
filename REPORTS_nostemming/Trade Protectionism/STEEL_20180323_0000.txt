steel stocks reacted negatively today broad exemptions may dilute the 
impact section tariffs testimony the senate finance committee 
march trade representative robert lighthizer said that section 
tariffs which into effect march will paused for canada mexico 
the south korea brazil australia and argentina while these countries have 
ongoing trade negotiations with the our channel checks indicate that the 
exemptions are expected last until the end april while discussions are being 
held 
see this pause drag steel pricing temporarily exempted countries 
accounted for steel imports while the exemptions are not 
definitive and their duration somewhat undefined view this headwind 
for prices the near medium term imports from these regions countries 
comprised the total steel imports see exhibit made 
permanent think this may increase the availability imports thus reversing 
the upward pressure domestic prices example with north european 
hot rolled spot price currently estimate european imports could 
arrive the midwest below which would create attractive arbitrage 
domestic spot hrc these exemptions drastically lower the 
likelihood hrc reaching the short term had expected 
before any exemptions were granted see months section tariffs and 
price spike hrc 
the list exemptions could potentially grow media reports suggest the 
administration may endorse using the section tariffs potential leverage 
trade negotiations with other countries and according trade representative 
lighthizer the ready pursue potential free trade agreements with other 
countries for instance japan successful getting exemption the
