trade policy tensions have fluctuated this week resulting increased volatility 
machinery stocks investors anticipate formal signing steel and 
aluminum tariffs thursday details emerge expect machinery names 
continue focus given their steel and aluminum exposure and sales average that are attributed exports from the this 
writing steel and aluminum tariffs with exemptions for mexico and 
canada and potentially others now considered the base case outcome 
exemptions just few days ago the focus has shifted from how the tariffs could 
affect steel and aluminum consuming machinery company margins how much 
potential measures response from and china could impact sales thus far 
the response from the has been measured aggregate and targeted 
specific products including consumer agricultural and steel goods suggesting 
that the not looking escalate the situation further 
our metals and mining analyst piyush sood thinks the tariffs could last 
months and that hrc could reach from currently 
before falling imports emerge thinks hrc will average 
most our machinery companies contract steel months out that 
should begin see spot pricing flow through margins 
still see potential margin headwind from the enactment steel 
and aluminum tariffs discussed our construction and truck 
initiations and assuming hrc think most the eps impact can 
offset pricing companies like cat and who had over pricing 
should able offset the entire tariff headwind with pricing 
think companies that had pricing like pcar and tex could have the 
most difficulty pushing this cost through onto the customer assuming only 
pricing would result hsd eps impact the group average with wbc 
revg and cat least exposed

remain and bullish the replacement cycle inventory levels 
and grain prices trade countermeasures broader countermeasures 
agricultural products particularly soybean exports china could have 
much larger impact the health the farmer and demand for 
agricultural machinery equipment but don expect china enact 
countermeasures through grains since would drive their feed inflation and 
there are several other products could target 
our cat call predicated continued strength mining 
infrastructure and european construction end markets higher steel costs 
would likely raise inputs for infrastructure which could slow the pace 
public non resi construction think the energy complex more 
insulated from trade countermeasures given the energy security issues would 
create for trade partners but that increased costs for steel could slow the 
pipeline build out and could crowd out capex our metals and mining 
analyst piyush sood thinks that companies would among the first 
apply for exemption this slowdown would temporary see little 
direct impact the pace european construction but appreciate the 
broader risks the global synchronous growth 
our policy strategist michael zezas has outlined three potential trade policy 
outcomes see trade policy beyond the hypothetical and trade policy how

what the impact margins and eps from cost inflation 
have refined our steel and aluminum impact analysis account for incremental 
company disclosures broadly view the awp manufacturers the most impacted 
from eps perspective while pcar and cmi will likely see some degree outsized 
margin pressure within our coverage continue see scope for price adjusted 
eps impact and price adjusted margin impact the majority our names 
assuming pricing offset across our coverage reiterate note the larger and 
construction players and cat are more likely achieve pricing excess our 
estimate given supportive end market backdrop and historical pricing actions while 
manufacturers who have continued deal with pricing headwinds over the course 
tex osk pcar are less favorably positioned incremental international 
competition further complicates the ability pass price within the aerials complex 
especially the context more aggressive pricing strategies from larger rental players

how strong pricing power 
terms pricing line with commodity inflation believe consensus largely 
appreciates that most construction equipment oems will able pass along 
incremental cost inflation the clear relative winners within our coverage are cat and 
which have both demonstrated ability largely achieve pricing power through 
the cycle and are currently benefitting from robust underlying demand 
environment which has historically been extremely supportive price additionally 
note that cat was able offset the last notable inflation steel costs with 
surcharge that resulted positive pricing through also note that 
construction equipment ppi historically has shown its strongest correlation with steel 
prices lag suggesting that oems generally have adequate time adjust pricing 
line with cost inflation this point believe most companies are likely hedged out 
several quarters their commodity exposure and likely only need pass along price 
when the contract rolled forward higher price 
the margin view the awp manufacturers somewhat less favorably positioned 
the heavy equipment oems terms the ability pass along commodity 
inflation this point note that tex struggled with its pricing contribution through 
and along with anecdotal evidence international encroachment skyjack 
pricing more aggressively through weaker cad believe the aerials manufacturers 
will find greater degree difficulty passing along such aggressive cost inflation 
further note that incremental industry consolidation the rentco level via 
footprint expansion and cold start strategies from aht and uri unfavorably impacts 
the negotiation position awp manufacturers given greater degree purchasing 
leverage the customer level

view trade risk already included our bear case and continued like the risk

tariffs agricultural commodities could have much larger derivative impact 
equipment stocks than direct tariffs agricultural machinery canada china mexico 
and the represent over half the agricultural exports china has previously 
suggested that would contemplate soybean tariff imports response any 
tariffs enacted against chinese imports since china represents less than steel 
imports view soybean tariff countermeasures highly unlikely for steel tariffs 
alone especially given that would significantly increase chinese feed inflation 
roughly the soybean exports china chinese tariff soybeans 
would place downward pressure the price grain prices and upward pressure
