mexican auto one the most attractive end markets for 
ternium but also has high exposure nafta risk 
however ternium manages displace imports then 
demand for its products should prove resilient even under 
extreme auto demand conditions 
the mexican auto market highly exposed nafta trade especially the 
the light vehicles produced mexico were exported 
the ran worst case scenario where assume that mexican auto 
production declines amount equal the number units exported the 
did this assess the potential impact nafta renegotiations 
mexican steel makers like ternium 
however our analysis suggests limited risk for local flat auto steel producers 
even mexican auto production falls significantly estimate mexico 
flat auto steel demand which was supplied 
imports and local producers our worst case scenario flat auto steel 
demand mexico would decrease which still above local producers 
output this means that local steel producers are able displace 
imported steel then demand for their products would unaffected while 
have conclusive data confirm that local steel players could immediately 
produce the right mix displace all imports believe that the impact for 
them should limited 
local galvanized auto sheet producers seem particularly vulnerable however 
for ternium the impact should still limited for estimate that 
domestic producers supplied mexico galvanized auto steel sheets 
demand the higher penetration local players this specific niche 
makes them more vulnerable potential demand shock the country auto 
production drops materially result nafta renegotiations compared 
other auto steel products calculate that our worst case scenario 
ternium galvanized auto steel sheet production could fall 
which represents only the company consolidated shipments

assessing nafta risk mexico auto steel demand 
mexican auto and auto steel market overview 
the mexican auto industry highly depends exports especially the according 
amia mexican auto association light vehicle production mexico reached 
units and exports totaled shipments the accounted for units 
those exports mexico total car production 
estimate flat auto steel demand and total auto steel 
demand using data from the american lron and steel institute aisi that assess 
flat steel per vehicle word steel association estimates total steel per 
unit and multiplying that number the mexican auto production units 
estimate flat auto steel demand applying the same methodology 
but using data from the word steel association wsa that estimates total 
steel per vehicle estimate total auto steel demand 
out which were supplied imports based data provided 
ina mexican auto supplier association auto steel demand mexico 
supplied imports from countries like china germany sweden and france among 
others the remaining comes from local producers throughout the analysis 
present this report and effort conservative have assumed that 
flat auto steel demand mexico currently supplied imports while the 
remaining supplied locally produced steel 
exhibit mexican light vehicle production reached units

how would mexican steel producers fare nafta ended 
even assuming the extreme scenario that mexican auto production declines 
amount equal the number units exported the from mexico under this 
worst case scenario assume that nafta dissolved note that this not our 
economics and strategy team base case they still see prolonged talks the most 
likely outcome while harsh protectionist measures are probably off the table 
altogether see here and trade barriers are implemented the extent that mexico 
longer sells vehicles the further our worst case scenario assumes that mexican 
auto manufacturers are unable redirect the lost sales other regions 
mexican auto steel producers might effectively prove resilient the whole shock 
the mexican auto steel market from our worst case scenario absorbed reduction 
imports then local steel producers would not see demand for their products decline 
auto steel demand would still higher than local production see exhibit 
however this assumes that locally established steel plants are able displace imports 
believe that nafta terminated neither would production fall much 
implied our scenario mexican auto manufacturers should able redirect auto 
sales other regions nor would domestic steel producers able displace all 
imports unlikely that the current product mix steel imports and local 
production exactly the same still the impact demand for locally produced autosteel should limited and less than investors seemed believe 
exhibit even mexican auto production declined domestic flat auto steel producers 
might not affected they manage displace imports

mexican galvanized steel market seems particularly vulnerable 
imports galvanized sheets are lower compared other auto steel products 
according data from aisi galvanized steel represents vehicles 
total flat steel content per vehicle considering that vehicles were 
produced mexico forecast galvanized auto sheet demand for 
estimate that mexican auto manufacturers sourced 
galvanized sheet from local suppliers posco covered kyle kim and ternium 
subsidiary tenigal 
making local producers especially vulnerable demand shocks there are less 
imports that local steel makers could eventually displace compared other autosteel products local galvanized auto steel producers are more vulnerable big 
demand shock our view calculate that under our worst case scenario current 
total galvanized auto sheet demand mexico would decrease from 
case local steel producers are able displace all imports demand for locally produced 
galvanized steel would decrease from 
further local capacity could theoretically supply most auto galvanized demand 
calculate that local producers have capacity cover demand mexico 
the fact that local producers particularly posco are not currently producing close 
capacity suggests that substitution imports might challenging 
and new capacity gradually enters the market mid nucor covered 
piyush sood and jfe covered harunobu goroh started the construction their 
galvanized auto sheet plant mexico expected start addition 
estimate that ternium new galvanizing line will auto grade 
considering this total capacity local producers would almost high 
demand was which means that local producers theory would able 
almost supply the whole market however expect new capacity effectively enter 
the market gradually obtaining new auto grade certifications from auto 
manufacturers takes approximately one year for each particular product 
share local galvanized auto steel capacity would eventually increase 
demand according ihs production mexico will increase ternium 
expects units assuming that avg galvanized steel content per vehicle 
remains the same forecast that galvanized auto sheet demand mexico will reach 
this combined with the gradual entering new capacity should 
maintain the share local galvanized auto capacity relative demand close 
however when assume that the new capacity already fully available 
nucor jfe should have auto grade certification then ihs expects auto production 
decrease units again assuming that avg galvanized steel content per vehicle 
remains the same forecast that galvanized auto sheet demand mexico will reach 
and local production capacity would represent demand

how would ternium auto steel shipments affected 
while under our worst case scenario see ternium galvanized auto sheet shipments 
decreasing ternium subsidiary tenigal galvanized auto sheet 
capacity basically operating full capacity assuming that tenigal maintains its 
market share other local producers estimate that tenigal shipments would 
decrease under our worst case scenario which shipments local 
galvanized auto steel producers fall 
total impact should limited only ternium consolidated shipments 
however forecast total consolidated steel shipments for ternium 
even galvanized steel shipments were fall this would represent 
only ternium shipments albeit the lost volumes would have aboveaverage margins moreover the potential negative impact ternium equity basis 
would even smaller the company only owns stake tenigal for nongalvanized auto steel are assuming the shock absorbed reduction imports 
and hence demand for ternium products would not decline demand would still 
higher than local production
