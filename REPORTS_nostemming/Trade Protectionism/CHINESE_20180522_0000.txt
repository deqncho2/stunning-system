chinese ports 
why remain guarded 
although consensus earnings estimates may have largely 
factored fundamental softness expect further pressure 
valuation from tariff uncertainties 
share price corrections owing weakened outlook chinese ports under our 
coverage have underperformed respective country indices since 
november believe this mainly led gloomy growth outlook 
after china ndrc announced voluntary tariff cuts for four chinese ports 
november leading drop their rolling forward and rise their forward dividend yield the past seven months 
remain guarded toward the segment although agree with the market 
that consensus earnings estimates have largely factored fundamental 
weakness still see downside the port stock valuations for these reasons 
slowdown volume growth traffic growth momentum may soften led 
slowdown real exports further rmb appreciation 
may also slightly negative for exports 
potential downside tariffs april the ndrc confirmed that 
cutting logistics costs will remain key area policy focus and mentioned 
cutting tariffs for ports think the possibility any tariff hikes 
low and see further downside the ndrc thinks chinese ports 
should cut tariffs further

potential pressure from liners believe liners margins will under 
pressure from strong supply growth well alliances willingness 
acquire market share earnings pressure for liners may translate into asp 
pressure for ports with six month time lag 
potential capex for overseas cmp and cspl may further expand 
overseas investment along the belt and road potentially leading higher 
gearing which may add pressure valuation

pressure tariffs for chinese ports may continue 
document published the ndrc april mentions that encouraging ports 
cut tariffs will remain one the key focus areas for the government order 
lower logistics costs for the whole economy 
think implies very low chances for china ports increase tariffs the rest 
potential downsizing the ndrc thinks ports should cut their tariffs further 
from current levels 
further pressure from liners 
believe will difficult year for container shipping terms profitability 
given potential shipping rate weakness led intensive scheduled delivery new 
vessels plus the uncertainties the demand side and the willingness compete for 
market share among alliances softness vessel utilization may make difficult for 
liners pass fuel price inflation their downstream customers which implies 
further pressure margins please see container shipping earnings cut demand 
uncertainties for more discussion container shipping 
think pressure liners profitability may translate into pressure port 
tariffs usually with time lag months 
potential further capex for overseas 
thanks the supply side reform ports the capex depreciation ratio for chinese 
ports has dropped below however think cmp and cspl will continue their 
expansion overseas led china belt and road initiative which may lead heavy 
capex for 
exhibit share listed ports capex depreciation ratio has continued drop 
source wind morgan stanley research note median for all listed ports china share market 
cmp guided for capex out which 
will used for acquisition announced projects cspl also guided for

used for domestic and overseas 
our views companies 
stay guarded toward the segment see limited upside fundamentals that 
could drive earnings upgrades while pressure valuation may continue view 
uncertainties related tariffs and intensive future capex 
stock preference 
sipg thanks its investments commercial property and banks sipg can 
generate solid earnings growth amid headwinds from port tariff cuts expect 
recurring earnings cagr however think the strong profit 
growth may have been largely priced 
cmp see positives thanks its investment sipg and strong growth 
overseas terminals also see negatives from weak fundamentals pearl river 
delta and bohai rim ports share price implies dividend yield thanks 
the disposal gain from chiwan wharf while dividend yield drops 
assuming non recurring gains

ports pricing more vulnerable compared with other chinese ports 
transshipment locations are decided shipping alliances assuring their high 
bargaining power see further downside fundamentals led potential tariff
