hrc emerging our base case 
tariff sign off hot rolled steel can hit before 
slipping imports exemptions and capacity restarts fcf 
from higher prices suggests stock upside indicating 
easy money has been made higher utilization boosts 
sustainable ebitda but becomes concern tariffs are 
repealed 
after strong rally potential section tariffs think the steel space 
now battleground between bulls and bears running only higher steel prices 
well into next year through our models see see exhibit upside 
from excess fcf most steel stocks higher for aks which tells that easy 
money the space has probably been made some investors are worried that 
tariffs will invite trade response from other countries and affect global growth 
view that our economics team doesn share continue believe that 
global steel supply will stay check due china ongoing supply side reform 
supporting higher global pricing think that the next leg upside across our 
steel names will come when questions around sustainability ebitda post 
capacity restarts are favorably settled any negative surprise section 
now key investment risk 
think that the president signs tariff imports under section 
this week next hot rolled coil prices the could rally 
prices are currently and mill lead times for hot rolled coil are 
extended into april the president enacts tariffs under section the next 
weeks will raise import costs which think gives the steel 
mills opportunity seek price hike equivalent amount not more 
for their may orders our sources tell that some import dependent buyers 
expect tight market the coming weeks and are willing pay tariffs 
incoming shipments just secure supply see potential for hrc prices 
touch 
and then decline some imports may become feasible think that price 
increase will likely bring imports adding shipping costs existing 
tariffs and possible section tariffs other countries prices calculate 
that hot rolled coil imports can come from several countries prices stay 
above see exhibit 
knee jerk price reaction followed some slippage appears well 
supported the market reaction president bush implemented 
section tariffs steel imports march and hrc prices rallied

over the course the year but trade responses from europe started 
mount and the doc started grant exclusions steel prices began slip see 
exhibit the doc released its first list excluded products april 
shortly after bush imposed the tariffs followed second list july 
and then one list each august and march see exhibit based 
the trump administration comments product exclusions are still possible but 
exemptions for countries seem unlikely this stage 
think these tariffs could easily last for months think the trump 
administration will potentially face pressure from import dependent companies 
consumers steel aluminum and international trading partners which makes 
believe that these measures might temporary the president signs off 
tariffs our base case calls for tariffs that last for months sufficient 
amount time for mills restart capacity the also any possible wto 
ruling this issue may take year not more see link our bull case calls for 
the tariffs remain place until the end months almost the same 
duration the tariffs under section think our base bull cases are 
much more likely than our bear case which calls for tariffs place for 
months

upside our similarly nue stld and cmc have slack capacity

pricing before restarting its mnt ashland facility 
tariffs are likely coming but duration unclear 
last week press conference with industry executives president trump officially 
announced his intention impose tariff steel imports while the president 
did not release any further details suggested formal signing would take place this 
week even though officially has until april make decision 
believe likely that president trump could sign his tariffs into law this week 
the president holding campaign rally pittsburgh march ahead the 
district special election march 
while president trump indicated his tariffs will last for long period time

found they did not seriously injure the steel industry second imports from

time they comprised less than steel imports collectively while the trump
