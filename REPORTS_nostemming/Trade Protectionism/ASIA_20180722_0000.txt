after the rhetoric the will impose duties all 
chinese imports global growth resets tech performance 
vulnerable rotation earnings risk and non tariff measures 
prefer domestic semi and internet exposure 
tariff exposures for tech have been minimal the latest china tariffs not 
include finished goods such smartphones but apply minor component 
parts panels led touch screens these parts shipped directly the for 
final assembly are insignificant since most are assembled outside the followon waves proposed tariffs are broader with targets including 
semiconductors and await review 
but confidence likely deteriorate further four impacts the asian tech 
sector 
stock market rotation technology stocks not provide safe haven 
stock leadership should continue narrow toward domestic exposures 
that have room grow such internet investors move safer plays

earnings risk have detected minor downticks orders from the 
supply chain reduced capex and more caution from the earnings season 
trade damage global growth would eventually reduce overall demand 
for tech costs also tariffs flow through the supply chain 
non tariff measures bigger risk non tariff measures china the 
form prohibition goods brand consumption present greater 
risk china could tighten laws and approval rules and make more costly 
run operations previous restriction korea defense issues japanese 
autos territorial disputes and france carrefour are examples 
valuation under pressure reducing tech exposure heightens risk derating seen the japan trade dispute three decades ago which 
resulted sharp multiple contraction and blow earnings growth the 
japan semiconductor trade dispute the ended with 
large concessions japan today the employing similar trade tools 
against china 
conclusion rush turn positive think makes sense lower broader 
tech exposure the near term and hedge sector exposure into earnings season 
elevated valuations lack material earnings upside extended positioning 
technicals and trade related risks all add poor near term risk reward

stock market rotation technology stocks not provide safe 
haven 
tech stock leadership should narrow further suspect that the technology sector 
will not immune from the changing attitudes toward risk assets that are building 
response rising trade tensions our and equity strategists have recently 
expressed the view that more defensive rotation was forthcoming they anticipated 
leadership changes downgrading the technology sector underweight the 
getting more defensive downgrading small caps and tech upgrading staples and 
telecom services july both strategists think makes sense lower broad 
exposure the near term the very least hedge sector exposure aggressively into 
earnings season they cite elevated valuations lack material earnings upside 
extended positioning and technicals while trade related risks add fuel poor riskreward for the sector the near term 
note that internet and software and services are really the only tech industry 
groups that have shown relatively strong outperformance ytd the rest the sector 
has shown both earnings and multiple contraction

earnings risk increases 
the technology supply chains are closely intertwined consumer and corporate 
confidence has strong impact demand for example semiconductor chips are 
behind every device from smartphones servers and the broader tech sector tech 
industry groups with strong links between china and the such semiconductors 
are vulnerable additional rounds proposed tariffs industries such automobiles 
and industrial that fall under tariffs and use technology may eventually reduce overall 
demand for tech tariffs are likely target chinese manufacturers rather than the 
supply chain for companies with devices produced china key examples are 
lenovo zte costs may also these tariffs flow through the supply chain 
contract manufacturers smartphones based china using parts the tariff list 
quantifying the earnings risk from trade disputes managements have cited higher 
business uncertainty arising from potential restrictions trade and sales well 
planning risks there have been some postponements projects customers 
mobile devices and data centers and these are affecting current business performance 
consensus projecting yoy eps growth for msci asia and 
these numbers may difficult achieve with bit room for misses saw with 
samsung and tsmc and not think there lot room for meaningful surprise

measures beyond tariffs present potentially greater risks 
potential non tariff measures china such prohibition goods brand 
consumption could present greater risk for instance chinese consumers 
protested outside carrefour retail locations and sales toyota and honda 
china tumbled over territorial dispute between china and japan more recently 
korea suffered major decline consumer product revenues owing 
prohibition and restrictions caused defense related issues 
impossible for china retaliate dollar for dollar terms since china imports 
from the are not large enough however china has other levers could use such 
tightening laws and approval rules and making more costly run operations china 
such companies with large revenues and retail outlets china could risk 
this turn would have more serious implications for asian tech supply chains 
valuation may less relevant rotation takes precedence 
are fairly confident saying that the earnings growth tech priced based 
where the sector trades relative the broader market exhibit shows that ntm 
for msci asia above the historical mean think reversion the mean more 
likely the near term than move higher from here there potential for rating

lessons from japan trade dispute devastating for japanese 
tech stocks 
japan trade frictions lasted for decades from the the and the 
semiconductor dispute there was resolution the japanese government 
conceded the semiconductor trade agreement was followed trade sanctions 
japan for violating the agreement which addressed all major concerns with 
respect both dumping and market access the sector initially rebounded but quickly 
came under pressure rated sharply until trade sanctions and did not recover 
until final agreement was reached since negative impact earnings materialized much 
later terms the global macro environment global gdp growth was 
quite robust and negating macro factors cause the decline

risk from headlines about tariffs muted for tech asia far 
the market has not reacted much the newly imposed tariffs the tariff target list 
for china light consumer end products such smartphones servers but 
covers more components that into finished goods this does not affect much the 
technology sector asia aside from the broader macro implications and only small 
portion the parts made chinese suppliers are directly shipped back the for 
final assembly most are assembled outside the the list chinese products 
affected includes telecommunications devices and parts precision instruments and 
electrical equipment the impact asian tech components the list such led 
touch screens and lcd panels not material since these products are not shipped 
directly the 
more and more meaningful tariffs are coming the second list targeted techrelated products includes semiconductors photosensitive devices computer parts and 
accessories such the impact tariffs the supply chain significantly larger than 
the announced tariffs and comes the form higher import cost the parts being 
supplied from china into the 
the bigger risk would china implements passive measures restrict sales 
finished goods products china this would disrupt the supply chain significantly 
however unknown whether any such measures will implemented second 
batch products undergoing further review and passed the effective date the 
tariffs would august for details see our recent macro report correction trade 
tensions stakes have risen 
led industry mostly affected the third tariff list but impact manageable the 
third tariff list nearly pages long and tech related products include electric 
lamps end product led tvs parts optical elements semiconductor media and 
cameras among these the led industry faces the most impact since the 
important export market for china led industry and the targeted products amount 
more than exhibit shows details the targeted products 
however view the competitiveness chinese led products and because more 
than global led lighting products are manufactured and assembled china 
will hard for consumers find substitutes imported from other countries that 
are cheaper than the products made china therefore even with the tariff 
chinese electrical lamps are still competitive the market and the impact likely 
shared chinese manufacturers and consumers

stock implications 
expect the sector continue underperforming although not much recently 
after trailing msci asia stocks have rated response sharp 
deceleration both the top line and eps and they are likely stay depressed 
light trade fears see upside being more earnings driven from here continue 
look for product cycles share gains and penetration new total addressable 
markets such autos automation exposure the data era consensus 
projecting yoy revenue growth and higher eps are below 
consensus and think that these numbers may difficult achieve with bit room 
for misses saw with samsung and tsmc not think there lot room 
for meaningful surprise the upside 
our preference stays with bat baidu alibaba tencent view minimal impact from 
tariffs and select stocks the apple supply chain are attractive light depressed 
multiples and renewed growth momentum stay baidu given its continued 
progress technology catcher for ongoing share gain iphone casings and semco 
given its high exposure midrange low end mlcc markets 
our key underweights are sohu epistar and phison 
standing benefit are design companies which have primarily customers that 
are based china and for which higher tariffs create trade barriers and help them 
become more competitive price competition with potential share gain 
opportunities taiwanese design companies may also benefit from better 
competitive position against peers 
risk are foundry companies with fabs china which will subject the tariff 
products shipped the these also include memory companies such 
samsung fab aan and hynix fab wuxi that may need divert some 
the back end final assembly outside china 
contrast nanya tech and silicon motion should gain share because they 
operate fabs taiwan module houses like phison which source nand from 
vendors are also risk result the trade tension 
last for back end companies the impact negative because less competitive 
prices owing the direct tariffs and the spreading effect the weaker demand 
from upstream 
hardware far unscathed unless end products become subject trade 
disputes the impact limited the current stage because imports like 
smartphones have been spared the trump administration but they could hit 
the trade dispute grows 
chinese internet companies are more immune trade tariffs because these 
companies generate most their revenue from china however commerce 
companies like alibaba could delay overseas expansion and growth
