stock reaction tariffs likely 
overdone 
proposed tariffs china imports has minimal 
impact can mitigated for many companies within our 
technology coverage expect trade disputes share 
price overhang rather than material headwind 
fundamentals the moment 
the list gets longer the office trade representative proposed tax 
list products from china with annual trade value approximately 
this comes addition the chinese imports that the 
taxing while there are tens billions technology products that the 
proposing tax imported believe the impact our covered 
companies likely limited and manageable given the ability shift 
manufacturing supply chains short order while the risk escalating 
trade dispute with china overhang for the technology sector see 
bigger risk sentiment than actual reported revenue and profits 
sector implications from latest tariff proposal 
hardware it important highlight that smartphone and computer final 
products not face tariffs which minimizes the impact products that are 
fully assembled overseas while tariffs impact components going into these 
products see companies quickly reacting shifting supply chains reduce 
the risk material cost shipment delay headwinds similar actions taken 
the event natural disaster most recently the floods texas 
hardware companies can adjust supply chains and logistics mute the impact 
disruption our early conversations suggest there are two key ways mitigate 
the impact tariffs and these changes should completed within matter 
weeks first companies can take ownership components and integrate 
products hubs outside the for example hpq can take ownership 
parts and accessories flat panel displays that may used computers and 
integrate manufacturing facilities outside the thereby minimizing the 
need import the tariffed product second components such hard disk 
drives can ship from factories outside china even the initial stages 
production remain china for example stx has operations thailand 
malaysia and singapore that can used for final staging before shipping the 
while stx has limited production china and many customers already 
integrate hdds into final products outside the stx working with some 
multi national customers shift integration locations minimizing the impact 
tariffs importantly seagate does not expect negative impact financials 
printing plates letter press and flexographic printing machines are the 
proposed list taxes but largely relate legacy analog printing tariffs old 
technology may benefit the transition digital printing where companies like

efii and hpq are well positioned although parts copier and fax machines are 
the list believe tariffs will stand alone copier and fax machines 
which are small portion the hardcopy peripheral market copiers fax and 
printers for perspective idc estimates inc shipments with base 
configurations for copiers fax machines not printer configurations were 
only the company total hardcopy peripheral shipments server 
and enterprise storage systems are not the list tariffed products and 
note many vendors use contract manufacturers for assembly products 
outside the 
semiconductors direct impact from this next wave potential china tariffs 
our semiconductor coverage pretty limited the tariff list omits major 
semi product groups memory graphics cards etc and only has smart cards 
which relatively small product category overall annual 
semiconductor sales having said that the broader risk semiconductor 
companies the current prevailing tariff uncertainty would result broader 
demand slowdown leading lower customer orders well inventory 
drawdown the supply chain addition retaliation from china the 
regulatory front has implications for companies doing business the region 
well for approval process for semiconductor case point the 
qcom nxp transaction that was announced months ago caught the 
middle the china tariff situation and continues await ruling from 
chinese regulatory authorities last remaining approval needed for the deal the 
latest merger agreement between the two companies runs out july 
before the august comment review period for the new round 
announced tariffs 
networking with reference switching and routing systems think there 
potential for slight near term margin drag for csco jnpr anet the 
companies are compelled move assembly because they are unable 
pass through the tariffs via price increases shifting assembly non china 
geographies should relatively quick particularly given global footprint 
most contract manufacturers would expect near term impact also 
mitigated product headed customers outside the where tariffs would 
not apply non for csco non americas for jnpr non americas 
for anet not have accurate view concentration assembly for 
vendors within china apac general but note that all three likely least 
have some production china based current disclosures 
tvs and corning with references low end non high definition televisions 
there potential impact the low end china made market this small 
part corning display market given competition the low end chinabased manufactured glass cheaper float glass and result think that 
impact corning should minimal tariffs were expand larger tvs 
there could bigger impact given the new boe gen facility but first 
blush impact tariffs they stand should relatively small
