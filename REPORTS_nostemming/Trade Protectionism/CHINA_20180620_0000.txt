backed robust external demand and the bulk tightening may well past

mid year outlook slower but sustainable may latest developments 
suggest that policymakers are focused the potential impact from trade

chinese goods could translate into modest drag china 
gdp growth with the drag exports growth this case china could 
fine tune the pace deleveraging with rrr cuts open market injections higher 
loan quota and faster local government bond issuance this could boost banks 
balance sheet lending capability and partly offset the tightening shadow

fiscal easing likely worse case further escalated trade tensions the 
government said monday that would impose additional tariff another 
chinese goods should china make matching retaliation the section 
tariff chinese goods and added tuesday that prepared impose 
tariffs additional beyond that this could lift the direct growth impact 
china growth and the indirect impact could amplified the 
interconnected nature global trade this worse case further escalated trade 
tensions the tariff additional chinese goods policymakers may 
step fiscal support probably widening the fiscal deficit stabilize infrastructure 
investment and provide targeted tax cuts subsidies the corporate sector and 
consumers however given that policy support would take time pass through see 
downside risks our outlook slight moderation growth this scenario 
our view policymakers are unlikely encourage material currency depreciation 
mentioned yesterday pboc statement that rmb relative strength year date 
evidence good economic fundamentals instead believe policymakers could 
tolerate some modest depreciation usdcny amid dollar strength but rmb should 
not depreciate out line with the trade weighted dollar trend thus maintain our 
view that china will continue implement opening its capital markets and 
keep cny neer largely stable ensure steady capital flows
