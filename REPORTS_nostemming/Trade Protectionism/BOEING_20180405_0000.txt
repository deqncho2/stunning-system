way tariff goods including aircraft the

what happened china responded potential tariffs larger and 
quicker than expected manner after the market close april china 
ministry commerce announced potential tariff exceeding 
expectations though equal size actions under section and covering 
items across agriculture automotive chemicals and aerospace for 
aerospace the tariff would levied aircraft with empty weight exceeding 
but less than according boeing oew operating empty 
weight specification this range may include the max 
that said estimate the backlog max 
aircraft for china represents less than the total thus less impact 
than our initial bear case when combining this with negotiations that are ongoing between the two governments where our firm believes escalation 
priority for both parties see clearer path our 
previously noted are less concerned about the direct implications 
tariffs and more around confidence the outlook the tariff impact 
boeing isolated the and max which account for less than 
the backlog noted above the impact earnings limited addition 
disputes were escalate believe these aircraft could placed elsewhere 
given strong demand for narrowbodies per the years backlog however 
our view the valuation multiple impact may meaningful because china 
represents key growth market for global aviation fact studies from boeing 
indicate the market will represent aircraft deliveries over the next 
years and based recent years and per the exhibit below when cycle risk was 
concern shares the company traded closer fcf today 
but these concerns appear easing based host data points

however with escalation the expected path the risks are dissipating with 
apparent desire from chinese and policy makers for mutually beneficial 
outcome our firm base case escalation going forward which our view 
lowers the risk boeing having said that need monitor any collateral 
effects from negotiations aside from escalation which may include tighter 
credit market and elevated volatility that could pressure business well 
consumer sentiment looking forward public hearing the proposed tariff 
scheduled for may with the deadline for local companies raise objections 
set for may creating urgency for resolution over the coming months since 
final determination may made mid year and our firm believes 
additional response from china contingent upon formal response from the 
finally commentary from policy makers alludes negotiations already 
taking place 
pulling all together these market dynamics appear setting tactical 
buying opportunity assuming our firm views are correct and this situation ends 
with limited disruption and our view supply chain issues being temporary are 
accurate see scope for share price recovery addition given growth fcf 
and healthy execution date see clearer path our upside 
from current levels and premised our fcf accordingly 
will revisit our rating upon conclusion global trade policy updates though 
note the risk reward skew has improved near term for
