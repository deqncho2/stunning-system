new tariffs auto imports 
may the commerce department said statement that started 
investigation vehicle and auto parts imports determine whether they threaten 
impair national security under section the trade expansion act according 
may reuters report the administration considering additional automobile tariffs 
much for our industry analysts initial views pleaser refer auto parts 
media reports considering raising auto import tariffs domestic auto production 
falls negatives relatively large for nhk spring toyota boshoku and aisin shinji 
kakiuchi and kota mineshima may 
the has already imposed tariffs steel and aluminum imports under section 
and japanese exports have not been exempted from these tariffs despite japan being 
ally that said think this impact the japanese economy will almost 
negligible even before the section tariffs were rolled out japanese steel exports 
the were already subject high anti dumping tariffs and they now only account for 
less than japan total exports the moreover the products japan does 
export are niche products with low price elasticity the macro impact exports 
likely small enough subsumed into rounding errors 
exhibit automobiles are japan biggest export the japan biggest exports the

the imposing high tariffs auto imports realized would different ball game 
autos account for larger proportion japan exports the than steel exports 
the make around japan total exports and autos are japan biggest 
export the autos and auto parts accounted for around and 
japan exports the respectively japan input ouput table shows that reduction 
auto production should have widespread ripple effects various industries terms 
production and employment 
that said are skeptical whether the would actually apply high tariff rates 
auto imports for sustained period taking into account that trading partners would 
likely file complaints against the the wto and take retaliatory actions think 
more likely that the administration will use the possible tariffs autos 
negotiating leverage obtain better deal including starting negotiations for 
bilateral fta with japan the government announced its intention impose 
retaliatory tariffs japanese luxury cars under section the trade 
act the japanese government responded quickly filing complaint the wto and 
the tariffs were avoided last minute agreement after intense bilateral negotiations 
the japanese government notified the wto may its intention take action 
against import tariffs steel and aluminum products without identifying any 
specific products tariff rates our view has been that the likelihood japan actually 
imposing retaliatory tariffs products low this time the chances the 
japanese government becoming more open taking action could rise the should 
impose tariffs autos including japanese exports japanese and leaders have agreed 
set new bilateral trade talks between japan minister for economic revitalization 
toshimitsu motegi and trade representative robert lighthizer which are expected 
begin mid june thereafter along with the results the commerce 
department investigation assertions during these bilateral trade talks will also 
potential market catalysts and are thus worth watching closely 
the wake trade frictions the japanese automakers stepped their foreign 
direct investment north america quid pro quo designed avoid trade frictions 
even after the end the voluntary export restraint ver program which lasted for 
around years from japanese automakers continued restrain exports the 
opting for strategy that put priority local production and jobs the the 
standard textbook assessment that the ver program had cartel like effects both 
the japanese and automakers short the prices market autos rose and the 
resulting economic rents benefited not only the but the japanese automakers 
well while consumers were saddled with high prices exhibit japan 
passenger car export volume the and price per vehicle converted usd 
market rates both indexed based japanese trade statistics japan export 
volume has remained largely range bound while the export price per vehicle has 
continued rise substantially indicating that japanese auto exports the have 
been shifting toward higher value added models

next week key indicators for japan 
next week data releases include the labor survey employment referrals for general 
workers april current survey commerce april preliminary consumer confidence 
survey may industrial production april preliminary housing starts april and mof 
financial statements statistics corporations industry jan mar 
labor survey employment referrals for general workers april expect the april 
labor survey employment referrals for general workers tba may 
show the unemployment rate and the effective jobs applicants ratio 
employment rose significantly about workers qoq during jan mar bringing the 
unemployment rate down reversal the previous downtrend selfemployment contributed the sharp increase and think this growth hit lull from 
april therefore expect see roughly flat mom growth the unemployment rate 
meanwhile the number new jobseekers continues rise pointing modest 
increase the jobs applicants ratio

commerce tba may will show retail sales yoy marking 
contraction the rate growth compared the previous month april chainstore data 
released may indicated sales down yoy for the first negative growth six 
months same store sales basis for second consecutive month decline 
expect corresponding contraction retail sales growth 
consumer confidence survey may expect the may consumer confidence survey 
tba may show gradual improvement the consumer confidence index 
households outlook for six months ahead the april survey indices all categories 
were down but given that the rise fresh vegetable prices has abated and wages are 
steadily increasing conditions look ripe for turnaround consumer sentiment the 
cabinet office just downgraded its assessment trends weakening april and 
with only slight improvement likely may not expect its basic view change 
industrial production april preliminary expect the april index tba may 
rise for the third consecutive month with increase yoy despite 
sharp drop january the index recovered february and march with support from 
electronic components devices and transport machinery trade statistics released 
may showed significant real growth exports april and anticipate 
corresponding increase april industrial output
