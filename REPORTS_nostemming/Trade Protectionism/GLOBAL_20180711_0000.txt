what the likely impact global growth 
our estimates the direct impact global growth resulting from the two sets 
targeted tariffs and imports respectively would rise this include likely drag growth and growth impact 
china around 
more pronounced impact growth 
for the our prior analysis has shown that tariffs chinese imports 
and retaliatory tariffs exports china would have only modest negative 
impact growth around the latest proposed tariffs worth 
chinese imports and likely retaliatory measures from china would have more 
pronounced impact growth adding this latest round tariffs could have 
cumulative direct impact around off gdp growth 
secondary channels may important amplifier these direct effects financial 
market volatility and heightened uncertainty would add the drag the economy 
and potentially nonlinear way trade tensions escalate for example financial 
conditions have tightened moderately since the beginning the year escalating trade 
tensions and tariffs that affect broader range products and end markets may mean 
that financial conditions tighten potentially nonlinear way more tariffs are 
introduced similarly uncertainty arising from trade tensions can dampen both business 
and consumer activity number recent surveys including the ism manufacturing 
and nonmanufacturing indices for june have already indicated that worries around 
trade are already affecting domestic sentiment even trade tensions have not yet had 
materia impact hard economic data 
implications for monetary policy remain limited for the near term the june fomc 
minutes noted economic growth remains solid but downside risks the outlook from 
trade have risen believe that most policymakers still see the upside from fiscal 
stimulus counteracting the downside from trade and the message gradual removal 
accommodation remains intact over the medium term downside risks growth and 
upside risks inflation from tariffs would create conundrum for the fed which has 
balance near term inflation pressures and long term threats demand destruction but 
regarding trade tensions thus far fedspeak suggests will take significant inflation 
shock sway the fed from its gradual path policy tightening 
china watching downside risks 
for china the direct impact would likely amount while the indirect impact 
arising from supply chain complexities could add drag growth this may 
pose downside risks our current base line growth forecast please 
refer the china economics section for more detailed discussion 
negotiations still the endgame but protracted escalatory cycle 
underway 
the announcement further tariffs the july likely lead more 
protracted escalatory cycle with further tariff rounds other protectionist measures 
likely staying the horizon pointed out our chief public policy strategist 
michael zezas the duration these measures should now measured quarters not 
weeks 
continue expect negotiations and escalation the end outcome both 
parties have hinted their respective willingness engage further dialogue the ustr 
specifically pointed out its statement today that the past the united states 
willing engage efforts that could lead resolution the first time has stated 
statement with regard its major tariff actions announced implemented far 
nonetheless today announcement suggests that the process toward eventual 
resolution would more drawn out keeping trade tensions alive for longer 
countries threaten impose tariffs and other protectionist measures against each 
other and thus keeping the uncertainty trade policy alive the impact business 
confidence could become more substantial over time which would turn weigh the 
private investment outlook the minutes from the fed june meeting already 
highlighted that corporates expressed concern the possible effects tariffs 
future investment activities and that capital spending has been scaled back 
postponed result uncertainty trade policy some areas 
furthermore larger amount and variety goods are subject tariffs the related 
growth impact would likely amplified through supply chain channels two thirds 
global goods trade are related global value chains for example component suppliers 
not directly targeted trade measures and foreign affiliates with operations affected 
countries will also affected input costs for some manufacturers are already 
partly because the tariffs steel and aluminum imports

what the potential impact china gdp growth 
more meaningful growth impact proposed tariffs worth goods 
were implemented the existing tariffs chinese goods would 
have moderate drag china growth but estimate that the direct 
impact could rise the proposed tariff list released july 
implemented moreover the indirect impact could amplified the interconnected 
nature global trade our preliminary estimate suggests that this means additional 
drag china growth and would impose significant downside risk 
our current baseline growth forecast estimated 
what could china countermeasures 
given recent developments think that trade tensions would likely linger for longer 
response the move china ministry commerce said july that china 
would adopt countermeasures although detailed measures have not been announced 
yet the ministry commerce did highlight earlier statement june that 
china will have take powerful and comprehensive solutions both quantitative and 
qualitative ways should the adopt tariff additional chinese goods 
expect more details announced the coming days 
our view china may use combination tariff and non tariff barriers retaliation 
considering that china imported goods from the and that 
american goods are already subject tariffs china could impose 
additional tariffs american goods 
meanwhile non tariff measures the policy toolkit could include ranked 
possibility 
more stringent longer processing times for quality checks goods imports 
requesting soes reduce the purchase based software and financial 
services 
reducing service imports from the discouraging outbound tourism the 
reducing domestic sales particular products via administrative measures 
media impact and 
adopting tighter supervision business operations china the least possible 
approach could complicate china efforts opening its domestic market and 
attracting fdi 
that said maintain our long standing view that escalation will likely the end 
game through negotiations while the ustr added its july statement that 
the past the united states willing engage efforts that could lead resolution 
china ministry commerce said china still committed opening today 
suggesting room for further negotiation this particularly the case the and china 
are sharing more bilateral business interests beyond goods trade exhibit 
estimate that the firms revenue exposure china reached 
about times more than its exports china which amounted last year 
you include service exports this likely reflects that firms have 
benefited more from producing and selling products within china rather than 
exporting china

what are the policy implications 
fiscal and monetary easing should trade tensions escalate have held the view that 
the policy stance has turned neutral from tightening bias the past two years view 
the impact existing tariff list china economics what does pboc 
monetary policy committee meeting tell june however should the 
proposed tariff list implemented policymakers could take fiscal and 
monetary easing mitigate the impact growth specifically policymakers could 
increase fiscal support widening the fiscal deficit stabilize infrastructure 
investment and provide tax cuts subsidies the corporate sector and 
consumers the government could also accelerate the issuance local 
government special bonds part china quasi fiscal support and lift the 
issuance quota for special bonds 
ease monetary policy allowing modest rebound broad credit growth 
accommodate fiscal easing while policymakers could boost banks balance 
sheet lending capability conducting further rrr cuts open market injection 
higher loan quota and window guidance reduce lending rates smes they may 
slow the pace shadow bank tightening the margin 
implications for cny 
not think policymakers would use cny countermeasure trade measures 
recent weakness cny has been due market concerns about china growth 
slowdown amid rising trade tensions and market expectations china monetary 
easing that said believe policymakers are less likely encourage material currency 
depreciation reflecting this the pboc has kept the cny fixing rate relatively stronger 
than our model suggested over the past weeks exhibit and said july that sees 
some pro cyclical behavior recent rmb fluctuations meanwhile the lesson from 
august suggests that active material depreciation the cny could hurt market 
confidence and endanger china financial stability 
some cny depreciation risks the short term while our base case remains that 
usdcny could reach and end the shifting market 
expectation growth and policy stance amid increased trade tensions could lead 
overshooting risks the near term for instance the trade weighted cny index were 
reverse its gain from february mid june exhibit usdcny could depreciate 
another expect the pboc step intervention depreciation risk 
intensifies see china economics cny july
