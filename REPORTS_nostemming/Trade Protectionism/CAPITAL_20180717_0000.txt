management teams provide greater detail around the potential effect 
china tariffs although the bulk the proposed tariffs are still the 
discussion stage have already been implemented since july 
and directly affect product categories which estimate are 
intermediate capital goods this report draw the following conclusions 
capital goods will most affected the coverage list includes plastic 
tubing plates sheets motors diodes integrated circuits printed 
circuit boards pcb locomotive and rolling stock parts parts for use 
nuclear reactors resistors connectors all categories medical device 
components ray tubes gas turbines above and below 
all categories machine tools lighting components forklift trucks 
tariffs proceed china will slow our china based economist robin xing 
sees downside risk china gdp growth and additional from supply chain complexity china arguably the main driver for 
our sector accounting for sales average certain stocks that 
cover abb kone schneider have higher than average exposure 
though their products product flows may not directly impacted 
are most concerned about supply chain although need consider 
raw material and component costs the greatest risk see around 
supply chain disruption for example china supplies almost half the 
world supply printed circuit boards and one fifth all electronics 
due climate events asia have previously seen stockpiling and 
shortages 
investment views with capital goods sector still trading premium 
msci europe any downside evidence the reporting would not all 
welcome not believe correct think terms winners and losers 
from tariffs rather some industries products are directly affected larger 
companies electrical equipment may have more flexibility supply chain 
see greater risks the electrical segment versus machinery due 
availability components metals exposure needs examined case

tariff implications 
the earnings season approaches look for further clarification from our 
coverage companies possible effects the china trade actions implemented 
far the companies have spoken still appear the relatively early stages 
addressing these effects while some the direct financial exposures are quite 
limited believe that the indirect effects that could more meaningful our 
specific conclusions this report are 
capital goods the heart the tariff issue the that have already 
come into effect since july estimate relates intermediate capital 
equipment that directly relevant our coverage 
our china economist robin xing believes that the proposed tariffs proceed 
these could reduce gdp while there would additional drag 
from supply chain complexity 
capital goods companies are branded sub assemblers components 
accordingly increases certain product categories would have 
dampening effect margins 
our greatest concern around supply chains which are integrated now china 
supplies the world printed circuit boards and one fifth all electronic 
components 
sector implications not believe correct pick out winners and losers this 
scenario the consequences are generally not favourable would make the 
following general points certain industries are explicitly risk gas turbines 
transformers motors lighting these industries also have higher value items where 
there cross border flow some the larger electrical equipment companies have 
more flexible supply chains and may able redirect production more easily the 
greatest risk the electrical part the capital goods spectrum because this 
where component shortages would arise there are however more direct impacts 
automotive 
tariffs goods already place since july another 
under consideration 
further section investigation june the trade representative 
ustr announced that would impose valorem duty chinese 
products effective july and seek public comment further june 
china responded this initial action imposing just under tariffs 
goods which included agricultural products transport equipment and 
intermediate goods meat soybeans off road vehicles based the chinese 
response ustr subsequently indicated july that may impose further 
valorem duty additional chinese products the second proposed list 
covers multiple broad based categories including foodstuffs tuna mackerel 
herrings garlic vegetables coal chemical compounds lighting equipment air 
conditioning systems transmission belts consumer goods incl appliances there will

morgan stanley economists expect negative impact china gdp 
morgan stanley economists chetan ahya and robin xing conclude the 
imported from china last year announced implemented tariffs now cover 
almost half these imports with tariffs ranging from the total value 
trade affected tariffs equivalent global trade and 
global gdp including all potential retaliatory tariffs trade partners around 
global trade gdp could affected china specifically our economists 
expect impact gdp growth and additional drag from supply 
chain complexity the they believe that the gdp impact from the tariffs already 
place has limited negative impact however the latest proposed tariffs 
worth chinese imports and potential reciprocal actions were 
implemented our economists estimate the cumulative direct impact

obvious effect import tariffs steel aluminium many respects

automotive impact capital goods could also significant 
the administration has signalled that may also impose tariffs broader range 
products including automobiles and wider range countries not only 
china this currently under investigation and potential tariffs could implemented 
soon october given that autos the fourth largest end market our sector 
tariffs broad based auto imports could pose significant issues for capital goods 
companies terms the capacity the auto industry invest manufacturing 
capacity and pricing and volume dynamics for auto components the exhibit below 
shows the companies within our sector most directly exposed autos but 
appreciate that saw with the oil gas downturn there could well 
meaningful indirect impact too several regions may disproportionately exposed

limited trade precedents what can learn 
having looked the literature not believe that there are clear cut precedents 
for the current situation also think that the nature the supply chain more 
integrated than was before however the literature have examined the most 
well known precedent for tariff action was the smoot hawley tariff act june 
this imposed tariffs nearly different items from europe and was 
met reciprocal action exports fell from the next three 
years consequence president reagan also introduced quotas which 
affected asian automobile imports but this was not sufficient offset the loss 
manufacturing jobs between lastly president george bush also 
introduced steel tariffs but these were removed quite quickly steel 
employment has fallen from persons 
also looked academic study kevin hendricks and vinod singhal 
published november which examined the long term stock price effects and 
equity risk effects supply chain disruptions based sample disruptions 
announcements made during the study looks the stock price effects 
starting one year before through two years after the disruption announcement date 
while this just one study and the outcome may have been different with different 
sample and time period this analysis shows that the average abnormal returns 
companies that experienced disruptions was nearly with much the 
underperformance the year before the day and the year after the announcement 
the volatility also increased around the announcement date with average 
increase year after the announcement 
note however that supply chain disruptions have historically stemmed more from 
weather related conditions accidents even driven initial faulty design 
human error which nature are difficult predict control ahead time compared with the current discussion tariffs which ongoing and will decided
