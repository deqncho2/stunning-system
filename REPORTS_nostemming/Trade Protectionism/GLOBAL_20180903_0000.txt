global trade could affected next round tariffs implemented 
the likely implement tariffs additional imports 
from china this would bring the total value goods affected tariffs

implementation tariffs chip away growth assess the growth 
impact simulated the tariffs using our global input output model thereby 
updating our earlier analysis the modelled initial impact global growth 
however existing trade measures already pose drag 
global growth the incremental drag from the new measures would 
estimate this impact should evaluated against the starting point still 
healthy global gdp and trade growth 
but policy response would likely triggered mitigating the growth impact 
peg the modelled initial growth impact from the first and second rounds 
tariffs the and china and respectively expect that 
implemented this latest set tariffs would likely trigger meaningful policy 
response from china which has already embarked path defensive easing 
specifically expect china take steps that would lift broad credit growth 
around from the current and the fiscal deficit gdp from 
current this would help mitigate the growth impact and peg the 
final impact including the policy response china and global gdp growth 
rates and respectively the think the federal reserve 
will stay its rate hike path but will likely sound more cautious about lifting 
rates into restrictive territory policy makers start incorporate these 
additional tariffs their baseline scenario 
what watch next the exact date implementation tariffs still unknown 
the comment period ends september and the final list products could 
announced shortly after that recent reports suggest that the date 
implementation could come early this week beginning sep there 
possibility that this round tariffs will implemented two stage process 
similar that for the first set tariffs announced june which were finally 
implemented early july the implementation process follows the previous 
timeline the final list products could released early sep with full 
implementation this round tariffs mid october

further tariffs likely implemented 
set implement tariffs imports from china the likely 
push ahead and implement tariff its list imports from china worth 
which first published july with regard the section 
investigation this addition the tariffs that have already been implemented 
worth imports from china given that the imported about 
goods from china last year the tariffs targeting china that have been 
announced implemented far will cover almost half all imports from the 
country compared the list imports which primarily targeted capital 
goods the list released july also covers consumer items such household 
electronics some materials related products are also included such leather 
products note that the final list items could differ from the list announced 
july this was indeed the case for the earlier round tariffs 
what the timeline for implementation the office the trade representative 
ustr ended its six days public hearings the proposed list imports from china 
worth aug the period for written comments due expire sep 
note that the previous round tariffs the implementation the tariffs 
happened two stage manner with the first stage implemented jul after the 
period written comments closed may the process implementation follows 
the previous timeline the final list products could released around early sep with 
full implementation this round tariffs mid october 
china response response actions china announced would impose 
weighted average tariff imports from addition the previous 
tariffs imports compared the list imports which 
include agricultural products passenger cars and chemical products the tariff 
list includes mostly intermediate inputs and some capital goods 
global trade could affected including potential retaliatory tariffs trade 
partners the total value goods affected tariffs could rise which 
would represent global trade global gdp these measures are 
implemented this would significant increase from the current affected value

assessing the impact 
tariffs china likely affect asia highly integrated supply chain 
globally asia remains among the world largest exporters accounting for 
global exports more importantly asia supply chain highly integrated with 
intraregional exports accounting for total asia exports according 
adb regional integration index asia has higher trade and investment integration levels 
than the latam and africa this will likely amplify the impact the tariffs china 
reverberates across the asian supply chain 
looking the proposed tariff list worth goods find that the 
computer electronic and optical products sector and the machinery and equipment 
sector together account for around the list value terms intraregional exports 
electronic and machinery product categories included the tariff list 
account for asia intraregional exports this reflects the key roles the 
electronic products and machinery sectors asia production networks 
this context that analyse the growth impact revisit the input output model 
used previously allows capture the direct impact demand and its 
spillover effects for more details the model and methodology please see our 
previous report global economics global supply chain impact who most exposed 
july 
results initial impact growth policy response and final 
impact 
estimating the growth impact 
provide initial modelled impact global growth through our quantitative 
analysis below taking into account the initial tariff impact well domestic and 
international supply chain effects these model results are based the global inputoutput model replicating our earlier approach 
the growth impact the tariffs imports will likely meaningful 
expect this trigger policy response considering that the growth impact china 
more meaningful expect much more significant policy response there then 
present final growth impact which combines both the initial impact and the offset 
growth from the stimulus measures for summary the results please see exhibit 
scenario impact 
our scenario status quo the initial impact growth would manageable globally and for the and china respectively given the 
relatively limited near term growth implications the fed would likely continue its 
path gradual removal accommodation and broad credit growth china would 
likely stabilize around considering that expect limited 
policy response this scenario the final impact growth would unchanged from 
the initial modelled impact 
our scenario escalation the initial impact growth would increase 
globally for the and for china trade tensions rise think the 
fed would turn more cautious pushing rates into restrictive territory china 
expect policy makers cushion the impact via monetary and fiscal easing lifting broad 
credit growth end now and the fiscal deficit gdp 
now this would result final growth impact and for the 
global economy and china respectively but the growth impact would remain 
unchanged 
our scenario significant escalation would expect more visible drag 
growth globally for the and for china while the fed would 
likely view the price effects from tariffs transitory policymakers would concerned 
about sharper tightening financial conditions which could potentially happen 
nonlinear way china think the policy response would result acceleration 
broad credit growth end and the fiscal deficit would probably further 
widen gdp this would result lower final growth impact and for the global economy and china respectively 
finally our scenario full blown escalation our most severe scenario the initial 
impact global gdp would estimated the impact growth would 
also more than double scenario while would for china the 
measurable reduction the growth outlook coupled with downside risks from financial 
market volatility and risk aversion would increase the likelihood that the fed would 
revert more dovish stance and pause policy tightening indefinitely china broad 
credit growth would likely accelerate end and the fiscal deficit should 
reach gdp this would result lower final growth impact and for the global and chinese economies respectively

due the large domestic and international supply chain effects following the initial 
impact from tariffs notably major decline demand mining and quarrying 
envisaged the most extreme scenario would have significant negative repercussions 
for global commodity prices 
computers electronic optical products ranks the most exposed sector scenario 
while also ranking the top most exposed sectors other scenarios aside from 
large initial tariff impact the sector would face large supply chain impacts especially 
scenarios and geographical basis the impact the computers electronic 
optical products sector greatest for taiwan china and korea highlighting the 
integrated asia electronics supply chain impact discussed the above section

uncertainties related final economic impact 
before while our approach enables estimate global supply chain effects from 
import tariffs there are other uncertainties which could affect the eventual impact 
the economy these include second round effects domestic demand lower margins 
higher prices and increased uncertainty translate into weaker corporate investment 
hiring and household consumption and the longer term impact productivity and 
potential gdp growth from lower investment and possible dislocation supply 
chains 
the flip side smaller than assumed pass through tariff hikes import prices 
and other mitigating factors such some policy response subsidies monetary policy 
and fiscal policy response could partly offset the global drag gdp 
another mitigating factor could some substitution the affected imports with 
imports from other countries china being able partially substitute soybean 
imports from the with imports from other countries and exporters may find 
alternative buyers the may export more soybeans and lng the instead 
relatedly over the longer term companies could seek shift production facilities away 
from the countries affected tariffs this would result relative shift demand 
from affected countries towards countries which are not affected tariffs exhibit 
shows the top products the list chinese imports 
key trading partners suggests that should the reduce imports from china demand 
could diverted elsewhere potentially benefitting china competitors the 
market such canada latin american countries japan germany and south korea 
from country perspective exchange rate dynamics could play important role 
terms the pass through domestic prices and impact financial conditions the 
case the for example further escalation trade tensions would likely 
accompanied continued usd strength and tightening financial conditions which 
would worsen the impact the case china could see further weakening 
cny which would partly help offset the impact exports

note this exhibit shows the top products the list chinese imports that could subject tariffs 
evaluating recent developments global context 
while our base case that global growth should stay above trend trade tariffs 
implemented will likely chip away global growth according the magnitudes that 
have laid out however acknowledge that underlying demand strong this 
juncture and that far the incoming data consistent with the view that the starting 
point global end demand and trade growth strong indeed asia export growth 
trend was strong going into july and the most recent release korea august trade 
data suggests that trade volumes picked further mom seasonally 
adjusted basis from mom the previous month the same time while the 
impact related trade tensions still overhang china acknowledge that 
there has been some progress between the and its other trade partners such 
renegotiation nafta and negotiations with the

the announced tariff measures billion chinese goods combined with 
section tariffs steel and aluminum mean drag china gdp growth 
estimate that the initial demand impact from the affected sectors mainly 
parts and components machinery and electronics sectors would drag down china 
growth merely that said the impact from repercussions along the domestic 
and global supply chain would weigh down growth further 
the inflation front china commensurate import tariff hikes response tariffs 
billion chinese goods could lift domestic cpi inflation assuming 
full pass through the tariff rate hike into domestic prices the key driver would 
tariff hike soybeans china billion list china 
soybean consumption imported and could difficult fully shift away other 
suppliers given that china soybean imports million tonnes exceeded the world exus exports million tonnes conversely china import tariff hike other 
american goods such energy and autos could have negligible impact domestic 
inflation given relatively small shares these imports domestic consumption 
domestic policy response 
our view the broad credit growth official tsf equity financing government bond 
financing could the best measure the fiscal and monetary policy stance with 
slowdown broad credit growth pointing tightening and vice versa estimate that 
increase broad credit growth could lift real gdp growth 
the status quo scenario expect policymakers continue with defensive easing 
measures keep the economy the path soft landing gdp growth moderate 
slightly from yoy and with rebound 
infrastructure investment growth from cushioning the potential slowdown 
exports and corporate capex indeed have seen series defensive easing measures 
since june when china trade tensions increased see exhibit specifically see 
the following measures 
boost banks balance sheet lending capability this includes more open market 
injections relaxation macro prudential assessment rules expanded list 
eligible collateral for medium term lending facilities mlfs and higher loan quota 
accelerate issuance local government bonds facilitate funding for 
infrastructure investment china ministry finance issued guidance 
august ordering local governments use their annual special 
bond issuance quota end sep and most the remaining quota 
end oct turn local governments have issued special bonds 
net basis over the past two weeks net issuance the january 
mid august period and further special bonds will issued the 
next two months meanwhile china securities journal reported august that 
policymakers may reduce risk weighting for local government bonds which 
would boost banks capital base spur bond purchases 
flexibility shadow banking china released the detailed amp rule july 
while showed intention reverse the financial clean efforts fine tuned 
some terms such allowing publicly offered products invest non standard 
credit assets nscas think this could part policymakers efforts 
prevent over tightening and stabilize credit growth

infrastructure project approvals recent weeks particularly for railway and 
subway projects while local media reported that china has raised its railway 
investment target set the start the year the 
ndrc has resumed approvals for metro projects for the first time since november 
starting with projects changchun august and suzhou august 
this context expect the fiscal policy stance turn neutral from

completed fiscal deficit down gdp july trailing basis its peak 
level and our forecast meanwhile policymakers will 
likely continue with the aforementioned measures stabilize broad credit growth

should the impose tariff its proposed list additional billion

while the initial tariff shock could modest the indirect impact 
from the interconnected domestic and global supply chain could bring down growth 
further imposing downside risks our current baseline growth forecast

cumulatively 
domestic policy response 
assuming that policymakers would maintain gdp growth broad credit 
growth would need rebound end reducing the tariff

government could widen the fiscal deficit currently

meanwhile policymakers could continue boost banks balance sheet lending 
capability and slow the pace shadow bank tightening 
scenario significant escalation 
what could china countermeasures 
this scenario where the imposes universal tariff all goods imports from 
china assume china could match this with tariff all goods imports from 
the meanwhile china may also consider some non tariff measures our view 
possible measures the policy toolkit are ranked possibility 
more stringent longer processing times for quality checks goods imports 
requesting soes reduce purchases based software and financial services 
reducing service imports from the discouraging outbound tourism the 
reducing domestic sales particular products via administrative measures 
media impact adopting tighter supervision business operations china 
highly unlikely could complicate china efforts attract fdi 
growth and inflation impact 
universal tariff the all chinese goods could drag down china growth 
within this the initial growth impact from tariff hikes would likely 
while the cumulative growth impact from the repercussive effect along the 
domestic and global supply chain would pick meanwhile should china 
respond with universal tariff all goods imports from the this could 
translate into increase china headline import prices lifting china cpi 
inflation 
domestic policy response 
assuming policymakers would reduce the tariff shock growth half 
broad credit growth would need jump end around its 
growth level early with meaningful stimulus package and considerable 
monetary easing the government could widen the fiscal deficit gdp 
and more than double the annual quota local government special bonds issued 
boost infrastructure investment cut vat corporate tax and consumption tax more 
meaningfully and provide higher subsidy private corporates the monetary 
front policymakers may postpone some the financial clean efforts deferring 
the implementation the new amp rule and adopt more measures engineer 
material rebound bank loan growth 
scenario full blown escalation 
what could china countermeasures 
more aggressive response the tariff hike all goods imports from 
china china could match with the action with the same tariff amount 
rather than tariff rate other words china could respond with universal 
tariff all goods imports from the meanwhile aforementioned china could 
consider taking some non tariff measures that said think china unlikely 
restrict firms business operations china which would complicate china efforts 
attracting fdi 
growth and inflation impact 
while our estimate scenario suggests that universal tariff the all 
goods imports from china could weigh down china growth china response 
with tariff all goods imports from the could bring additional growth 
drag from global supply chain lifting the cumulative growth impact meanwhile china tariff action could translate into increase china 
headline import prices leading one time boost headline cpi inflation 
considering that the price shock transitory nature the supply side not 
think would constrain policy easing this cycle 
domestic policy response 
similar scenario assume policymakers would reduce the tariff shock half 
with aggressive fiscal and monetary easing measures lifting broad credit growth

potential impact china policy 
cny could return regime relative stability trade weighted terms our base 
case have held the view that the sharp depreciation cny from mid june endjuly has been triggered concerns about trade tensions and the potential divergence 
between the and china monetary policy rather than reflection weaker macro 
fundamentals the trade weighted cny cny neer has largely reversed its divergence 
with the trade weighted usd from february mid june and stabilized since the end 
july amid pboc intervention besides the hike reserve requirement ratio 
forwards trading early august and bloomberg reported moves raise the offshore 
yuan funding cost put pressure cny short positions the pboc also confirmed 
august that has reused counter cyclical factors yuan fixing august hedge 
the pro cyclical sentiment the market 
this context believe rmb will probably return regime relative stability 
the trade weighted exchange rate other words the broad trade weighted usd 
depreciates rmb should appreciate against usd 
but some further depreciation likely trade tensions escalate further should trade 
tensions further escalate where the tariff hikes could lead further downside risks 
growth policymakers may allow some cny depreciation offset the impact and 
impose stricter restrictions capital outflows 
not expect material currency depreciation one off devaluation while weaker 
cny may partly offset the potential impact from tariff hikes significant currency 
depreciation could raise the risk self fulfilling stress outflows and financial 
conditions tightening suggested the lesson from that time while the 
pboc emphasised that the policy intention changing the fixing rate mechanism was 
not conduct meaningful one off cny depreciation the market self fulfilling 
expectations imposed challenges for the pboc intervene and stabilise the currency 
meanwhile disorderly currency depreciation would also jeopardise china efforts 
promote rmb internationalisation and capital account liberalisation our view 
what could china offer part trade deal bull case 
while our base case has been protracted escalatory cycle bull case china could 
accelerate economic reforms and opening reaching trade deal with the and 
calling off the implemented proposed tariffs the soft agreement the first three 
rounds trade talks which focused low hanging fruit china importing goods 
was withdrawn the administration potential deal may include meaningful cut 
china trade deficit and address issues related its intellectual property rights 
ipr practices and china domestic market access particular the deal may include 
larger deficit reduction china may promise bigger number than offered early 
june bilateral talks wsj reported increasing imports 
agriculture energy and manufacturing products and provide more tariff cuts 
consumer goods imports 
further opening china could open its domestic financial services and 
manufacturing sectors foreign firms with faster implementation the 
liberalization timetable announced bo forum april and reduction 
negative list for foreign enterprises 
adjusting industrial policy china could make its industrial policy more inclusive 
and coherent ensure the business interest foreign enterprises this could 
include equal treatment tax policy market access and government procurement 
for domestic and foreign enterprises less government intervention business 
operation and smoother procedure for foreign enterprise business expansion and 
license application 
enhancing ipr protection china could step protection revising the relevant 
laws and regulations including the patent law could also further relax the joint 
venture shareholding requirement for foreign firms the manufacturing 
particularly autos chemical and service sectors reduce concerns the 
practice technology transfers 
promoting market oriented reforms china could pledge accelerate marketoriented reforms providing more market access private sectors continuing 
with soe reforms and increasing market transparency that said such structural 
reforms may take longer time materialize 
assessing the impact tariffs 
ellen zentner robert rosener 
tariff measures put place date are likely lead only modest drag gdp 
growth around the cumulative effects could increase the additional 
billion tariff list implemented but rounded basis the impact remains 
similar more severe scenario consider scenario significant escalation 
where tariffs are applied across the board against china and china responds with its 
own broad based tariff the cumulative growth impact could increase 
finally the most extreme scenario consider where tariffs are applied all 
goods imports from china and proportionate response applied against exports 
the cumulative growth impact could much 
consequently further escalation trade tensions raises downside risks our baseline 
growth forecast all else equal the growth profile remains 
largely intact strength growth provides offset potentially slower rate 
growth impacts inflation are somewhat more contained estimate that 
tariffs will lift core pce inflation the more severe scenarios which 
consider downside risks the outlook increase policy makers will likely feel even

source morgan stanley research estimates 
scenario status quo 
growth impact china measures response the billion tariffs would 
have negative impact gdp growth the direct impact from reduced 
demand for affected exports would amount and would seen most 
significantly agricultural sectors and manufacturing chemicals and chemical 
products indirect impacts would transmitted through the domestic and global 
supply chain and estimate that these secondary effects would reduce gdp growth 
additional 
this scenario believe that the net impact may modest but could more 
noticeable the quarterly growth pattern and early gdp growth 
was reported strong pace boosted part contribution from net trade 
that reflected some stockpiling behaviour that occurred before these tariffs were 
implemented exports soybeans for example rose nearly annualised 
pace the three months through may some payback likely occur 
result although smoothing through this volatility the headline gdp growth rate the 
net effects are likely remain quite modest especially with respect the private 
domestic economy 
pass through into financial conditions another important channel consider this 
scenario particularly this initial round tariffs has contributed recent usd 
strength and financial market volatility that together have acted tighten financial 
conditions turn while the tightening financial conditions has been fairly modest 
date all else equal these factors could amount additional drag gdp 
growth 
inflation impact inflationary impacts would primarily transmitted through the higher 
costs imported goods that the has placed under tariffs scenario which entails 
tariff measures against billion imports from china covers very few 
consumer goods indeed only about the products the billion chinese 
goods list are consumer goods other products represent more intermediate inputs and 
capital goods where cost changes are more likely absorbed the production chain 
substituted away from consequently estimate the inflation impact very 
small lifting core pce inflation negligible amount about 
domestic policy response implications for monetary policy remain limited for the near 
term the august fomc stated noted economic growth has been strong policymakers have noted increased risks the outlook from trade but believe that most 
still see the upside from fiscal stimulus counteracting the downside from trade and 
the message gradual removal accommodation remains intact 
over the medium term downside risks growth and upside risks inflation from 
tariffs would create conundrum for the fed which has balance near term inflation 
pressures and long term threats demand destruction but regarding trade tensions 
thus far fedspeak suggests that will take significant inflation impact sway the fed 
from its gradual path policy tightening 
scenario escalation 
growth impact proposed action from china response additional tariffs the has 
proposed against billion imports from china would lead greater though 
still muted drag growth implemented these measures would result 
cumulative drag growth estimate that the direct effects would 
amount drag growth felt wider ranging set industries including 
the agricultural sector food manufacturing manufacturing chemicals manufacturing 
computers electronic opticals and manufacturing transportation equipment 
secondary indirect effects propagated through the domestic and global supply chain 
would bring down growth another 
the bulk these tariffs would not likely implemented until the effect 
growth would felt mostly raising some downside risk our baseline 
forecast for growth 
these tariffs are implemented would expect that the effects financial 
conditions via usd strength financial market volatility and equity market valuations 
might become more significant further tightening financial conditions could result 
additional drag growth that magnifies downside risks the economic outlook 
moreover expect the effect these tariffs core pce inflation modest 
further usd strength would act counter any upside core pce inflation and could 
lead net neutral impact inflation hence the predominant concern for the fed 
would downside risks the growth outlook while any upside risks the inflation 
outlook would attenuated the usd response 
inflation impact the proposed tariffs billion worth chinese imports 
include about consumer goods therefore see meaningfully greater channels 
for potential pass through into higher prices estimate that this could lift core pce 
inflation about the end 
domestic policy response this scenario the conundrum facing the fed would 
somewhat more pronounced with downside risks growth and upside risks inflation 
pushing the dual mandate opposite directions some positive fiscal impulses will 
remain place however primarily through higher government spending caps 
result even after accounting for the drag growth from the tariffs gdp growth 
likely remain above potential and with rising inflation the fed would likely feel that 
continued gradual rate hikes are appropriate these trade related downside risks the 
growth outlook may increase policy makers caution about how far and how fast 
push rates into restrictive territory 
scenario significant escalation 
growth impact this more severe scenario tariffs are applied across the board 
against china and china responds placing tariff all goods the impact 
growth would more significant amounting cumulative drag gdp 
growth with direct demand impact adding secondary indirect drag the effects the tariffs ripple through the domestic and global supply chain 
inflation impact this scenario includes more expansive list products under tariffs 
and increases the channels for inflationary pass through into consumer prices 
estimate that this scenario could raise core pce inflation the end 
domestic policy response greater restraint growth would raise downside risks 
the outlook making policy makers even more cautious about pushing interest rates 
beyond neutral policy setting moreover policy makers may lean towards more 
dovish stance guard against more pernicious tightening financial conditions that 
could occur potentially non linear way more tariffs are introduced such 
tightening financial conditions could raise the downside risks for growth even further 
beyond what considered here 
scenario full blown escalation 
growth impact this severe scenario where tariffs are applied all goods 
imports from china and proportionate response applied against exports china 
places broad based tariffs all goods the impact growth would 
much more material amounting cumulative drag gdp growth with 
direct demand impact adding secondary indirect drag amplified 
through the domestic and global supply chain this scenario positive fiscal impulses 
from tax reform and higher government spending would significantly offset the 
negative effects from trade frictions 
inflation impact this most expansive tariff scenario the impact inflation matches 
that scenario significant escalation only the china response changes 
estimate that this scenario could raise core pce inflation the end 
domestic policy response likely that worst case scenario for trade policy would 
come alongside meaningful tightening financial conditions and dampening risk 
sentiment that would put further pressure growth while the fed might feel 
pressured higher inflation full meaningful reduction the growth outlook and 
looming downside risks from financial market volatility and risk aversion would raise the 
risk that the fed pauses its policy tightening indefinitely and reverts more dovish 
policy stance
