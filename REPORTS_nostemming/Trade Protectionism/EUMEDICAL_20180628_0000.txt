assessing tariff implications 
with medtech trading all time highs little appears priced 
for tariff risk assess the impact announced tariffs and 
provide theoretical framework for ranking subsectors and 
companies exposure any future tariffs 
china tariffs solving complex equation 
july the will impose tariff chinese goods the 
ustr also identifying chinese goods for tariff medtech 
included the and the list expands more devices could included 
despite this medtech valuations have risen sharply the past months 
year high most companies have provided little guidance far and solving 
for the potential impact complex however interrogating chinese tariff 
lists analyzing medtech trade imbalances and consulting tariff experts have 
outlined framework for identifying companies and subsectors that are exposed 
further potential tariffs 
medtech implications from announced tariffs 
based tariff decisions focusing diagnostic imaging and radiation 
equipment which come into effect july believe two companies are 
most affected philips and siemens healthineers see the most likely nearterm consequences for the industry immediate reduction gross margin 
for products entering the from china and possible delays order deliveries 
impacting organic growth and order bookings calculating the financial impact 
challenging but our analysis sales exposures and production locations 
indicates low single digit earnings implications for philips and siemens 
healthineers this prior any meaningful response from the companies 
theoretical tariff risk framework what look for 
most exposed subsectors while acknowledging the difficulty predicting how 
trade disputes will play out provide indicative tariff risk framework using 
china trade imbalances starting point identify which medical device 
subsectors are exposed the risk future tariffs our framework suggests 
the electro diagnostic monitoring hearing aids orthopedics and wound care 
subsectors are most exposed based their high import exposure high 
proportion chinese import value the and large trade deficit value 
radiation equipment looks exposed this risk well but relatively large 
trade surplus from the china provides offset 
most exposed companies extending our framework companies assess 
revenue exposure china manufacturing footprint product diversification and 
restructuring experience our framework suggests companies most exposed 
future tariff risk are store nord sonova and philips less exposed are

executive summary 
the escalation china trade tensions has implications for medical devices the 
the world largest medical device market and china the biggest growth 
opportunity for many medtech companies yet medtech valuations have been 
propelled year highs recent months suggesting that the potential 
implications tariffs are not material while they are difficult quantify and 
predict with any accuracy not think they are immaterial especially for 
companies that have large proportion their manufacturing base china 
try gauge the magnitude risk medtech companies have looked 
detail the product lines that will subject tariffs from july and how 
this could impact the companies concerned have also analysed china trade 
imbalances subsector inform theoretical tariff risk exposure framework 
while acknowledge the challenges predicting how trade disputes will play 
out and the impact individual companies think this framework provides 
indicative ranking which subsectors and companies could most exposed 
the introduction further tariffs the situation complex and the detail 
important also provide overview the current china tariff situation 
our framework outlined section assesses the exposure medtech 
potential tariffs using three lines analysis cross referencing medtech 
products against wto product codes from both the and china proposed tariff 
lists derive current and potential tariff rates for each product line for both 
countries analysis trade flow data from the international trade statistics 
database derive the volume and value imports for each medtech product 
between the and china and other major trading partners and analysis 
historical trade imbalances for the products between and china derive 
overall supply trends for each sector combine these factors produce 
total theoretical tariff risk exposure score subsector and company under our 
coverage 
medtech trading all time highs 
the medtech sector has performed strongly over the past months helped 
multiple expansion across many its constituents valuations have expanded highs with the year forward consensus moving the year average 
the relative valuation compared the european market msci has 
followed similar trend hitting year high the year average the 
relative valuation multiple expansion difficult reconcile with underlying 
fundamentals that are largely unchanged estimate the sector will deliver 
organic sales growth per annum over the next three years and earnings growth 
around constant currency

the and chinese markets are arguably the most important for many medtech 
companies the the largest and most profitable medical device market the world 
while china offers the biggest growth opportunity over the medium long term 
despite the recent escalation china trade tensions and proposed introduction 
tariffs from july the sector valuation has increased further and note that 
medical devices are not immune further tariff increases 
china tariff developments are fluid and there are also trade tensions between the 
and europe note that hearing aids were initially included the preliminary list 
products subject tariff published april but were removed from 
the final tariff list published the office the trade representative ustr 
june june the ustr released statement support further 
chinese goods receive additional tariff after regular legal process 
with this backdrop are surprised that valuations have run new highs suggesting 
that the potential for more negative china tariff developments not priced 
make the observation that there are number stocks for which china major 
production hub such philips and the hearing aid sector but where valuations over 
the past three months have continued expand with apparent risk adjustment for 
tariff enactment potential escalation

recent developments 
march president trump stated that the ustr would publish list products 
for intended tariff increase address the acts policies and practices china that 
are unreasonable discriminatory and that burden restrict commerce the 
preliminary list products subject additional tariff was announced 
april and included chinese import goods affecting product lines with 
least goods categorized under the medtech sector june the ustr gave 
further details which included revised list products splitting the list into two 
sets tariff lines the duty applied the first set lines 
july including least medical device product lines the second list lines will 
through further review public notice and comment process before the federal 
agency decides whether proceed with tariffs 
medical devices included first tariff round 
according the ustr press release the first set contains product lines covering 
imports from china including medtech products imported from 
china that are relevant our covered companies the second set lines covers 
imports from china this set lines targets imports that are due benefit 
from the made china industrial policy policy designed transform china 
into leading manufacturing power with particular focus the development highend medical devices across sectors such diagnostic imaging robotic surgery wearable 
devices and telemedicine note that this second list does not contain any complete 
medical instruments and analysis many the product lines are primary and 
intermediatory goods such polymers motors electric conductors and processors 
further june the ustr released statement following china response its 
june announcement support further chinese goods receive 
additional tariff the ustr will announce the additional tariffs due course 
after regular legal process similar the above events 
medtech implications based current tariff decisions 
our view the most likely near term consequences for the industry from the 
introduction tariffs july include immediate reduction gross margin for 
products entering the from china and delay delivery orders any company 
responses are likely take time implement given the complexities involved 
adapting supply chains well the uncertainty implicit any trade negotiations 
however some mitigation through redirecting product could possible the short

theoretical tariff risk framework exposure subsector 
given the evolving situation around china trade tariffs have attempted assess 
which subsectors might exposed the risk additional future tariffs although 
acknowledge the limitations this analysis given the inherent unpredictability trade 
negotiations think provides indicative ranking subsectors exposed the risk

point based china trade flow alone view the electro diagnostic monitoring 
hearing aid and wound care subsectors those most exposed the risk further 
tariffs based their high import exposure high proportion chinese import value

overview tariff situation 
april the trade representative ustr released section proposal 
for tariff hike worth targeted imports from china affecting 
product lines including least goods categorized medical devices june 
the ustr refined the list products comprising lines begin 
collecting duty from july and further lines that will through further 
review before potentially proceeding with tariffs the updated list includes least 
goods categorized medical devices compared with the initial and these 
are included the product lines the proposed action the first set 
lines worth additional duty over any existing tariff rate 
response the initial section proposal from the april china 
announced tariff hike products including soybeans cars and aircraft 
however china list does not include medical devices china second tariff hike 
response june does identify medical devices potential area for tariff 
however they are only included second list which due finalized 
later date there currently import duty most medical devices imported 
from the china 
acknowledge that further escalation the breadth and depth tariffs 
possible over the coming weeks however this point assess the impact only 
the currently proposed tariffs where know the product lines that will 
included also provide framework this report assess potential exposure 
any further tariffs products within our coverage they materialize 
medtech product due begin collecting duty 
the tariff discussions are evolving area and there limited certainty which 
product lines will command higher tariffs case point the difference between the 
preliminary list product lines and the products identified june this 
was marked difference for medtech between the product lists with the initial list 
containing directly relevant product lines while the second list there were 
exhibit outline those product that are included and for cross reference exhibit 
outline those product lines that were removed from the list june the 
final list from the ustr firmly targets large healthcare related capital equipment 
products and equipment and includes 
diagnostic imaging equipment including scanners mri systems and ultrasound 
which are most relevant siemens healthineers and philips 
radiation equipment most relevant elekta siemens healthineers and philips 
should noted that may congress led bipartisan effort urge the ustr 
exempt close worth medical devices from the proposed tariffs this effort 
appears have had some impact the first set product lines given number 
medtech products were removed from the list june these include 
catheters relevant for coloplast and convatec 
dental equipment relevant straumann 
hearing aids relevant store nord william demant and sonova 
orthopedics most relevant smith nephew 
wound care most relevant convatec and smith nephew and lesser 
extent coloplast 
while this second set currently excluded from the lists outlined june the 
ustr are due identify additional product lines receive tariff 
therefore possible that some these initially identified products will included the 
ustr will announce the additional tariffs due course after comment period and 
legal process our framework later this report seeks identify which subsectors and 
companies are most exposed potential further tariffs 
china medtech product due begin collecting duty 
response the ustr announcement june china finance ministry issued 
tariff hike response goods also covering exports from the with 
tariff and split into two lists the first list includes product categories covers 
equal starting july and includes variety agricultural products and 
automobiles the second list product lines worth will begin later date 
due announced and include other goods such coal crude oil gasoline and 
medical equipment the number medtech products within this second list more 
limited than the list however includes some common products 
diagnostic imaging equipment including mri systems and electro diagnostic 
equipment which are most relevant siemens healthineers philips and getinge 
radiation equipment most relevant elekta siemens healthineers and philips 
highlight that these product lines are only included the second list for which the 
final measures and effective date will announced later date 
tariffs regulation make powerful disincentive for local buyers 
purchase internationally 
recent years the chinese government have released series policies and guidelines 
support the development the medical device industry for example chapter 
the five year plan laid out the ministry finance china emphasised the 
build out hospitals rural areas with medical devices sourced from domestic players 
most recently the made china policy launched may has the aim 
promoting domestic manufacturing the program supports the innovation and 
industrialization the medical device industry again with the desire increase the 
significance domestic players the emphasis supporting domestic manufacturing 
coupled with the tariffs could result more local sourcing medical device products 
from chinese manufacturers and loss share for multinationals

goods ranging from alcohol motorbikes this list does not include medical devices 
summary 
import tariffs have not played major role doing business between the and china 
over the years for many medical device companies the lower labor cost china was 
viewed compelling way lower cogs this attractive for medical devices where 
labor cost high usually because the product requires high level human assembly 
and where automation not yet available hence the material increase tariffs 
medical devices could have material impact the european medical device sector 
which benefitting from using lower cost manufacturing china and selling product 
the world biggest medical device market the united states below explore the 
financial implications from these initial tariffs and assess the potential exposure

medtech implications current tariff decisions 
trade tariffs could delay orders reduce organic growth and lead 
gross margin compression 
our analysis the product lines subject tariffs indicates philips siemens 
healthineers and elekta are the most exposed our analysis the manufacturing 
origin products for these players suggests that philips and siemens 
healthineers are most exposed with revenue chinese origin imported 
into the 
running sensitivity analysis estimate that the introduction tariffs from july 
could lead reduction gross margin the mid point our 
sensitivity range and expect order delivery slow customers delay 
purchases manufacturers have number solutions alleviate the impact 
tariffs however these will come cost and are likely take time implement 
below look the medtech companies that believe will directly impacted 
the current china tariff announcements acknowledge that government led 
tariff developments revisions are still evolving and such the implications for the 
medtech sector can change present believe the medical device categories 
flagged the government are most relevant philips siemens healthineers and 
elekta 
have also provided theoretical tariff exposure framework which draws 
number factors including trade imbalances between and china try identify 
other medical device categories that could potentially exposed any further tariffs 
see section tariff risk framework what could happen next 
near term implications 
expect the near term consequences the introduction the announced tariffs 
include immediate reduction gross margin for products entering the from 
china july and delay delivery orders impacting organic growth and 
order bookings the majority the products under section are larger items that 
have month order lead times therefore products purchased customers the 
such mri linac for delivery from manufacturer importing from china 
after july will subject tariff the customer would have signed contract 
agreeing accept delivery set price the product the other hand will now 
subject tariff either the manufacturer will have absorb the tariff seek 
renegotiate with the customer see number possible outcomes all which 
would detrimental for the manufacturer 
manufacturer concedes the manufacturer consumes the tariff maintain 
goodwill and ensure does not lose the contract the expense gross profit 
customer delays the manufacturer tries pass the tariff costs the customer 
could attempt delay the order avoid extra cost the hope that the 
tariffs will not long lasting 
half way house the manufacturer and customer agree split the cost the 
tariff 
customer purchases outside china the customer attempts cancel the order 
avoid extra cost and repurchase from manufacturer who can provide the 
item from origin other than china 
possible responses the manufacturer the tariff and possible delays orders 
could include the following 
redirection products the near term and depending the diversification and 
capacity the manufacturing facilities companies may able redirect products 
manufacturing facilities distribution centers that not subject the new 
tariffs 
origin shifting some circumstances may possible for the manufacturer 
ship almost finished goods from their china facilities existing new facility 
another location and make substantial transformation before being shipped 
the this would have more than just trans shipment but could the 
form installing software complex assembly finished intermediate goods 
relocation manufacturing the longer term there may need relocate 
manufacturing facilities there more local production both these actions 
would likely lead restructuring costs and pressures gross margins 
our view potential company responses tariffs will take time implement given 
the complexities involved with shifting the supply chain well the uncertainty 
surrounding trade negotiations would not expect companies make major changes 
manufacturing footprint without some certainty that the tariffs will place for 
extended period therefore possible that the tariffs introduced july have 
immediate and material impact until there clarity furthermore any response the 
companies likely bring associated costs 
long term implications 
following the initial impacts end market demand and any response from 
manufacturers believe that high level the import tariffs would generally have 
three effects product demand 
expansion domestic output companies with higher manufacturing locally will 
benefit the extent they are able offer more competitive prices relative 
foreign importers subject tariffs 
shift import volumes due higher pricing pressure importers foreign 
manufacturers are likely look for alternative markets without trade tariffs which 
would likely increase supply and focus lower tariff markets 
contraction demand depending the availability locally sourced products 
higher pricing would likely reduce consumer demand least the near term 
buyers delay purchasing decisions conversely government tax revenues would 
increase result the applied tariffs whether this could offset demand 
reduction through greater budgetary schemes longer term possibility 
summary the introduction the currently proposed tariffs will likely result end 
user demand waning orders being delayed logistical supply chain problems

provided below addition some feedback collected from the companies note that 
our analysis unlikely totally accurate assessment the impact given the 
many unknowns manufacturing volumes value and origins well the variabilities

philips personal health consumer business 
our review the tariff product lines indicates that there will also some implications 
for philips personal health business which represents sales largely comprising 
consumer discretionary products such kitchen tools and appliances household 
appliances electric tooth brushes tvs and sleep apnea devices there are number 
subcomponents the product lists however there were minimal consumer products 
and the list focused manufacturing and industrial use items identified handful 
products that may have some overlap including filtering and purifying machinery and 
apparatus well machinery for the preparation meat poultry fruits vegetables 
and nuts given the diversified nature the personal health division see the 
currently announced tariffs having limited impact philips personal health 
consumer division with more significant impact for the diagnosis treatment division 
note that tvs were removed from the initial list and the final list appears 
more focused manufacturing and industrial equipment rather than consumer 
products directly purchased and imported the therefore the event more 
consumer products are included the next list which the nstr due 
release over the coming weeks there could more meaningful impact philips

however there currently date set for tariff imports china and the only

furthermore given philips manufactures locally for china there should reason 
for tariff applied therefore think tariffs from china are unlikely have 
large impact philips business 
company feedback 
our discussions with the company indicate that philips diagnosis treatment business 
will affected the july tariff although with minimal impact owing its 
diversified manufacturing footprint and limited exposure imports from china 
manufacturing facilities the business the company has not yet provided precise 
guidance the volume value that will affected the most recent china 
tariff developments has highlighted that believes has balanced footprint 
manufacturing sites china israel netherlands germany and the united states which 
provide flexibility optimizing production response tariff changes philips 
emphasized its strategy for manufacturing which has centered around manufacturing 
china for the chinese market and manufacturing europe for the european and 
markets well some production for the market with respect its personal 
health division philips highlighted that the majority its products are made china 
but there was nothing the tariff product list that would affect its business 
aside from some minor components also estimate based the company high 
level disclosure that there double digit low treble digit million worth diagnosis 
treatment sales the being sourced from china this appears very 
manageable amount 
siemens healthineers 
background 
the tariffs announced far primarily impact siemens diagnostic imaging division and 
lesser extent the advanced therapy division scanners mri machines ultrasound 
equipment and most other imaging modalities fall under diagnostic imaging while 
imaging for radiation oncology falls under advanced therapies all which fall within 
the scope the announced tariffs within diagnostic imaging sales are mri

china sales represents the group and probably slightly more for the imaging 
business however there currently date set for tariff imports china and 
the only tariffs applied would mri machines and patient monitoring 
equipment furthermore the significant manufacturing capacity china means there 
should reason for tariff applied equipment can manufactured 
locally therefore think tariffs from china are unlikely have large impact 
siemens 
company feedback 
our discussion with siemens healthineers indicates that the company diagnostic 
imaging business will affected the july tariff decision while the company has 
not quantified the impact from the upcoming tariffs siemens healthineers was very 
helpful pointing out the following production locations modality mri scanners are 
made germany and china germany and china ray china and 
europe and ultrasound south korea also estimate based the company high 
level disclosure that worth diagnostic imaging sales the are 
sourced from china this appears very manageable amount 
diagnostic imaging market longer term implications 
over the years multinationals have shifted their manufacturing china take 
advantage lower labor costs all major players philips and siemens have large 
manufacturing operations china for diagnostic imaging equipment the introduction 
tariffs could potentially lead some logistical issues and potential shifts competitive 
dynamics those with more local china manufacturing will able offer 
more competitive pricing than imports all else equal given siemens wide manufacturing 
footprint could have greater flexibility respond than some manufacturers for 
example philips now manufactures primarily from suzhou china after shutting down 
its ohio cleveland operations and consolidating its manufacturing footprint one 
possible response from philips tariffs are imposed could refocus its resources 
outside the profitable market where would price disadvantage 
and siemens which have more manufacturing outside china thus allowing the latter 
gain share less competitive space

view the china trade tensions material risk where there high exposure 
production and revenue inflow between the two countries the basis geographical 
production exposure feel siemens the mid range its peers with less 
production exposure china relative philips and less market share and revenue 
exposure relative however the full implications will likely industrywide with 
costs incurred either through reduced demand from the resulting price inflation the 
restructuring charges required redirect operations alternative unaffected regions 
elekta 
background 
the tariffs announced far include some radiotherapy equipment and products that 
will directly impact elekta while linac related sales make the majority elekta 
group sales the hardware component that will subject incremental tariff 
each market proportion hardware sales largely dependent upon how developed 
the linac market for example north south america has the lowest proportion 
hardware sales while apac hardware sales are this unsurprising since 
the more developed markets are largely replacement markets while emerging 
markets are still building new installations estimate that hardware sales 
exposed the tariff will approximately while china hardware sales will

most significant manufacturing facility producing the majority linacs including the 
linac unity system over the past five years elekta has shifted manufacturing and 
production facilities asian markets allow for shorter transportation time and 
develop the more localization solutions however estimate the crawley facility 
represents manufacturing volumes 
near term financial implications 
tariffs 
estimate that north america sales for imaging represent around group sales 
however with the majority manufacturing out crawley the there currently 
unlikely any significant impact the business 
china tariffs 
similar the tariff situation the impact elekta likely negligible the 
group manufactures either europe china itself therefore the tariffs would not 
apply them 
elekta varian dynamics 
although the tariffs are likely have minimal impact elekta the group could 
benefit from new competitive advantages over varian the majority varian 
manufacturing facilities are the therefore china tariffs were ahead elekta 
could relatively better positioned distribute its linacs without incurring added 
duty however varian has diversified manufacturing footprint with facilities europe 
and recently ramped production china therefore should have options 
respond tariffs should wish 
varian made the following comment its results april about its 
potential exposure tariffs 
dow wilson president ceo monitoring very closely and are working with 
avmed and other industry organizations address the issue and clearly preserve 
access potentially lifesaving cancer treatment important note that the trade 
representative list still proposal form and has not been finalized they are seeking 
comments that and clearly advocating for the removal medical devices and 
component parts part that 
this stage the trade representative list only proposal remains seen what 
final products are that will included dynamic environment and continue 
watch guess from kind really broad perspective don see having big impact 
market nor our market share how impacts tariff cost cetera play and 
going have watch that moves through the process 
company feedback 
our discussion with elekta confirms our view that the company should not materially 
impacted the pending tariff radiation equipment with most its production 
linear accelerators the while not the ambit this report perhaps more 
meaningful debate for the company how the exit from the could affect its 
future production decisions for linear accelerators 
tariff risk framework subsector analysis 
the second stage our analysis try assess the exposure further 
potential tariffs within the context the ustr statement support another 
worth chinese goods receive additional tariff 
while acknowledge the difficulty predicting how trade issues will play out 
our framework uses china trade imbalances starting point identify 
medical device subsectors that have higher and lower exposure tariff risk 
recognise that other factors may play into government tariff decisions such 
violation intellectual property rights but trade imbalances appear have been 
key consideration for the government compiling the preliminary list for the 
additional tariff announced april 
based china trade flows alone view the electro diagnostic monitoring 
hearing aids and wound care subsectors those most exposed further 
tariffs given the combined effect high import exposure high proportion 
chinese import value the and large trade deficit value think radiation 
equipment also exposed this risk but given the relatively large trade surplus 
from the china for this sector believe alternative providers well 
domestic providers would well positioned compensate for the loss

what else impacts tariff equations 
when assessing the tariff implications for companies our sector number 
additional complexities need considered for example 
component sourcing company does not have manufacturing china but 
sources large number chinese components for use production say 
european production facility what degree will section tariffs apply 
intellectual property value can companies that manufacture their products 
china claim that the majority the value add from the intellectual property 
developed outside china europe and thus reduce the value which section 
tariff applies 
wto what degree can the wto make rulings which the and china are 
bound 
help with these issues consulted wto tariff expert who provided the following 
feedback 
component sourcing the legal test that applied determine the origin 
product based the country last substantial transformation hence 
company does not have production china but sources the components from 
china and then transforms the product into something substantially different 
europe then europe would the country origin also understand from our 
wto tariff expert that there have been plenty rulings the meaning 
substantial transformation help determine which country the source the 
product for tariff purposes 
intellectual property value our wto tariff expert suggested that the source the 
intellectual property generated less relevant when evaluating the source 
product for instance the design and research done europe but the product 
undergoes substantial transformation china then china the source the 
product however there have been cases when company argued successfully that 
loading software into device made china different country vietnam 
germany equates substantial transformation and shifts the source 
production that country 
wto our wto tariff expert highlighted that the mission the wto drive 
equitable trade between countries based common principles the wto has four 
roles play namely set out precise rules developed wto members which 
countries must apply when trading with one another settle disputes between 
members and play the role trade tribunal where members can file complaints 
against other members who fail abide the rules countries that not comply 
are liable sanctions monitor that wto members are abiding the wto 
rules provide training government officials practice the wto has little 
power enforce its rules and breach can have limited implications for the 
country concerned understand that countries can withdraw from the wto 
summary 
our theoretical tariff risk framework uses china trade imbalances starting point 
identify medical device subsectors that have higher and lower exposure the risk 
further tariffs based china trade flows alone view the electro diagnostic 
monitoring orthopedics and hearing aids subsectors that are most exposed the 
risk further tariffs based combination high import exposure high 
proportion chinese import value the and large trade deficit 
tariff risk framework company analysis 
extend our theoretical tariff risk framework try identify which companies 
are more less exposed the risk further tariffs the criteria use for 
our framework are revenue exposure china manufacturing footprint product 
diversification and restructuring experience although acknowledge the 
difficulties making definitive assessments individual companies well 
predicting how trade disputes will ultimately play out think our framework can 
provide indicative ranking the companies under our coverage terms 
exposure tariff risk 
our framework suggests the companies that carry higher exposure future 
tariff risk are philips store nord and sonova lower risk companies are 
fresenius william demant and straumann 
while section presented theoretical framework for identifying medical device 
subsectors with high and low exposure china tariff risk this section move 
onto company specific implications replicate our subsector analysis for medtech 
companies within our coverage have excluded spire and terveystalo which are 
largely hospital operators with little exposure trade although recognise the 
secondary effect profitability from potentially higher medical device input costs 
identify revenue exposure and china manufacturing footprint two major criteria 
gauge exposure the risk tariff hikes also consider two additional factors 
that could influence company ability adapt the tariff impact namely product 
diversification and experience with restructuring 
revenue exposure 
looked the companies annual reports for geographical sales distribution 
fresenius medical care has the highest revenue exposure deriving total revenues 
from north america given its primary position dialysis care provider the but

under our coverage the most exposed companies chinese manufacturing appear 
philips for the company biggest division personal health group 
sales and includes products such domestic appliances electric toothbrushes 
electric shavers understand large proportion products are made 
chinese oem partners with respect its diagnostic treatment division 
group sales understand the company has broad production footprint with 
facilities china israel netherlands india and holland scanners are made 
israel and china mir china and the netherlands ray china and india and

xiamen which supplies hearing aids global basis including north america 
also has material production for hearing aids malaysia the company uses 
contract manufacturers china for its audio business which makes office and 
contact center headsets well blue tooth mobile headsets 
sonova the company has three main production facilities which believe 
china currently the largest with estimated production volume 
vietnam the second largest facility with the volume followed 
switzerland there also production facility illinois the its 
chinese production facility more geared towards bte and ric form factors while 
vietnam more ites over the years the company has been moving production 
vietnam and understand that recent years the company has doubled its 
capacity and appears that future capacity increases will also directed 
vietnam where labor cost more favorable compared china the company 
communicated that believes has effective options rebalance its production 
capacity between the different sites and shift production for the market 
other locations outside china within relatively short time 
smith nephew beginning the company started more aggressively 
move its advanced wound management production with its new facility suzhou 
china this plant replaced its wound care plant florida usa the time the 
announcement smith nephew said the facility will manufacture some its 
leading product lines suzhou namely allevyn adhesive dressings well 
other products within its advanced wound care range the company opened 
phase which doubled the capacity smith nephew announced that 
had opened new manufacturing facility beijing china produce surgical 
instruments and components for its hips and knee prosthesis our discussion with 
the company highlighted that chinese production going the manageable 
and perhaps more relevant from tariff perspective goods flowing from 
production into china 
companies with low exposure chinese manufacturing are william demant and 
convatec illustrate the combined risk revenue and china manufacturing 
exposure below also note that the tariffs apply not just finished goods but also 
semi assembled goods machine parts and materials along the supply chain hence 
companies that manufacture the europe but import parts from china may 
subject tariff impact while difficult assess what percentage the 
components medical device are made china feel that our analysis 
directionally correct for many the subsectors the issue around component 
manufacturing irrelevant especially for products that don require much 
componentry product examples are dental implants titanium dialyzers plastic 
ostomy bags plastic rubber intermittent catheters plastic corrective lenses

manufacturing move redirect production 
companies could choose move redirect their manufacturing operations 
alternative geographical region the near term this would incur restructuring costs 
shifting production and employee headcount but the long term could offset the 
cost the tariffs hearing aid manufacturers for example demonstrated years ago 
that the transition hearing aid manufacture from denmark and switzerland china 
can done relatively speedily around months companies with diversified 
manufacturing footprints could redirect products manufactured say europe the 
while redirecting product manufactured china asia pacific europe how 
quickly and costly manufacturing move would for the company likely 
driven number considerations including 
complexity medical device product the production facilities required 
manufacture medical device vary with the complexity the product and 
government regulations devices that are applied externally the body typically 
require less expensive manufacturing facilities these include capital equipment and 
hearing aids which generally require lower cost assembly facilities comparison 
implantable devices such hip and knee implants dialyzers require capitalintensive production facilities medical devices where assembly more focus 
production ray mri operating room equipment monitoring afford 
companies greater scope respond more quickly production move our 
view implantable products such cardiac rhythm management and orthopedic 
devices require more capital intensive production making change production 
relatively more cumbersome and challenging

availability other production sites the speed which company can move 
production away from china also depends whether has production plants 
other geographies with spare capacity also depends whether there are other 
oem manufacturers available outside china take production for instance 
store nord audio business uses oem manufacturers china for its contact 
center and office headset business philips uses chinese oem manufacturers for 
large part its personal health product line are there other oem 
manufacturers outside china that could take large production volumes our 
view probably not over the short medium term 
manufacturing stays with restructured cost 
companies may also decide maintain china based production and implement 
alternative restructuring measures absorb the added costs from tariffs these could 
include automation initiatives overhead reduction and other cost efficiency programs 
for example philips which largely exposed chinese manufacturing for its medical 
imaging business undergoing cost efficiency program believe this skill set 
could position well adapting tariff hike companies could also combine these 
measures with more aggressive marketing non regions expand their share 
alternative markets would expect companies with large manufacturing 
operations such fresenius fmc and smith nephew more able 
withstand the tariff impact expanding their operations meet domestic demand 
and redirecting product manufactured china other markets

which companies are less exposed 
getinge william demant fresenius and straumann are less exposed tariff risk 
relative the group according our framework virtue relatively lower 
revenue exposure smaller china manufacturing footprint exposure number 
product lines and the case straumann and getinge experience with restructuring 
how have companies responded 
responses from the companies our coverage have indicated general perception that 
additional tariffs would not create substantial trade barrier for the following reasons 
more value created locally not china our discussions with suggest that 
chinese manufacturing costs are minor proportion the product final sales 
value much the value add around system design patented technology and 
proprietary software algorithms which are developed denmark 
business operations can diversified companies believe that tariff hike would 
treated added cost the normal course business and that their 
exposure the tariffs can minimized through redirecting production flow 
below provide comments from coloplast and essilor conference calls 
have received number questions the proposed tariff additional 
list products from china that includes catheters ostomy bags and wound dressings 
coloplast has production china today accounting for approx total volumes 
smaller portion these volumes are shipped the within continence care and 
ostomy care enforced the tariff not expected have material impact ellen 
bjurgert coloplast 
our industrial supply chain system you know made many plans some sitting 
asia but also some sitting the mexico brazil europe have 
overall manufacturing system that can swing around very easily and most the 
added value done locally through the lab the prescription labs that are the and 
most the added value created locally even there tariff put place can 
swing the production flows easily and anyhow the added value created local labs

other interesting developments considerations 
government lobby 
may several members the united states congress wrote open letter 
robert lighthizer the united states trade representative the letter highlighted that 
are concerned the recent announcement potentially subject almost billion 
worth medical technology products from china the section tariffs and 
request that medical technology products removed from the list for the reasons 
explained below not believe that imposing additional tariffs medical technology 
products would advance the policy objective you have articulated which target 
products that benefit from china industrial and economic plans while minimizing the 
impact the economy you know the medical technology industry 
american success story this industry has been historically competitive global 
level and one the few with consistent trade surplus exports medical

whether congressional pressure will result medical devices being completely 
excluded from any further tariff announcements remains seen while some items 
were removed from the june list large value items such scanners and mri 
machines are still included the tariffs will important watch this space see 
whether further moderations are possible following the official announcement june 
and expected collection duty july although this stage see 
unlikely remains seen whether the next planned product list due 
receive tariff does does not include medtech products 
summary 
our theoretical framework for assessing the exposure our covered companies 
tariff changes use four criteria revenue exposure china manufacturing footprint 
product diversification and restructuring experience although acknowledge the 
difficulties making definitive assessments individual companies well 
predicting how trade disputes will ultimately play out think our framework can 
provide indicative ranking the companies under our coverage terms exposure 
tariff risk 
our framework suggests the companies that carry higher exposure future tariff 
risk are sonova and smith nephew lower risk companies are fresenius

materiality for our companies the event the subsector included future set

june and currently undergoing regular legal process again stress the 
hypothetical nature this analysis and the difficulty predicting ultimate impacts

background 
while the initial tariff list published april included hearing aids they were later 
removed from the list published june tariff the expected

impact sonova prior any mitigating measures the company the accounts 
for sonova sales and the hearing aid sales cochlear should least 
the group tariff would impact the wholesale value the product rather than 
the retail price which can higher therefore given sonova retail exposure the 
the percentage sales impacted the tariff would lower than the overall 
exposure estimate sales are retail therefore the representative value 
hearing aid imports the closer sales 
exhibit sonova sales region

americas 
sonova has four primary production centers china vietnam switzerland and the 
hearing instruments are produced switzerland china and vietnam while cochlear 
implants and hearing aids for the market are made the the china and vietnam 
facilities manufacture hearing aids for global distribution and over the past decade 
sonova has ramped production capacity china the company has increased

large manufacturing site aurora illinois the therefore sonova has effective

reminder the section tariff was initially proposed restrictive measure 
chinese companies over alleged intellectual property theft innovative 
technologies the use trade barriers the past has gone beyond levying import 
tariffs and has included creating prohibitive regulatory environment that incurs high 
compliance and approval costs price control anti dumping measures where china 
holds competitive supply goods quotas quantity control measures 
selected importers government subsidies preferred goods nations such 
nafta public procurement regulations and intellectual property restrictions 
our global economics team set out three possible scenarios for the tariff debate 
following the june announcement see trade tensions stakes have risen the three 
scenarios laid out our economists are relevant for assessing the impact tariffs 
the medtech sector 
negotiation deal before july which would escalate tensions and reduce 
the risk the tariffs being enacted however our economists believe the chances 
appear low this juncture 
new measures tariffs taken both parties move into negotiation after the 
current round measures concluding with deal the next two months which 
eventually drives gradual adjustment trade relations related impact global 
growth will remain manageable this scenario 
additional tariff measures and beyond trade tensions keep escalating the 
and its trading partners continue impose additional tariffs this scenario our 
economists see meaningful adverse impact trade business confidence 
investment and global growth even negotiation turns out the end outcome 
from purely medtech perspective note that china has the past removed 
limited tariffs imported products the medical care urgently needed for example 
march the premier the state council keqiang pledged remove tariffs 
urgently needed foreign cancer drugs and reiterated the government intention 
further liberalize number service industries including pension and healthcare and 
lift restrictions foreign investments state council
