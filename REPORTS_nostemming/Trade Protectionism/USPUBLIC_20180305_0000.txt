the announced steel aluminum tariffs would clear 
break with the status quo toward our temporary trade 
dispute scenario escalations section reciprocal tax 
nafta exemption more severe global response raise risks 
protectionist push more severe market reactions 
steel and aluminum tariffs forward how much 
more serious could trade tensions get last thursday 
president trump announced that the would 
impose tariffs steel and aluminum imports 
and respectively this would done under 
section the trade act national security 
justification following the recommendation his 
commerce secretary while not yet implemented 
think that investors should take the statement intent seriously 
status quo outcome behind we now our temporary trade dispute 
scenario with risks skewed toward broader protectionist push recall that 
our published framework see trade policy beyond the hypothetical january 
for full details called for three potential outcomes 
facto status quo very minor tariff action despite ongoing use 
provocative language 
temporary trade dispute similar tariffs undertaken presidents bush 
and obama the sets temporary escalating tariffs trading partners 
respond equal lesser measure wto adjudication targeted 
product actions etc but both sides ultimately back down 
protectionist push the institutes broad tariffs and the situation 
escalates trading partners respond kind and the follows 
with further meaningful action 
assuming the goes forward with its announced tariffs steel and aluminum 
think that scenario clearly off the table however don think that the 
most severe scenario protectionist push becomes the most likely one this 
because our global economics team believes that the response from china the 
and other trading partners may coordinated but will limited 
provocative language targeted product actions and wto adjudication for 
example friday the president the european commission jean claude 
juncker said that while the plans tax american goods produced the home 
states were not finalized they amounted treating them the same way that 
due the nature the fixed income market the issuers

european products would under the steel and aluminum tariffs new york 
times march furthermore they view the immediate economic impact 
limited which holds out the possibility that the public attention this matter 
may limited 
what are watching that could escalate the situation protectionist 
push important question ask because could mean the difference 
between manageable economic and market reaction and one with meaningfully 
more downside growth and asset prices 
while not comprehensive list four items have our attention 
the international reaction more severe than expected this could take 
the form broad based tariff response rolling back foreign investment 
limiting imports 
the uses section act intellectual property while the 
administration has not been specific with the remedies considering 
pursuing regarding intellectual property the investigation aimed one 
partner china separating china out from the crowd that affected 
current trade efforts could taken material escalation 
the does not exempt canada and mexico from tariff actions calling 
nafta negotiations into question tariffs are announced but keep 
nafta partners scope this would break with recent precedent given 
that the steel tariffs under president bush did not apply canada and 
mexico furthermore nafta negotiation talks are ongoing and the 
announcement was made during the seventh round talks set wrap 
monday hence markets may have reflect some increase the 
probability that nafta talks fail 
the moves materially closer enacting reciprocal tax while the 
administration has not yet fully detailed what such tax would look like 
based public comments take effort level the playing 
field taxing imports near equal the difference between the 
exporting country vat and state and local sales taxes not clear 
that the president has the authority enact something this broad 
within the existing set laws but can dismiss such move outright

where see market sensitivities 
for equities these developments are consistent with our strategists 
thesis increased volatility and lower potential returns this year 
late cycle environment where expect markets begin contemplating 
peak rate change earnings growth and economic surprises before 
year end material escalation toward protectionism would involve 
additional risks increase volatility further and likely dampen broader risk 
appetite 
these trade actions affirm downside risks mxn and cad those 
currencies still appear vulnerable any further escalation trade 
concerns particularly they spill over the nafta process hence 
whether the tariffs exclude nafta partners may key catalyst 
rates current conditions and further escalation would both support our 
strategists view flatter curves and downside for ust rate levels over 
the course the year prior similar tariff actions have led near term 
rises market measures inflation expectations which have later abated 
realized inflation was comparatively lower furthermore the extent 
that trade tensions feed into more volatile risk market outlook our 
equity strategists have noted this supports the notion that bond yields 
will hard pressed sustain materially higher levels over the course
