what did investors have asked how tariffs will felt across state and local credits using wage export and import data 
developed regional exposure guide that measures how tariffs imports and exports may 
affect states and msas then extend this analysis simulate how exposures increase under full scale china tariffs which 
would propel the total value goods subject tariffs over find the impact unevenly distributed just 
general exposure trade unevenly distributed across states agricultural manufacturing and trading hubs are most risk

methodology measured impact using wage export import data 
tariffs response tariffs 
percent wages impacted tariffs 
mapped digit harmonized system codes digit naics codes identify regional exposure 
industries impacted the retaliatory tariffs the percent wages affected was used determine the degree 
impact all codes included the us steel and aluminum tariffs were eliminated since domestic producers 
those goods should benefit from the global tariffs 
naics data paired with the bls quarterly census employment and wages allow assess the impact 
state and msa but not differentiate between domestic and global focused establishments 
state exports goods subject tariffs gsp 
used the census usa trade online tool quantify the annual value tariffed goods exported state 
the specific country applying the tariff done for the percent wages method codes included the us 
steel and aluminum tariffs were eliminated 
using state exports more precisely tells the value goods that are subject tariffs versus the percent 
wages method which based broader classifications business type however the exporting state origin 
movement state does not reflect the state production practically this means states that consolidate goods 
for export such louisiana will overemphasized msa level data available 
tariffs 
state imports goods subject tariffs gsp 
using the census usa trade online tool quantified the annual value tariffed goods imported each state 
from specific country tariffs were assumed apply steel and aluminum imports from all countries besides 
those that were exempted quotas were not taken into account 
the census refers the importing state the state destination which not equivalent the state 
consumption this series can reflect consolidation points and can overemphasize large states since shipment 
with multiple destinations will only considered imported the state that receives the greatest value

impacted current tariffs exports than the coastal state actually since about
