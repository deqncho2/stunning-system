imports see risk increasing cogs and potential margin risk for 
companies sourcing imported steel and aluminium for their production 
though some companies like vesuvius and lower extent prysmian and 
nexans are likely see some benefit and others have generally the ability 
pass the headwind over time for instance assa abloy legrand companies 
such electrolux dometic skf may more sensitive tariffs imported 
metals having less pricing power and provided they rely those for their 
production aside from potential impact sourcing costs there possibility 
the administration could impose tariffs specific products components for 
which deems competition unfair domestic production though most our 
companies have local production some also import from neighboring 
countries notably canada mexico into the list here the top sectors 
aggregate relevance for our sector with the highest imported value the 
with appliances professional domestic and electrical infrastructure 
management equipment topping the ranking 
auto mass oems are most exposed steel cost threats globally for 
aerospace autos face higher potential raw materials costs well the explicit 
proposal levy actual import duties european german cars sold the 
steel costs tend contained european cars generally contain approx 
hrc steel currently priced although our steel analysts believe this 
may spike short term steel months section tariffs and 
price spike hrc emerging our base case mar 
hike steel costs could raise production costs similar amount amounting 
ebit margin pressure approximately for the premium oems but 
much for mass oems steel prices rise globally for the suppliers 
raw materials are largely covered indexation contracts particularly for steel 
obviously direct tariffs car imports could bigger problem with current 
import duties european duties european oems sell over 
cars the annually for revenues over japanese oems have

composite based platforms some estimates aluminium could

from potential new tariffs finished aerospace products small comparison 
autos the value goods the lower aerospace for 
aerospace for autos and there narrower gap between tariff 
regimes between the and the european union meaning the exchequer 
would have less gain levelling tariff regimes between markets global

although the potential new trade policy the still unclear terms what shape 
and form could take and what type imports will affect see two ways could 
affect our sector 
import tariffs impacting raw materials imports into the 
his communication the administration clearly identified the possibility imposing 
tariffs imported steel and aluminium into the per the department 
commerce section review though some uncertainties remain the 
countries regions origin that will affected the tariffs and which type 
products whether this will impact just raw materials components specific grades 
raw materials 
large number the companies cover have significant raw materials and especially 
metals exposure part their cogs though not all them provide visibility the 
magnitude sensitivity the origins these raw materials while expect some 
them have the opportunity pass raw mats cost increases their customers over 
time they face higher sourcing costs this the case for cables locks for instance 
others may struggle more offsetting any potential headwind also some companies 
would have automatic cost adjustments especially have projects based business 
model 
most exposed cap goods companies increase steel aluminium sourcing 
costs 
risk considering the products they manufacture see most obvious risks for 
increasing raw materials costs particular order using imported steel 
aluminium companies like assa abloy dometic electrolux kone sandvik schindler 
skf and vestas 
benefit see vesuvius beneficiary the results announcement 
march vesuvius noted that the the region the world with the highest 
penetration rates for its products they sell the most products per tonne steel 
the measures were implemented they would likely have positive impact 
steel production and thus vesuvius sales this region given its growth tied closely 
steel production volumes also see potential modest benefit for companies like 
prysmian and nexans operating industries with mechanism prices increase decrease 
based raw materials prices though this case their exposure section 
mostly aluminium related with their biggest raw materials being copper which seems 
far unaffected 
this stage though not have any visibility where the companies our 
coverage source their raw materials and may that all the raw mats used their 
production sourced the which would limit their risks nevertheless show

import tariffs impacting finished products 
also see risk for measures taken components and finished products that 
would imported into the and for which imports are considered unfair 
competition domestically produced goods 
the vast majority companies follow have local manufacturing footprint and 
therefore their operations could benefit from tariffs imported goods making 
their products relatively more competitive the case they competed head head with 
cheaper imported goods however also possible that top their production 
companies our coverage also import products into the and especially from

hrc rose from the lows further hike steel costs therefore 
could raise production costs similar amount again oems have been warning 
amounting ebit margin pressure approximately both bmw and 
daimler for the premium oems but much for mass oems for 
psa and renault and over for for just the latest hike hrc steel 
our steels analyst correct the impact could still double full year aluminium 
has risen steadily from per cars use average less aluminium 
approximately per vehicle for cost just over per car suggesting 
aluminium costs for could also rise further per vehicle obviously some 
manufacturers use much more aluminium 
for the suppliers raw materials are largely covered indexation contracts particularly 
for steel where oems can use their larger scale negotiate more favourable terms 
than the smaller suppliers would likely achieve therefore raw materials can 
sometimes affect top line growth rates and percentage margins although this much 
less prominent for the suppliers than for the tire stocks where raw materials

aerospace defence 
there are two questions relating tariffs and other protectionist measures that 
think may become relevant airbus and the european sector more broadly 
could proposals for tariffs aluminium and other materials components going into 
aircraft impact margins and could there tariffs finished products themselves 
import tariffs affecting raw materials 
aluminium remains critical material for aircraft despite increasing use composites 
some estimates aluminium constitutes the value naked airframe this 
will clearly higher for older airframes than for newer composite based model and 
presents risk where there are substantial imports raw materials 
much airbus supply chain outsourced meaning final assembly plants such that 
mobile alabama will import subassemblies with substantial aluminium content 
aerostructures skins fuel tanks the impact the industry will clearly therefore 
depend specifics and the location the broader supply chain 
many contracts the sector also contain clauses that allow companies pass 
increases material costs and hedges are place short term clearly over time the 
impact the supply chain tariff increases input materials would hard 
quantify but clearly negative 
import tariffs impacting finished products 
tariffs finished products are less likely our view comments the autos 
industry coming from the administration highlight what our view are the two 
most material factors that could contribute increased tariffs affecting specific 
products significant imbalance imports particular sector and material 
difference tariffs specific products the autos sector has both these the 
aerospace sector does not our view this makes the politics the situation less 
conducive the introduction additional tariffs the aerospace sector 
for context airbus has its order book with customers north america boeing 
covered rajeev lalwani has similar proportion aircraft order from european 
customers 
the value aircraft and components imported the the latest year with 
detailed information from the wto was largely tariff free total european 
union imports comparable products were most which was 
tariff rate while there net imbalance here considerably less than that 
the autos industry according the same source motor vehicles and parts imports 
were compared for the typical tariffs this imports 
were compared for the 
terms output the potential gain the exchequer from equalising tariffs the 
aerospace industry calculated very simplistically would less than per year 
compared from pursuing similar protectionist measures autos this 
calculation does not reflect the complexity supply chains but gives impression 
the order magnitude 
exhibit imports aircraft and components per year 
exhibit tariff regime aerospace shows narrow gap between
