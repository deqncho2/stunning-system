tariff soybean exports china increasingly 
likely while the headlines likely have negative impact 
farmer sentiment china demand for soybeans could 
replaced demand from other countries over the long term 
impact machinery cos could less than feared 
for our public policy team detailed thoughts implications from the and 
china tariff announcements please see cards the table and for our chemicals 
team view please see initial thoughts china trade news 
wednesday the chinese ministry commerce announced additional tariffs 
products including soybeans automobiles and planes reigniting 
concerns over trade conflict following initial round tariffs initially 
announced march our thoughts here china response was faster and more 
aggressive than our economists expected but still likely moves towards 
eventual negotiation the ministry announcement follows the trade 
representative release proposed tariffs april which amounted 
and targeted areas including robotics information communication 
technology medical equipment and aerospace the ustr tariffs are not set 
into effect immediately companies have until may issue 
objections including public hearing scheduled for may 
acknowledge that tariff soybean imports from the likely 
pressure the farm complex from both sentiment and fundamental 
perspective soybeans make farm cash crop receipts and china 
soybean exports specifically make assuming that tariff lowers 
china demand proportionally see farm cash receipts risk 
conceivably china could replace imports with imports from argentina 
brazil although soybeans are down today news grain commodity 
prices have been more supportive farmer sentiment through the back 
the argentine drought agriculture equipment organic growth has historically 
correlated well with both commodity prices and farm cash income exhibit 
and absent broader move lower commodity prices view not supported 
our agribusiness team continue remain optimistic the outlook for 
accelerating organic growth and 
expect south american production pick the slack from lost 
imports but this would likely drive soybean prices higher latin american and 
lower the which would then lead other soybean importing countries like 
the and mexico buy more from the the change chinese buying 
patterns could incentivize demand shifts arbitrage the differential this will 
rearrange the global soybean trade market but don think its negative for

alternatives exports are relatively limited

clearly reliant production meet its domestic use requirements the remaining 
major players brazil and argentina account for china soybean imports 
respectively implying that china import reliance relatively concentrated and limited 
these three larger players further note general lack export diversity among 
the major players with china accounting for argentine soybean exports and

shift towards south america would benefit agco but this 
likely well understood even tariff related volume shifts 
while agco does over index latam our coverage view any potential 
tailwinds not meaningful enough move the needle from top line perspective 
theoretically incremental export demand and price appreciation latam markets 
could incentivize area growth boost exports china although this assumes china 
tariffs are sustained over extended period also note that with the latam growing 
season now concluding these changes would need take effect the following 
marketing year which time the trade landscape could differ significantly what has 
currently been proposed additionally with brazilian soybean production already 
expected reach record levels the coming year believe consensus has already 
embedded modest market acceleration and acreage expansion south america 
expanding production excluding tariff related impacts given previously wellunderstood international demand acceleration such while acknowledge these 
near term tailwinds latam markets note that emea continues the

south america long term ability meet higher chinese 
demand remains unclear 
per wasde estimates both brazilian and argentine production looks relatively 
stretched export and domestic requirements this point the argentine draught 
has clearly placed pressure argentina soybean production capacity with the 
most recent wasde estimate placing argentine production down such 
argentina domestic use requirements are expected account for soybeans 
production suggesting that argentina will need dip into inventories 
meet domestic requirements alone not accounting for estimated 
exports which could see further reduction well further with brazilian exports 
forecasted step wasde estimates that total domestic use export 
volumes will account for brazilian production suggesting brazil somewhat 
stretched meeting its own obligations and will likely require upwards revisions 
domestic production the coming year have highlighted above while 
incremental acreage growth could theoretically resolve the above issues and meet this 
long term demand believe these factors are unlikely move the needle from 
investor perspective given the well understood bullish view south american acreage
