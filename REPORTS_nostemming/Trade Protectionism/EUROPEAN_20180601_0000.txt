the administration will impose import tariffs steel 
and aluminium while the magnitude the immediate impact 
output should minimal higher degree business 
uncertainty and potential extension tariffs other sectors 
could alter the macro trajectory 
matthew pennill 
trade policy takes centre stage the administration has decided impose 
tariffs steel and aluminium imported from the while this 
negative believe that the immediate impact both tariffs the and 
euro area economies should quite small practically negligible even taking 
sector spillovers into account rather the possibility large tariffs things 
like cars along with more elevated business uncertainty that could have bigger 
effect the economic outlook mainly due the impact german industry 
quantifying the drag growth simple measures trade exposure likely 
underestimate the impact tariffs but even account for both intra and 
inter industry effects our quantitative model the result suggests that the 
tariffs steel and aluminium would only amount loss 
nominal gross value added gva the however variation across countries 
considerable the euro area austria finland and italy will likely most 
affected while spain and france less germany between moreover interindustry effects exceed the direct effects almost all countries 
spotlight the german economy germany the fifth largest steel exporter 
globally accounting for around all steel volume exported but even here 
the immediate impact should fairly limited the ifo institute estimates that the 
tariffs would cause loss million which rather negligible when 
expressed percentage gdp first this because german corporations 
invest more the relative the revenues generated the same region 
second significant share imports from europe are intra firm third 
regional market and supply chain diversification german steel exporters 
extensive and the high quality nature the raw materials allows for some 
degree pricing power that said the possibility tariff extensions car 
imports would have stronger impact our view 
looking the potential response historical precedents suggest that 
one option available the agree proportional import tariffs 
selected categories goods and simultaneously initiate wto complaint 
dispute settlement case this option has been mirrored the latest speech 
jean claude juncker reported the international press that said also 
believe that path trade policy escalation likely the most preferred 
outcome any stage and our base case that the would welcome any 
possible negotiation with the

how might the respond 
tariffs imports far the european commission has tried gain permanent 
exemption from the tariffs but the same time the commission has started 
plan tariff based response this next step the european reaction likely follow 
the playbook response the bush administration tariffs steel any 
countervailing tariffs proposed the are likely proportional those the 
has imposed stretching roughly equal value pool exports the steel 
and aluminium amount imports estimate the value trade scope 
much billion first step 
which goods mid may the commission published list specific goods that could 
subject tariffs most have been cited potential targets before and look set 
focus key congressional constituencies the goods the sights range from 
sweetcorn fruit juice and whisky jeans shirts and motorcycles well the 
mirroring the tariffs steel and aluminium 
what form would such response take practical terms would likely follow two 
steps first immediate imposition tariffs range products valorem the 
tariffs that would the first wave the response with tariffs imposed goods 
worth the very most total exports the our calculations this 
first set tariffs would come into force june and would impose duties 
the exports scope 
going through the wto the second stage would see work towards wto settlement 
permitting the designate further tariffs american imports from the tariffs 
imposed through this process would wider ranging and more differentiated from 
rates certain goods our upper bound estimate the scope 
exports impacted here total exports the both these phases would 
direct response the steel and aluminium tariffs and not factor future

key views 
economic outlook mid cycle expansion 
core thesis small moderation growth 
risks balanced but with slight downside skew 
expect gdp grow for that more 
moderate than last year and below consensus but 
don see sharp slowdown the consumer remains 
well supported capex will probably accelerate further 
though less than past cycles policies remain 
expansionary and financial conditions supportive 
fiscal policy and productivity are the main domestic risk 
factors financial conditions and stronger euro are 
global ones the tariffs announced far only have 
limited impact growth but the risks from escalating 
tensions are larger political developments the 
periphery are further source uncertainty 
inflation normalising further 
core thesis rising gradually 
risks the upside given rising oil prices 
expect hicp average and 
core inflation likely rise gradually from 
this year next 
see services inflation continuing rise tighter 
labour market and capacity constraints raise wage 
inflation 
the upside wages may rise more quickly than 
expected and slack absorption may push pay 
growth rising oil prices pose upside risks our 
forecast too higher import prices due tariff 
hikes the downside but less changes labour 
market structure regulation may have reduced wages 
sensitivity closing output gap 
monetary policy getting closer qend 
core thesis taking prudent path 
think that the ecb will likely stop buying this 
year with short month taper from october 
december expect further changes the forward 
guidance june july envisage depo hike 
june don see any balance sheet 
reduction and expect the reinvestment policy 
continue throughout the forecast horizon end 
risks making the case for cautious approach 
there risk that the ecb extends beyond 
december but with very small amounts more 
bearish scenario the first depo rate hike could come 
later depending the inflation outlook and 
financial conditions the downside risks growth from 
trade policy and financial stability from political 
uncertainty may incentivise the central bank move 
even more slowly
