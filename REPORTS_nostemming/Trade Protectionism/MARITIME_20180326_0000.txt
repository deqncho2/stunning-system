china trade frictions and rising interest rates fuel uncertainty shipping 
markets but create opportunities new fears trade protectionism after 
president trump proposed tariffs worth imports from china 
coupled with rising interest rates have further increased the uncertainty 
global shipping markets and particularly containerized trade are 
therefore lowering our price targets for cmre and ssw and 
respectively while the trade measures announced the last week were less 
aggressive than previously feared and were likely taken negotiating tactic 
reduce intellectual property violations and other unfair trade practices 
suspected the office the trade representative ustr difficult 
forsee how this situation will develop our chief china economist robin xing 
estimates that the announced plans would reduce china export growth translating into drag its gdp growth after considering 
the spillover effects far china initial response has been pragmatic 
announcing tariffs just imports from the that will affect 
fruits nuts wine seamless steel pipe hog hog products and recyclable aluminum

time that supply demand looks increasingly tighter fleet supply growth keeps 
slowing down yoy from six months ago while despite concerns 
weak capesize rates and potential slowdown the chinese steel and iron ore 
import demand our chinese steel analyst rachel zhang feels confident that 
steel demand remains healthy anticipated this year according 
rachel the recent slowdown that has caused steel inventories elevated 
mostly attributed migrant workers taking longer cny holidays and 
returning work later and central government meetings held during march 
the same time view that fears china escalating its response against 
tariffs reducing its soybean imports will probably beneficial for dry bulk 
shipping our china consumer analyst lillian lou notes that agriculture patterns 
could take over year shift domestic production for china with domestic 
soybean supply covering just weeks its demand china relies heavily 
imports buying over with brazil and argentina accounting for 
and the for any potential decline chinese imports from the 
would likely have replaced longhaul volume from south america 
adding ton miles dry bulk demand therefore see the dip attractive 
opportunity enter the sector and reiterate our rating sblk 
rising geopolitical risk coupled with better oil inventory data and seasonal and 
cyclical supply demand imbalance are increasingly positive for lng lpg and 
tanker sectors energy prices are the rise the lng sector chinese 
demand continues grow faster than previously anticipated supporting higher 
slopes relative oil during the last two months asian lng prices have 
averaged brent higher year ago which coupled with the 
gradual rebalancing the oil market could lead new offtake agreements 
such event could potentially allow cheniere advance its plans expand 
its capacity with the fid both corpus chirsti train and sabine pass train 
which could add another our furthermore increased demand 
for lng that could lead new wave offtake agreements and fids would 
also create demand for lng carriers and push companies like glng glog 
glop hlng and hmlp higher the higher oil prices have also made propane 
more attractive relative naphtha the price ratio between the two 
commodities asia lowest level over the last months the tightening oil 
market also supportive for tanker stocks rebalancing moving closer 
despite the record scrapping ytd tanker fleet supply continues grow rapidly 
shifting focus beyond and companies with modest leverage that can safely 
avoid dilution therefore reiterate our rating eurn and dht

valuation methodologies investment risks 
tankers dry bulk the hyper cyclical nature the tanker and dry bulk sectors calls 
for using net asset value our primary valuation approach companies historically 
have been unable generate meaningful earnings and stable cash flow that analysts 
could use for analyzing among peers and broader market averages based multiples 
comparison therefore our primary valuation tools for tankers and dry bulk companies 
are the enterprise value the market value the company fleet and other assets 
forward fleet value and price forward net asset value forward nav 
secondarily particularly for more liquid stocks and during the upper part the cycle 
use the relative dividend yield and other cash flow metrics ebitda etc 
containerships for containership companies our primary valuation tool the forwardlooking ebitda and long term free cash flow yield and secondarily the dividend 
yield 
gas carriers for lng shipping companies use dcf primary valuation tool and 
secondarily the forward looking value the fleet expressed fleet value and 
nav also take into consideration the relative distributable free cash flow yield 
and dividend yield particularly for those companies structured mlps well 
ebitda and note that all shipping mlps are filers with the exception 
tgp that 
also make effort estimate the nav also for containership and lng companies 
however unlike the dry bulk and tanker shipping sectors the use nav has several 
constraints this mainly due the lack homogeneous vessel classes and the 
variety sizes and technical characteristics such speed refrigerated capacity cranes 
for containerships the longer useful life containerships and lng carriers 
compared dry bulk and tanker vessels that extends beyond years and can vary 
significantly iii the relative limited liquidity lng carriers and large containerships 
the sale and purchase market the long charter party agreements that are common 
the lng sector well the container sector where charter agreements are privately 
negotiated between ship owning companies and liner operators different credit 
quality 
our nav estimate values the company fleet based current newbuild resale and 
secondhand prices both from variety shipbrokers and industry publications and 
morgan stanley estimates for companies with long term charter contracts calculate 
the value the each vessel the sum the present value its ebitda during the 
charter and the present value the charter free vessel value based its age the 
end the contract duration and the current newbuild resale and secondhand prices 
similar age vessels include forward balance sheet information based our 
forecast adjusted for asset acquisitions debt and equity issuances newbuilds and 
recently acquired secondhand vessels that have not been delivered are included the 
fleet substracting remaining capex requirement for their acquisition providing credit 
the company for any vessel deposits the company may advance the shipyard seller 
order calculate the fleet value use the adjusting for newbuilds 
recently acquired vessels that have not been delivered adding the value these 
vessels and the market value the company fleet fleet value the sum the 
nav and the net debt plus the remaining capex vessels that have not been delivered 
recognize that nav and fleet value are often viewed backwards looking 
measure and may understate the true value rising market well overstate value 
falling market attempt reduce this effect applying forward net asset 
value approach which has historically proven good predictor shipping stock 
performance 
last also view valuation multiples relation the financial and operational risk 
expressed primarily with ratio net fleet value and charter coverage respectively 
investment risks 
the maritime industries are among the most volatile and unpredictable within the oil 
services and commodity space the main investment risk the overall health the 
global economy although with particular interim risk exposure the fiscal and 
geopolitical specific investment risks include 
the health the global economy for tankers and lng carriers global 
demand for oil and natural gas crucial for rates and may affected the 
direct effects rising energy costs well the indirect impacts energyrelated pressures their major trading partners the decline crude prices 
could reduce demand for offshore activity making projects uneconomical for 
example low oil prices due weakness the global economy could 
significantly reduce drilling offshore construction and consequently demand for 
commodity transportation tanker rates are also sensitive the quantity oil 
shipped not much the price oil change opec export policy which 
ships its crude tanker could have negative impact tanker rates 
the dry bulk industry particularly sensitive china india and other developing 
asian economies trades iron ore coal and grain are directly impacted the 
level overall economic activity which therefore affect spot and longer term 
shipping rates containership demand directly linked the global economy 
and the strength trade 
capacity substantial increase shipyard capacity without subsequent 
increase demand for tonnage has negative implications for dry bulk newbuild 
resale and second hand prices slowdown scrapping older vessels without 
any increase demand adds total supply negatively impacting the viability 
attractive market rates and therefore shipping stocks 
charter credit risk the past the extraordinary gap between spot earnings and 
time charter rates has led wave defaults the dry bulk market primary 
reason for this the weak financial health certain dry bulk charterers and 
secondarily container liner operators effective assessment counterparty risk 
shipping companies crucial minimizing this risk 
government regulations the effect regulatory slowdown the pace 
issuing drilling permits and the imposition laws regulations that result 
reduced exploration and production activities and therefore demand for tanker 
vessels 
limited operating history this particular concern for dry bulk and 
containership stocks which have much shorter trading history than their tanker 
and osv counterparts most those companies came market after 
establishing trading record that lacks the duration other industries
