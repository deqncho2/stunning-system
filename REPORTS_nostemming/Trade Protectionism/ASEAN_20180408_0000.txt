likely benefit more china the diversify other import sources due 
higher tariffs malaysia and thailand are comparatively less exposed china 
trade disruption and could benefit from china turning alternative import

trade friction has risen since the start the year with the putting safeguard

imports from china strategic sectors apr the latter currently under public 
consultation but has led proportionate response from china impose tariff 
imports such soybeans cars chemicals and aircraft return the

further chinese imports 
export momentum has not been affected far 
due higher base effects the yoy export growth trajectory value and volume 
terms for the asean korea and taiwan region has gone from earlier acceleration 
phase phase which largely cruising along exhibit however sequential 
seasonally adjusted basis data for jan feb suggest that trade momentum has continued 
rise the region despite concerns about trade friction and korea trade data for 
march shows that trailing momentum remains favourable indeed value 
terms this export upswing which began the asean korea and taiwan region 
has been quite similar pace the export recovery seen exhibit export 
volume recovery lagging somewhat compared with the upswing this driven 
both commodities and non commodities exhibit and export momentum has been 
broad based across destinations with asia leading the and the trailing currency

trade friction escalates how would affect other asian 
economies looking the different transmission conduits 
believe negotiation and escalation will likely the endgame however the 
tariff plan the back section investigations china response and the 
counterresponse last week increase risks escalation rhetoric the coming weeks 
see asia trade policy cards the table apr given the elevated 
uncertainty trade policies lay out framework for thinking through what the 
impact may other parts asia 
the impact from trade friction will likely come through few conduits 
direct impact from bilateral trade friction between the and various countries from 
safeguard measures solar panels and washing machines and tariffs 
steel aluminium 
indirect impact bilateral trade friction between the and china from the 
tariff that each side looking impose imports more 
broader spillover trade friction escalates rising trade policy uncertainty could 
affect sentiment leading tightening financial market conditions and causing 
demand slow 
direct impact from bilateral trade friction likely limited even 
for more exposed economies 
calculate that the export segments affected the safeguard measures and the 
steel aluminium tariffs imposed the make between and total 
exports the exhibit this due product segments such solar panels and 
iron steel malaysia one the top solar panel producers globally amid fdi inflows 
and tax breaks 
however believe the direct impact from bilateral trade friction between the and 
various asian economies the back the safeguard measures and the 
steel aluminium tariffs likely limited this because even the case 
malaysia which most exposed the affected export segments make only 
gdp meanwhile affected export segments account for gdp less for the 
other asian economies exhibit the case economies which have been involved 
bilateral trade disputes specific export segments for example korea note that 
past incidents have typically not derailed the export trajectory which more dependent

indirect impact china bilateral trade friction would 
mixed for economies and sectors but overall macro impact from 
tariffs each and china imports likely 
manageable 
the bilateral trade dispute between the and china likely have mixed effects 
believe 
would negatively affect participants the production supply chain feeding into 
chinese exports the exports china taiwan singapore and korea are 
relatively more exposed 
production chain linkages from increased globalization mean that bilateral trade friction 
between the and china would likely have knock effects believe that 
economies likely more affected china bilateral trade friction are those that 
have larger export exposure china and the 
run higher trade surpluses with these economies 
iii have bigger components their exports china and the catering 
intermediate use meaning that they could exported elsewhere 
have made investments overseas manufacturing bases china and the 
taken together the likes taiwan singapore and korea stand out with higher exportto gdp ratios and higher trade surpluses with china and the exhibit exhibit and 
exhibit look foreign direct investment china and the suggests that korea 
and taiwan also likely have more overseas manufacturing facilities these locations 
compared with other asian economies meaning that these manufacturing facilities could 
affected china trade policies additionally korea exports china are 
for intermediate use whilst taiwan exports china are for intermediate use 
this means that these could end final demand elsewhere and hence would 
more exposed any tariffs that the imposes china aside the proportion 
exports from asean korea taiwan the that are for intermediate use not high 
other words the production supply chain dynamics are such that asian exporters are 
less likely affected china imposing tariffs exports than the 
imposing tariffs chinese exports exhibit

overall think the net macro impact likely manageable our china 
economists expect that china gdp growth would slow only respectively 
the back reciprocal tariffs trade each direction overall 
see three groups the region the first group consists taiwan singapore and korea 
which are more exposed china trade disruption given their greater trade exposure 
and the production supply chain dynamics the region but they would also bigger 
beneficiaries china diversifying other import sources the event higher 
tariffs the second group consists malaysia and thailand which are comparatively 
less exposed china trade disruption and the same time could benefit from the 
and china turning alternative import sources the third group consists 
indonesia and the philippines which would hurt less but would also benefit less 
from china import diversification the longer term higher tariffs lead fdi 
outflows from china and the diversify into alternative production bases 
economies with favourable demographics and lower manufacturing costs would likely 
benefit and this would include economies the third group indonesia and the 
philippines alongside other economies such vietnam 
broader spillover from rising trade friction the key watch 
who loses more who loses less singapore taiwan and korea 
are relatively more exposed indonesia and philippines less 
for the region the export upswing was important driver the growth recovery 
the export recovery has also helped slow the rise the debt gdp ratio 
alleviating the structural debt headwinds some the economies face morgan stanley 
global team has highlighted the key things watch terms whether trade friction 
escalates escalates from here see asia trade policy cards the table apr 
should get more aggressive protectionist push scenario the extent 
collateral impact would depend the path taken the endgame and the specifics 
policy measures implemented during that process nonetheless the region would likely 
affected rising trade policy uncertainty affects sentiment and causes financial 
conditions tighten and domestic demand such capex plans deferred 
the economies which are more exposed terms growth are those which have 
higher export orientation and higher concentration exports fewer export 
markets this context singapore taiwan and korea are comparatively more exposed 
all else equal whilst indonesia and the philippines are less exhibit 
herfindahl hirschman market concentration index
