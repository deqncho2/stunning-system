cautious 
some our thoughts some the proposed changes nafta far 
less affordable cars increasing the local regional sourcing threshold 
and requiring value come from plants that pay 
workers minimum hour will likely drive higher manufacturing 
costs oems will try pass these costs onto consumers through higher

executing remind investors that the auto cycle unprecedented 
levels finance penetration average transaction prices leasing 
penetration and loan maturity length 
china bigger issue resolving trade tensions with china far greater 
concern investors our view chinese auto sales are down nearly 
through the first weeks august our china team remains concerned 
over the recent slowdown the auto retail consumer rising regulatory 
pressure and the potential for anti american sentiment impacting volume 
select manufacturers the market are watching the situation very 
closely with the help our china team 
global trade and macro concerns have dampened sentiment auto 
names for much seems the market removing small layer 
this discount over the past trading sessions auto stocks are cheap 
they should this late point the cycle and many have been 
making moves around restructuring exiting unprofitable regions and 
extracting value around tech capabilities and data monetization 
increasingly conspicuous ways however our discussions with investors 
reveals very little appetite assume even the most modest level 
global trade risk that could accelerate negative revisions contribute 
contagion note that the magnitude the bounce the share prices 
and fca were broadly similar pct despite varying levels 
mexican supply exposure ford less exposed than either fca 
our view performance for auto names over the next months will 
dominated auto credit including used prices strategic actions 
including restructuring tech carve outs and external validation new
