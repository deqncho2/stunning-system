recasting inflation tariffs and 
much much more 
number recent developments including tariffs have the 
potential alter the trajectory core inflation fold them 
all into our inflation forecast using transparent assumptions 
and find they have roughly offsetting effects leaving our core

this analysis fold the following recent developments into our 
inflation forecast 
tariffs enacted steel aluminum and some capital goods imports 
higher jet fuel prices 
the supreme court decision authorizing state taxation remote 
sales 
amazon acquisition prescription drug distribution company 
revised dollar exchange rate path incorporating recent movements 
bea revisions core pce inflation the first half this year 
the net effect these developments leaves our core inflation projection 
basically unchanged see core pce inflation 
and which compares the median fomc forecast 
and 
then examine several alternative scenarios where tariffs increase 
further raising core pce inflation about percentage point above our 
baseline forecast only under widespread tariffs full blown 
escalation the core inflation effect considerable percentage

inflation forecast revisions 
tariffs implemented far should have little impact core inflation our view 
number other recent developments are consequential and net out leave our core 
inflation projection little changed our core pce forecasts remains 
and 
our mid year outlook set our core pce inflation forecast line with 
the quarterly model nalewaik then moved the forecast slightly above 
the model based expected rise medicare reimbursement rates for doctors and 
hospitals idiosyncratic factor not captured the model see economics 
interest rates and equity research healthcare costs the june 
understand how the revisions outlined below fit with the baseline model projection 
note that the model sets mean inflation trend inflation estimated average 
inflation the and since the mid removing the effects slack and the 
dollar exchange rate believe that part the reason why average inflation was low 
from the mid the present was structural factors such globalization and the 
diffusion technology including the internet therefore these factors are already 
incorporated into the model least some extent and reflected its low estimate 
mean inflation and would only deviate from the model based these factors 
believed they were likely move inflation more less than their average effect since 
the mid 
two important caveats 
exhibit lists the revisions have made the core pce inflation forecast with this 
update discuss each turn before moving the inflation effects alternative 
scenarios with higher tariffs but first two points note about the tariffs 
going forward measures response could partially offset upward pressure 
inflation from tariffs the calculations here quantify the upward pressure 
inflation from tariffs but that upward pressure may partially offset 
downward pressure inflation from measures response that reduce demand 
for exports for example soybean prices have declined sharply over the last 
couple months partially from declining chinese export demand following the 
imposition tariffs this primarily impacts headline pce inflation not core but 
food prices have small impact core pce through the food services 
subcomponent estimate that would take percentage point decline 
the commodity research bureau crb spot foodstuffs index shave basis 
point percentage point from the core pce price index unlikely that tariffs 
response have lowered food prices that much and the administration has 
taken countermeasures 
sustained onshoring trend could reverse past downward pressure inflation from 
globalization and offshoring the tariff calculations this note include only direct 
pass through effects however circumstances may have changed enough that 
offshoring supply chains emerging markets may longer pass the cost benefit 
test for many firms that case the downward pressure inflation since the 
from globalization and offshoring would smaller going forward and 
sustained onshoring trend might reverse some the past downward pressure 
however the ultimate outcome from trade negotiations still the air 
think premature incorporate these indirect effects into our inflation forecast

discussion individual revisions 
currently enacted tariffs 
since few tariffs were implemented from the mid the present appropriate 
make judgmental adjustment the forecast account for the tariffs that have 
been implemented although these cover few consumer goods far for example the 
billion chinese imports subject percent tariff almost entirely capital 
equipment higher prices for capital goods could raise the cost production for 
consumer goods but the higher cost should spread out over number years since 
capital equipment durable and often financed with debt take the average 
depreciation rate for capital equipment about percent our starting point for 
estimating the pass through higher capital goods prices consumer prices 
then scale down the pass through factor since some the higher costs likely 
will absorbed profit margins rather than passed consumers this yields 
pass through estimate for capital goods tariffs consumer goods percent 
emphasize the considerable uncertainty around this estimate 
with this assumption higher consumer prices absorb billion the billion 
tariff costs pre substitution nominal spending core pce amounts about 
trillion the higher prices raise core pce inflation basis point next year the 
remaining tariff costs will postponed issuing debt absorbed profit margins 
across the production chain reduced firms substitute away from the capital goods 
subject tariffs 
similarly low direct rate pass through steel and aluminum costs consumer 
prices likely hold particularly since price increases for the considerable amount 
steel used building construction and equipment manufacturing likely pass 
through higher consumer prices very slowly and incompletely furthermore the 
literature reference below the discussion alternative tariff scenarios estimates 
exchange rate pass through not much higher than percent for consumer goods 
and price changes intermediate goods like steel should have slower and smaller passthrough consumer goods prices than exchange rate movements that affect consumer 
goods prices directly 
however higher prices for steel imports likely raise the price domestic steel since 
domestic and imported steel are highly substitutable and roughly double our passthrough estimate account for this effect bringing percent again 
emphasize the large uncertainty bands surrounding this estimate under this base 
assumption higher consumer prices absorb billion the billion added costs 
from steel and aluminum tariffs boosting core pce inflation more basis 
points 
last the tariffs implemented washing machines did produce sizable response cpi 
which raised inflation about basis point the first half this year expect these 
price increases have largely played out already though exhibit shows the breakdown

supreme court decision authorizing state taxation remote 
sales 
recent thorough gao study estimates the recent supreme court decision authorizing 
state taxation remote sales will generate billion additional taxes assume 
that most but not all these remote sales are part core pce and since the cpi 
measures feeding into core pce measure prices are inclusive tax the higher taxes will 
boost inflation using the same methodology for tariffs the added cost taxes 
divided nominal core pce implies boost about basis points core pce 
inflation assume that this effect will spread out over the rest this year and 
next year some states may start collecting taxes with bit delay 
amazon downward pressure prescription drug prices 
after amazon announced its entry into the prescription drug industry through its 
purchase pillpack the stock prices walgreens and cvs each declined roughly 
assuming the decline reflects expected downward pressure margins through 
lower prices the implied effect amazon entry prices can computed 
multiplying the stock price decline the profit margin for drugs which appears 
about the implied drug price decline multiplied the share 
prescription drugs core pce produces effect about basis points assume 
this downward pressure drug prices will spread out over several years lowering 
core pce inflation basis points this year and basis points next year however 
amazon and the internet more broadly likely have been placing downward pressure 
inflation since the perhaps contributing the low estimate mean inflation 
already incorporated into the model whether the pillpack acquisition will produce 
downward pressure inflation that greater than the average downward pressure 
from the internet since the mid debatable but assume will

inflation effects alternative tariff scenarios 
consider three alternative scenarios that incorporate higher tariffs estimate that 
the first two further raise core pce prices the end modest amounts around 
percentage point the third scenario assumes widespread heavy tariffs and raises 
inflation considerably more over percentage points for more discussion these 
scenarios see global economics global supply chain impact who most exposed jul

the status quo scenario assumes more tariffs are imposed 
the escalation scenario assumes tariff the list billion chinese 
imports recently released the administration well tariff auto imports 
from the the billion list includes about billion consumer goods and 
the pass through the tariffs consumer goods consumer goods prices the key 
parameter for estimating the effect inflation recent new york fed staff paper 
estimates relatively small pass through exchange rate movements consumer 
goods prices and while there little work tariff pass through feenstra 
supports the notion that exchange rate pass through can used approximate tariff 
pass through 
assume tariff pass through percent for consumer goods the end 
higher than estimates exchange rate pass through consumer goods because 
believe the greater salience tariffs will facilitate higher pass through the recent 
experience with washing machines suggests relatively high pass through well 
however think substantial portion the cost tariffs consumer goods will 
absorbed profit margins both here and the countries exporting the 
for tariffs capital goods and intermediate inputs continue use and 
percent estimates pass through respectively under these pass through assumptions 
the tariff billion chinese imports and the tariff auto 
imports raise core pce prices additional basis points compared the status quo 
raising the overall effect tariffs core pce inflation about percentage point 
the severe escalation scenario assumes tariff all chinese imports along with 
the tariff all auto imports from the about half chinese imports are 
consumer goods subject the relatively high percent pass through rate under this 
scenario tariffs raise core pce prices additional basis points compared the 
status quo increasing the overall effect tariffs core pce inflation about 
percentage point 
the full blown escalation scenario assumes tariff all chinese and imports 
which would raise core inflation much more than the modest increases the other 
scenarios these additional tariffs would raise core pce prices additional basis 
points this scenario raising the overall effect tariffs percentage points
