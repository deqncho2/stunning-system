the global input output model explained 
georgi deyanov 
note methodology our approach based input output 
ners declines well looked from the angle the supply 
matrix summarising the inter dependencies among different sectors 
chain partners means fewer exports and thus also decline 
the economy tracks what extent the output one sector 
demand for the local economy the demand shock also 
becomes input another sector this model can used simu 
passes through the two main channels magnification the 
late how the change final demand for one product can traced 
intra and inter industry effects 
back through all the sectors and countries that provide inputs into 
global supply chain impact now that the main supply chain 
the final product how the increase the price intermediate 
partners the tariff affected countries have also suffered 
input can traced back all the final products directly and indi 
decline production the same logic applies their own 
rectly contributes 
supply chain partners where one can also find the tariff affected countries and thus the global supply chain effect can 
want know more specifically our work based world input 
additionally impact their economies negative way 
output tables wiod and underlying data covering countries 
and model for the rest the world for data for sectors 
another major advantage input output analysis that also 
are classified according the international standard industrial clas 
allows distinguish between gross output turnover and 
sification revision isic rev the key reference timmer 
value added turnover less cost intermediate goods and services 
dietzenbacher los stehrer and vries illus 
bought recognising that value added and not gross exports 
trated user guide the world input output database the case 
that matters for overall gdp thus once calculate the size the 
global automotive production review international economics 
three main effects our model focus gross value added 
stripping out intermediate consumption gauge the impact the 
overall economy 
what are the advantages this approach the benefit this 
method that can help understand the detailed process pro 
our approach allows identify vulnerable sectors 
duction and reveal how trade changes propagate throughout the 
model one time change that works via multiple channels the pro 
system following our first publication based the input output 
duction and global supply chain move away from the complexity 
approach have updated our model capture the supply chain 
and black box characteristics large dynamic general equilibrium 
effects global scale now capture three main effects for each 
models also allows zoom the effects sector sector 
economy and its subsectors 
and outline not only the obvious sectors which would more vulnerable upturn trade frictions but also the ones that would 
domestic impact the economy the increase import 
affected spillovers from the impact the global supply chain 
tariffs from one country affects the exporting country negatively increases the prices the exported goods and thus 
what are the potential drawbacks potential pitfall that the 
translates into negative demand shock the demand shock 
database use given how extensive the data collection tends 
impacts the exporter economy through two main channels 
lag three years currently wiod data cover and updates 
the intra and inter industry effects the intra industry 
infrequently however considering that the structure economy 
effect has with the initial change one firm turnover 
changes very slowly believe this acceptable trade off 
falls one sector other firms suppliers clients the 
same sector will likely affected too which magnifies the 
the income effect consumption and investment not cap 
initial change the inter industry effect has with reper 
tured our framework allows capture the full extent how 
cussions along the domestic supply chain other sectors 
trade shocks propagate through the global supply chain yet 
may affected well 
although theoretically possible not include any second round 
initial impact supply chain partners production 
effects from the decline economic activity employment house 
declines the tariff affected countries their demand for 
hold consumption and investment why because while global 
imports intermediate goods from their main trading part 
supply chains can assumed less flexible and slow evolving 
foundation 
less obvious assume that firms and households will behave 
further consider three escalation scenarios that build the 
linear way trade goods does moreover policy makers each 
status quo scenario these escalation scenarios are hypothetical 
country can take measures offset the negative impact and thus 
nature and are based information circulated the media and 
mitigate the impact consumption and investment 
some extent the authorities the respective countries once 
calculate the value the goods with imposed tariffs for each sector 
behavioural reaction functions response exogenous 
the economies then calculate weighted tariff increase based 
changes our model does not consider dynamic shifts the economic 
their share the sector total exports the respective coun 
relationships such changes economic agents behaviour this 
tries the calculated weighted tariff increase represents the price 
also applies financial market impacts such adjustments 
increase our model which use combination with price 
exchange rates response shifts trade patterns any impact 
mand elasticities calculate initial trade shock for each country 
via changes financial conditions another assumption that falls 
this category that assume producers transfer the full extent 
price demand elasticities for price elasticities china export 
the increase prices along the supply chain result the increase 
demand mainly adopt results from previous imf study entitled 
tariffs while this assumption convenient for modelling pur 
china changing trade elasticities which finds generally elastic 
poses reality producers can absorb some the price increases 
response chinese exports price changes our simulation 
through lowering their profit margins this could especially true 
use the following price elasticities for seven broad categories 
regions where profit margins are higher than the rest the world 
products agriculture manufacturing material chemicals 
due higher levels productivity relatively lower labour costs 
transportation machinery commodities electrical 
electronic products and others for the mainly adopt 
scenario assumptions our status quo scenario designed cap 
similar estimates elasticities from the same imf study focused

products that are covered under tariffs but not covered these 
future the scenario aim realistic nature yet not exhaus 
studies assume elasticity but the effects could larger

for certain categories where substitution towards imports from 
tariff increases for all countries the sectorial classification used
