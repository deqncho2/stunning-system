trade disputes have dominated headlines but not find 
systematic impacts equities therefore focus 
individual stocks with high low sensitivity trade risk 
michelle weaver 
trade disputes primarily involving the have been the news since march 
natural question how risks associated with trade disputes have been 
influencing equities specifically are there any trade risk trades cohorts 
stocks that respond differently news regarding trade disputes 
signals are mixed trade disputes influencing equity cohort returns mid cap 
stocks typically less global have outperformed large caps exhibit consistent 
with trade risk effects centric sectors have also outperformed the other 
hand the market since march contrary trade disputes being disruptive 
and mega caps have outperformed 
hard draw conclusions from these results since they may have non trade 
risk drivers including earnings and interest rates isolate trade risk factor 
need observe its daily effect stocks constructed trade risk factor 
using currencies commodities and equity indexes see quantitative equity 
research trade risk factor perspective exhibit but was not highly 
correlated with equity cohort returns 
this note test three extensions our analysis search for systemic 
trade risk impacts building news based trade risk factor testing high sharpe 
ratio factors and adjusting for noise our trade risk factor none these 
approaches was able identify systemic trade risk effects 
since equity cohorts are not being driven trade risk focus identifying 
individual stocks with high sensitivity trade risk exhibit some stocks such 
cat have nearly twice the trade risk sensitivity the overall market our 
estimation technique different from the standard approach and find that 
certain stocks such nvda adbe acn amzn and nke show relatively 
more exposed than their peers 
among the large stocks with the least exposure trade risk exhibit there 
wide range sensitivities wmt cost and pfe show more exposed 
trade risk our approach than with the standard method while pep and aet 
are less exposed

trade risk equities systemic 
large stocks with extreme trade risk sensitivity 
the crux this note that despite trying number different approaches 
not find any factors connected with trade risk for equities few factors like the 
overall market have statistically significant correlations with our trade risk proxy but 
the explanatory power squared low under for the market and few 
percent less for other factors 
since not observe cohorts stocks being driven trade risk provide lists 
individual stocks that have high and low sensitivities our trade risk factor this 
factor described the next section based the returns currencies commodities 
and equity indexes that are sensitive global trade compute daily returns our 
trade risk factor since march and measure the sensitivity the largest stocks 
use modified technique estimate the sensitivities stocks trade risk these 
exposures are shown the highlighted column with the border exhibit and exhibit 
and they are ranked according these values the other highlighted column shows the 
sensitivities computed the standard approach these values are all smaller than the 
ones estimate since they are biased down noise our trade risk factor 
among the largest stocks cat has the most trade risk sensitivity exhibit with 
value that nearly twice that the overall market compare the sensitivities 
stocks according our approach with those obtained the standard one there are 
some large rankings disparities nvda adbe acn amzn and nke all show being 
more sensitive trade risk than their peers whereas amat and cop are somewhat less 
sensitive were some banks and financial stocks that did not make this list

there wide range exposures among stocks that are least sensitive trade 
the one hand nee and have oppositely signed exposures while those like wmt 
cost and pfe show with about one third the exposure cat those three stocks 
also have much more trade risk sensitivity our approach than the standard 
approach meanwhile pep aet and amt show being less exposed using our 
approach 
why use modified approach computing trade risk sensitivity our trade risk factor 
only proxy for trade risk and contains measurement error relative the true 
but unobservable trade risk because this measurement error the sensitivities 
estimate for individual stocks are biased downward under the usual method ordinary 
least squares regression ols they are too low magnitude whether they are 
negative positive see appendix

split the equity universe two ways search for systemic effects trade disputes 
first use the largest gics industries industries potentially allow capture 
many different dynamics including market beta style cyclical defensive and quality 
however since the industry returns are cap weighted they may not fully reflect trade

equal weight size buckets the top stocks each bucket contains stocks with

news based approach quantifying trade risk 
previously used returns trade sensitive assets certain equities currencies and 
commodities characterize trade risk this section describe the construction and 
testing news based trade risk factor 
starting march searched for daily headlines related trade disputes using 
number sources for each relevant news item included time stamp 
could determine when the latest was available during the trading day news 
items arriving prior eastern given day were assigned same day market 
impact while items arriving after given day were assigned the next trading 
day impact 
for each item assigned value corresponded event that lessened 
trade disputes events that escalated trade disputes received while events whose 
direction was unclear received zero many days were unable find meaningful 
trade dispute related news items those days received 
typical news item might announces tariffs chinese goods valued 
billions dollars certain date would have score since 
exacerbates trade disputes and would apply the following trading day since 
occurred after 
finally multiple news items mapped the same trading day considered them 
combination give overall for that day the resulting series shown below 
exhibit not surprisingly there are far more days where news exacerbates trade risk 
rather than reduces there are also number gaps the coverage 
one limitation our approach that treats all news items having the samemagnitude impact regarding trade adding magnitude each the days perhaps 
based wording frequency mentions dollars potentially involved etc could 
provide additional context however our simple approach gives indication the

could high sharpe ratio factors correlated with trade risk 
when analyzed trade risk previously our focus was seeing how key risk factors 
among industries and size cohorts were correlated with trade risk through the returnsbased proxy constructed principal components analysis pca well suited for this 
since the main factors identified pca are the ones that explain the largest fraction 
risk 
could possible however for trade risk make big impact the cross sectional 
average returns equities way that has relatively low variability over time other 
words since trade risk became bigger issue march some groups stocks could 
have steadily appreciated while other groups steadily declined causing big spread 
cross sectional returns but since this occurred gradually would not register among 
the biggest risk factors the last six months these boring terms risk but not 
terms return spreads factors might barely register with pca yet important 
return differences among stocks 
why might suspect that trade risk could result high sharpe ratio factors 
observe steadily rising trajectory for mid cap large cap equity cohort returns over 
this period particularly when compared with the volatility other factors such style 
value growth even the market exhibit contrast style risk value growth 
and equity market returns are more volatile

size spreads could associated with trade risk due the generally more global nature 
larger firms while size spread may one manifestation trade risk there may 
other more important ones this motivates look for factors with high sharpe 
ratios that may correlated with trade risk such factors may not prominent 
traditional pca but still important for cross sectional returns 
method for finding high sharpe ratio factors has just been introduced professors 
martin lettau and markus pelger and can implemented easily standard pca 
use this method called risk premium pca pca identify factors with high 
sharpe ratios from industries and size cohorts and then compute the correlations 
these high sharpe ratio factors with our trade risk factor this section are 
referring our returns based trade risk factor rather than the news based factor

measurement error trade risk driving low equity 
correlations 
our returns based trade risk factor constructed from select currency commodity and 
country equity index returns only approximation the true trade risk whatever 
that other words our trade risk factor contains measurement error relative the 
actual trade risk the presence measurement error exerts downward bias called 
attenuation bias the sensitivities asset returns the factor with measurement 
error see appendix for explanation the absence measurement error the 
sensitivities equities trade risk would higher 
difficult estimate the measurement error for our trade risk factor however 
can use technique called instrumental variables estimate sensitivities equity 
risk factors trade the presence measurement error good instrumental 
variable which return series augmenting the original independent variable has two 
properties correlated with the independent variable this case our trade risk 
factor but not otherwise correlated with the dependent variable this case 
equity cohort stock return 
good instrumental variables are notoriously difficult find standard approach when 
measurement error believed modest use the rankings the independent 
variable however the rankings the time series our returns based trade 
risk proxy had correlation with the original trade risk proxy the rankings series 
would likely have retained too much the measurement error 
second that tested was the volatility china etf exhibit specifically 
used the daily percent changes the cboe china etf volatility index vxfxi which 
reflects the implied volatility the ishare china large cap etf fxi fxi tracks the 
ftse china index investing large cap stocks focused financial oil and gas 
technology and communications sectors 
not surprisingly this had meaningful correlation with the trade risk proxy 
the question that can easily answered how correlated has china etf volatility 
been equity cohort returns other than through trade risk argue that since 
there has not been chinese equity situation unrelated trade disputes that would 
feed back into equity returns during this period march september the 
residual correlation the with equities should low

appendices 
appendix identifying high sharpe ratio factors 
recent papers martin lettau and markus pelger introduced modification principal 
components analysis pca that explains both the risk and the cross sectional returns 
assets the new technique called risk premium pca pca and includes two 
terms one favoring factors that explain variance risk and the other term favoring 
factors that explain differences cross sectional returns standard pca only the first 
term present and factors are chosen based explaining the largest fraction risk 
what the motivation for this approach arbitrage pricing theory which theoretical 
underpinning pca focused finding factors that can explain both the risk and 
average returns assets identify factors that have risk premia cross sectional mean 
returns must included pelger and lettau find that pca has two main beneficial 
properties 
consistent with usual pca estimating strong factors like the market factor 
typically the first principal component for equities that have meaningful loadings 
all assets there even some improvement efficiency for estimating strong factors 
with pca 
allows you find weak factors with high sharpe ratios that would not seen 
traditional pca weak factors are those that have large magnitude loadings only 
some the assets this typical for long short factors everything but the market 
factor equities 
thus pca can detect factors that explain the risk premia assets the authors find 
higher out sample sharpe ratios for the factors they identify well 
implementing pca very similar that traditional pca you have software 
run pca you can run pca the same manner just using modification the 
covariance matrix there additional parameter pca that controls the weight 
between the risk covariance matrix and means risk premium 
the usual case compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors matrix however 
instead using the covariance matrix standard pca use matrix that the 
combination the covariance matrix and the matrix formed outer product the 
vector the factor mean returns thus information from both the second moment 
covariances and variances and the first moment means used find modified 
principal components 
the estimation step there parameter that determines the relative weight 
between the two terms pca suppose there are assets and time periods the 
nxk matrix returns the assets denoted and the vector expected asset 
returns 
with superscript for transpose then pca applied the matrix 
pelger and lettau show that the above quantity related combination the 
covariance matrix the factors and the vector factor means specifically 
converges 
when 
recover the usual pca when 
both the variance and the 
mean factor will contribute toward its having large eigenvalue higher values 
will emphasize factors with higher sharpe ratios their analysis lettau and pelger 
use 
and therefore test range values between usual pca and 
apply pca two sets equity cohorts the period from march 
through september using daily data one the set cap weighted industry 
returns the largest gics industries the other set equal weight cohorts 
sorted market cap for the top stocks each contains stocks similar 
market caps rather than using standard pca compute factors that explain risk only 
since march use pca identify high sharpe ratio factors over this period 
the motivation for our focus high sharpe ratio factors that size mid cap largecap cohort return spread has had relatively high sharpe ratio over the trade dispute 
period and this factor has association with trade due smaller companies typically 
being less global than larger ones using pca allows systematic 
identifying factors with high risk premia once have found them can test their 
correlations with our trade risk factor

components measured the usual way with those computed from pca the first 
two charts are from the industries while the second two charts are from the size

appendix measurement error attenuation bias and 
instrumental variables 
standard regression models the independent variable assumed uncorrelated 
with the error term suppose that know the true trade risk and regress the 
equity returns 
term 
trade risk has intercept 
sensitivity 
and error 
now suppose that the observed trade risk factor that are working with the true 
trade risk plus some noise 
this means that the observed trade risk factor correlated with the noise and this 
leads biased estimates coefficients when estimate the slope the equity 
return the observed trade risk factor denoted smaller magnitude than 
the true sensitivity 
due the measurement error 
how does instrumental variable help there variable that correlated with 
observed trade risk but otherwise not with the equity returns then can effectively 
split the observed trade risk factor into two parts one that related trade risk 
correlated with and one that correlated with the error perform the original 
equity trade regression two stages the resulting sensitivity the ratio the 
covariance the dependent variable equity return and the covariance the 
regressor trade risk and 
however the standard errors may larger for the regressions even though the 
slopes compute are larger without measurement error the significance and hence 
correlation may not larger are trading off unbiased slope estimates for higher 
variability
