the latest round china tariffs seems creating 
more concern for autos investors fearful that the may 
raise import duties whilst seems too early for any 
concrete conclusions show some sensitivities this 
report 
deeya souza 
tariff policies seem worrying auto investors friday news that post the 
announced steel and aluminium tariffs the would impose import duties 
china imports from july and china response 
imposing equal duties exports china including cars seems 
worrying autos investors wrote about the initial tariff impact risks march 
there are three obvious risks the may follow through previous 
proposals levy import duties european cars exported the steel 
and aluminium tariffs may raise the costs production would tariffs 
imported parts and global trade disputes may impact negatively global 
economic growth prospects time when the has already turned 
negative meaning data not meeting expectations have highlighted 
many times auto valuation multiples react sharply adjusting global growth 
expectations our china economists highlight that the stakes have risen 
bmw and mercedes are large auto producers but gross imports that 
matter whilst bmw and mercedes are major producers vehicles the 
with large suv assembly plants and bmw net exporter suvs from the 
europe and china the risk from tariffs gross imports not net 
produces little the but major assembler puebla mexico every 
german oem gross exporter vehicles the calculate 
gross revenues for audi bmw and mercedes and for including audi 
and porsche whilst far too early know what changes any may 
decided upon show illustration that for every impact price 
assuming oems offset higher tariffs some degree protect sales german 
oems lose approximately group ebit roughly that for every 
volume loss course believe also possible that political pressure 
could result reduction european auto import duties which case german oems could actually benefit suv import duties fall 
conclusion sxap reversing relative outperformance the sxap has 
underperformed the eurostoxx and dax and since their peaks 
march coinciding with the deterioration the cesi europe european 
growth expectations proved too high was ever thus part our hesitation 
recommending auto oems has been the level economic optimism quite apart 
from record earnings any threat either was always likely drive downside 
risk this seems now happening once more with oem earnings coming 
under pressure from lower growth especially china euro concerns 
worries headwinds from and wltp disruption europe from
