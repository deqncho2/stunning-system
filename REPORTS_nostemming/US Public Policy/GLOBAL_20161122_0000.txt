financials stocks particularly banks have reacted quite positively 
president elect trump expected policies particularly infrastructure spending 
and lower corporate taxes which are clear positives for the banks and contribute 
rising bond yields higher inflation expectations paired with hawkish fed 
commentary have greater confidence near term fed funds rate hike and 
are building bps hike dec into our models resulting higher eps

which stocks should benefit the most from higher short term rates and steeper 
yield curve overall banks have the most direct exposure higher rates 
followed closely hong kong banks asia hong kong taiwan singapore 
and europe 
united states banks benefit the most from higher fed funds due their

large cap banks betsy graseck 
large cap bank stocks have marked market for the recent shift the yield curve 
recent fed commentary and the market outlook for rates post election gave more 
confidence bake the benefits from higher rates our models and recently took 
eps across the group while were previously being more conservative 
assuming rates remain flat line with the current spot curve plus one rate hike 
are now using the higher forward curve our estimates this move 
equivalent roughly bps parallel shift the yield curve expect most not 
all the benefit from higher rates will fall the bottom line our banks did not cut 
investment spend while rates were low large cap banks stocks are however 
median since the election stocks have already marked market for this shift 
the yield curve 
large cap banks that should benefit the most from higher rates are bac 
ow and jpm bac and jpm appear particularly cheap these 
stocks are only baking the benefit from higher rates and not the significant benefit 
that comes from lower regulation lower taxes and higher growth 
but still see more upside bull case eps why the recent republican sweep 
comes with more than just bps shift rate expectations believe there 
scope for lower taxes less regulation and more growth which could collectively drive 
eps much from here rate expectations could also move further 
inflation expectations could rise period higher infrastructure spend that occurs 
time higher government borrowing and lower taxes more our reports here and 
here 
exhibit stocks are expectations for higher rates and perceived benefits less regulation

midcap banks ken zerbe 
the banks that should benefit most from higher rates are sivb ewbc tcb 
cma and cfg each these banks would see roughly more increase 
net interest income from bps increase interest rates conversely would 
expect little benefit and perhaps modest headwind from higher rates overweightrated sbny and nycb and underweight rated the median midcap bank would see 
net interest income nii increase over the months following bps 
parallel move rates although the individual bank sensitivities vary significantly 
sivb the most asset sensitive bank cover getting benefit nii while 
nycb would see headwind nii higher rates fall the bottom line with 
offset from higher expenses would expect the group see its eps improve 
roughly 
the most basic level higher rates should allow most the midcap banks 
banks are asset sensitive will benefit from higher rates earn more their 
interest earning assets than they will need pay their liabilities higher funding 
costs the reason that the midcaps have sizable exposure shorter duration 
commercial industrial loans which tend floating rate loans tied shortterm benchmarks such prime and libor the average midcap bank has its 
loan book lending and makes more total loans five our 
banks the banks with the most loans are sivb cma key and fhn higher rates 
also allow banks earn more interest income their cash and cash equivalent 
balances and their short duration securities portfolios the yields these balances 
reprice higher rising rate environment currently total earning assets the 
midcap banks and the benefit could even greater they choose invest more cash 
into longer duration and higher yielding securities 
however most midcap bank valuations already reflect the benefit higher rates 
while rising rates and steeper yield curve are undoubtedly positives for the midcap 
banks believe the market has already given the banks full credit and then some for 
this previously discussed our november report downgrading our midcap 
banks industry view cautious midcap banks too far too fast moving cautious 
industry view increased our estimates and price targets incorporate the postelection environment the increase the fed funds futures curve stronger loan 
growth from more infrastructure spending and some cases better capital return and 
yet see roughly downside the midcap banks put simply with the median 
midcap bank trading our eps versus more typical multiple months eps think the market has gotten ahead itself near term baking 
these benefits leaving little upside over the next months absent additional positive 
catalysts such significant reduction corporate tax rates 
still see moderate upside several rated banks that also stand benefit the 
most from higher interest rates sivb and cfg and more benign regulatory 
environment cfg and key 
brokers asset managers michael cyprys 
among our coverage see schw amtd etfc and lpla best positioned for rising 
rates this due combination sticky and low cost client deposits that are 
invested securities the short end the curve which should reprice rapidly when 
rates rise and elimination client fee waivers money market funds when the 
short end the curve rises among these brokers view schw best positioned for 
rate rise with about its interest earning assets sensitive the front end 
the curve our work suggests bps rate rise could drive upside earnings 
schw amtd etfc and lpla our base case reflects the 
forward curve which last refreshed after earnings mid late october since 
then the interest rate outlook has improved which skews closer our bull case that 
reflects normalization fed funds over our bull case see schw 
reaching normalized earnings over share and see the stock worth 
share for over upside asset managers could benefit from rate rise but the 
impact less transparent direct normalization interest rates and central bank 
policies could create better environment for active managers outperform 
benchmarks possibly slowing the flow shift passives alternative asset managers 
could benefit from pockets dislocation that arise during period rising rates and 
their fixed income strategies could benefit from greater income yield 
asia 
australia richard wiles 
the direct impact higher interest rates the major australian banks immaterial 
unlike many global banks higher interest rates will not lead margin expansion 
low cost deposits and capital only anz has its assets and unhedged liabilities 
resulting estimated earnings benefit from every increase 
rates however the performance australian banks could influenced 
movements australian interest rates and the resulting from higher interest 
rates believe there downside risk net interest margins from increasing 
competition and falling cash rates australia refer australia banks falling margins 
jul and our economics team factors further fall the rba cash 
rate the end due the headwinds for growth and unemployment from 
reduction housing related activity refer australia macro rba cautiously 
optimistic nov however higher interest rates could lead weaker 
which turn could lead higher inflation and improved economic outlook 
australia reducing the need for the rba lower interest rates the same time 
higher global inflation and commodity prices could provide some support for australia 
terms trade reducing the downside risks australian bank earnings from 
deteriorating economic outlook 
hong kong anil agarwal 
hong kong well placed benefit from small increase rates given the significant 
excess liquidity which parked the short end the curve any increase interest 
rates would help the banks see better asset yields almost immediately the large hong 
kong banks should also benefit from the sharp improvement have seen casa 
deposits both bochk and hsb have meaningful sensitivity higher rates given their 
large amounts excess liquidity these banks have leverage higher rates 
recently increased our numbers for for hsb and bochk reflect possible 
rate hike year end this drove eps for each bank please see 
our note for details asia financials higher rates who benefits among pure play asian 
banks nov 
the other upside will come from continuous steepening the yield curve hong kong 
banks have seen material price competition the lending side the yield curve 
steepens then can start seeing better lending spreads top the deposit 
spreads 
rates increase materially hong kong banks will see higher credit costs and also 
impact from the pro cyclicality capital property prices have increased sharply hong 
kong since the advent very low rates this has helped the banks get more volume 
growth experience lower loan losses and capital ratios improved for irb banks any 
sharp increases could cause meaningful correction such scenario would shy 
away from hong kong banks any benefit from higher rates would lost the form 
credit costs higher capital calls and rising cost equity 
korea joon seok 
for korean banks the local rate movement more important than what the bok does 
monetary policy however yield curve steepening should influence korean long 
rates certain extent but should not significant enough move the needle for 
earnings larger proportion loans are still priced off shorter term rates the loans 
that are more affected the steepening local interest rates should newly 
originated fixed rate mortgages generally year hybrid fixed rate loans and sme loans 
year working capital loans both which are showing growth tapering off 
korean banks share prices moved initially after trump was elected partially 
driven expectations for local rates upward trajectory but they have 
come back down the market outlook for interest rates remains mixed consensus 
outlook bps bok rate cut for year period with our economics team expecting 
bok further lower rates bps next bps each quarter from and 
this would pressure nim policy rate cut lowers nim bps year basis 
according our analysis furthermore expect the economy slow considerably 
gdp growth forecast consensus the business 
environment general should quite weak for banks especially with property market 
normalizing from year bullish volume cycle hence compared previous cycles the 
sensitivity policy rate changes lower but the difference that offsetting this has 
also become tougher loan growth should slow and credit costs are already quite low 
please refer our korea financials new normal downgrading industry view 
cautious aug for more details 
the positive angle that banks capital structures have strengthened especially for 
hana and expect dividend yields level for hana continue 
prefer hana within korean banks with valuation being compelling and more resilient 
roe expected 
singapore nick lord 
the extent which singapore bank nims rebound will function both 
rate rises and the relationship between sor and sibor and between and rates 
particular note that singapore rates have diverged from normal patterns over the 
last quarter 
for example historically sor and sibor have tended track each other however 
sor moved down bps whilst sibor remained unchanged this has lowered 
the yield some loans with very little corresponding adjustment the cost funds 
which are sibor linked and was the main driver softer nim over the same 
period sibor premium libor firstly widened reflecting weakness but more 
recently sibor has not responded the pick libor and they now trade parity 
compared historic premium sibor has seen its premium the fed funds future 
come down from just below bps closer bps 
since the presidential election sibor has remained relatively unchanged bps 
but sor has begun move bps the has depreciated the 
the real benefit singapore bank nims would result from further upward moves 
rates note each bps sor and sibor adds bps group nim and 
earnings dbs would benefit the most given its higher levels casa while ocbc 
should also benefit from easier operating environment for its life assurance business 
great eastern 
our existing nim assumptions are based upon the fed funds futures curve for forward 
rates stable bps spread between fed funds futures and sibor and view 
that the gap between sibor and sor will close this basis expect bps nim 
expansion dbs and further bps increase ocbc expect bps 
and bps and for uob bps and bps and respectively 
our bull case assumes that libor follows the fed dot plot and our bear case 
assumes libor increases are the fed funds futures curve with the 
relationship between rates and rates similar our base case assumptions the 
key downside risk our forecasts that either the sor sibor gap remains that the 
sibor fed funds futures gap narrows further 
one final issue note that with the domestic economic outlook remaining sluggish 
sharp rise rates suggested our bull case could have negative implications for 
credit quality especially the sme space 
taiwan silvia fun 
fed funds rate hikes will lead nim expansion for selective taiwanese banks since the 
bps fed funds rate hike december the loan spread taiwan banks 
jumped bps this helped enhance the nim taiwan banks the extent 
the positive impact potential upcoming fed funds rate hikes taiwan banks will 
differ the percentage usd hkd denominated assets they have mega the usd 
clearing bank taiwan possesses the highest usd rate sensitive assets 
which carry low funding costs its dominant usd deposit franchise allows the 
biggest beneficiary fed funds rate hikes and its earnings will react most positively 
that among taiwanese banks expect every bps increase the fed funds rate will 
increase its net profit 
are not concerned about potential liquidity drain taiwan interest rate are 
raised taiwan has abundant liquidity with ldr expect taiwan act 
liquidity provider lend corporates mostly taiwanese asean fed funds rate 
hikes take place this would bring loan growth opportunities taiwanese banks which 
have more usd denominated assets fed funds rate hikes are unlikely raise credit 
cost concerns for taiwan banks our view taiwan has not built excess leverage 
amid low interest rate environment coverage ratios taiwanese banks are also 
exceptionally high regulator imposed strict provision requirements this provides 
very good cushion credit cost our view 
fubon fhc will benefit from high interest rates both its life and bank businesses 
the bank side its assets denominated usd hkd would allow benefit from 
fed funds rate hikes the life side its recurring yield would enhanced with the 
steepening the yield curve its assets are denominated usd expect 
every bps hike fed funds rate and bps increase the year bond yield will 
increase its net profit 
japan hideyasu ban mia nagasaka 
japanese major banks have been growing their loan book the mizuho and 
smfg loans are now overseas loans and those loans are the 
americas thus around the total loans are now and higher interest rate 
will contribute nim expansion their loan businesses 
also historically ust year yield and jgb year used reasonably correlated 
thus steeper curve could eventually lead steeper curve japan however 
since september the central bank japan targets zero percent yield year thus 
japan may not have steeper curve entire zone until core cpi recovers certain 
level currently negative together with nirp domestic nim still under pressure and 
nim expansion the will not completely offset the domestic nim contraction 
result nii not going near term eps growth driver for japan banks 
however japanese bank stocks had rallied post election which appears driven 
multiple recovery for major banks around their ppop now made outside 
japan expectation for widening interest rate differential because steeper curve 
and boj peg japan has led weakening jpy which will raise yen translated 
gains their overseas business japanese banks may not direct beneficiaries terms 
nim expansion but the forex situation could lead further recovery multiples 
also the current positive cycle leads further recovery price expectation and 
further recovery core cpi the positive territory the market could start looking 
the potential domestic nim recovery then eps could become share price driver 
still think would take least few quarters for see that type scenario 
happen the meantime would position japanese major banks upside 
option for weaker jpy 
european banks and diversified financials 
have seen over the last few weeks large caps have marked market for the 
shift the yield curve our banks colleagues bake the benefits the higher 
rates lifting eps european banks rallied sympathy the european yield 
curve steepened somewhat but more importantly rates markets priced out ecb 
december deposit rate cut which would have taken current rate further 
negative yet again disproportionately hitting nii thus current higher confidence the 
nii trough and stronger conviction reflation euro area have driven the 
outperformance over the last two months and believe this will continue 
second order effect assume bottoming rates and some curve steepening europe 
the confidence roe delivery aggregate nii levels find the floor should improve 
across our european portfolio spanish banks would better positioned benefit 
from the higher rates and steeper curve environment discussed our note
