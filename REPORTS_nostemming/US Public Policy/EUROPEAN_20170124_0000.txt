european equity strategy 
macro meets micro european 
implications from changing 
trade and tax policy 
the policy backdrop for trade and tax likely change 
radically the coming years based the scarce details 
available this stage examine which stocks and sectors 
europe face the most impact from possible developments 
changes policies affect european economies through variety channels 
demand for european products delivered via direct exports produced and 
sold locally subsidiaries primarily driven the health the economy 
and the exchange rate both look favourable present protectionist steps that 
the new administration might take nafta partners and china see here 
could divert demand europe where direct action seems less likely 
tax reform has the greatest scope impact european companies 
believe tax reform see here the area policy change most likely 
impact companies this could include cut corporation tax border 
adjustment tax limiting the tax deductibility for depreciation and net interest 
expense and allowing for the immediate tax deductibility capital investment 
also need consider protectionism healthcare reform and stronger usd 
and gdp 
other areas possible policy change that could have implications for 
companies include trade protectionism healthcare reform and the potential for 
stronger dollar and better gdp growth product the wider 
reform agenda 
layering analyst insights onto the views our economists and strategists 
highlight qualitative impacts positive and negative sectors 
have discussed the potential policy changes with our sector analysts and 
together identified the areas that could most affected these conversations 
highlighted that the most significant potential influence should autos 
cement capital goods consumer staples energy healthcare luxury goods 
media and steel 
and then digging deeper into stock implications 
for each sector show which stocks are most likely impacted the five 
factors tax reform protectionism healthcare reform stronger usd and

summary 
there large amount uncertainty around the scope and extent potential 
changes the policy backdrop but seems inevitable that are the cusp 
some significant shifts that will have widespread implications for european stocks the 
lack detail this stage makes difficult precise quantifying the impact but 
this report brings together the insights our economists strategists and sector 
analysts identify the key areas policy that are most likely change and some 
the stocks that would most affected 
economics 
the world two largest developed markets europe and the are very closely 
connected some exports the are intra firm reflecting the fact that 
europe accounts for almost the inward fdi the european owned 
companies also employ about million workers the result think direct 
protectionist measures against europe are unlikely the agenda indirect ties 
through integrated global supply chains span range countries and also might not 
fully captured official statistics 
equity strategy 
possible changes policy are unlikely have any significant affect market 
earnings growth with european companies sales exposure the relatively modest 
the areas potential change policy and subsequent macro implications that 
look likely most relevant for companies are 
tax reform including lower corporate tax rate border adjustment tax limit 
tax deductibility for depreciation and net interest expense immediate tax deductibility

economics mapping transatlantic ties 
changes policies affect european companies through variety channels with 
mistaking the close ties between europe and the terms exports foreign 
direct investment fdi foreign affiliate sales fas portfolio investments and bank 
claims see also the transatlantic economy note that export exposure alone only 
captures part the picture given the importance bilateral fdi between the world 
two largest markets fact fas rather than exports are the main channel through 
which european companies deliver goods and services the fas the 
amount more than three times direct goods exports and about 
times direct services exports fas like direct exports driven the health 
demand and the exchange rate both factors look favourable the start 
additional boost demand for european products could result from protectionist 
measures that the new administration might take its nafta partners and china 
overall europe runs trade surplus about with the while the 
bilateral services deficit around but nearly imports from europe 
are intra firm which considerably higher share than asia and latam 
germany the country with the largest bilateral trade deficit with the the share 
even high not surprising that fas and intra firm trade play such 
dominant role given that europe accounts for almost the inward fdi the 
this should give european companies better shot being heard washington 
protectionist measures against europe could put jobs risk european owned 
companies employ about million workers the and account for all 
conducted foreign owned firms european companies generate exports 
the opposite direction the share intra firm imports only about ireland the 
leading export platform for companies with fas destined for export via ireland

equity strategy the top down implications 
what changes policy mean for europe 
from top down perspective the direct impact the european equity market from 
potential changes policy may limited particularly some the potential 
negatives are offset cyclical boost global growth product the growing 
optimism however possible that subsequent policy shifts are profound and hence 
will have longer lasting influence european equities particularly for certain sectors 
and stocks discuss the latter the next section but here make some general 
points 
from revenue perspective european company exposure the relatively 
modest accounting for sales versus sales and sales made 
domestically within europe 
general believe that any protectionist measures from the are likely 
more targeted china mexico and asia than europe after all hard argue 
that jobs have been lost europe given the latter lack low cost characteristics 
however this distinction would irrelevant the new trade policy focuses 
border adjustability rather than tariffs equivalent border adjustability would make 
differentiation between the source imports into the european companies 
would directly impacted 
regardless the method implementation any increase protectionism 
dampens global trade would have ramifications for europe given the latter nature 
relatively open economy with significant reliance exports this regard 
exhibit illustrates that the european stock market has greater degree foreign 
sales than any the other major regions

key areas potential change policy relevant for companies 
this stage there still high degree uncertainty around the shifts policy that 
may may not take place looking what michael zezas and our team have 
written recent weeks see the following factors and knock consequences 
most relevant for investors when looking assess which european companies could 
most affected 
tax reform 
believe that tax reform the area policy change that likely have the most 
identifiable impact european companies this time this could include 
likely cut corporation tax from down low 
potential for border adjustability exports are excluded from corporate taxation and 
imported expenses are longer excluded businesses taxed solely their domestic 
activity the aim would make businesses more competitive internationally and 
remove incentives for tax inversions and offshoring without the need for tariffs 
other regulation 
iii limiting tax deductibility for depreciation and net interest expense think 
unlikely that this would applied retrospectively 
allowing for immediate tax deductibility capital investment 
repatriation existing overseas cash reduced rate 
protectionism 
although trade restrictions are unlikely directly aimed europe there would 
likely some indirect implications for european companies issues consider include 
companies that sell into the from production facilities countries regions 
that could targeted for trade restrictions china mexico etc investors should 
consider whether this likely limited goods whether will capture services 
too how are financials treated 
more generally companies that have complicated multi national supply chains 
global trade frictions start increase 
healthcare reform 
logically this primarily limited focus european pharmaceutical and medtech 
companies 
stronger usd 
the majority potential changes policy appear relatively bullish for the 
dollar this can benefit companies that have above average sales the region 
who can increase their pricing competitiveness the global marketplace 
better growth 
addition corporate tax reform there are also proposals cut personal tax rates 
increase fiscal spending areas such infrastructure although our economics 
team see only modest rebound gdp around growth and 
possible that these initiatives are able engineer pick economic activity that 
companies can tap into

sector beneficiaries from reflation financials and commodities 
although the reflation trend started last summer received further boost from the 
election outcome with investors perceiving greater probability higher growth 
more inflation and rising rates upcoming policy changes increase investors confidence 
and conviction that this theme has further run then the areas the market most 
sensitive reflation are likely outperform even their level exposure 
modest this regard the sectors the top ofexhibit are those that have the 
strongest positive correlation reflationary factors and hence stand benefit the 
most within the sectors with positive correlation prefer financials and commodity 
stocks over other cyclicals believe valuations and positioning for the latter

stock and sector commentary 
this section summarises the key implications for stocks and sectors the potential 
changes policy noted earlier highlight those stocks where see the greatest 
relative risk upside and downside within each sector ordered from cyclicals then 
defensives and finally financials 
capital goods lucie carrier 
tax reform average exposure sales for capital goods names with 
most exposed stocks being smiths group dometic halma bodycote spectris assa 
abloy vestas electrolux rexel and philips philips lighting with over their sales 
generated the for these names the impact lower corporate tax rate could 
quite significant and while would align tax rates somewhat closer domestic 
rates for swedish and based companies would much lower than most domestic 
tax rates continental europe thus providing meaningful benefit for companies 
with balanced european exposure 
trade this stage unclear for most companies how much their sales 
manufactured outside the but would expect companies like kion with its 
largest facility mexico schneider electric plants mexico osram which recently 
opened new facility mexico for the americas legrand factories electrolux 
facilities assa abloy large china manufacturing base serving the global market and 
dometic global hub for equipment china most exposed the event that 
protectionist measures were applied exports from mexico and china however 
note that these companies all have local manufacturing the well and are not 
just reliant exports for their sales 
aside from potential pressures exports the see the potential for some 
value chain disruption imported products components into the such lighting 
companies with numerous components notably led chips and packages light 
sources like bulbs that are manufactured outsourced from asia this also relevant 
for the appliance industry outsourced products and components even some cabling 
equipment notably auto harnesses also manufactured low cost countries could 
more exposed this could particularly affect companies like osram philips lighting 
electrolux dometic and nexans these risks are not exclusive these specific 
companies however generally expect our sector source more broadly than just 
locally notably for some raw materials but information this topic tends 
limited for now the outlier here rexel which sources and sells fully locally 
healthcare reform look companies exposed healthcare the philips 
and siemens for medical imaging equipment smiths for consumable hospital devices 
halma for ophthalmology and vital signs monitoring and renishaw neurological and 
dental terms long term trends not see step change what have 
observed over the last few years more patients care for and need control 
these costs additionally the wave hospitals consolidation well current 
reimbursement levels after several years cuts are unlikely reverse where they 
were ten fifteen years ago that said see risks the short term due uncertainty 
the final regulatory set healthcare which could delay some 
purchase investments relative terms this could more detrimental for capital 
equipment manufacturers considering the value single item still see 
opportunity for the excise tax medical devices removed the aca indeed 
repealed this could incremental positive 
stronger usd given the relatively large exposure the sector has the most 
our names would see top line tailwind from stronger usd especially and scandi 
exposed names however note that numerous companies notably the electricals 
space tend have large cost base usd well somewhat mitigating not 
offsetting completely the top line benefit earnings especially pricing power the 
industry limited would see electrolux particularly exposed this and 
lesser extent dometic philips philips lighting and zumtobel 
better growth backdrop lower personal tax rates higher wages and lower 
unemployment would benefit our more consumer exposed stocks such electrolux 
dometic philips philips lighting assa abloy and legrand increased infrastructure spend 
could support business for the likes construction equipment suppliers ranging from 
elevator companies schindler and kone low voltage electrical suppliers legrand 
schneider but also cables such prysmian and nexans distributors rexel and 
locks safety assa abloy and halma 
industrialization our short cycle general industrials names would benefit from 
broad pick american output the most exposed companies are schneider skf 
sandvik atlas copco spectris and spirax sarco rexel one the largest automation 
distributors the would also benefit addition more general protectionist 
measures were implemented could opportunity for rexel also distribute 
businesses that relocate the after having been set initially other countries 
and that does not serve currently industrialization scenario were also driven 
investments resources industry names like rotork and abb would benefit 
infrastructure and weir exploration 
stock most positively impacted rexel electricals assa abloy mechanicals smiths 
group 
stock most negatively impacted electrolux electricals kion mechanicals bodycote 
metals mining alain gabriel 
trade while the reflation trade general supportive for mining companies the 
most direct impact the sector would come from any move restrict imports via the 
implementation tariffs border adjustability this would beneficial for the usexposed steel producers such arcelormittal and ssab which would benefit from this 
indirect tax all steel imports into the note that the imports between 
its steel demand import barriers could drive material uplift domestic margins 
these two stocks would also benefit from significant infrastructure program 
well better domestic growth environment generally 
elsewhere the effects the sector are more indirect for example the gold producers 
such acacia centamin and randgold resources could potentially benefit 
protectionist measures are typically inflationary gold commodity has historically 
performed well high inflation environments 
stock most positively impacted arceormittal and ssab 
chemicals paul walsh 
tax reform within the sector believe air liquide and evonik could big

evonik both stocks should also benefit from usd strength 
most our companies have limited transactional impact with production asset

tax reform there may some pockets benefit freight companies with operating 
subsidiaries the domestic market like dsv deutsche post kuehne and much 
smaller extent rmg and bpost however disclosure profits generated the

firstgroup with around and ebit exposure respectively should benefit 
from lower tax rate don have more detailed disclosure but clearly the 
relatively high exposure for both these names would bring the average group tax 
rate down

ultimately negative for the group intertek potentially the most exposed tester 
tighter trade restrictions given its heavy asia and consumer goods focus there one 
potential offset policy tried discourage imports via more stringent quality

tax reform this difficult assess the companies not disclose regional profits 
excluding adidas and hence unsurprisingly there are details the current levels 
tax paid activities also not know how much debt domiciled although 
the sector has low levels gearing intuitively companies with the greatest

likely for the sports brands luxury goods are almost entirely manufactured within

the heritage the brands manufacturing the same quality craftsmanship not 
able replicated elsewhere contrast think there likely greater risk for

production the luxottica the luxury brands industry typically passes 
pricing headwinds the consumer which could negatively impact volume greater

tax reform assume that most our multinationals pay little tax the 
possible relatively high tax regime and the benefits reduction the 
headline corporation tax rate would slight they removed the tax deductibility for

assuming that such change would not applied retrospectively would impact 
future investment decisions rather than the cost previous ones 
healthcare uncertainty over the future obamacare could lead hiatus

slow federal spend picked there were material investment plan the new

labour growth one other point note heidelbergcement has indicated that 
around construction workers the are immigrants any new labour 
restrictions this regard could create problems actually getting projects built the 
other big question this topic the potential impact the housing market there 
are significant curbs immigrants 
tax reform terms changes tax policy and given that cement capital intensive 
think the potential for depreciation and financial expenses longer tax 
deductible would probably have greater impact than material cut corporate tax 
stock most positively impacted crh

cross border trade the introduction border adjustability would significant for 
the sector given that almost cars are built mexico and another canada with 
many these exported the note however that bmw daimler and also 
produce cars the and possible that car production could become more 
profitable with border tax for the premium oems china arguably more important 
than the and seems unlikely that trade between europe and china will come under 
pressure this time stronger usd would obviously benefit the european exporters 
but think the potential benefits from lower corporate tax rate would quite 
limited particularly for the premium oems 
stocks most negatively impacted bmw renault through nissan and

trade tax reform border tax adjustment would likely drive the price domestically 
produced crudes such wti well above the price crude produced elsewhere like 
brent combined with corporate tax cuts this would provide strong stimulus for 
investment the shale industry boon for the sector however this could 
subsequently lead sharper growth oil production putting pressure 
international oil prices perhaps even such extent that opec may find difficult 
manage this downside pressure international oil prices would further 
compounded strength the usd therefore this would headwind for european 
oil companies shell and statoil have meaningful positions the which means 
they would partially benefit from the positive aspects there and hence would 
somewhat sheltered the net effect still likely negative across the european oil 
gas sector with the lack any exposure for eni and total making them most 
negatively exposed see this note from our colleague for further information

lower demand for goods priced usd outside the further protectionism more 
generally around the world the then would not good for end demand for

spirent all their activities the they could benefit from lower corporate tax 
rate overall think the impact the sector will modest 
pharmaceuticals patrick chen 
talked about many these issues our year ahead pharmaceuticals year ahead 
outlook playing rating changes nov short the main issues for 
our sector are 
tax reform european pharmaceutical companies tend have large exposures the 
while not easy break out the effective tax rate given the 
companies generally have low tax rates already would naturally expect those 
companies with high exposure such shire sales from novo nordisk 
sales and roche sales and high starting tax rate roche sanofi 
and novo nordisk benefit the most 
trade number companies our space have material manufacturing facilities 
the and would presume benefit from any favouring manufacturing 
namely roche through genentech shire through baxalta and sanofi through 
genzyme could benefit novo nordisk currently has production although 
building sizeable plant there right now 
tax repatriation this looks more issue for pharmaceutical companies that 
have large overseas cash positions see only second degree read across whereby 
could incentivise companies pursue more the and hence make 
european targets less attractive and maybe make the market for acquisitions 
more competitive 
healthcare reform the current consensus regarding the affordable care act repeal 
and replace this would imply that there would minimal loss coverage 
volume from pricing perspective those incremental patients covered under the aca 
are some the lowest margin ones for pharmaceutical companies any replacement 
plan put forward looks unlikely exacerbate this there would little downside 
risk pricing hence not believe the repeal aca would have significant 
impact for european names what could potentially more impactful would 
changing the pricing structure for the government channels medicare medicaid dual 
eligible etc which have written about here 
stock most positively impacted shire roche 
medical services technology michael jungling 
tax reform enacted lowering the corporate tax rate from would create 
major tailwind earnings for our medtech coverage with average 
earnings before tax generated the our high level analysis suggests the effective 
tax rate would fall from average assume purely for illustrative 
purposes that the tax cuts came into effect january estimate average 
that earnings would increase across our european med tech 
coverage see fresenius medical care fresenius smith nephew essilor and 
grifols most likely benefit from the tax rate reduction they also have many 
manufacturing production plants and significant operations within the border 
adjustability comes pass they would unlikely impacted some companies 
that believe could adversely impacted border adjustability would convatec 
coloplast elekta and getinge all whom have very limited manufacturing the 
but significant revenue exposure terms repatriation tax believe there would 
mixed impact while healthcare would likely benefit given the magnitude 
offshore profits generated believe the indirect impact european med tech could 
mixed one scenario could see less interest from corporates 
given the option bring offshore cash balances back the for reinvestment 
nationally furthermore future profits foreign subsidiaries were taxed annually 
earned companies could discouraged from investment overseas finally should 
noted that the economic prospects the are relatively strong 
developed markets and create another disadvantage offshore investments 
therefore while remain cautious how corporates will behave the tax proposal 
unfolds the repatriation taxes look set discourage overseas investment which our 
view could result fewer large cap buyers for assets this could favourable 
pricing for acquirers result fewer deep pocketed bidders see our 
report 
healthcare reform healthcare reform under the aca also known obamacare 
may repealed the incoming administration this could reverse the number 
insured people under aca and lead softer procedure volumes well impacting 
the demand for hospital capital equipment weaker volumes are likely more 
pronounced for elective procedures including hips knees and spine this may provide 
headwind for smith nephew our coverage universe weaker capital equipment 
demand may also negatively impact elekta and getinge areas that are not affected 
aca include corrective lenses essilor dentistry straumann and hearing aids 
sonova and william demant 
stronger usd the medtech services sector long dollars making 
compelling sector during potentially prolonged period uncertainty european 
currencies current spot rates suggest appreciation the usd versus most 
european currencies meaning usd sales will more valuable for our names that 
report sek eur dkk and chf against this will some marginal headwinds from 
some emerging market currencies overall the net magnitude shift notable and 
likely have impact company performance especially for companies 
that will also have transactional ebit margin benefit our strategists believe the 
eur the usd will weaken more than the current spot rate which what 
use and correct would provide more substantial tailwind than outlined above 
specific impact believe appreciating usd the gbp and the eur can impact 
med tech stocks three high level ways revenue exposure average usd makes

food producers sanath sudarsan 
nestle reckitt and oreal are among the companies that have the highest revenue and 
profit exposure the however given relatively low level disclosure 
effective tax rates interest debt based and indeed the import export level for 
these companies difficult quantify the actual impact these policy changes 
within the limited amount data available preliminary analysis suggests nestle and 
reckitt are likely the biggest beneficiaries danone also likely benefit post 
completion wwav acquisition 
tax reform among companies with high exposure the nestle stands out 
one the companies with high group corporate tax rate danone and oreal based 
out france highlighted above not have details effective tax rates for 
our companies however example cut corporation tax from 
taken current tax rate for all companies ceteris paribus this could potentially 
drive earnings growth for nestle the highest within our food hpc coverage 
along with reckitt 
trade border adjustability would likely dilute the impact corporate tax reduction 
specific information about manufacturing within the remains scarce however nestle 
and reckitt did indicate that the global level around manufacturing 
generally from the local market note however that both these companies have 
production facilities outside mexico for both nestle and reckitt switzerland for 
nespresso and for mucinex etc danone stands out company with potentially 
low impact from border adjustability given its largest businesses dairy and wwav 
post deal completion have most their production within the 
healthcare reform there could some impact for nestle which has growing skin 
health and health science business the had take one time 
impact additional rebates due lower prices for its products given that reckitt 
operates the consumer health business primarily operates the over the counter 
category and would less likely impacted 
stronger usd possibly impact for reckitt given reporting currency gbp and has 
high exposure 
better growth general pick consumption would benefit all companies with 
high exposure the and those with discretionary portfolio among staples oreal 
beauty and unilever personal care might see some improvement growth trends 
along with nestle petcare skin health health science

trade the most impacted stocks our sector potential border adjustability 
would spirits producers both diageo and pernod have large exposure the and 
large proportion their sales imported products estimate diageo 
sales are generated products manufactured outside for pernod estimate 
products manufactured outside account for sales heineken would also 
impacted generates revenues from the but imports from production 
centres the netherlands and mexico any border adjustment taxes could 
potentially quite negative for those names understanding the implications the tax 
obviously quite complicated but know that spirits companies make around 
gross profit margin example applying tax the cogs from imported goods 
means the companies would have pass through mid single digit price increases 
offset the impact this would headwind for volume growth and potentially lead 
some negative operating leverage although there are some ways mitigate this impact 
tax reform trying work out the net impact from the broader tax reform difficult 
because our companies don disclose how much tax they are currently paying the 
strongly expect less that the headline rate but don know the 
actual number hard know what base they are starting from and they don 
disclose how much debt domiciled the nevertheless assume greater 
exposure equates greater tax exposure then certain names our sector should 
have decent upside from corporation tax coming down diageo ebit comes 
from the for abinbev and for pernod

tobacco matthew grainger 
tax reform tobacco bat and imperial brands should both net beneficiaries 
prospective tax reform each company has exposure the market via imb 
acquisition divested brands from rai and bat current ownership 
rai and planned full acquisition later this year 
bat bat earnings outlook will impacted tax reform via its planned rai 
acquisition the absence this its current ownership the company 
which expected close following this transaction bat would derive 
revenue and ebit from the market based our current rai forecasts 
which are predicated tax rate expect the deal accretive 
bat eps however reduction the corporate tax rate could meaningfully 
enhance the accretion outlook our base case tax reform scenario assume the 
corporate tax rate declines and that the incremental interest expense 
associated with the deal not tax deductible under these assumptions calculate 
eps accretion 
imb imb derives its revenue and ebit from its division itg brands 
imb has favorable corporate tax rate due tax benefit from step 
amortization intangibles resulting from the assets acquired from rai and 
underlying basis reduction corporate taxes would equate 
boost our eps however the potential elimination interest expense 
deductibility for imb denominated debt would partially reduce the 
benefit 
trade expect border adjustability have some impact imb and bat 
estimate that portion tobacco leaf and some cigarette components are 
sourced outside the estimate that total cogs associated with the 
companies sales are sourced 
stock most positively impacted bat imperial brands 
utilities nick ashworth carolina dores 
tax reform lower tax rate not necessarily good for utilities for renewables 
lower tax rates could potentially reduce the time value money tax credits which 
would more than offset the lower taxes paid throughout the life project for 
regulated utilities where taxes are passed through customers lower tax rates could 
result lower pre tax income and cash inflows national grid and iberdrola via 
avangrid own such businesses the other hand earnings power may modestly 
higher because the nol balance the utility would used more slowly 
overall our team see several business model qualities that maximize tax reform 
benefits high percentage positive unregulated earnings small nonexistent 
nol positions and minimal non utility debt companies with large unregulated losses 
high parent interest expenses and large existing nol would benefit less some 
cases worse off from the tax reform proposals consequence the incentive 
invest infrastructure possible the negative effect losses would offset the 
opportunity invest more the decent returns 
tax deductibility regarding the immediate deduction capex and the loss the 
deductibility interest expense our team sees the potential for this lead 
lower rate base and earnings growth again potentially impacting national grid and 
iberdrola these taxation topics are discussed greater detail our utilities 
colleagues here 
the existing subsidy schemes for future renewable projects however should there 
any changes the following stocks would affected iberdrola edpr enel 
innogy and dong energy not currently own any renewable projects the but 
have previously spoken about the potential growth region 
stronger usd companies that generate substantial proportions their ebitda the 
include edpr national grid centrica and iberdrola however most companies have 
usd denominated debt that would partially offset this exposure all all stronger 
usd gbp and eur would still positive for the aforementioned companies 
all all while changes corporate taxes may not positive for utilities would 
expect the overall effect the expected changes policy likely positive for 
companies such iberdrola national grid and centrica for edpr the tax changes 
could marginal negative 
telecoms emmet kelly 
there are two stocks our sector that think will impacted the potential 
changes policy 
better growth tax reform deutsche telekom owns mobile usa the 
wireless operator the and estimate the latter will account for 
ebitda proportionate basis already factor strong ebitda and 
operating fcf growth mobile usa over the next few years although better 
gdp growth would obviously help further our forecasts mobile usa will 
zero cash tax payer until and wouldn benefit immediately from any tax rate 
cut although cuts would boost terminal valuations note that the lack tax payments 
due combination tax credits historical losses license amortisation and 
elevated interest payments the stock would hit what looks the unlikely event 
that the loss tax deductability net interest costs were applied retrospective 
borrowings 
regulation one other angle the new administration relates the 
telecoms space this report discussed the possibility that the new administration 
would more supportive potential merger mobile and sprint 
stronger usd inmarsat listed stock that reports gbp but receives almost

tax reform ahold delhaize the stock our sector that could most impacted 
changes tax policy derives its sales and its ebit from the 
highlight that await further policy clarity none the potential impacts 
examined below are reflected our current estimates 
looking potential corporate tax rate cut suspect ahold delhaize would not 
major beneficiary would argue its tax structure already pretty efficient despite 
deriving its ebit from the where local peers are paying effective tax rates 
the range and its ebit coming from the netherlands were the 
statutory tax rate stands ahold delhaize management expects its group level 
effective tax rate only the mid ahold delhaize does not break down 
its tax rate geography but this combined tax rate suggests efficient tax structure 
the when comes the potential interest deductibility given that ahold delhaize 
has significant proportion its bonds located its subsidiaries gross 
debt according bloomberg records the policy change would have adverse effect 
ahold delhaize including relative basis competitors with lower leverage 
walmart however the potential immediate deductibility capital investment would 
positive for the rest the sector 
trade believe the risk relating potential import restrictions border 
adjustability manageable for ahold delhaize indeed food retailers should more 
insulated than other retail channels believe that large proportion the food 
products sold typically produced domestically also the revised system would have 
higher impact those retailers with higher domestic sales imported goods 
generally the higher the non food share retailer sales mix the higher the 
proportion imported goods this should mean that some ahold delhaize 
competitors notably within the dollar store segment those players with relatively 
high share non food sales would most impacted see here for vincent sinisi 
views the potential risks dollar stores

the life and savings market most relevant for european insurers with aegon 
group ifrs earnings prudential and axa having the biggest exposure 
exposure for the stocks more limited although zurich insurance has very 
significant exposure with the fee income from farmers comprising around group

the global reinsurers which four are within our universe munich swiss 
scor and hannover several our companies have asset management businesses 
that are either headquartered have significant operations for example 
allianz pimco unit and axa formerly alliance bernstein 
tax reform lower corporate tax rate would helpful for our companies 
especially for prudential where the unit jackson has effective tax rate close 
reduction the tax rate would simplistically add around 
prudential group eps for aegon assume group tax rate the regions feed 
into income before tax the group level before taxing the group whole 
earnings are taxed above currently likely the case there would some 
benefit from moving tax rate 
regulatory reform for the life insurers any potential reform the proposed 
department labor fiduciary rule would impactful 
higher inflation higher inflation typically helpful for life insurers but increases 
reserving risk for stocks especially for longer tail lines business addition 
the reinsurers zurich probably most impacted here 
higher bond yields the life insurance stocks are positively geared rising yields 
rising yields help maintain investment spreads fixed annuity business and reduce the 
cost hedging for variable annuity writers positive for aegon prudential and axa 
furthermore the extent that there are dollar pegs asia rising yields can also help 
new business margins markets such hong kong helpful for prudential
