history tells that midterms could mark calming the policy variable catalogued all major legislation that passed both houses 
and became law since see congress has been less productive after the midterms short congress less productive passing the 
president agenda even less when the president party loses control 
but that doesn tell the whole story some market relevant policies will still impacted the key question see will the 
policy trajectory continue stall take turn investment fundamentals for treasuries equities credit and key equity sectors 
pharma telecom reits etc could impacted the trajectory fiscal trade sanctions infrastructure and other policies 
fundamentals the race limiting outcomes most measures democrats appear favored take back the house yet they are 
structural disadvantage gain back the senate they must defend seats the republicans hence neither side likely obtain 
filibuster proof majority the senate further given the hurdles for democrats believe they are unlikely gain senate control without 
also gaining house control see likely outcomes listed order likelihood using average third party probabilities 
blue house senate house the generic ballot spread proves prescient for democrats taking the house does their numerical 
disadvantage failing take senate control the president trade agenda continues until market economic circuit breaker intervenes but further fiscal expansion through additional tax bill unlikely 
red repeat senate house republicans buck the projections and keep house control addition holding their advantage the 
senate they use budget reconciliation for more fiscal expansion extending tax cut expiries making key technical corrections the 
trade agenda continues until economic market circuit breaker intervenes 
blue sweep senate house democrats ride surprisingly strong electoral wave into power while they still lack sufficient votes 
convert legislation into law investors perceive greater chance progressive agenda which could include rollback 
fiscal stimulus and deregulatory efforts

current policy agenda continue stall signal its coming reversal answer this question established 
framework analyzing historical trends post midterm election legislative activity the likelihood various election

islative activity tends decline after midterms and fewer 
party average probabilities that dems win the house 
bills pass that have the president public support the effect 
legislative activity should decline under all scenarios but 
augmented situations where governments move from

this why the policy outcomes for each scenario reflect only

what view the highest priority and most bipartisan 
policy agenda full investor takeaways are summarized the below 
items

play democrats need gain seats and experts consider 
structure spending proposals get lot attention but 
nearly seats play experts generally agree that 
unfunded version this unlikely under all outcomes our 
democrats need hold lead about percentage points 
view the most likely candidate for fiscal deficit expansion 
the generic ballot gain the majority and the fivethirty 
tax extension expiring provisions the tax code 
eight generic ballot poll currently has them the 
yet this only possible republicans retain control con 
senate math more difficult democrats are defending 
gress with outcomes skewed toward democrats controlling 
seats the republicans that doesn put majority control

out reach but filibuster proof majority seats and 
increase further result the election this good for 
the legislative autonomy that comes with likely unattain 
ust rates which think have priced the current deficit 
able 
trajectory but more challenging for usd which could 
this limits likely outcomes given the hurdles for demo 
weaken deficits expand into tightening global liquidity 
crats the senate the voter behavior conditions consistent 
the election less likely break the current escalatory 
with them gaining senate majority very unlikely coin 
trade cycle than risk asset economic weakness hence 
cide with republicans keeping control the house the 
trade related pressure should continue for equities the 
most likely house senate control scenarios according 
president who currently maintains broad unilateral trade 
average third party estimates are democrat republican 
powers our view unlikely persuaded alter trade 
republican republican democrat democrat none 
conflict escalation unless more obvious negative market 
where party has more senate seats 
economic reaction congress could intervene curb the

impeachment now policy variable take into account 
have generally discounted the likelihood impeachment given the president party controls congress the president 
popularity with republican voters remains strong and our view democratic leadership remains unconvinced that advocating 
for impeachment good politics further been unclear that impeachment would yield market relevant policy change 
impeachment does not guarantee removal from office and even the vice president were ascend the presidency likely 
the policy initiatives the executive branch would unchanged 
yet these assumptions could clearly undermined the outcome the midterm elections blue sweep scenario democrats 
may intuit mandate proceed with impeachment view that would emboldened eventual report the special counsel 
were suggest evidence wrongdoing the president democrats proceed removing the president from office which requires 
two thirds vote the senate would remain uncertain but investors should consider potential ramifications 
gridlock impeachment proceedings could take all the oxygen out the room increasing risks appropriations delays and 
shutdowns while limiting potential for any bipartisan arrangements around shared policy goals like infrastructure 
implied higher probability progressive policy swing while impeachment proceeding far from guarantees party 
switch the presidency following the election reasonable suggest markets may intuit greater odds such 
outcome impeachment action signal that democrats are pressing their advantage that they seen enough evidence that 
public opinion has turned the president shed their concerns about proceeding with impeachment hence would not 
unreasonable for investors start thinking more critically about the possibility some tax reform and regulatory rollback 
tax technical corrections what you need know 
shortly after enactment the tax cuts and jobs act tcja congressional republicans and the administration began calling for tax 
reform the impetus for successive legislation the scheduled expiration and phasing out key policies which were required 
constraints due budgetary mechanism the tcja 
the headline focus making the individual side the code permanent this includes the lowered marginal rate structure the 
doubled child tax credit the increased standard deduction amounts the increased amt thresholds and the qualified business 
deduction for non corporates 
the corporate code also contains key policies scheduled expire change for instance bonus depreciation phases out 
the interest deductibility limitation shifts ebit from ebitda and expenditures will require 
amortization versus upfront expensing starting not addressed the combination these policies will result facto 
tax increase for many corporates see the downside fiscal stimulus 
republican policymakers have also signaled they are interested indexing capital gains taxes inflation and reforming education 
and retirement savings incentives 
noted above only see tax remotely likely scenario where republicans maintain control both legislative chambers 
however repeat the budget reconciliation vehicle will required the party unlikely secure senate votes avoid 
filibuster 
technical corrections 
technical corrections are normal after major legislative changes group republicans the senate finance committee have 
identified three items they intend resolve the most significant drafting error dubbed the retail glitch congress intended 
permit qualified improvement property which includes interior remodeling and renovations commercial property qualify for 
upfront bonus depreciation result the error these expenditures must now amortized over years the net present value 
this timing benefit material most companies the retail and restaurant industries believe these corrections will 
eventually get resolved but timing and mechanism remains uncertain the most likely outcome corrections will need 
attached tax because both parties will want make tax revisions beyond the corrections scope hence corrections will 
difficult achieve near term without one party controlling the white house and congress note more technical correction items 
are likely identified treasury proceeds through the tcja regulatory process

probability the republicans maintaining both the house and
