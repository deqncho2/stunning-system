across the energy space are introducing new cross sector outlook our 
commodity price estimates are based integrated forecast across the gas 
coal and power segments anchored proprietary power generation and 
pricing model are bullish natural gas and see further upside

conviction the broad markets natural gas looks compelling many investors due 
its relative insulation from global macro and strengthening supply demand

backdrop from higher commodities prices rising interest rates tax reform and potential 
strategic action while expect gas prices fall relative our forecast 
remains modestly above forwards and well above levels furthermore higher coal

midstream election impacts better federal permitting 
environment could support narrowing differential for 
marcellus utica but state issues remain 
there are number uncertainties the wake the recent general election but 
believe federal permitting issues could ease with trump administration but state 
constraints will remain pending projects will most likely eventually proceed but with 
permitting delays many many more boxes have checked order get the 
myriad permissions hand oftentimes too the processes different levels 
government and different agencies are working parallel tracking the sequence 
necessary steps linear fashion challenging 
the ferc level however the gas pipeline permitting process includes pre filing 
application notice schedule for environmental reviews draft eis 
environmental impact statement for new pipe less demanding environmental 
assessment for expanded pipe final eis and then construction permit after 
period public commentary currently the ferc staffed with only three five 
commissioners with one those three term out mid expect two 
replaced year end the epa level new head will less likely expand 
regulations and push for other agencies for example consider downstream carbon 
footprints during project permitting though the permitting process will remain 
increasingly complex would expect see less political interference with the process 
have looked two scenarios for the marcellus utica our base case for new 
takeaway and delay case wherein projects are pushed back roughly one year due 
permitting delays our base case believe the marcellus utica can see relatively free 
flowing conditions with the current slate projects this dovetails with our 
team views regarding producer volume outlooks our delay case 
need another year before achieving unconstrained free flowing conditions rover seems 
key project given its size and uncertainties and seemingly limited information 
flow progress atlantic sunrise nexus northern access constitution penneast 
broad run tgt atlantic coast and mountain valley each face permitting issues some 
level with some consultants suggesting two year delays 
the basin could enjoy somewhat better basis the ready duc drilled but 
uncompleted wells inventory runs off early and producer well activity 
slow ramp the new year addition producer announcements production 
anticipated early will part based the need get ready fulfill firm 
transportation agreements the new pipes the pipes are delayed should see 
less upsized drilling commitment from producers contrast aggressive ramps from 
producers might foreshadow anticipated volume requirements and time pipeline inservice dates 
other basins would expected supply gas the marcellus utica remains 
constrained little longer important consequence this would the pipe pipe 
renegotiation period would likely end with less risk with new capacity 
delays 
other uncertainties for the midstream area with the new administration that could have 
impacts beyond the supply demand for takeaway include the timing fully staffed

reform both rates mlp less incentivized low rates and carried interest 
leveraged equity fund partnerships are targeted mlp may require carve out language

texas current low prices are not sustainable believe 
merchant generation texas warrants lower valuation 
than comparable assets pjm new york new england 
this due the lack capacity market and the longterm energy price headwind from wind and solar that said 
believe current suppressed ercot power prices are not 
sustainable expect tighter market conditions resulting 
from slowing new build and robust demand growth drive

pjm gas new build priced attractive long run 
outlook the pjm market energy capacity now trades meaningful 
discount new build economics historically pjm has oscillated above and 
below new build equilibrium levels however the generation pjm 
comes from coal which under economic pressure the current low gas price 
environment result expect see gradual retirements the coal fleet 
over the next decades this should drive consistent need for new generation 
even with demand growth keeping total margins energy capacity 
attractive new build levels separately over the last several years natural gas 
prices the pjm market have been under meaningful pressure from rapid growth 
production from the marcellus and utica shale regions and lack adequate 
infrastructure move this gas demand centers elsewhere the however 
gas infrastructure buildout expected over the next several years should alleviate 
much the infrastructure constraint driving local gas prices higher narrower 
differentials versus henry hub this dynamic which expect begin playing 
out modest positive for pjm power prices higher coal prices 
relative levels are also positive for the pjm region coal sets power

prices could see material breakout despite lower demand forecast for rto 
forecast only modest improvement due headwinds from lower demand 
and the likely entry quad cities into the overall capacity mix comed 
believe breakout still likely but modestly lower prices year over year 
company impacts rising gas prices 
many companies the merchant power space have taken steps reduce their 
sensitivity changes natural gas prices gasifying their fleet over the last several 
years that said gas prices remain meaningful driver for the space believe 
stabilization the commodity and any improvement would positive catalyst for

from sensitivity earnings perspective exc and are most levered changes

propane currently accounts for only ethylene production and that the

incremental investment equates ethane this process would begin 
propane cash costs become more economical relative ethane cash costs which 
present would begin with gal higher ethane prices all else equal ethane prices 
were rise even further relation propane prices expect even more propane 
substitution given that most ethane crackers were originally repurposed from 
naphtha and therefore have intrinsic structural capabilities handle incremental byproducts therefore assume ethylene production could consume propane 
our bull case scenario which would displace another ethane demand 
note however that while crackers have the ability produce ethylene 
using propane theoretical basis there would likely challenged supplying the 
propane these facilities and other logistical constraints that would require 
incremental investment and time mitigate the impact incremental propylene and 
other product production associated with switching propane from ethane their 
respective market balances should also kept mind more propane cracking 
would lead more propylene production which could drive propylene oversupply 
lower prices and therefore increase propane cash costs
