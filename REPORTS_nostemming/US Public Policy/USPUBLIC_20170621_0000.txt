remain skeptical that tax reform can get done this year 
despite recent speculation that republicans can accelerate 
their agenda this summer yet this does not appear 
current market driver hence identify summer signposts 
that could push risk positive negative market outcomes 
tax timing uncertainty has been feature not bug for markets 
consensus appears have shifted from late last year and early this year 
tax reform longer optimistic timing and scale policy action 
get little pushback our base case delayed and diluted tax reform 
negligible fiscal stimulus yet this disappointment appears 
feature conflicting theses that have driven both equity and bond prices 
higher rather than bug investors logic timing and content uncertainty 
have allowed investors see what they want policy strong earnings 
mean equity investors can hope for tax reform without relying 
delayed reforms mean bond investors can focus the wisdom fed 
action without having price exogenous growth boost hence 
are aware how fiscal policy developments may affect the summer 
market dynamic pulling markets either toward the bullish tone pushing 
equities higher the bearish tone pushing bond prices higher must 
examine what driving our base case and what could change for better 
worse 
reasons why still not optimists tax timing and content 
clear still think there better than not chance that tax reform will 
happen before but outline reasons why think the political and 
legislative process will delay and dilute 
what summer signposts could move markets outcomes that are additive 
risk markets require bringing tax timelines forward eliminating 
diluting controversial pay fors and increasing the probability 
ultimate passage helpful signs may include the ahca being passed 
passed the august recess unified and detailed republican tax plan 
being presented around labor day and pivoting key provisions 
the camp plan outcomes that detract from risk sentiment create further 
delays increase the risk failure they include getting bogged down 
further ahca through failure agree key provisions and republican 
groups writing alternative tax plans

fiscal disappointment current feature future bug 
our base case has been that fiscal stimulus likely fueled tax reform would 
delayed and disappointing enactment relative republican leaders stated 
goals the main culprits lack bipartisanship the restrictions the budget 
reconciliation process and disagreements key tax issues within the republican party 
late last year and early this year perceived this out consensus view given 
investor pushback that tax cuts would come soon and made trump deficitagnostic image boosting both earnings and gdp growth however recent months 
note reversal tone with clients resigning themselves the notion that congress 
will probably still pass tax reform but can only move slowly given its complexity and 
the novice political nature the trump administration our recent macro 
conference investors had muted expectations for fiscal boost did not believe 
fiscal stimulus would come the next months believed tax reform would not 
delivered before the end 
however risk markets were not driven lower this disappointment even though 
treasury yields were rather the equity market rally continued buoyed strong 
earnings results and signals from economic survey data suggesting rising confidence and 
accordingly increased potential for corporate and personal consumption after procyclical rally the months following the election defensively oriented sectors coupled 
with tech led the market higher post march this suggested that near term growth 
boost the kind which could delivered through fiscal stimulus was longer 
requirement for equity investors hence our chief equity strategist mike wilson 
believes that the pro cyclical recovery that really began early will resume 
late cycle forces exert their influence particularly excitement around tax reform 
builds once again treasuries told different story though with yield declines 
suggesting bond investors reticence embrace the same economic confidence story 
exhibit risk markets were not driven lower policy disappointment though the composition 
showed less reliance policy 
source factset morgan stanley research note election was 
exhibit the treasury rally tells different story economic skepticism rising when legislative 
gridlock became evident year treasury yields increased between election night and march 
then gave back 
first ahca house 
vote failed 
source morgan stanley research bloomberg 
think the takeaway that our current base case for fiscal policy near term 
rorschach test for investors argue that delays the legislative process have made 
the uncertainty regarding the content tax reform feature rather than bug for 
markets for risk markets means that potentially worrisome provisions like border 
taxes and loss interest deductibility rightfully remain the abstract for bond 
markets allows investors focus the very real risk that delays boost the odds 
failure the calendar approaches the midterm elections 
hence the power fiscal policy impact markets clear deviation from the 
narrative delayed and diluted think this drives two principles 
signs that clean tax reform excluding watering down controversial pay fors like 
border taxes loss interest deductibility are increasing likelihood and are 
coming sooner should provide further boost risk assets and bond yields 
beyond our current forecasts 
signs that tax reform may delayed further and risk failure could 
catalyze risk off move particularly coincident with economic data 
disappointment given the fed tightening bias 
flesh out these positive and negative risk catalysts later the report but start 
the next section affirming our base case 
reasons doubt legislative optimism 
press reports and the comments key republicans legislative progress were 
reliable indicator should expecting concrete tax reform plan soon this 
summer 
president trump has repeatedly expressed optimism saying june and very 
big focus for over the next short period time are going tax cuts tax 
reform 
early june gary cohn said will have very detailed drafted tax plan 
delivered congress when they get back from the august recess and 
tuesday said the white house wants tax bill the floor probably the first 
couple weeks september 
june reuters reported the trump administration and top republicans 
congress are within few weeks agreeing central aspects tax overhaul 
plan that will determine the contours legislation now expected september 
administration official told reuters this week 
press reports indicate that senate republicans are aiming vote the ahca 
before the july recess politico reported june vote not possible 
republicans hope least have agreement bill before heading home for 
the july recess 
his team ryan summer outing politico reported that speaker paul ryan laid 
out his preferred timeline for obamacare repeal bill saying that will done 
mid summer and tax reform will completed the end the year 
yet remain skeptical fully detail our rationale for how the political and 
legislative reality governing the fiscal policy process namely tax reform and 
infrastructure policy points toward outcomes that are delayed and diluted two prior 
reports see tax policy pathfinder march and after the fail april 
this section tease out reasons some old and some new that think affirm our 
conclusions even light recent news flow 
credible bipartisan path 
the common ground between republicans and democrats appears more the

seeing trump tax returns 
difficult achieve larger benefit for the middle class when cutting rates for everyone 
republicans could message plan good for the middle class while democrats define 
disproportionately good for high income earners 
democrats are under pressure not accept tax cuts for the wealthy corporations 
democrats are critical the changes the child tax credit the house plan 
both democrats and republicans support the earned income tax credit 
republicans want tax credits incentivize private investment and lower direct funding 
democrats want higher amount direct federal funding and worry about tax breaks 
democrats are worried that cutting red tape means gutting environmental protections 
democrats want protect davis bacon requirements 
democrats not want fund border wall 
democrats not support cutting funding for sanctuary cities 
democrats will not vote for bill with poison pill defund planned parenthood 
democrats want see trump tax returns see how tax reform would affect him 
source morgan stanley research better way bloomberg center for american progress financial times the hill house ways and means democrats itep politico roll call 
flesh out one example let consider the ideological divide over what the parties 
consider middle class focused tax cut key sticking point for democrats technical 
terms lawmakers could easily find themselves odds over tax reform distributional 
effects democrats believe that high income individuals gain too much relative the 
middle class consider that republicans could plausibly claim that across the board 
personal tax rate cuts benefit all republicans could claim that cuts are focused the 
middle class they were paired with increase the standard deduction proposed 
the president during his campaign and the house etter way plan which used 
over filers with income under elimination deductions 
proposed the house etter way plan which are most commonly enjoyed higher 
income individuals yet democrats could see this dynamic quite differently that 
because dollar terms the tax benefit that accrues higher income brackets from 
cut dwarfs that middle and lower brackets

what about scenario which enough democrats break from their leadership 
enable tax reform through regular order still skeptical republicans are not 
able pass their tax bill the senate using reconciliation their only option gain 
eight democratic votes the senate while there are senators representing states 
that trump won who are for election only five those states 
have demonstrated recent republican trend voting for romney hence 
think senators facing tight races swing states will reticent act against their 
democratic base and trump currently not popular enough force their hand 
health care complications 
though questioned the political logic their approach see after the fail april 
think clear republicans intend see the process attempting 
repeal and replace aca obamacare through its end successful not practically 
speaking the lack bipartisanship creates the need push legislation through the 
reconciliation process this means tax reform cannot meaningfully begin its complicated 
legislative process until health care reform either succeeds fails the near term 
that means the senate must deliberate issues divisive within the republican party 
that are part the health care debate defunding planned parenthood means testing 
health care credits whether not repeal obamacare taxes unclear whether the 
plan being developed leader mitch mcconnell will pass the senate and does 
will acceptable house republicans the bill passes the journey not over yet 
either the house will have accept the senate bill they will need work out 
differences conference committee 
the budget and the debt ceiling 
house and senate republicans need pass the budget resolution with 
reconciliation instructions order pass tax reform using reconciliation recent press 
reports indicate that this may more difficult that sounds hawks want 
increase funding for defense some house republicans want include budget cuts that 
align closely with president trump budget while vulnerable moderate republicans 
may not want vote for cuts popular programs they could use shell budget 
order pass the reconciliation instructions like they did with the budget but 
the freedom caucus already balking that idea not say that they won 
ultimately come agreement but negotiating the budget resolution could take 
valuable time 
the debt ceiling another key impediment potentially linked the above process 
while the president and treasury secretary mnuchin have both called for clean debt 
ceiling increase house conservatives and even some the president administration 
have called for linking the debt ceiling budget concessions resolving these 
disagreements could distract from the broader policy agenda 
the byrd rule 
use the reconciliation process means legislation must abide the byrd rule 
reconciliation can used for legislation that changes spending revenues and the debt 
limit and the byrd rule prevents any extraneous provisions from being included the 
rule treats most policy changes that not have effect spending revenues 
extraneous most importantly does not allow for changes that raise the deficit any 
year after the period covered the reconciliation instructions unless other provisions 
offset those costs senate parliamentarian and senate budget committee review 
the bill and compile list which provisions may byrdable the senate floor 
senators can raise point order about any provision the bill and the 
parliamentarian provides guidance the provision the presiding officer the senate 
which for important vote would most likely vice president pence who ultimately 
makes the decision strike the provision from the bill 
senate republicans could try get around the byrd rule order pass tax cuts but 
those actions extending the budget window using different score overruling the 
parliamentarian would unprecedented and have drawbacks they could also use the 
uclear option voting eliminate the filibuster which would also eliminate the need 
use reconciliation the first place however uking the filibuster would 
permanently alter the senate and republican senators signed letter earlier this 
year saying they would protect the filibuster for legislation byrd rule remains 
hurdle passing tax cuts that increase the deficit and the main reason why leadership 
has indicated that the bill needs revenue neutral 
conservative think tanks 
conservative think tanks have recently weighed manner that both prods lawmakers 
follow the more complicated legislative path reconciliation and odds with 
house republican leadership key issues like the border tax for example recently 
the conservative heritage foundation which had supported the border adjustment tax 
report released paper called time move past the proposed border 
adjustment tax stating that the bat controversial and economic gamble but also 
stating that without the bat the house blueprint outlines very good tax plan that 
would encourage investment job creation and economic growth 
economists from the tax foundation have supported the border adjustment tax and 
have recently released papers supporting full expensing and advocating against 
temporary corporate income tax cuts 
former cbo director and president the american action forum douglas holtz eakin 
personally supports the border adjustment concept but recognizes that may 
politically hard achieve believes that tax reform should revenue neutral and 
permanent and has expressed support for the house blueprint saying that 
trump tax plan released april fell short being real tax reform 
june coalition conservative groups led the national taxpayers union 
released letter identifying their three areas agreement cutting the corporate tax 
rate moving territorial system and allowing for full expensing 
statutory paygo 
potential speed bump achieving fiscal stimulus through deficit expanding tax cuts 
the statutory pay you paygo act which created budget mechanism 
ensure that all legislation passed given year budget neutral omb determines 
that there projected debit the budget year its scorecards the president issues 
sequestration order omb for across the board cuts non exempt mandatory 
spending programs amount equal the debit 
republicans would likely anticipate that this risks putting them disadvantageous 
position the future they may have enact budget austerity directly contradicting 
their notion that tax cuts would pay for themselves 
concede that there are ways get around paygo the president could refuse 
issue the sequestration order omb omb could use its own scoring engineered 
make the tax cuts score better they could use the nuclear option the filibuster 
and repeal the law however majority senators have pledged maintain the 
filibuster but such tactics are far from easy for party that prides itself fiscal 
discipline 
state and local tax deductions 
the potential repeal the state and local tax deduction well 
proposals limit itemized deductions generally are not 
purely red state blue state issue rather repealing itemized 
number republican 
deductions affects high income earning places relatively similar 
representatives 
ways analyzed county tax return data from the irs among 
the top states ranked the percentage filers earning 
between and per year count 
republican representatives the house chose these 
two income buckets because they are the most exposed cut 
itemized deductions incomes below these levels generally 
not itemize and taxpayers with much higher income tend count 
capital gains and investments greater degree some 
these republicans represent blue states like new jersey 
california new york but others are from traditionally red 
states including georgia and south carolina well swing 
states like wisconsin lack good tax data congressional 
district that said conceivable that tax plan sharply limiting 
itemized deductions could divide the republican party between 
wealthier districts and poorer districts much would unify 
republicans against democrats

the freedom caucus goes rogue 
the freedom caucus discussions about how wants influence the tax reform 
debate and certain vocal faction recently rep mark meadows the chair 
the freedom caucus pushed for congress stay session august work the 
tax bill call that unlikely popular and suggested that the freedom caucus 
may put together its own plan meadows and other members have said they believe 
that tax cuts not need fully paid for and have suggested that some the tax 
cuts could temporary paid for through cuts welfare order meet 
reconciliation rules most significantly they believe that leadership should drop the 
border adjustment tax 
the freedom caucus also making demands about the budget resolution 
which needs pass order include the instructions for tax reform wants 
through the budget process instead passing shell budget with reconciliation 
instructions did earlier the year for the budget the caucus may push for 
some the cuts included president trump budget proposal and has suggested 
exchanging welfare cuts exchange for higher top line spending numbers 
the border tax 
won rehash the detail the house border adjustment tax bat proposal here 
but key leaders like paul ryan and kevin brady continue push for the idea 
contrast the freedom caucus and several key senators cornyn cotton perdue have 
expressed displeasure with the proposal ranging from reticence outright opposition 
see tax policy pathfinder march hence this another potential wedge issue 
that takes time resolve 
russia 
don want speculate the outcome the various official investigations into 
russian interference the election yet think its appropriate point out that 
the political ramifications those investigations can slow the legislative process 
insomuch they affect the president popularity and therefore the incentive for 
congressional republicans accede his policy demands less incentive cooperate 
means more time must spent seeking compromise within the caucus and makes that 
compromise more difficult achieve furthermore there the potential for intraparty 
tension arise from issues tangential the investigation the recent passage 
russia sanctions bill through congress which the white house gently pushing back 
given that takes some discretion away from the president could put the president 
awkward position when the bill get passed through the house and the 
president desk 
tax market catalysts 
revisiting our earlier principles since our fiscal policy expectations are currently the 
price markets order for become relevant investment catalyst either positive 
negative need see signs clear deviation from the status quo delayed 
action consider three narratives that they emerge could describe such break 
thread the needle republicans manage pass ahca before the august recess 
white house house and senate leadership announce joint tax plan after labor 
day which includes key provisions from the camp plan the familiarity with that 
plan enables legislation move more quickly putting passage within scope and 
leading investors begin pricing its impact 
quick cut frustrated their lack policy progress and desperate not miss 
opportunity remake the tax code their image republicans work around the 
reconciliation process institute simple tax cut rather than broader reform 
while think that such level desperation would not reached until after 
the midterms perhaps catalyzed loss house control increasing 
consideration reconciliation workarounds like temporary cut extending the 
budget window killing the filibuster for all legislation might suggest higher 
levels urgency and faster timeline than currently perceive 
party fail the health care reform process becomes bogged down further but 
republicans refuse give time runs out complete tax reform before 
and perhaps longer democrats regain majority the house representatives

the above breaks from the status quo think thread the needle has the best 
chance developing hence investors should become familiar now with prior drafts 
tax reform namely plans put forward former ways means chair david camp 
given established body academic evaluation and party support for many its 
provisions information suggesting lawmakers are adopting such provisions would 
suggest that the tax reform process may following more rational pragmatic path 
accordingly odds success could increase and timing risks could decrease hence 
revisit the plan below quick primer for investors 
revisiting the camp plan 
todd castagno cfa cpa 
camp proposed cap the top business and individual rates the 
corporate side provides for repatriation with one time mandatory tax unremitted 
foreign earnings and would shift international taxation quasi territorial system 
camp was designed revenue neutral over traditional year budget window 
for business revenue offsets camp essentially chose increase accrual accounting 
components within the tax code lengthening cost recovery schedules and removing 
investment incentives such the tax credit and the domestic manufacturing 
deduction

the camp plan has the benefit full legislative text robust macroeconomic review and 
being well understood the business community economists and policy makers 
however camp has significant issues 
key corporate tax issues with camp 
reconciliation the plan was designed for regular order not for budget 
reconciliation while the plan was engineered revenue neutral within budget window likely creates deficits outside the budget window which 
would run afoul the byrd rule under reconciliation 
revenue offsets base broadening never popular but these particular offsets 
were widely panned economists and the business community they would 
collectively discourage investment and hinder growth the plan was also designed 
for static scoring environment versus dynamic scoring models that incorporate 
such growth effects 
international reform while camp billed territorial system included 
numerous and complex tax base erosion protection features that were broadly 
unpalatable the business community 
camp plan could engineered mitigate many these issues dynamic scoring 
would help significantly the budgetary front especially some the unpopular 
cost recovery offsets are removed replaced shift immediate expensing 
permanent bonus depreciation for limited assets well supported the business 
community and would boost the plan growth effects camp camp would 
also benefit from shift the budgetary baseline courtesy the path act 
which made many business preferences permanent such the investment tax 
credit the path act generated billion year relative savings note 
billion over years estimated fund reduction the corporate rate 
sure income tax systems are competitive and there will always race zero 
base erosion protection features will required but there view that camp 
could simplify erosion rules introducting minimum rate mechanism and 
harmonizing with international standards
