trade risk longer hypothetical while nafta 
negotiations are ongoing nearer term deadlines 
approach for the administration take action 
ignore recommendations initiated under law 
for protectionist actions such tariffs specific 
products and industries electing initiate tariffs 
not without precedent recent history but has 
not heretofore meaningfully changed the country 
free trade stance yet must recognize that tariff 
action could challenge investors perception whether 
the will adhere current free trade policies this 
could stoke concerns about harder stance nafta negotiations and broader 
protectionist push study these issues given the risk that certain markets 
could reflect elevated economic concerns consequence 
scenarios for trade how the administration reacts those triggers may 
taken important signal their long term intent see possible 
scenarios facto status quo temporary trade dispute protectionist 
push given valuations the and equities markets think scenario would 
cause temporary risk off sentiment but scenario would required for 
broader risk off move near term tariff action may sufficient activate 
either scenario meaning key hedges may useful regardless subsequent 
action the trading partners 
the fundamental vulnerability key currencies cad mxn krw 
augmented recent strength inflows further valuations may not 
appropriately discounting the risk volatility with even incremental 
protectionist move like the temporary trade dispute scenario hence like 
long jpykrw hedge and also maintain mxn and cad core shorts 
this year 
equities signs protectionism could shift focus toward risks inflation 
and long term growth this would undercut the reflationary pro cyclical market 
trends have seen and also risks return uncertainty engendering 
volatility which may weigh multiples such conditions would favor defensives 
health care reits telco and utilities particularly those with low foreign rev 
exposure over cyclicals and sectors companies with high foreign revenue

key takeaways 
despite membership multilateral trade treaties and organizations the 
executive branch maintains powers institute tariffs and other protectionist 
measures 
when considering this legal capacity and the current administration criticism 
certain trade policies the short term trajectory trade policy has become 
unpredictable 
hence although tariff actions are not unprecedented investors must take 
seriously the risk that the least temporarily deviates from historical free 
trade policies 
trade powers what can the president 
quite lot per law here cite the review trade laws from the peterson 
while congress has authority regulate commerce has over the years 
delegated broad authority the president regulate trade via several statutes dating 
from early protectionist measures can enacted properly justified for 
economic national security reasons economic imperatives for example the 
president can under the trade act impose temporary tariffs for 
days against country there large balance payments surplus the 
president can also take retaliatory actions under the statute foreign country 
undertaking practices that are deemed unjustifiable unreasonable discriminatory 
national security imperatives the president has the power under the trade 
expansion act impose tariffs quotas there finding adverse

demonstrate the flexibility these statutes the peterson institute cites the example 
president nixon using the korean war justify certain import surcharges 
even though the conflict had ended almost years earlier while that law has since 
been amended limit its use during the time war that doesn necessarily limit 
action presently given current engagement various overseas conflicts for certain 
given the justifications required for executive actions under any these statutes 
judicial review that could potentially overturn such actions would likely congress 
could also act amend laws rescind these powers from the president however 
either process would likely lengthy the takeaway short term disruption possible 
that creates economic facts the ground that markets would need pay attention 
practice unilateral action uncommon but can disrupt 
since the advent the general agreement trade and tariffs gatt the trend has 
been toward tariff levels consistently declining over yet there has been the 
occasional unilateral protectionist action the intervening years addition the 
nixon example cited above president reagan instituted voluntary export restraints 
against japanese automakers the early more recently actions have 
appeared targeted temporary and within wto rules for example the obama 
administration instituted tariff chinese tires which sunset the 
action was upheld the wto appropriate reaction chinese dumping actions 
perhaps the most relevant analogue potential action that investors are concerned 
about today the steel tariff imposed president bush march and 
withdrawn late the exercise our view highlights the practical constraints 
and implied penalties that have kept the and trading partners from sustaining such 
actions and substantially challenging prevailing international trade norms president 
bush initiated the action using section the trade act was characterized 
safeguard measure against recent surge steel imports that was weakening the 
domestic steel industry the result was increase steel tariffs from 
the tariffs were relatively short lived though the wto ruled against them 
november while the bush administration initially signaled would ignore the 
wto ruling dropped the tariffs december after the european union 
threatened retaliatory tariffs products such automobiles and florida 
the episode highlights the same takeaway the previous section the has the 
power initiate trade actions that could have immediate effect markets even 
one thinks the would eventually revert following historical free trade policies 
the fundamental and political motivations for the remain engaged the global 
free trade regime are strong yet when considering the capacity for protectionist 
action and the current administration stated concerns with trade predicting the 
next move becomes little more than educated guess hence investors must take 
seriously the risk that the least temporarily deviates from free trade path

how might this play out scenarios 
given the unpredictable and short term nature these catalysts don ascribe 
specific probabilities how these trade catalysts could play out yet see relatively 
distinct paths for trade policy for which these upcoming trade actions could provide 
evidence 
facto status quo the administration chooses not act tariff 
recommendations from the commerce department perhaps preferring keep 
them part ongoing negotiations negotiations could ultimately succeed 
perhaps part due partners addressing the administration focus trade 
deficit concerns market concerns are allayed with investors interpreting the 
behavior high degree reluctance the part the break from free 
trade norms 
temporary trade dispute similar the bush steel tariffs and obama tire 
tariffs this administration undertakes product specific actions these 
upcoming triggers without signaling broader protectionist push potentially 
negotiating tactic while wto challenge would expected the administration 
could signal its ambivalence about complying with the results their review 
temporary tit for tat could also ensue did with china auto tariffs response 
the obama tire actions that tension could certainly abate over time through 
combination face saving solutions cosmetic changes and wto adjudications 
was the case with both bush and obama administration actions effectively 
returning the status quo nevertheless the process could justifiably spark 
market concern about rising probability tit for tat trade conflict with key 
partners and hard exit from nafta 
protectionist push the administration acts tariff opportunity and follows this 
with demonstrative signals broader protectionist push this could the 
form subsequent tariff actions and more definitive statements actions 
nafta negotiations such the activation article while this approach 
would not definitively mean the taking more long term protectionist 
approach markets could reflect meaningfully higher probability this approach 
and all its economic implications 
the key takeaways our view 
instituting tariff necessary but not sufficient condition for markets reflect 
broader protectionist concerns simply raises the probability protectionist 
outcome 
even though the temporary trade dispute scenario may end with trade conditions 
they started the path get there long winding and fraught with potential 
points market concern 
background trade disputes practice 
the institutes tariff how might other countries react doing nothing 
course one option responding with retaliatory tariff another however the 
recent norm for countries who are members the wto has been dispute the 
tariff through its dispute settlement body dsb 
wto compliance member states incentivized the benefits that accrue its 
members from promoting free trade but ultimately state actions are voluntary 
hence when the dsb considers complaint against country that has started 
tariff that tariff generally stays place the dsb finds country has broken 
rules with its tariff action the case the steel tariffs then may 
instruct that country remove the tariff the other hand the dsb finds that 
tariff was appropriate response another member actions did 
regarding the tariffs chinese tires from then may instruct the 
country that brought the dispute bring its laws into conformity either case 
the country who has lost the dispute fails adhere the dsb 
recommendations over time the wto could potentially sign off retaliatory 
measures from the other party the dispute 
what the price and where are the fault lines

key takeaways 
rising risks protectionism remain important watchpoint for particularly 
many ems have seen marked rise inflows leaving them more vulnerable 
sudden reversal 
direct trade linkages are critical source vulnerability leaving cad and mxn 
particularly exposed other countries such twd and krw with high levels 
exposure global trade may also experience weakness protectionist risks rise 
considerably note that the eur has become increasingly sensitive both risk 
and trade 
recommend jpy long positions against krw hedge against protectionist 
risks and maintain cad and mxn core shorts this year the negative 
relationship between jpy and risk coupled with the acute sensitivities krw 
and global trade risks render this trade attractive under higher protection 
scenario 
the initial pricing trade related risk premia markets could result 
some usd strength against the above currencies but ultimately think the usd 
will resume longer term downward trend 
time worry again investors have spent the best part the last year learning not 
worry too much about trade tensions there has been little immediate follow through 
from some the rhetoric that dominated the presidential election campaign indeed 
detail below the implied probability significant protectionist shock derived 
from options prices has declined since just after the presidential election 
with some clear potential catalysts the pipeline take another look where the 
fault lines may lie there are number general comments make set the 
scene first the trade deficit has widened since the presidential election this 
not simply the result widening deficit with those countries that have contributed 
the most the trade shortfall namely china germany japan mexico and lesser 
extent south korea and taiwan the deficit with the rest the world appears 
growing too from this perspective the stakes are arguably higher 
second investor positioning risk markets has increased substantially over the past 
year particular have seen significant inflow into assets both equity and 
fixed income since january the latest aggregated quarterly data for 
and the quarters that point saw the largest gross inflows many years

third valuations have also become more expensive with currencies and bonds having 
rallied over the last year indeed local currency bond yields have compressed 
versus the and other equivalents with the nominal yield differential with 
bonds now below the long run average see here 
meanwhile with few notable exceptions such try and php most real effective 
exchange rates have generally marched higher over the past year this arguably 
leaves them more exposed potential shocks though note that those economies 
that are more heavily exposed via trade links such krw sgd twd have not seen 
significant reer gains 
country macro vulnerabilities remain similar 
currency vulnerabilities persist early last year examined which currencies would 
most sensitive protectionism based variety factors direct trade exposure 
commodities exposure manufacturing exposure capital account vulnerability and dollar 
liabilities general the relative ranking currencies most sensitive these factors 
has not materially changed there have however been substantial changes the 
absolute vulnerability some countries shifts portfolio flows mentioned above 
and discussed further below 
our scenario temporary trade dispute argue that the direct linkages are more 
important under our scenario protectionist push outcome though broader risk 
sentiment will affected which why believe currencies sensitive risk sell off 
will also see significant depreciation these would typically those that have 
experienced the largest portfolio inflows which discuss further below meanwhile 
those currencies negatively correlated risk like the jpy should benefit and thus 
serve attractive hedge 
within the cad remains most vulnerable cad remains far the most sensitive 
currency protectionist risks our view beyond its relatively high sensitivity 
trade more broadly roughly three fourths canadian exports are sold the united 
states within its share exports well good proportion are commodities and 
manufacturing particularly autos which are often part broader integrated supply 
chains with the also continues finance its current account deficit with long term 
debt inflows rendering sensitive reversal important area sensitivity that has 
grown though central bank pricing unlike last year when boc hiking expectations 
were fairly benign the market now pricing more than two additional hikes the 
end meaning dovish shift the boc could lead significant cad

and potentially those risk facing tariffs imposed certain 
products they export are more likely vulnerable scenario 
within the world think these are mostly countries

come from the direct trade channel where their vulnerabilities are larger 
jpy serves attractive long hedge while inflows into ems have perhaps 
created more vulnerabilities argue that has been the outflows from japan that 
render attractive hedge these outflows meaning net foreign asset position 
that render jpy negatively correlated risk concerns about repatriation flows 
and thus jpy buying rise the market 
often investors cite japan current account perhaps suggesting trade sensitivity 
fact japan sensitivity trade among the lowest measured exports

long jpykrw should benefit protectionist environment given the arguments 
above suggest that long jpykrw should offer protection against these risks 
also maintain our short mxn and cad views both which should also particularly 
vulnerable trade shock jpy should serve attractive hedge given its negative 
correlation risk well the risk this trade course that risk sentiment remains 
elevated and that the market perception protectionist risks does not materially rise

move would for usdkrw and jpykrw head higher however over time and

how would axj central banks respond 
several asian central banks have recently stepped their rhetoric appreciating 
exchange rates these include the bank korea the bank thailand and the cbc 
taiwan assessing this commentary light recent price action these central banks 
broadly speaking appear willing tolerate strength against the dollar when 
such moves are driven primarily the usd leg however they appear less willing 
tolerate idiosyncratic outperformance domestic currencies regional peers 
exemplified recent commentary from south korean officials over the course the 
past two months policymakers south korea taiwan and thailand have either 
explicitly expressed concerns about currency strength are reported have done 
while chinese policymakers have not made comments along the same lines our 
knowledge recent policy changes could imply increasing unease with currency 
strength 
south korea 
after the krw strengthened more than regional peers the usd 
from november january south korean officials said that they would take steps 
case one sided moves krw even usd weakens globally january

banks buy dollars nsn

january bot governor veerathai santiprabhob said that the central bank 
had identified signs speculation the baht and that would address the 
problem order curb too strong impact nsn 
however note that estimates central banks net purchases foreign currencies 
from for example korea and taiwan have been relatively low over the past year see 
exhibit dialing back intervention following the election would fit well with 
the sharpened tone from the incoming administration trade imbalances this also 
implies that trade tensions were escalate from here policymakers could again 
respond allowing for domestic currency strength filter through should market

what are markets telling about the probability trade

market participants often discuss the risks protectionism but can infer these risks 
from market pricing look the pricing very out the money options 
evaluate implied tail risks 
options pricing evaluate options pricing using two models one provided 
bloomberg another developed internally using monthly returns since 
evaluate the price usd call against each currency equivalent standarddeviation move based the monthly returns for each currency pair from the 
present use this likelihood move under the assumption normal distribution 
returns proxy for the potential for sudden trade shock implicit this 
framework that the usd would rally because both direct trade effects and indirect 
effects via market risk aversion 
the results suggest the market pricing significant risk for cad but little else the 
present our results below using both models appears that the market 
pricing the highest probability tail risks for usd rally against cad compared 
peers this would consistent with the greatest direct trade linkages between 
canada and the compared the other members this seems consistent 
with the argument that the market has been pricing non negligible risk targeted 
protectionist actions against large trading partners scenario however the very 
low probabilities priced into other currencies suggests that the probability 
protectionist shock sufficiently substantial derail global risk sentiment not the

market pricing suggest that protectionist risks appear have been declining this 
seems consistent with the softening rhetoric from the administration relating 
trade using this framework appears that while the probability tail risk outcome 
elevated for usdcad when compared pricing prior the election this figure has 
declined substantially exhibit one could argue that the decline implied risk the 
usdcad pair part due general decline implied volatility when looking the 
average compared usdcad there some movement but the fact that 
usdcad stays elevated suggests that there remains trade risk premium priced 
indeed the narrowing this spread since the presidential election suggests that some

robustness tests confirm our thesis acknowledge some important qualifications 
first liquidity very out the money options can limited test for this 
evaluating these figures using standard deviation moves instead where options 
are more liquid the magnitude the probabilities changes but the ordering generally 
does not with usdcad still the highest probability second differences model 
assumptions can impact the results which why employ both bloomberg and our 
morgan stanley models the results are similar third the results could sensitive 
how one defines tail outcome that instead using standard deviation return 
based historical volatility one could examine fixed percentage change argue 
this latter method may imprudent biases the results toward higher volatility 
currencies and away from lower ones while not indefensible argue that adjusting 
for each currency unique historical volatility more accurate representation these 
risks 
are inferring from the data that the higher usdcad probability related trade 
this seems plausible and consistent with our assessment rate sensitivity but
