focus usd rates and trade relations implications key implications for autos 
from trump victory seem follows 
get stronger usd stronger usd could help european exporters 
and this were also help gbp eur would benefit especially peugeot 
and bmw contrast may also mean lower cny which would have 
negative implications for china earnings for bmw and daimler 
rates yield curves have steepened sharply whilst this argues for cyclical 
performance short term does not help autos fundamentals higher rates 
clearly impact negatively credit availability for auto consumers well 
auto credit loss performance 
trading relations key concerns for investors hinge around nafta and china 
trade relations autos hardly export from china but implications are 
important more important are key production centres mexico for nissan 
renault and daimler trucks 
fiscal policy investors focused initially the potential for higher 
government spending and lower taxes potentially boosting economic 
growth key beneficiaries infrastructure would volvo and daimler 
construction equipment and trucks personal spending benefits may more 
limited depending where the tax savings could come 
conclusion lack rally ytd surprised cyclical optimism our recent 
marketing still suggests very limited investor appetite for european autos autos auto parts making hay before the sun goes down oct few 
investors appear seduced current low oem multiples when earnings are 
high and when the risks those earnings are many however with excess 
liquidity still issue global cyclicals have seen very sharp run versus 
defensives and autos have lagged maybe auto oems could see short term 
rally even against the fundamentals defensive selling peaks rates rise 
however without fundamental support rally could short would 
continue sell any such rally the sector into strength see our latest slides european automotive sector cycle peak magical thinking sep

trump victory what means for autos 
after the somewhat surprisingly positive stock market reaction the election result 
ask what impact the result could have european autos any although policy 
focus remains uncertain from most the debate somewhat clearer from the preelection headlines and debates what the key areas difference going forward could 
would focus the following key debates 
usd think the resilience the usd and dxy yesterday may have been one 
the catalysts for the stock market rally euro and yen could the weaker currencies 
the usd our global strategist remains bullish usd see here and stronger usd 
would help global exporters into the including autos and especially bmw and 
daimler japanese oems were strongly overnight the yen has fallen 
cny seems that with china maintaining stable cny against basket global 
currencies then stronger usd almost automatically leads lower cny the usd 
already cny back multi year lows auto oems have more exposure 
cny than usd these days given local production potential for more tense trade 
relations between and china could also impact cny 
gbp not obviously political angle but seems gbp was the only major currency 
outperform usd yesterday relative strength gbp versus euro also helps the 
european oem exporters including peugeot and bmw see autos shared 
mobility risks for oct 
rates sell off ust continues pushing rates and steepening the yield curve the 
market focuses december rate rise the and investors question the 
potential relationship between trump and fed chief yellen higher rates historically 
have supported cyclical trades have seen but tough see this 
fundamentally positive for the autos some stage higher rates will impact negatively 
credit availability and credit performance further impacting sector profitability 
remember believe marginal changes credit cost availability are key driver not 
just auto demand but also global oem profitability see autos auto parts global 
insight credit dependency jan and european autos auto parts autos 
and credit explaining the circularity feb 
corporate taxation president elect trump team have talked much lower 
corporate tax rates from one the highest tax regimes the world today with talk 
taxes falling whilst believe there may budget limitations and 
implications that could stop such moves any reduction tax rates would obviously 
push earnings higher similarly possible trump may try negotiate way 
for corporates repatriate large proportion current off shore deposits further 
boosting the economy and liquidity the economy and pushing usd 
personal taxation trump campaigned lowering taxes and tax rates obviously 
any reductions federal tax rates would boost personal income and disposable 
incomes will important see where those tax reductions fall before assess 
how this will impact total spending autos demand volume and mix terms small 
positive maybe 
trade tariffs nafta campaign rhetoric obviously highlighted trump more 
protectionist stance for the with potential for negotiation major trade treaties 
such nafta with many industrials and auto oems opting for mexican production 
recent years trade tariffs with mexico could real risk the mexican production 
base although short term peso weakness has been significant cost help 
seems too early take strong view but european oems most exposed mexican 
production are with large plant for exports directly renault through nissan 
mexican production exposure and daimler which has mexican truck production 
exposure 
trade tariffs china again campaign rhetoric focused the trading relationship with 
china tough know how this pans out seems unlikely that aggressive tariffs 
sanctions are possible given the inter dependence both countries trading imports 
and exports see china autos auto parts election implications for china auto 
parts stocks nov 
fiscal stimulus seems many construction related stocks the reacted well 
anticipation greater fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending again details are 
limited but seems this could boost the economy starting volvo and 
daimler through construction equipment and trucks may the moist obvious 
beneficiaries 
environmental policy trump views environmental policy appear indicate 
marked change direction and has talked about reversing some recent moves 
this regard again actual policies are known but coal stocks reacted very 
favourably yesterday this regard possible that current very stringent cafe 
standards the may negotiated relaxed taking some pressure off 
technology risks for oems the other hand global oem strategies are not going 
change for the alone and seems the emissions discussion still one way debate 
whatever the speed the reductions 
doj settlement ceo matthias mueller said interview bloomberg 
yesterday there obviously small risk that the election could delay eventual 
settlement and conclusion the dieselgate situation again little evidence 
here
