failure yet repeal replace aca move 
from hurting the tax reform process failure 
was function the republican leadership 
mistaking their members consensus desire 
repeal obamacare for consensus how 
replace avoid similar misstep they 
signaling more deliberative process for tax 
reform reversing key stances allowing 
hearings and bipartisan overtures yet think 
this ultimately changes little for the distribution tax outcomes 
the good news softer bargaining positions key conservatives have 
signaled tacit comfort with deficit expansion means achieve tax 
reform this flexibility improves the prospects for legislation particularly 
light the contrast between diminished congressional support for bat 
and the president preference for some type border tax yet unclear 
how much deficit accommodation these statements imply hence wide 
range fiscal stimulus and disruptive pay for scenarios remain plausible 
the bad news republicans fish and cut bait aca push back 
our expected timing tax reform while republicans initially 
appeared ready jettison aca repeal replace efforts focus tax 
leadership appears have initiated those efforts hence they may 
spend considerable time pursuing possibly fruitlessly bill changes that are 
both reconciliation friendly and pass muster with all republican factions 
what about the bipartisanship skeptical while costs democratic 
lawmakers little engage tax reform discussions also costs them 
little walk away from the table given the president low approval 
ratings further disagreement over the relative focus tax cuts for the 
middle class well republican demands for border wall funding and 
planned parenthood defunding may hurdles too big overcome 
hence doubt plan could come together that would endorsed 
both parties leadership also skeptical that there could enough 
democratic defections help tax plan pass through regular order given 
that poll numbers suggest potential crossover senators would reticent

upset their democratic base supporting trump initiative 
the tax policy takeaway delay dilute republicans face the same 
challenge with tax reform with repealing aca satisfying one wing 
their support base risks losing support from the other wing accordingly 
our tax reform scenarios tend cluster around compromise outcomes 
that take awhile develop disappoint size scope relative 
existing proposals and either sunset fail provide near term fiscal 
stimulus hence though tax reform with long term economic benefits still 
more likely than not likely won deliver the near term stimulus punch 
that many expect 
the market takeaway equities rates may forgive this disappointment 
more than credit munis michael wilson and our equities strategy team 
see prevailing economic undercurrents and more balanced investor 
sentiment supporting stocks even with some degree fiscal policy 
disappointment the recent rally treasuries also reflects our more 
sober tax assessment suggesting risks rates from fiscal policy are more 
balanced and likely take cues from incoming data contrast corporate 
credit could underperform shift sentiment could move focus 
weakened fundamentals similarly munis have outperformed lower 
risks the tax exemption but valuations are close overvaluing those 
outcomes 
repeal replace collateral damage tax reform 
while maintained that tax reform coming republicans policy path has been 
key reason thought the odds were meaningful that those reforms would 
disappoint relative postelection expectations particular republicans choice 
make the repeal and replacement aca obamacare their first legislative initiative 
appeared strategic error appeared republican leadership mistook their 
members consensus desire repeal obamacare for consensus how replace 
hence key party divisions would laid bare that could delay tax reform and make 
compromises harder achieve this thesis played out dramatic fashion starting with 
the withdrawal the american healthcare act ahca march efforts revive 
the ahca linger despite initial signals that republican lawmakers would shift focus 
tax reform 
gauging the influence this dynamic tax policy whether republicans ultimately 
find solution their internal disagreements about ahca less important than the 
fact that they are still trying see the following effects 
delays tax outcomes new estimate moving tax reform effectively 
means abandoning the pursuit republican only healthcare reform due the 
budget reconciliation hence republicans are serious about pushing 
ahca further the tax reform timeline must pushed back also risks getting 
further bogged down the intractable nature the republican approach aca 
where reforms that appease conservatives tend alienate moderates and vice 
versa further unclear that some the compromises being discussed could 
processed under senate reconciliation further complicating the process 
building successful bill hence pushing back our point estimate 
tax reform timing further delays would likely come with diminished odds tax 
reform being achieved given the proximity midterm elections 
republicans signal some flexibility and openness which don think 
meaningfully improves outcomes the wake the failure pass ahca 
march there have been some notable concessions from republican leadership 
appears there will committee hearings tax contrasting with the 
earlier notion that republicans would pass their existing blueprint without fresh 
public vetting the vein their approach ahca yet this doesn move our 
opinion much while this may have been the right remedy the health care 
process don see improving tax reform odds since republicans challenges 
passage lie less policy disagreement bat and more the risk that public 
airing full tax details enables public opinion campaigning from special interest 
groups key fiscal conservatives have suggested they can accept some deficit 
expansion pay for tax cuts yet that doesn clarify they accept the implied 
deficits created dynamic scoring which already restricts tax reform fiscal 
stimulus potential broader deficit expansion republicans have started 
reaching out some democrat legislators gauge the possibility bipartisan 
approach yet discuss later the report skeptical such approach 
could successful and could further delay the process false hope

source morgan stanley research better way bloomberg center for american progress financial times the hill house ways and means democrats itep politico roll call 
first let consider the roadblocks truly bipartisan tax reform one embraced 
party leadership both sides the table above highlights the disagreements key 
issues the tax debate including infrastructure policy which the president has 
suggested could pair with tax reform win democratic votes 
flesh out one example let consider the ideological divide over what the parties 
consider middle class focused tax cut key sticking point for democrats 
technical terms lawmakers could easily find themselves odds over tax reform 
distributional effects democrats believe that high income individuals gain too much 
relative the middle class consider that republicans could plausibly claim that acrossthe board personal tax rate cuts benefit all republicans could claim that cuts are 
focused the middle class cuts were paired with increase the standard 
deduction proposed the president during his campaign and the house etter way 
plan which used over filers with income under 
elimination deductions proposed the house etter way plan which are most 
commonly enjoyed higher income individuals yet democrats could see this dynamic 
quite differently that because dollar terms the tax benefit that accrues higher 
income brackets from cut dwarfs that middle and lower brackets 
hence democrats and republicans can describe the benefits tax reform differently 
fit their ideological goals this leaves both sides open the influence base 
politics and key party tastemakers this may already display with the recent 
release center for american progress brief stating any legislation cuts taxes for 
corporations the wealthiest americans even lawmakers should vote

able pass their tax bill the senate using reconciliation their only option gain 
eight democratic votes the senate while there are senators representing states

also made some key changes the content our scenarios note which are fully 
detailed appendix 
characterizing outcome categories reflect their macro impact rather than 
broad implied market impact which our strategy teams opine upon based 
valuations their markets the next section 
smaller rate cuts several scenarios reflect decreased tolerance among key 
policymakers for key pay fors like the bat and limiting corporate interest 
deduction without substantial carve outs phase ins 
characterizing our outcomes buckets 
stimulus tax outcomes that require deficit expansion meaningful rate cuts 
and either don include disruptive pay fors bat loss interest 
deductibility only watered down version 
mixed outcomes where rate declines are modest deficit expansions are 
either absent modest disruptive pay fors are also either absent modest 
these outcomes may long term additive for the economy but lack the 
punch near term fiscal stimulus 
drag outcomes that are either delayed thereby failing deliver benefits 
timely manner and include disruptive pay fors that risk near term pain 
the economy transitions 
market takeaway equities rates may deal better with 
disappointment than credit munis 
understand how the above distribution outcomes impacts markets consulted 
our strategy teams fixed income and equities specifically asked them react 
how each what each scenario would mean for their market based the potential 
fundamental impact and what currently the price their asset class the key 
takeaways are 
corporate credit negative and neutral probabilities outweigh positives hence 
anything short stimulus would fail uphold current valuations given 
fundamental trends 
treasuries negative positive probabilities appear roughly balance this 
attributable the recent rally treasuries which prices slower fed path and 
accordingly our more sober outlook tax policy 
munis while the balance outcomes shifted favorably for munis both delay and 
deficit financed outcomes decreased the probability curbing the tax exemption 
further outperformance could put munis odds with the distribution tax 
outcomes 
equities contrasting with fixed income equities the near term may 
less sensitive tax outcomes given evidence that investor sentiment has already 
turned negative and that economic data could enough push late cycle rally 
this reflected low egative probabilities reflecting the idea that most 
outcomes even fundamentally mixed would perceived favorably investors

think risks are still skewed the downside current valuations late and 
early credit investor sentiment was quite bullish part with the expectation that 
large tax cuts would easy pass driving meaningful increase earnings and 
economic growth ultimately translating better corporate fundamentals the good 
news that optimism has faded somewhat the bar that needs cleared 
probably lower however still believe much smaller tax cut than originally 
assumed will disappoint think that border tax its various forms would come 
with large unintended consequences and while interest deductibility going away could 
incentivize lower leverage the long run would make current leverage levels even 
less manageable the short term especially for high yield issuers finally while the 
market may give policy makers some leeway timing meaningful delay tax reform
