overview the proposed destination based cash flow tax system 
todd castagno 
summary points 
the house republican blueprint proposes convert the corporate income 
tax into destination based cash flow taxation system that would border 
adjust not taxing revenues from exports and disallowing deductions for 
the cost imports 
theorized that the policy trade neutral the dollar should appreciate 
offset the border adjustment credit exports and 
corresponding disallowance for imports 
absent full foreign exchange offset border adjustability will benefit net 
exporters and hinder net importers retailers and multinationals with 
international supply chains are particularly exposed 
however any significant usd appreciation will also pressure translated 
revenue and earnings from foreign subsidiaries companies 
proposed mechanism border adjustability will also introduce foreign 
exchange volatility the reported effective tax rate 
believe broad business opposition and trade law concerns pose 
formidable resistance achieving legislation 
most the united states major trading partners utilize value added tax vat systems 
generate revenue addition direct taxes such corporate and personal income 
taxes vat tax indirect tax similar national sales consumption tax and 
thus ultimately paid the consumer the taxing jurisdiction the vat tax accrues 
each stage the production process and function input costs less sales price 
times the vat tax rate vat taxes are designed tax consumption within taxing 
jurisdiction they are generally border adjustable for goods imported and exported 
that means exporters receive rebate for any vat taxes incurred their production 
process while corresponding vat tax levied all imported goods and services 
the key feature the committee ways and means tax reform blueprint 
radically transform the current business taxation system destination based cash 
flow system with border adjustability 
destination system the proposal seeks locate the tax incidence the place 
consumption sense converting the business income tax system into 
synthetic consumption tax 
cash flow based system the proposal would remove many the accrual 
accounting structures today code such amortization capital investment 
and would also eliminate most taxation from financing flows this why the house 
blueprint requires immediate capital investment deductions and the near elimination 
interest deductibility 
the blueprint clearly states that the proposed system not vat but 
structurally very similar subtraction based vat system the blueprint proposes 
apply border adjustability the destination based cash flow system 
not taxing the value exported goods and services including intangible rights and 
property 
disallowing deductions for any imported good service including intangible rights 
and property 
the system would apply both foreign and domestic taxpayers thus 
multinationals with international supply chains would incur tax importing goods 
and services into united states this includes rights and fees paid foreign subsidiaries 
that control intellectual property for instance 
some policymakers perceive the united states structurally disadvantaged the 
border adjustability our trading partners vat systems vat taxes are levied 
goods and services imported from the united states and rebated companies 
exporting the united states the blueprint states this amounts self imposed 
unilateral penalty exports and self imposed unilateral subsidy for imports 
however many economists disagree economic theory suggests that the adjustment 
imports symmetric with the adjustment exports then the system neutral 
trade and that exchange rates will immediately adjust offset the initial impact any 
border adjustment terms magnitude the dollar theoretically would need 
appreciate for complete offset 
proponents the destination based cash flow system claim its true appeal not 
promote fairer trade policy but rather reduce eliminate aggressive tax planning 
strategies that shift profits low tax jurisdictions thus protecting the tax base 
while the benefits are appealing there are also formidable concerns with this policy 
including 
wto violations the word trade organization wto rules permit border 
adjustability indirect taxes but not direct taxes such income taxes supporters 
the proposal contend the cash flow nature the proposed business tax creates 
economic equivalent indirect tax and thus should comply with wto rules 
however many trade lawyers disagree there are also compliance concerns with 
proposed border adjustment including deductions for domestic labor costs and 
may viewed favoring exports over imports 
business opposition the policy may economically harm net importers and benefit 
net exporters the extent exchange rates not fully adjust offset the border 
adjustments many multinationals have complex multi jursidicational supply chains 
making assessment the tax policy highly uncertain retailers particular have 
voiced opposition the policy proposal and would likely harmed increased 
costs cannot fully passed the consumer recently group consisting 
over industry trade affiliations issued letter senior lawmakers opposing 
border adjustability appreciation the dollar will also result headwind for 
foreign translated reported revenue and profits 
tariff for non corporate entities the proposed mechanism for applying the 
border adjustments works well for taxable business entities but largely 
inapplicable for individuals and non taxpaying entities supplementary system 
taxing tariffing imports acquired these entities and rebating exports will likely 
required otherwise the border adjustment system can gamed and likely 
viewed violation trade rules thus adjustment personal and non profit 
imports will likely viewed unfavorably tariff 
financial services key challenge how the destination based cash flow system 
will apply banks and financial service entities where cash flows are largely 
irrelevant the blueprint provides detail but states the ways and means 
committee developing special rules for financial services developing hybrid tax 
system for banks and financial system crucial extremely complex and likely 
controversial 
losses conceivable that economically profitable net exporter will fail 
generate taxable income perhaps indefinitely the blueprint proposes indefinite 
carry forward losses including compensating return capital maintain the 
time value the losses this may create perception government subsidy 
some economically profitable businesses may pay little federal taxes and 
may even accrue tax benefits the form net operating losses this also creates 
loss trafficking concerns where acquisitions may pursued primarily for valuable 
tax attributes the target 
border adjustment large usd appreciation but not full offset 
charles rubenfeld 
summary points 
border adjustment would likely cause large usd appreciation 
reasonable our view but unlikely fully offset the effects the 
border adjustability provision 
textbook model would say that usd would immediately appreciate 
offset the effects border adjustment economically similar 
export subsidy combined with import tariff 
however the empirical breakdown purchasing power parity ppp the 
short run global supply chains and concerns about sharp wto led 
response will likely limit full usd offset 
short run expect considerable usd appreciation with gains largest 
against countries which are more welcoming currency depreciation and 
have few global supply linkages the such japan korea and the 
eurozone 
believe the pboc would prevent usdcny from rising line with other 
usd pairs but would still allow significant cny depreciation don 
expect them pursue aggressive devaluation 
because the large potential for disruption possible the border 
adjustability plan will dropped favor plan without similar 
impacts however debate around the provision can push usd higher the 
near term 
how would border adjustment affect markets first look the idealized 
textbook model but then discuss why think the impact will less severe 
textbook model border adjustment would essentially have the same impact joint 
import tariff and export subsidy the same size not allowing for the deduction 
imports from your taxable income like normal costs means imports would taxed 
the new corporate income tax rate like tariff assuming the new rate passes 
similarly allowing for the deduction exports from taxable income and therefore 
avoiding the tax acts similarly subsidy you would think these policies 
would boost net exports the former would make foreign goods more costly for 
residents and reduce imports the latter would make exporters more competitive 
and increase foreign demand for their products boosting exports 
however many economists have argued that border adjustment would have net 
impact exports and imports because exchange rates offset the impact see the role 
border adjustments international taxation auerbach and holtz eakin 
reduced demand for imports and increased foreign demand for exports both 
increase demand for usd and decrease demand for foreign currencies these policies 
push usd higher usd would then appreciate until fully offsets the border 
adjustment provisions and exporters importers are better worse off and are 
back where started todd notes this would equivalent move higher 
usd moreover the economists argue that nominal exchange rates would react 
immediately financial markets discount the expected future changes demand for 
imports and exports 
how realistic this move higher the broad usd would extreme say the 
least how likely this happen our view not very because relies the theory 
purchasing power parity ppp 
recap ppp usually refers the theory that basket goods one country should 
sell for the same price after adjusting for exchange rates the same basket goods 
another country know this version ppp absolute ppp does not hold 
well established fact that rich countries have higher price levels than poor countries 
known the penn effect even tradeable goods however this case care more 
about relative ppp which just says that nominal exchange rates move line with 
inflation differentials the ratio the prices the basket goods stays constant 
said otherwise relative ppp assumes the real effective exchange rate does not change 
over time 
while relative ppp holds somewhat better study after study has shown takes very 
long time for deviations from ppp correct the deviations can large that ppp 
failure predict exchange rates has been called one international macroeconomics 
puzzles there are also plenty current examples extreme deviations real 
effective exchange rates from their long term averages with sign turning around 
therefore are skeptical full offset particularly short time horizon 
usually takes long time for exchange rates fully react changes trade flows 
one can argue that many deviations ppp are driven financial flows pushing 
currencies from their fair value whereas this provision would have large immediate 
impact prices and little impact financial flows but even ignore financial 
flows takes considerable time for consumers producers corporations adjust their 
purchasing behavior based import and export price changes 
exhibit rich countries have higher prices levels than poor 
inconsistent with absolute ppp

however while usd may not appreciate fully offset the effects border 
adjustment still likely appreciate significantly the general impacts described 
the textbook model still hold here what are considering coming with our 
estimate 
import content the higher the import content exports the less impact border 
adjustment will have the short run understand this think about the often cited 
global supply chains the company exports car but most the parts are 
imported from other countries then much what they gain from lower export costs 
wiped out from higher import costs you can imagine the cost exports 
comes directly from imports border adjustment would have little effect usd 
though would have distributional effect companies within the country 
eventually companies which export would substitute imports for domestically 
produced goods and cause further usd appreciation but expect this would take 
long time happen 
this issue the ranks relatively low aggregate only our export value comes 
from imports this suggests aggregate import content will relatively little 
prevent usd appreciation however there are some trading partners that matter more 
exports canada and mexico are likely have much higher share those 
countries inputs due the supply chains strengthened the passage north 
america free trade agreement nafta this could limit usd appreciation against these 
countries relative trading partners with fewer supply linkages

wto response todd writes the wto permits border adjustability indirect taxes 
transactions like the vat but not direct taxes individuals businesses ways 
and means chairman kevin brady has said the house republicans are confident they 
can win any case but remains open question about how the wto would rule 
the plan even the plan allowed the wto border adjustment may stoke 
retaliatory measures countries who view unfair the extent which markets 
price this possibility the possibility that the wto eventually strikes the plan down 
would limit usd appreciation 
fed reaction function not clear how the federal reserve would react the 
implementation border adjustments the one hand likely that net exports 
would get boost and the plan would part broader tax reform bill which would 
likely boost fiscal stimulus and increase incentives invest the this would call 
for faster rate hiking cycle the other hand sharp move higher usd would 
cause large tightening financial conditions and push the dollar into even more 
overvalued territory possibly eliciting the fed lower its path for rate hikes bring 
usd lower isn clear which side would win out expect that the fed won 
prevent the initial usd appreciation from occurring but will reluctant push 
further 
what would usd rally against given that border adjustment impacts exports and 
imports equal size and applies all countries the textbook would say that usd 
should rally equally against all currencies however two main factors will matter here 
central bank reaction and supply linkages 
the first make distinction between countries which would and wouldn readily 
allow currency depreciation central banks the key trading partners would likely 
with large depreciation their local currency such canada japan and the 
eurozone however some emerging market central banks may not welcoming 
most obvious here would the pboc 
cny china the largest trade weight the fed broad twi would the 
pboc allow usdcny rally significantly result the effects border 
adjustment the pboc has shown willingness allow usdcny rise line with 
broader usd moves recently though the amount usd appreciation that could occur 
result these changes would likely more significant our view china would 
allow usdcny rise but not much the broader usd moves would imply given 
their size and would possibly couple such move with tighter capital controls line 
with recent trends don expect the pboc pursue aggressive devaluation due 
the risk anchoring expectations and causing disorderly capital outflows this 
similar what would expect the event bilateral tariff china china 
economics implications presidential election for china november 
mxn mexican policy makers may also respond large mxn weakness but likely only 
mitigate volatility the central bank has already hiked year date largely due 
concerns about inflation pass through and financial stability risks stemming from 
weaker peso itself partially cause higher concerns about trade protectionism until 
now hiking anchor the currency has been seen prudent because there have been 
actual shifts trade policy the such measures are actually put into place it 
possible the central bank mexico banxico may choose allow the currency work 
the shock absorber the united kingdom did with brexit and could see 
measures such rate hikes defend the currency that said the central bank has 
stated its desire mute volatility the currency and would likely step provide 
liquidity necessary they did the financial crisis rate hikes could used far 
they can help mute volatility but may not the first tool choice providing 
liquidity through swaps may more effective for this purpose they have several 
means doing this which discussed mexico mxn the view from twenty sep 
second expect usd moves most pronounced against economies without large 
supply linkages the noted before countries like mexico and canada have 
strong supply linkages tradeable goods therefore this factor may its own limit 
usd apprecation against these countries currencies the other hand usd 
appreciation may easier against trade partners with fewer linkages such the 
eurozone japan and korea 
bringing these factors together think usd will appreciate most against countries 
which have few supply linkages with the and less interventionist central banks jpy 
krw and the eur rank highest this list usd appreciation may also pronounced 
against cad and mxn though wonder how much supply linkages will limit 
appreciation lastly usdcny likely rise but the pboc will err the side 
caution preventing the cny from depreciating line with other currencies

taking this all into account difficult weigh the multitude factors which would 
impact the size the usd move the event border adjustment plan however 
are confident the plan would result significant appreciation usd with 
move being reasonable this would offset some the effects the border adjustment 
trade but not come near the full amount this would imply boost net 
exports but also large problems for import dependent industries this appreciation 
would come disproportionately against the top free floating trading partners the 
within namely the eurozone canada and mexico 
but how likely this occur given our view extreme usd move the event 
passage how likely are see border adjustment make into the broader tax reform 
package which expect pass regardless how much one believes usd would 
appreciate the plan would disruptive increase usd may leave trade 
relatively unaffected but would cause tightening financial conditions and 
additional problems for global markets particularly emerging markets more 
moderate appreciation would cause less financial market dislocation but would 
large hit industries that are net importers there has already been pushback 
from certain sectors like retail and auto and expect this increase the plan 
becomes more well known 
therefore while think tax reform requires some sacred cows sacrificed border 
adjustability more likely than other controversial changes interest deductibility 
dropped from the final bill however this not guaranteed and think the risk 
border adjustment being included another bullish factor for usd going into the 
beginning next year

financial reporting implications 
todd castagno 
the blueprint proposal for border adjustability disallowing deductions for imports 
and not taxing exports will also have significant implications the reported income 
tax provision and effective tax rate the dispersion effective tax rates within the 
market and within industries will increase substantially and the reported effective tax 
rate will exposed foreign exchange rate volatility 
bellow provide two examples 
pure importer company that imports its cost sales and resells 
domestically 
pure exporter company that exports its sales and all input costs are 
domestic 
the first column each example simply illustrates the hypothetical income tax and 
financial reporting scenario with rate similar current practice the second 
column illustrates outcome the rate was reduced the third scenario 
adds the border adjustability mechanism imported costs and exported revenues the 
fourth column assumes the dollar appreciates and completely offsets the impact the 
border adjustments note how the reported net income the same scenarios two and 
four 
net importers will have significantly higher reported tax rates even the foreign 
exchange rate were completely offset the economic impact the adjustment the 
adjustment made the income tax provision foreign exchange movements will add
