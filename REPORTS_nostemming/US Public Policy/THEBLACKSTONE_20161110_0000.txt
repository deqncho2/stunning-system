rates could see lower tax rates and international tax reform enabling 
companies bring cash back home about trillion corporate cash held 
abroad which could stimulative part this could see onetime tax 
the assets held abroad generating tax revenue put into

first page continued 
stimulus spend could create investment opportunities infrastructure doesn 
believe that existing portfolio companies are negatively impacted however markets 
decline that could pressure near term portfolio values 
compelling deployment opportunities today and dislocations energy real estate 
warehouses logistics urban areas capitalizing commerce boom office space 
india european bank asset sales various niche assets regulatory capital driven 
mortgage market and sme lending look attractive 
rising rate environment good for blackstone zero bound and low rates are hurting 
economic growth with diminishing and negative returns resulting from such policies 
terms exposure credit business has rate risk hedged short duration and real 
estate business underwrites with expectations for cap rate expansion buys broken 
under managed businesses that fixes drive cash flow growth resulting less 
rate risk than owning pristine properties 
what our take 
dislocation and unpredictability are good for business blackstone while the past 
few years have seen exceptional asset growth think they operating below 
potential with the key constraint being availability attractive investment 
opportunities that could soon change with the election outcome and policy uncertainty 
creating pockets opportunity that could accelerate deployment which good for 
both asset gathering and boosting earnings 
blackstone can raise more money than they can deploy right now and are turning 
investor clients away this the midst institutions and hnw investors seeking 
greater exposure alternatives result blackstone continues innovate and 
develop new products meet the growing needs their clients 
blackstone has raised more money than their publicly listed peers combined hard 
imagine that they operating below capacity but they just scratching the surface 
terms their potential with the market under appreciating longer term growth 
opportunities newer products that are very early stage their life include core plus 
real estate real estate debt core private equity tacopps stable value and various 
strategies their hedge fund solutions business baam 
further see potential new strategies and adjacencies that blackstone does not have 
today but could bolster growth ahead this could include infrastructure regional 
specific funds such european private equity fund and sector specific funds just 
name few 
growth these new strategies particularly core plus real estate promise transform 
blackstone earnings power and earnings composition toward higher multiple 
recurring management fees paid navs that grow and compound over time 
opposed fees paid the initial cost base that generates stable fee which doesn 
grow and more recurring performance fees that crystallize specified dates 
opposed monetization events net result should less volatile earnings stream 
that should lead multiple expansion longer dated funds offer fee revenue 
compounding benefits for blackstone and slows the treadmill giving back client 
money thus blackstone aum could grow even more quickly 
while the stock has lagged ytd despite the strong growth outlook don expect 
mgmt buyback shares rather needs the earnings retained plough into 
new growth initiatives and values the firepower balance sheet that could used for 
agree dry powder the balance sheet the mgmt company prove pivotal 
for doing strategic did back during the financial crisis when acquired gso 
tremendously successful acquisition 
think the election results could make easier and increase the probability 
converting corp corporate tax rates are lowered that our view could make 
the decision easier convert due less tax leakage were convert corp 
from current partnership structure that could expand the universe eligible investors 
and likely result index inclusion see our strategist most recent report the 
election here 
think real estate sector concerns are weighing the shares recently following 
pressure the reit sector broadly see the recent note from our reits analyst for 
more details real estate market concerns including tightening lending conditions 
concerns that foreign buyer interest could wane rising interest rates among others 
reits cmbsignals cre indicators watch post election nov however 
did not benefit the way when reit stocks were outperforming earlier this year 
seems bit disconnect now important remember that blackstone 
real estate business largely buying orphaned properties with the intent fix 
improving the property and generating higher cash flows this value creation the 
underpinning for their strategy they underwrite expecting cap rate expansion and 
long they can successfully achieve the property and cash flow improvements then 
the impact rising interest rates should mitigated particularly spreads tighten 
they are also not forced sellers and have the ability hold assets for many years
