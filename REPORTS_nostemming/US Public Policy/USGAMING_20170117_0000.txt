customers 
regionals expect regional gaming trends see positive inflection 
driven increasing consumer confidence higher incomes and personal 
income tax savings which lower income households have higher propensity 
spend and iii rising interest rates which should support retiree incomes 
expect the pace spending build gradually with revenue coming 
below expectations and seeing tough comps expect casinos should also 
less risk than other consumer facing companies from wage inflation and 
border tax adjustments upgrade byd result and prefer over penn 
byd has greater tailwinds from recovering oil markets has lower leverage

relative discounts their appropriate multiples 
vegas believe las vegas fundamentals remain strong with the market well 
positioned for another year mid single digit revpar growth aided the 
return the con agg convention march which should provide boost 
and broader macro vegas tailwinds expect another year lowsingle digit gaming volume growth including stabilization high end baccarat 
but expect gross gaming revenue ggr decline slightly given high hold 
expect growth front half weighted primarily due 
challenging revpar and table hold comps remain overweight mgm 
way play the momentum vegas while byd should also derivative 
beneficiary given its ebitda comes from the locals market 
macau macau has clearly turned the corner with gaming revenue declines 
turning into growth expect strong growth 
continue before more stable growth thereafter see risk 
volatility the china macau macro and regulatory environments remain 
uncertain recommend wynn sentiment low following weaker thanexpected opening its new palace casino but expect the property ramp

consumer outlook 
the following are excerpts from the consumer outlook authored the 
economics team ellen zentner ted wieseman robert rosener and michel dilmanian are 
economists and are not opining any equity securities their views are clearly delineated 
executive summary 
with likely tax reform disposable income gets lift helping consumers maintain their 
pace spending despite slower job growth consumer durables travel and credit cards 
stand benefit most don worry about the fed the household balance sheet stays 
protected rising rate environment 
forecast highlights 
our year ahead outlook revised upward our gdp growth forecast 
for and attribute that 
faster pace real personal consumption expenditures than 
previously estimated 
stronger outlook pulls faster pace rate hikes from the fed but 
the household balance sheet largely protected against rising 
interest rates 
the back likely tax reform personal disposable income holds 
despite slower job growth this development now allows households 
maintain level pace spending compared with the slowdown had 
previously anticipated 
lower income households tend have higher marginal propensity 
consume out tax savings while higher income households will save 
more the aggregate historical evidence suggests households 
will spend little less than the tax cuts 
after growing estimated real pce 
growth now follows similar pattern rising 
and 
the quarterly pattern for growth real pce inflects higher starting 
the anticipation personal income tax cuts builds 
higher consumer confidence and income expectations will likely lead 
faster pace debt accumulation expressed rising balances 
revolving credit credit cards 
discretionary spending categories that exhibit high income elasticity 
demand should benefit most from tax reform breathing new life into 
consumer durables and stretching out the cycle travel related 
spending also gets lift

less taxing outlook 
the personal income tax blueprint 
january president trump will preside over unified republican 
congress believe his economic agenda likely provide needed boost 
growth with positive inflection later tax reform expect 
trump use the power the pulpit curb the influence the deficit hawks 
his party achieves personal income tax reform that adds the deficit and 
therefore effectively stimulus but not the degree his original proposal 
the size have presumed gdp year this makes 
trump tax cut more line with the size and scope the gop paul ryan 
lueprint order give those same hawks some amount rhetorical cover 
assume the cuts come and recognize the risk earlier delivery 
ryan blueprint that are using rough guide aims consolidate the tax 
brackets and lower overall rates resulting tax code that simpler fairer 
and flatter dynamic analysis the tax foundation concluded that indeed the 
distribution changes after tax income look fairly even around average 
for all taxpayers but skews higher for the top taxpayers and 
beyond 
while lower income groups tend spend one dollar for every dollar tax 
savings upper income groups tend have much lower marginal propensity 
consume and save good deal the tax cuts across all income groups 
expect the multiplier average out less than line with the findings 
economists the imf 
among other details ryan plan collapses the number tax brackets from 
seven three and lowers the top individual income tax rate from top 
rate taxes capital gains and dividends ordinary income the 
alternative minimum tax eliminated well the estate tax eliminates all 
standard itemized deductions with the exception charitable donations and 
mortgage interest this not exhaustive list for more details see analysis 
the plan the tax foundation 
front running the tax cuts 
the anticipation congress delivering lower tax burden expected family income 
over the next months has jumped among households with our financial 
expectations diffusion index increasing more than points since the november 
election its highest level since temporary spike december exhibit 
gauging expectations important because oftentimes how feel about our future 
finances tends dictate how spend today should the rise expected income 
corroborated actions congress would expect see household spending 
respond before the actual tax cuts are enacted

credit quality 
when gauging the stage the consumer cycle look credit quality rates 
delinquencies tend bottom and turn upward long before cycle peak balance sheet 
dynamics also play important role the consumer cycle and household balance sheets 
today remain great shape 
excessive levels debt late the business cycle can impede discretionary consumer 
spending and pull forward the end the cycle but not see such dynamics 
currently unfolding consumer balance sheets quite the contrary since peaking 
ahead the financial crisis the ratio household debt disposable income has 
declined nearly percentage points and now levels last seen the 
same time net worth has recovered pre recession highs relative disposable income 
exhibit and although the level household debt remains above levels seen before 
the the cost servicing this debt has declined historical lows exhibit 
true ultra low interest rates have helped dramatically reduce debt service costs but 
our analysis the following section suggests that household balance sheets are largely 
protected against the impact rising rates see exhibit and exhibit

solid credit quality also reflected low and declining level aggregate 
delinquencies although details suggest weakness has begun emerge certain 
categories the aggregate share balances days delinquent down over five 
percentage points from peak levels close following the recession however 
delinquencies appear broadening out modestly the auto sector driven 
higher leverage and looser credit environment relative other product areas the 
share auto loans going sub prime consumers those with sub fico score 
has risen from post crisis low september compared pre crisis 
peaks above 
balance sheets and rising interest rates 
finally this business cycle when the fed finds itself the position start 
normalizing policy more quickly expect later the interest expense incurred 
households should not rise materially thereby avoiding cutting into disposable 
personal income and causing knee jerk reaction among households pull back 
spending indeed households are sitting nearly unprecedented counter cyclical 
balance sheet 
facing economy that expected grow beyond its potential think policymakers 
will remain cautious first continuing pursue gradual path and letting the 
economy build pressure before normalizing policy more quickly after having raised 
rates december now expect the fed raise rates twice september 
and december then three more times year end target range 
with the fed set pick the pace policy normalization examine the household 
balance sheet and find that unlike during prior business cycles the bulk outstanding 
household debt being held fixed rate indeed mortgages represent roughly 
outstanding household debt and those are being held very low fixed rate 
exhibit prevailing mortgage rates have remained low for years allowing for the 
gradual transformation the household balance sheet into fixed rates the effective
