for midstream expect growth bifurcation between the haves and have nots 
increasingly important factor determining unit stock performance 
actions stabilize underlying businesses have been largely taken with the hunt 
for growth now resumed for the majority the industry think producer 
activity and prevailing commodity prices will supportive for midstream firms 
with relatively accommodative rate environment new project origination 
should remain concentrated plays where have aggressively pursued 
delaware scoop stack with the potential for legacy assets play 
part developing new infrastructure solutions ultimately customer 
relationships integration within the value chain and geographic positioning will 
play large roles driving project success with expectations for operating 
leverage already outlined for many the pace and relative change volumes 
should drive visibility distribution expectations meanwhile believe firms 
will look proactively address contract restructurings legacy assets pipeon pipe competition becomes more prevalent amid maturing production 
several basins and the need potentially repurpose existing infrastructure 
grows 
with regard the mlp structure the hunt for growth intensifies cost 
capital should paramount ultimate distribution growth potential caps 
idr splits eliminations and simplifications are likely considered trying 
right cost capital for many expect play role accelerating 
this trend firms with advantaged cost capital arbitrage capex opportunities 
along these lines think broader energy infrastructure players will look 
involve themselves given the stable long lived contractual nature assets 
midstream separately tax reform also likely pertinent topic the new 
administration and congress look reform the tax code and spur investment 
infrastructure 
valuations remain attractive yield spreads indicate relatively attractive entry 
points compared historical norms while cash flow and ebitda metrics appear 
approaching more historical averages mlps trade dcf 
distribution yield believe broader institutional participation will resume 
midstream offers attractive total return potential compared other yieldoriented industries

what inside 
what this report consider seven key questions for the midstream outlook 
five relate the underlying midstream business and two the future the mlp 
structure addition review themes and performance and offer valuation 
update 
themes and performance revisited our themes our outlook were 
stabilization healing and differentiation with help from commodity recovery off the 
bottom oil and gas most our covered firms were able stabilize their finances 
through variety steps the playbook including financings distribution reductions 
asset sales and structural changes the idr relationships stabilization set 
several financial healing mode albeit very slow healing given lack cushion 
for many coverage balance sheet strength still ahead for many another year 
more execution projects before cash flows can ramp and more rapid healing can 
occur 
the differentiation front few midstream firms started step out with thematic 
tailwinds such permian ngl exposure marcellus utica exposure didn play 
nor did the managed growth stories the sponsored dropdowns though the latter did 
deliver high growth promised the latter cases the units were punished due high 
valuations and price depressing equity offerings despite accretive acquisitions but are 
now acting better seeing better garp valuations 
many strategic paths success the healing and differentiation phases 
will continue into each our covered firms works succeed from their 
heterogeneous starting positions some non exclusive examples the various 
starting positions include

valuation 
multiple analysis continues point midstream valuations approaching historical 
means however yield spreads still show potentially interesting entry points and growth 
can provide valuable hedge rising interest rates remain line the industry 
and view primarily sector for stock picking rather than group call 
midstream questions for 
below consider the questions 
what are volume expectations 
what can expect new capacity and pipeline permitting 
volumes are improving need concerned about pipe pipe 
competition 
are ngl theme for 
will accelerate 
how could the trump administration and tax reform impact the industry 
will idrs and cost capital remain key topic for investors 
what are volume expectations 
volume trends will remain key underlying focus for the midstreamers with duc 
rolloffs new drilling and reservoir management each topical ducs were important 
source volume support and should continue through the first half 
before the inventory ducs several basins diminishes reservoir management 
through pressure modifications technique that continues several basins 
improve volume support the downside our base case for oil production bottom 
the second half with that the midstream area should benefit from more 
confident expectations recovering volumes and the free ebitda that comes 
from available capacity and operating leverage without the need spend capital 
over the next months producers should continue indicate mostly higher guidance 
their drilling and completions plans for next year and rig counts leading basins 
should rise some additional new rig activity required simply offset the rolling off 
ducs how improved the activity levels become will drive the support for additional 
midstream projects how quickly service costs rise counter factor that could 
ultimately tap the brakes the cycle improvement heading into 
initial volume recovery trends for specific midstream firms can obscured mvc 
protections inasmuch volumes will first flow fulfill current contracts without any 
incremental ebitda impact for the midstream firms that customers are already 
paying for some unused space new projects that added committed volumes may also 
obfuscate underlying volume trends but reasonable expect continued oil gas 
projection declines impact midstream volumes for few more quarters even 
eventual recovery remains expectations 
basin the pace any volume recovery will augmented diminished continued 
producer commitments additional rigs our team indicates continued new rig 
adds but not much incremental basis relative expectations midstream project 
potential linked basin activity 
are seeing adds primarily the permian with expectations several rigs 
being added through the early part signals anticipated future basin 
takeaway tightness look first for epd midland sealy line from the 
permian 
bakken developments well productivity have been encouraging for underlying 
volumes though new rig commitments have not been evident yet between the 
permian new wells and bakken reservoir management our team sees the 
potential for volumes more encouraging next year than many expect 
the marcellus utica starting see rig additions but still waiting for utica 
science projects run their course with perhaps larger rig jump 
reasonable expectation the timing additional marcellus utica ngl 
takeaway less certain but likely needed within months 
scoop stack activity accelerating faster than expected with several offering 
possible residual dry gas projects that will likely needed years 
look mid reasonable time start expecting some projects 
defined 
elsewhere the haynesville catching little buzz for gas the eagle ford quiet 
and remains decline and activity appears relatively stable 
potential concern for the late could inflation service costs 
dynamic keep eye 
what can expect new capacity and pipeline permitting 
the pullback commodity prices and deceleration crude gas ngl production altered 
the pace and trajectory midstream project development rapid increase 
processing fractionation and takeaway infrastructure led overcapacity 
several different classes infrastructure regional basins while continue see 
relatively healthy slate new capital projects being completed over the coming years 
see industry capex slowing and projects being downsized 
expect federal efforts slow pipeline and other infrastructure projects diminish 
under the trump administration certain regulatory constraints may ease tightening 
state regulations however may still impediment and all cases even for federal 
permits spending the overall time prepare for efforts block the projects will slow 
the process see project detractors continuing use variety rationales stop 
projects including environmental geologic native american issues demand forecasts 
and lender pressure wherever the weakest link the process 
volumes are improving need concerned about 
pipe pipe competition 
yes several basins are seriously overbuilt and underutilized will help industry 
volumes are improving and particularly pipeline projects are delayed significantly such 
that firm transport existing pipes remains demand while longer from the outside 
difficult handicap contracts mvcs customer choices etc many firms won begin 
negotiating their upcoming rollovers until months ahead their expiration 
expect periodic disclosure about midstream contracts that are for renewal 
and expect this news flow pick time progresses many pipes are trying 
pick volumes passing through their basins rather than from their basins interstate 
volumes transhipped partly through existing intrastate system all likely still 
early for conversations about upcoming contract rollovers though investors may 
increasing asking about them get handle the base businesses 
believe the midstream firms with integrated operations are better positioned for 
this environment given greater operational flexibility and the ability offer bundled 
rates well have more strategic optionality environment many pipelines 
aren just pipes from point point but really multiple segments inputs and 
outputs from point say point multiple points make difficult replace one 
part transport with better deal elsewhere further midstream information often 
not available revealed mvcs including mvcs further downstream the contract 
question customer options and the potential for other assets services involved 
the renegotiations our base expectation the industry will intermittently impacted 
with ebitda hits but not cliff like declines overall ebitda any given year 
are ngls theme for 
ngl markets are widely expected improve from now until the end the decade 
though the path improvement open debate have already seen periods 
rapid producer response slight changes ngl spreads which coupled with the 
uneven inventory and startup demand new petchem crackers the gulf coast 
promise make for rising but volatile next couple years ngl and specifically 
ethane markets higher natural gas prices have begun lift ethane prices and petchem 
producers are starting line volumes and inventories ahead their late 
startups ethane inventories are high partly result and rejection the field 
remains high well these work down during the market should supported 
but not likely steady trajectory 
weather remains wild card particularly for propane seasonally and this current 
winter setting balances better than expected few months ago when the weather 
was unseasonably warm lpg export trends will also area focus natural gas 
production rises propane will have move export remain better balanced 
market the 
will accelerate 
believe will accelerate but participants may not the usual suspects 
large caps large caps seemingly are less likely participate transactions 
they are each focused executing large programs and taking steps reduce 
leverage and build coverage the small mid cap firms with healthy balance sheets 
looking for growth potential may more likely participants motivations are achieve 
density specific plays integrate system control molecules drive 
them through multiple downstream facilities possibly delever and reduce 
eliminate idr burdens via idr exchange transactions 
believe dropdown names will play increasing role their asset bases 
have become larger and they look diversify away from sponsor transactions 
additionally after wave permian deals believe private 
midstream firms may look monetize also believe that broader strategic jvs will 
take more meaningful role with related industries utilities looking get 
more involved infrastructure investments with growth slowing for many firms 
could see broader consolidation with recent offering some precedent

how could the trump administration and tax reform impact 
the industry 
tax reform still its early stages several ideas have been floated but isn clear 
what will ultimately proposed passed expect tax reform discussions take 
place earnest after budget decisions are made this spring corporate tax reform 
impacts mlps could multi faceted all commentary from washington 
congressional committees still forming but preliminary comments suggests mlps have 
very low probability being reformed away and instead could expanded include 
renewables 
the corporate tax reform changes being floated are much deeper philosophically than 
just tax rates much gets cash flow income based taxes and collateral changes 
accommodate how our tax code will change become globally competitive 
repatriation stranded cash for example could have implications for depreciation 
interest deductions border tax could raise domestic oil prices and drive greater 
producer spending and production volumes lower corporate tax rates ceteras paribus 
would make mlps funding vehicle less attractive the margin mlps would lose 
some their cost capital advantage however less corporate deductibility interest 
could offset the impact lower tax rates the corporate choice use mlps the 
intention keep the changes revenue neutral overall will leave some firms slightly 
more winners than others but not clear which ones yet 
most firms are unable offer any tax impact guidance the issue has moved the 
back burner management meetings until more definite changes are offered the 
new administration unclear whether reform will general after pass through 
partnerships private equity hedge funds both main candidates talked about this 
issue before the election mlps would have have carve out this becomes the 
case which most washington seem aware some have suggested that 
preference for infrastructure may actually lead more mlps with renewables even 
different non energy assets them roads bridges etc this would good way for 
some firms replenish backlogs later this decade 
impact mlps from lower personal income taxes could reduced demand for 
mlps the margin that said people might continue like deferring any taxes cash 
income any event even though mlps are pass through structure less interest 
deductibility will leave little more their distributions taxable the margin and thus 
incrementally less attractive growth can expected slow general for mlps 
then there could more consolidation corp buyer gets basis step when 
buys partnership the holder the mlp would have pay income taxes any gains 
such case lower personal income taxes would make this possibility less expensive 
but still often unhappy surprise 
other non tax policy details the trump administration energy environmental 
trade with mexico particular and tax policies are uncertainties even they are likely 
biased neutral positive for the industry additional uncertainties include permitting rule 
changes the reviewed meaning consultation with native americans constituency 
and any state led developments the pricing carbon various regions the 
country the final irs rules qualified income are perhaps months beyond when 
initially expected not clear when they will disseminated will also watch 
the ferc review tax allowances which has just begun 
will idrs and cost capital remain key topic for investors 
believe definitely yes the market continues respond favorably reduced 
capital markets requirements improved coverage and moves strengthen balance 
sheets most firms mature the incremental take the high splits proving 
too much burden anticipate more firms will reconsider their idr 
relationships during which could lead more structural changes and think 
better ahead when needed avoid the interim pressure the equity 
values few firms have indicated ongoing strategic structural reviews wmb wpz 
mpc mplx enb eep mep enbl tcp and see other firms acknowledging the 
inevitable issue and believe some will choose get ahead their rising cost capital 
retain momentum 
though financially and operationally stable many seem ripe make strategic moves 
that change their trajectory trgp semg mplx pagp paa nsh and sun 
though these moves are often positive for the individual equities selection can quite 
complicated when existing fundamentals are surprised otherwise black box 
management choices exchange ratios premiums take back dropdowns and 
idr transactions more firms are embracing the unit take back approach 
way avoid capital markets yet still deliver promised distribution growth targets while 
not indefinitely tenable strategy does buy some time the capital markets cycle 
which seems starting percolate 
starting valuations 
the rating midstream stocks over valuation expansion still could have room 
relative recent history despite interest rates possibly rising since the valuation 
trough dcf and ebitda multiples have largely recovered and now screen line 
with year historical averages while further cash flow multiple recovery heightens 
execution risk attractive yields and resumption underlying growth improving 
commodity environment could remain supportive the sector somewhat longer 
many cases see midstream stocks continuing offer strong total returns modest 
distribution growth high upfront yields and relatively low risk with wide dispersion 
potentials among the best and worst positioned stocks and accordingly stock specific 
catalysts that should drive those top performers 
the sector more execution story this point catalysts definitely occur but 
they are hard predict idr changes new project announcements 
think the group sets grind higher with execution growth projects and slowly 
improving financial positions supportive commodity prices for drilling should combine 
with improving cost capital across the space jumpstart the investment cycle 
elsewhere catalysts offer further option potential such new project 
announcements and activity ngl price improvement driven evolving 
market demand and possibly more dedicated mlp midstream investment funds 
that said think the biggest near term risks include geography with midstream 
providers stronger basins siphoning market share from providers weaker basins 
and substantial and quick happen rising interest rates that impact debt and equity 
costs thus squeezing project returns

eventual rise interest rates could trigger pullback but 
history suggests this would short lived june the 
beginning the last sustained rising interest rate cycle the fed 
raised the fed funds target rate from ushering 
year tightening cycle mlps began fall early april 
anticipation the move declining before bottoming may 
the space then quickly began sustained recovery the face 
rising fed funds rates fully gaining back what was lost this 
pullback just over four months more recently the mlp 
peak trough correction from the amz all time index high 
late may the mid june trough response rising rate 
fears was followed quick recovery the index mid july 
just slightly below mid may highs 
believe long term mlp growth expectations and improving 
credit rather than short term interest rate sensitivity have more 
impact mlp unit prices while past expectations imminent 
fed funds rate hikes have increased mlp correlations the impact mlp price 
direction has been short lived and muted the longer term 
still one cannot ignore potential higher interest rates they bear cost mlps 
much higher cost capital due higher interest rates would diminish project and 
acquisition economics for mlps which rely capital markets fund growth 
scenario rapid rate increases cost capital challenges will especially acute for 
midstream operators with non debt ratings and variable debt nevertheless our view 
that mlps will enjoy improving access capital markets and favorable 
funding costs both which are supportive future growth even rising interest
