republican sweep changes everything are increasing our eps 
estimates average for the midcap banks with the greatest increases 
among the most asset sensitive banks sivb ewbc tcb cma and cfg which 
are see exhibit roughly half our eps estimate changes come from 
building the fed funds futures curve our base case interest rate assumption 
which implies average fed funds bps versus our prior 
assumption bps and treasury year end for 
reference the median increase net interest income from bps hike 
are also building slightly stronger loan growth given trump emphasis 
infrastructure spending benefitting the lenders most cma key zion 
fhn fitb and increased capital return with the ccar banks cfg and zion 
particular getting the greatest benefit from potential moderation the 
regulatory environment our pts are also moving higher exhibit due 
combination higher eps and our greater focus eps however even 
after raising our pts still see roughly downside the group based 
our eps and downside our underweights 
but midcap banks are less exposed this positive change yet they rallied 
even more than the large caps broadly speaking are much more cautious 
the smaller midcap banks than are the larger regionals and money 
centers why comes down both relative valuation and where see the 
most potential for upside surprises the smaller regionals those under 
bil assets are trading just under one year forward eps see exhibit 
the larger midcaps and super regionals are trading earnings but have 
the potential see greater improvements their efficiency ratios due lower 
regulatory costs and capital return beyond what already our estimates 
more than the smaller banks that have operated with more flexibility given 
they did not have participate ccar yet all relative our large cap 
analyst betsy graseck downgraded three super regionals underweight 
trading forward earnings but she still has attractive industry view 
large cap banks she sees upside the card stocks and money center 
banks which trade closer the larger and more complex the bank the 
greater the potential for regulatory relief drive higher payouts and lower 
expenses this the driver our greater eps increases the large cap banks 
than the midcap banks even are building the same

interest rate assumptions that combined with their considerably lower 
valuation multiples gives the large cap banks more upside pts than 
see the midcaps downside with range 
higher valuations not appear supported better fundamentals bank stocks 
are since the presidential election outperforming the 
pct pts and are now trading our new eps and our new 
eps well above the year average one year forward earnings given 
eps growth and profitability see exhibit suggesting disconnect between 
valuations and fundamentals agree with the market that trump presidency 
should positive for the banks overall with higher interest rates improved 
economic outlook and less regulation but can broadly quantify these 
items and have our revised estimates and the midcap banks still appear 
fully valued the buying bank stocks has been fairly indiscriminate each 
our banks regardless asset sensitivity see exhibit regulatory 
burden exposure lending capital available returned through 
buybacks seems the market building considerably higher rate 
environment than the futures curve suggests suspect that many investors 
may have been under invested financials which has led excessive 
appreciation bank valuations through either increasing their allocations just 
outright short covering driving multiple expansion without corresponding 
increase eps estimates that believe not sustainable near term this the 
primary rationale behind our cautious industry view 
rating changes are downgrading first republic and zions equal weight 
from overweight each stock has outperformed peers year date but given 
their relative valuations see less outperformance from here our view frc 
should trade sizable premium given its well above peer loan growth and 
pristine credit but its premium multiple eps leaves little room for 
meaningful outperformance particularly management made clear during its 
investor day that selling the bank the near term was unlikely zions has 
executed well its expense and margin initiatives but this now appears 
reflected the stock eps while declining asset sensitivity 
suggests less benefit from higher rates are downgrading prosperity 
underweight its valuation eps has recovered from prior texas 
energy credit concerns but its mid single digit loan growth below peer earnings 
growth nim compression and exposure weaker texas economy could 
lead the shares underperform given where the stock valued 
top picks playing the theme very expensive smaller midcap banks our 
favorite underweight rated stocks where see double digit absolute 
downside are boh cbsh pbct snv and wbs each trading 
revised higher eps are right concerned about valuations 
exceeding fundamental improvement then those are the stocks that could see 
the most downside bank stock correction conversely are most bullish 
bku cfg key nycb sbny and sivb although given our cautious industry 
view only see mid single digit upside for most our overweights now 
have equal number overweight and underweight rated stocks with bias 
towards banks that can benefit from less regulatory pressure key cfg and 
nycb are undervalued given their growth prospects bku sbny and sivb 
what are the risks our cautious industry view wrong will likely 
because underappreciated the positive economic benefit that trump 
economic stimulus plan has gdp and loan growth the banks tax rates fall 
sharply banks are allowed deploy considerably more capital than expected 
boosting eps conversely there the risk that are still too optimistic 
certain stocks because are giving the midcap banks full credit for higher rates 
increased capital return and less regulatory expense burden all before presidentelect trump has even entered office should the impact his proposed policies 
prove slower materialize than expected our eps estimates may prove too high 
near term which would likely the catalyst that could drive valuations back 
toward their historical levels

there wide disparity the performance the banks the bottom the list 
exhibit are the cre focused banks sbny nycb and bku there was clearly concern 
earlier the year that cre credit quality was beginning roll over due part small 
decline property values which put considerable pressure the cre focused banks 
however given cre values have improved and credit quality remains pristine 
among these three banks expect their relative valuations improve conversely

valuation 
from valuation perspective the midcap banks appear relatively expensive trading 
one year forward consensus estimates why say they are expensive over 
the last years the midcap banks have typically traded one year forward 
earnings however averages tend only tell part the story 
you can see exhibit the typical multiple range one standard deviation 
between with the banks trading currently they are nearly two 
standard deviations away from the mean more interestingly the banks have traded 
over forward earnings just the time 
how have the banks traded periods rising rates this clearly important topic 
given the market appears pricing both higher fed funds and higher year 
treasury during periods rising fed funds the shaded regions exhibit the 
change midcap bank multiples has been mixed between jan and july 
multiples compressed from from june july multiples were 
relatively flat moving from only december when the fed hiked 
once just bps did multiples expand from not terribly dissimilar 
where banks are currently trading 
how have the banks traded when the curve steepened there have been five periods 
the past years where the curve has continuously steepened least bps over 
discreet period although some cases this driven declining fed funds rate 
average banks multiples have increased points the curve steepens the 
range has been between contraction and expansion during the current 
period starting july bank multiples have expanded more than any other period 
exhibit typical bank price next months eps multiple historical steepness the yield
