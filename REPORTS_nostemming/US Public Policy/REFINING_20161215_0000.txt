executive summary 
expect better year 
see better year for the refining stocks supported recovering refining 
spreads and upside from value creation from asset drop downs and from positive 
regulatory change though some may worry that higher oil prices could pressure 
refining profitability see three drivers behind refining equities crack spreads crude 
differentials and mlp growth value and think all are supportive for 
contrast was volatile year for the refining stocks they were pressured during 
most the year from lower margins because oversupply after very strong 
though the group has recovered recently because greater macro confidence and the 
prospect regulatory relief 
exhibit stocks faced pressure the first half poor macro outlook but has 
since recovered the markets healed and the recent election outcome brings optimism 
renewed economic growth and positive policy changes 
supply started outpacing demand further fueling fears 
inventory glut margins faced pressre with falling cracks 
further exceberating the pain rin prices increased 
high per gallon 
refiners benefited from robust profits 
and ran hard and deferred

election results bring increased sentiment 
refueled economic growth and optimisim rin and

also think constructive policy changes for the industry are the works including 
reducing removing the cost burden rins renewable identification numbers that 
show compliance for the rfs renewable fuel standard that mandates the amount 
biofuel blended into gasoline see appendix for rfs and rin background information 
for refiners that not have the ability obtain the rins internally blending 
operations must purchase rins off the market skyrocketing rin prices have meant 
meeting this obligation has become increasingly expensive rin price per 
gallon estimate this potentially translates expense over shr 
for merchant refiner like pbf exhibit which makes almost estimated 
ebitda exhibit while refiner are looking for ways mitigate costs exporting 
gasoline investing buying operations that involve blending gasoline like retail 
wholesale business believe positive reform which think the new administration 
coming will look see our previous note make refining great again will provide 
significant rate earnings and stock prices currently assume cos that rin 
expense will alleviated proposed tax rate changes could provide 
incremental tailwind with the prospect lower corporate tax rates and the ability 
expense capex instead interest however the border adjusted tax looks like could 
net negative for refiners adopted taxes the crude feedstock that imported 
into the country although less for refiners that can export they will find some offset

debate what drives refining stocks today 
our view 
there are three key drivers refining stocks cracks spreads crude price differentials and mlp growth and value oil prices and cracks spreads 
sometimes move the same direction due their related demand and crude prices can affect consumption over time high prices stifle demand and vice 
versa overall however believe the two are moved different dynamics for crack spreads supply determined refining utilization and market capacity 
changes demand driven product consumption trends weather efficiency improvements etc and global growth refinings margins were boosted 
when nam crude price differentials widened the growth production pressured domestic prices relative international crudes and put 
constraints the nam infrastructure system those constraints disappeared with the lifting the crude export ban and production growth stifled 
lower crude prices however think crude price differentials widen again domestic production had incentives grow again finally refiners have 
diversified their business into the mlp market creating their own mlp vehicles aggregate mlps currently make total ebitda and 
aggregate sotp value our coverage 
oil price not the main driver refining stocks 
there common but think overly simplistic view that crude prices dictate 
crack spreads influence refining margins and thus ultimately drive refining stocks oil 
prices and cracks spreads sometimes move the same direction because they share 
related demand exhibit and crude prices can affect consumption over time high 
prices stifle demand and vice versa but overall believe the two are moved 
different dynamics thus not believe oil prices are the main driver refining 
stocks and would point the limited correlation between refining stocks and crude 
prices exhibit think the correlation limited because while crude prices dictate 
the price feedstock refiners eventually pass higher costs the consumer though 
there lag the impact passing through costs particularly when prices move 
sharply down with the lifo accounting margin 
exhibit crude prices and cracks spreads sometimes move the 
same direction but this because they share related demand

debate what the outlook for refining margins 
our view 
better margins with upside the product market looks well its way toward rebalancing its high inventory see the potential demand outpacing supply 
much mbpd with refiners responding with lower utilization and higher planned turnarounds continued materially elevated unplanned outages 
countries like venezuela and iran from years under investment that will not resolved easily and continued robust product demand mmbpd iea 
domestically gasoline inventories have already normalized and distillate stocks are directionally heading there well early forecasts warmer thannormal winter have been updated incrementally cold providing additional demand distillates for heating forecast refining margins higher 
yoy strip but have bias higher pricing 
product market became oversupplied 
base cracks spreads fell low bbl late and heading into 
believe this was because supply outpaced demand due strong crack 
spreads bbl usgc brent the prior year average bbl for example 
provided incentive for refiners run harder reducing deferring planned maintenance 
and producing more product chinese teapot refiners surprised the market with mbpd unexpected supply and weak diesel demand the abnormally warm 
winter was combined with lower activity the oil and gas industry which also 
led refiners shift more gasoline result gasoline and distillate inventories

chinese teapot refiners little less threat 
after they surprised the market expect chinese teapot refineries have less 
impact according morgan stanley china oil analyst andy meng teapot 
refiners are expected face stricter regulatory measures that should impose capacity 
discipline and diminish their cost advantage while expected that chinese stateoperated enterprises soes will the beneficiaries and potentially recapture market 
share that don expect material reduction overall output from the country 
this does reduce the risk another supply surprise like the one saw 
recently announced ndrc regulatory measures include 
government review crude oil import quota application documents and 
suspension the quota any qualification issue identified 
disposing old refinery capacity for teapot refiners that haven completed the 
required disposal their crude import quota will suspended well 
strict monitoring the government and avoiding significant expansion following 
the capacity expansion plan 
paying more attention tax evasion for enterprises having such issues the crude 
import quota will suspended for months there improvement the 
tax evasion issue identified for second time the crude import quota will 
revoked 
please see our colleagues august report for details teapot refiners 
face stricter regulation china positive for soe refiners 
our china oil team forecasts teapot output growth mbpd which 
lower than the mbpd supply adds but still yoy increase

debate will bring positive regulatory changes 
our view 
the election put the refining industry the path potential positive policy changes the key focus around the renewable fuel standard and ethanol 
blending requirements that have become increasing cost burden the industry believe the epa recent denial rulemaking petitions change the 
point obligation actually puts regulatory changes faster path has already started the statutory day comment period before the decision reviewed 
new republican appointed epa administrator see significant upside earnings and stock value with the elimination rin costs finally proposed 
changes corporate tax policy could provide incremental benefit from lower tax rates and the option immediately expense capex lieu interest for 
refiners who are historically high tax payers the ultimate overall impact the border adjustment tax less clear could negative offset the proposed 
tax breaks for refiners with higher imported feedstock costs though less for those that are able export refined products 
for more background please see appendix the renewable fuel standard rfs and rins 
agree with the market that rin costs are set keep rising 
epa raises blending obligations expected the epa finalized the renewable volume 
obligation rvo for billion gallons above the proposed billion gallons 
this was line with the statute and above the blend wall rin prices rallied the 
news november rising from per gallon but have since traded 
back down see year with directionally higher rin prices driven 
the increase rin obligation being greater than the increase forecast gasoline 
consumption exhibit

however believe the election results could bring cost 
abatements 
believe the industry the path have rin associated costs reduced removed 
via modification the rfs epa enforcement our view the november 
election results improve the probability changes the rfs while donald trump 
expressed support for the intent the current rfs program promoting energy 
independence for the indicated that the policy restrictive and putting 
energy companies out business has also promised make changes empower 
energy companies become more profitable and competitive albeit without offering 
specifics far 
moving the point obligation has the most visible near term potential our view 
there are three interrelated issues with the current rfs and its application the epa 
has increased the ethanol blending obligation above the blend wall the maximum 
amount that can sold into the market due legal and practical constraints the 
application the statute appears have resulted unintended tax burden 
merchant refiners who are required buy compliance via rins broader rfs goals 
and ambitions seem many have become disconnected from markets and science 
whether these issues were causative not there industry shortage rins 
available meet increasing obligation which has caused rin prices increase 
significantly and become greater cost refiners that need obtain them 
believe the first two issues above could addressed setting the rvo the blendwall and changing the point obligation the blend point better match rin 
collection with rin obligation our view such change would halt the inventory rin 
drawdown and significantly reduce the rin trade via better balance between rin 
collection and submission significantly reducing even eliminating the value the rin 
broader rfs reform would likely require legislative reform and thus longer process 
with the new administration priorities dictating the pace and potential 
the epa denied rulemaking petitions change the point obligation but put 
faster path potential change with day comment period while the epa recently 
denied rulemaking petitions change the point obligation believe the start the 
statutory day comment period means new republican appointed epa 
administrator could soon position review the decision expect the epa 
decision like many policy positions could well changed 
independent refiner stocks could see substantial upside rins 
are eliminated revised 
who wins potential reform believe refiners would win the rvo were set 
the blend wall that would increase demand for refined products the margin the 
rin redistribution more challenging believe the rin payments will have some 
offset lowering cracks however merchant refiners would clearly benefit net 
buyers rins with some offset lower cracks retailers majors and integrated 
refiners will have some lower cracks within our coverage believe there significant 
upside the stocks prospects for eliminating revising rin although believe 
there some rin cost reflected gasoline prices and crack spreads estimate pbf

proposed tax changes may also provide tailwind but with 
some potential offset 
potential corporate tax change may provide tailwind the tax reform proposals both 
president elect trump and the republican congressional leadership include two 
elements reducing the corporate tax rate under trump plan under 
the gop plan and allowing companies immediately write off expense the full 
cost investment capex instead net interest expense both which potentially 
reduce taxes for refiners who are historically high tax payers ran analysis the 
potential changes cash flow using the gop plan for hypothetical generic refiner
