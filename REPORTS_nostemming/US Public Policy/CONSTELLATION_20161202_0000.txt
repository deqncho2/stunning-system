regressive tax consumers unlikely and deportation rhetoric likely

deportations migrations out the have already ramped under the obama

implemented during which time forecast stz will outgrow peers eps

key point trump presidency risk wild card but manageable 
since trump victory stz stock has underperformed staples peer 
average and increase since risk from the new presidency 
which believe reasonable concern however view the risk factors 
manageable and view stz stock compelling here detailed below 
exhibit stz stock has underperformed peers since election day 
note avg peers excludes stz 
source company data morgan stanley research estimates 
this section analyze the four major potential risks see for stz associated with 
trump presidency while acknowledge the uncertainty around these issues and 
that trump election negative believe the risks are manageable and view the 
worst case scenarios improbable 
trump has stated that could impose tariffs against mexican products which 
would impact stz given produces its beer mexican breweries imported into the 
unlike the other major beer companies 
trump pre election plans for deportations would pose challenge stz 
hispanic centric consumer base could decrease deportations were increase 
trump stance against immigration could influence migration trends either 
deterring hispanics from entering the causing many leave the country 
there risk tax changes the trump administration which would lower tax 
rates for corporations while eliminating many tax breaks used companies 
overseas profits thus clearly domestic centric players could see greater tax 
benefits than stz which fair point expect some kind tax reform 
import tariffs and financial impacts 
trump has stated could put place import tariff from 
mexican products which would have direct implications for stz mexican import beer 
business which represents total stz sales and profit however 
view tax beer unlikely given higher beer prices would regressive tax for 
consumers which part the reason there are beer import tariffs place globally 
second implementing tariff would first require withdrawal from nafta and then 
even more unlikely the wto which would both take time and create complications 
third even pre nafta tariffs mexican beers were only which would 
manageable level fourth trump our minds much more likely impose tariffs and 
trade restrictions industries that have been shifting jobs outside the 
automotives taking employment opportunities away from americans however stz 
mexican beer portfolio and has always been produced mexico maintain its 
authenticity any job impact would minor last modest tax were 
added stz could likely pass most through higher pricing demand inelastic 
category albeit disadvantaged manner beer peers with mostly domestic 
production 
while tariff would negative also point out one potential positive already 
playing out that could partially offset these factors which that stz beer 
cogs are peso denominated thus significantly stronger usd mxn margin 
positive the mexican peso has already devalued the dollar since the 
election which eps benefit for stz each devaluation the mxn peso 
relative the dollar would drive bps beer operating margin expansion and 
boost eps however this favorable impact will more gradual stz does 
have long term hedges place 
deportation undocumented immigrants 
potential for largest case scenario according the pew research center there are 
estimated undocumented immigrants the which are adults 
and are hispanic based these estimates estimated 
undocumented hispanic adults could deported which relative the total hispanic 
population over would equate total hispanic adults thus 
worst case scenario for stz the company consumer base could 
theoretically fall beer corporate profit resulting 
headwind total beer volume even before considering additional relatives may leave 
the country however believe that trump call for mass deportation unlikely 
implemented president elect trump has been inconsistent with his stance stating 
his campaign that would deport million immigrants all undocumented 
immigrants the country after his victory has now stated that would more like 
million focusing criminals follows through with this new figure 
then the beer volume impact would only addition these estimates laid out 
above are overly onerous deportations will centered those incarcerated 
clearly not consuming beer well lower income undocumented workers who 
skew lower priced beer and not stz higher end portfolio detailed below 
stz premium pricing should limit demographic exposure risks while stz beer 
skews the hispanic consumer the worth noting that stz also skews 
towards the higher income bracket given the pew hispanic center reported that 
undocumented immigrants earn average below the average 
believe stz higher income class skew limits deportation risk audience measurements 
from mri show that stz beer drinkers earn less than per year 
between budweiser and bud light meanwhile stz beer drinkers were 
reported earn more than per year under for budweiser bud light 
these findings make sense given stz portfolio premium average 
beer prices the thus stz premium brands are likely less exposed the 
undocumented immigrant population 
exhibit stz beers under index with consumers who earn less 
than per year 
exhibit and stz beers over index with consumers who earn 
more than per year

addition clear point which confirms our point limited impact from greater 
deportations that stz business has accelerated recent years during sharp 
ramp deportations under president obama and with net migration the 
from mexico turning negative obama has actually been tougher with deportations than 
any other president including president bush during his term according reports from 
the department homeland security annual levels deportations hit all time highs 
under the obama administration peaking people albeit decelerating 
since during the seven completed calendar years under president obama there have 
been more deportations than any president history with over total 
deportees increase from bush eight years office the who were 
deported them were mexican from other words the 
deportation headwind has already been present recent years reducing the hispanic 
consumer base and stz beer business has still prospered fact trump

hispanic migration trends the 
beyond deportations another major risk with the trump presidency might decide 
hispanics willingly leave the not enter the first place once again the 
common conception that hispanics predominantly mexicans have been steadily 
immigrating into the increasing numbers however recent trends show this not 
the case according pew research mexican migration trends have already been 
unfavorable the with negative net migration figures for the first time decades 
recent years migration trends have sequentially worsened over the last years 
decreasing from net mexicans immigrating into the net 
loss mexicans breaking the mexicans decades long mass migration 
into the again this period has coincided with stz beer business accelerating 
highlighting net migration risk manageable

relative tax rate risk 
relative tax risk basis centric peers this fair potential negative wild card 
for stz but tax reform would likely still benefit stz absolute sense even 
relatively advantaged more for centric peers the cpg sector addition any 
changes will likely take significant time fully implemented during which time 
forecast stz will outgrow peers eps growth bps per annum which clearly 
does not seem priced into valuation today and would likely more than offset any 
relative tax disadvantage over time
