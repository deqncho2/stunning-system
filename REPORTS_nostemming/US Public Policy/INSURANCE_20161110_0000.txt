overview with the life insurance industry having been firmly out favor 
recent years the prospects appear improving interest rates gapped higher 
the aftermath the election the burden regulatory uncertainty could 
lifted while recent results posted the industry were solid generally ahead 
consensus expectations sure considerable uncertainty remains and 
whether the higher rates are knee jerk reaction the beginning longerterm trend remains tough call furthermore the reaction from the life 
insurance stocks was swift with roughly half the names have under coverage 
rallying over that said were starting relatively inexpensive 
valuations and even after the move valuations for the group remain relatively 
inexpensive with still substantial upside for several stocks including voya 
ameriprise and lincoln see our strategist recent note the election here 
positive trends higher interest rates sustained help mitigate the ongoing 
spread compression weighing eps growth and reduce the chances 
additional balance sheet charges potential rolling back softening dodd 
frank and dol fiduciary rules which our view has weighed heavily many 
stocks also powerful driver upside multiples would also note the 
industry coming out earnings season where companies generally beat 
expectations solid margin although sustainability this upside remains 
question was driven alternatives and favorable mortality most cases 
negative trends given the surge stock prices not just yesterday but from 
lows earlier the year the power capital management initiatives likely 
moderate the margin are watchful various business lines that continue 
underperform including weakness personal auto results companies with 
property casualty operations and further deterioration long term care across 
the industry have also begun see significant declines sales while asset 
management outflows remain the spotlight variable annuity sales have also 
declined more rapidly than expected although product generally disliked 
investors diminished earnings contribution from this product may not 
necessarily bad thing for future stock multiples 
top picks voya remains out top pick while also see solid upside potential 
lincoln ameriprise and prudential conversely the stocks where are 
underweight are rga and torchmark

unlikely sustainable

later likely reflects some impact from the new regulatory rules should these rules 
softened could potentially see least partial recovery flows

reasons avoid the company was forced recapture large block long term 
care business previously reinsured beechwood this drove immediate charge 
million while also increasing the company overall exposure long term care 
while the charge was largely line with preliminary guidance some investors are 
concerned that additional write downs assets supporting the previously reinsured 
block may necessary buybacks have been suspended through year end result 
the recapture although are expecting them resume the first quarter core 
business momentum across its various businesses has been lackluster with most 
recent quarterly sales which fell showing signs turning around 
catalysts audit beechwood assets due completed year end could 
drive additional charges given its large exposure long term care stock also 
likely driven macro factors most notably changes long term interest 
rates 
short term view with the stock having posted sizable gains following its most 
recent results would recommend against chasing the stock the current level 
with the risk reward profile being modestly negatively skewed our opinion 
long term view from longer term perspective believe the company 
executing the right strategy improve their return profile although recent 
developments may potentially derail least temporarily their efforts

asset management and favorable mortality group insurance international results 
have benefited from favorable currency moves late while longer term its 
opportunities china look substantial 
reasons avoid there are fears that the combination the new dol disclosures 
coupled with new entrants and less favorable demographics will negatively impact 
flows and margins retirement one the more equity sensitive companies 
weakness the equity markets has the potential weigh fundamentals while 
having authorization place management appears favor acquisitions over 
stock buybacks even though several these acquisitions have not provided the 
results originally envisaged 
catalysts potential catalysts include acquisition announcements and macro 
developments especially equity markets and latam currencies the company 
scheduled host investor day november and outlook call discuss 
expectations december 
short term view the stock price has moved substantially higher recent months 
leading view the current level somewhat less attractive relative its peers 
long term view with its business mix focused pension and accumulation 
operations expect the return equity continue improve although 
remain watchful competitive and regulatory issues both domestically and abroad 
further pension outflows and less favorable variable investment income are also 
likely weigh fsa margins future years

complexity well the broad geography its businesses last see the risk 
new entrants potentially eroding the profitability new business both domestically 
and abroad 
catalysts are watchful additional block transactions and the impact that they 
could have their future capital management plans

looking somewhat expensive relative its peers

reasons own the company has the most predictable and sizable free cash flow 
among the companies that follow driving sizable buybacks underwriting results 
have been coming ahead expectations due mostly well contained expenses 
reasons avoid direct response one its main distribution channel has seen 
deteriorating sales and underwriting results even outside direct response life and 
health sales the most recent quarter were lackluster looking forward the 
company guiding very modest eps growth only against which the 
stock current valuation multiple looks expensive 
catalysts clear catalysts outside earnings results 
short term view with the stock having held better than its peers consider the 
risk return presently less compelling than others the industry 
long term view while the stock has the potential slowly and consistently grind 
higher likely underperform environment where macro factors drive 
higher stock prices and interest rates though the relatively predictable nature its 
earnings and simplicity the business model has historically led the stock trade 
premium the current premium well above where has traded historically

reasons own despite some weakening sales overall premium growth

upside expectations making guidance provided the company likely 
conservative 
reasons avoid rates had moved lower earlier concerns regarding 
additional rate related charges against its long term care exposures had again 
emerged although the rates have rebounded recently and view this risk for 
year end rather than this year rates decline back low levels adverse 
currency moves following the brexit vote have weighed earnings prospects from 
its operations management has begun highlighting some escalation 
competitive conditions across the market which sustained could make growth and

catalysts company will hosting investor day december discuss its

short term view view the risk return profile the stock current level being 
balanced other things equal would consider stock price closer 
more attractive entry point

million which was larger and announced earlier than most investors expected the 
company also increased the size its expense reduction goals which makes them 
confident their roe goals from ongoing operations despite the more 
challenging market conditions last have seen generally solid organic growth 
including positive inflows its two most important operations retirement and asset 
management 
reasons avoid citing low interest rates the key factor management has now 
reduced its return capital guidance for basis points given 
the return guidance for other divisions has remained unchanged investors view the 
path toward improving overall returns being somewhat oblique investors also 
remain apprehensive over the company large variable annuity exposures despite 
the comprehensive hedges that have been placed against them 
short term view while well off its lows the stock price remains level where the 
risk reward looking compelling leading recommend investors take advantage 
recent price weakness and build position the stock 
long term view believe the longer term restructuring story focused 
improving the roe makes for interesting stock and the company has made 
stronger than expected progress that said remain watchful other exposures 
including its variable annuity block
