executive summary 
maintain our cautious industry view clean tech into given several complex 
macro issues with high degree uncertainty shaping the clean tech landscape 
prefer rooftop solar installers and stocks exposed favorable wind market trends our 
top picks are run solar and tpic wind overall there heightened uncertainty for 
the group the year ahead with several key themes emerging 
implications the new presidential administration believe key renewable 
energy tax credits will stay place but uncertainty remains overhang the 
industry the new administration seems have little appetite provide additional 
support for clean energy and think the clean power plan likely 
primary target the future the itc and ptc are also question though 
expect both remain place given broad political support especially for the wind 
industry the elimination either tax credit would raise the cost new renewable 
energy but state level policy support should provide solid backstop more 
generally think there very little appetite for additional federal support 
clean energy under president elect trump administration such federal net 
metering laws other incentive programs 
tax reform impacts appear negative the margin but there are many variables 
lower corporate tax rate could lead decline total tax equity capacity and 
rise hurdle rates though negative overall for financing renewables projects 
would expect ppa rates adjust soften the impact border adjustability 
could impose higher tax burden importers most renewables companies 
rates not respond but company specific impacts would depend how much 
the tax burden passed customers through higher prices lower corporate 
tax rate would also lead lower utility rates cutting into the headroom rooftop 
solar economics 
expect solar price declines ongoing headwind for solar panel 
manufacturers limited installation growth and continued oversupply 
despite potential rush china will continue pressure module pricing 
our view see the potential for further downside globally costs come 
down and low priced emerging markets grow share ongoing price declines tend 
cause buyers delay orders and are seeing limited urgency sign new 
contracts 
renewables economics are competitive and continue improve rapidly wind 
the lowest cost form new generation many markets and solar competitive 
with natural gas generation sunny areas within the southern with ongoing 
price declines technology improvements wind turbines and solar panel 
efficiency and policy support expect lcoe levelized cost energy 
continue fall for wind and solar acting strong underlying driver demand 
prefer wind exposed names over solar see several key advantages wind 
development has higher barriers entry than solar our view and will likely 
maintain higher returns the high teens range than solar development 
result wind power highly economic states the central and many 
countries around the world and technology improvements the next several 
years will lower lcoe even further wind also receives stronger political support 
many republican states advantage under the new administration our view

election impacts 
think the trump administration has little appetite provide additional support for 
clean energy and the clean power plan cpp likely primary target believe the 
supreme court evenly divided the pending court challenge the epa clean 
power plan which focused reducing carbon emissions from the power sector the 
next supreme court justice will our view the deciding vote whether this carbon 
regulation will enacted assuming the supreme court grants ultimate cert request 
which believe likely president elect donald trump will able appoint the 
ninth supreme court justice and his comments suggest unlikely nominate 
someone who would support the regulation however this would not incremental 
negative the status quo cpp was stayed court and our analysis shows that 
existing economic forces improving natural gas and renewables economics present 
the power sector are likely drive reduction carbon emissions that exceeds the 
cpp targets more generally think there little appetite for additional 
federal support clean energy under trump administration such federal net

and rggi and assume and join rggi compliance strategy spp 
and miso and other and 
expect the itc remain place though its removal could have meaningful 
impact solar economics with the rooftop market most exposed there are several 
reasons behind our thinking the itc investment tax credit was extended 
republican led congress and would have through congress removed 
was not included target recent tax reform proposals and trump staff has 
indicated that they not plan cut represents small dollar amount relative 
other large tax changes that are being proposed and the focus policymakers 
has been the cpp and blocking incremental renewable energy credits several 
republican lawmakers have expressed support for renewable tax credits republican 
senator chuck grassley has been vocal supporter the ptc and tom reed 
republican member the house ways and means committee has noted that 
renewable energy tax credits need respected the tax reform process the itc 
were cut solar project economics would impaired our estimates utility scale 
solar lcoes would rise mwh hurting the competitiveness other fuel types 
however note that utility scale solar still has economic headroom compared with 
other forms new generation many areas the and demand also driven 
state level rps programs which are less influenced the cost energy the 
rooftop market believe the loss the itc could have more serious consequences 
since represents important funding source through tax equity and larger portion 
the economics system 
exhibit utility scale wind and solar lcoe become modestly less favorable without ptc and itc 
source morgan stanley research solar assumes low cost region southwest 
any incremental solar panel import tariffs could result higher costs for rooftop 
installers see the potential for greater restrictions trade under the trump 
administration including tariffs solar panels manufactured outside the while 
panels imported from china and taiwan currently face import tariffs the the new 
administration could expand the countries targeted these tariffs discussed 
our global solar report estimated about manufacturing capacity was 
added outside china avoid anti dumping tariffs imposed several 
countries solar modules produced china tariffs were expanded additional 
countries would expect rising panel prices the incorporate these additional 
costs which would lead higher input costs for solar installers and developers 
addition president elect trump could attempt unilateral withdrawal from nafta 
end has implied may consider giving six months notice under article 
however unclear whether such action would withstand legal challenge given 
the senate role ratifying treaties even given apparently rising antitrade sentiment 
the most observers believe renegotiation nafta seems more plausible than 
withdrawal from the pact moreover trade interdependence and wto agreements 
would limit the extent potential tariff hikes 
tax reform 
tax reform particularly lower corporate tax rate could lead decline total tax 
equity capacity and rise hurdle rates under the republican and trump proposals 
the corporate income tax rate would cut from either this varies 
between the proposals result tax equity providers may have lower tax liability 
and presumably diminished demand for tax equity investments however potential 
offset could higher taxable income for tax equity providers banks for example 
higher interest rate environment have not yet seen availability tax equity 
limiting factor despite robust growth wind and solar installations there likely 
some slack the market absorb reduction tax equity but could lead lower 
tax equity market size and therefore lower implied leverage for some asset developers 
given the potentially smaller pool available tax equity hurdle rates for these funds 
may rise but believe ppa prices future projects should rise modestly absorb 
these changes and preserve development economics 
border adjustability potential negative unless rates offset the impact under the 
house republican tax reform blueprint border adjustability would eliminate taxation 
the value exported goods while disallowing deductions for any imported goods 
effect companies that import raw materials products then sell the would 
experience higher taxes since this expense would not tax deductible while 
companies manufacturing the and selling other countries would realize lower 
taxes since there will tax this sale this policy implemented theoretically 
exchange rates should adjust offset the impact any border adjustment 
analysts estimate the dollar would theoretically have appreciate for 
complete offset see our strategists analysis here 
exhibit net income impact border adjustability depends level offset 
source morgan stanley research assumes importer scenario inventory imported and all sales domestic 
there are several potential implications border adjustability for the solar industry 
depending the details how such plan implemented though fslr and spwr 
manufacture their own modules they primarily outside the first solar has 
some capacity ohio but the majority its production will imported the 
from malaysia and vietnam sunpower has several lines and module assembly 
facility the but the majority its cell production done the philippines and 
malaysia with module assembly done mexico france and the philippines for system 
sales the source bos components would also come into consideration see risk 
greater tax burden for sales which represent the majority both fslr and 
spwr revenues for non companies unclear whether the tax would 
charged local subsidiary the foreign company the end customer purchasing 
the products there are few potential offsets our view first the theoretical rate 
change which would cause the dollar appreciate reducing the dollar value the 
imported goods additionally given the broad set industry participants affected some 
the incremental cost would likely passed customers the way higher panel 
prices system prices and ppa and lease rates 
tax reform could result lower utility rates risk rooftop solar economics 
discussed multiple notes last year post election note here and follow note here 
several elements the republican and trump tax reform blueprints could lead 
lower utility rates for customers addition the lower corporate tax rate companies 
may able elect immediate deduction capital expenditures from the tax bill the 
year they are spent while giving the tax deduction interest expense for utilities 
our analysis indicates that the reduction income tax rates would lower utility rates 
customers the benefits are immediately passed through customers with 
the low rates continuing permanently least until tax rates are changed with the 
second policy proposal expensing capex immediately see this having similar 
impact bonus depreciation immediate expensing capex would reduce the utility 
taxable income and thus the tax bill and result greater deferred tax liability item 
that deducted from the utility rate base because customer rates are calculated 
allow utilities earn fixed return rate base this reduction will likely result lower 
customer rates and potentially lower growth rates over time believe the 
potential decline customer rates due corporate tax rate cut alone could have 
meaningful impact rooftop solar economics the typical headroom between solar 
lease rates and the prevailing retail electric rate drop customer rates 
would thus reduce headroom believe this dynamic could impact the 
economics older customer leases with aggressive annual escalators and also reduce 
returns future lease deployments reduction utility rates could result solar 
lease price reductions and increase competition among installers 
pricing dynamics 
expect solar panel price declines remain significant headwind fslr faces the 
most risk our view following brief period price stabilization november 
when utilization rates were lowered and ballooning inventories had been burned off 
module prices resumed their declines december and into the first half january 
multi price points are currently around and mono prices are 
globally with pricing also now similar levels given capacity expansions regions 
not receiving import tariffs 
exhibit module prices continuing decline early 
source insight morgan stanley research 
expect further price declines globally there are several key factors 
behind our thinking 
limited signs supply constraint expect capacity rise leading 
players are seeking lower costs through vertical integration technology upgrades 
geographic diversification manufacturing and economies scale note there have 
been some early indications supply rationalizing with announcements spwr and 
fslr reducing capacity expansion plans but given the magnitude the capacity 
additions will take more aggressive action improve the supply demand balance 
downward price momentum tends lead buyers delay orders anticipating better 
prices the future given the continued price declines have not heard indications 
buyers increasing urgency step 
china market dynamics could add significant volatility but expect feed tariff 
fit declines and slowdown installations drive further module price 
declines 
china solar project quota was increased but likely will lead weakness the 
ndrc announced december that would increase the quota for projects 
eligible for subsidy payments long they are interconnected june 
with this think installations possible our previous 
expectation though note that there significant uncertainty 
around the potential magnitude installations china however this will 
likely lead very limited solar installations outside the top runner program 
solar feed tariffs were better than expected kwh above the 
kwh proposal but don think this will help panel prices projects 
will primarily allocated through competitive auctions expect the realized 
fit lower than the benchmark have already seen bidding results that 
were lower than benchmark fits the decline fit payments plus further 
competitive declines from the auction construct will necessitate further panel price 
declines sustain project economics thresholds 
continued overcapacity despite potentially higher china demand this year even 
after accounting for potentially greater installations china discussed above 
and even the increased quota exceeds our estimate the supply additions 
just the top manufacturers will still take years fully absorb the market 
expect this level continued oversupply keep pressure pricing 
exhibit over three years installation growth needed absorb supply additions even 
china sees higher demand 
source company data morgan stanley research estimates supply represents module capacity red lines represent cumulative incremental demand 
following installation increase 
ppa pricing the ppa landscape remains highly competitive both first solar and 
sunpower have struggled sign additional contracts for projects fslr 
pipeline mid late stage opportunities declined from due 
uncertain market conditions several countries well aggressive pricing that led 
the company lose project bids sunpower has adjusted its approach light the 
competitive pricing environment opting not bid low ppa prices projects and 
instead focusing improving cash flow potentially the expense lower ebitda 
several utilities are also slowing their acquisitions solar projects focusing instead 
wind assets where returns have remained higher this could place further pressure 
project pricing 
solar economics 
utility scale solar highly cost competitive today and further price declines and 
technology improvements will further improve project economics today the 
sunniest portions the southern solar costs can reach mwh lower this 
compares new natural gas plant with lcoe mwh mmbtu gas 
prices manufacturing cost reductions falling balance system component costs and 
efficiency improvements have been and will continue drive meaningful reductions 
lcoe expect technology improvements make unsubsidized utility scale solar 
highly competitive the time the investment tax credit itc expires 
estimate unsubsidized solar lcoe will the mwh range texas the 
southwest and california lower cost than new natural gas generation these are 
remarkable economic improvements which our view will result attractive growth 
over multiple decades given that just power produced solar 
exhibit wide variation regional required revenue driven variations solar

net metering 
recent net metering decision arizona cuts rooftop solar compensation and makes 
the long term outlook more challenging the state december the arizona 
utility commission voted the arizona value and cost distributed generation 
proceeding with decision that skewed positive for utilities and negative for rooftop 
solar companies the state the arizona corporation commission has been considering 
perspectives from utilities solar companies and other intervenors determine the 
value and cost distributed generation particularly rooftop solar that the state 
can move away from net metering new long term compensation program that 
based the value the solar electricity provided the grid 
several aspects the decision are unfavorable the rooftop solar industry our 
view 
the decision tie compensation rates generation only utility scale solar 
costs which are well below net metering rates and continue decline rapidly 
assigning value societal and economic development benefits 
allowing new rooftop solar customers lock rate for only years 
rate resets occurring annually which reduces visibility for solar installers 
modestly positive offsets for solar companies include 
grandfathering existing solar customers for years 
the use rolling year average solar cost set compensation rates which 
blends much higher historical costs than current levels 
maximum annual declines the compensation rate per year 
demonstrate the math behind the decision current solar net metering rates the 
state are kwh using the last years reference period for calculating utilityscale solar ppas the net metering rate would fall the reference period 
were remove the earliest year the rate would fall kwh which would result 
the maximum annual decline the compensation rate for the following year 
utility scale solar costs are declining rapidly see chart below with ppa levels currently 
the kwh range would expect declines the compensation 
rate each the next several years this puts pressure rooftop economics

metering debates with outcomes that supported the solar industry language the 
future energy bill originally contained provisions restrict net metering but the final 
bill did not make major changes net metering rules the state florida voters 
voted against measure that would have been negative for rooftop solar the bill 
claimed insulate consumers that don own solar systems from subsidizing those 
with rooftop solar which would essentially give utilities the power block any cost 
shifting from program like net metering net metering will continue 
battleground for solar and utility players but significant political support for rooftop
