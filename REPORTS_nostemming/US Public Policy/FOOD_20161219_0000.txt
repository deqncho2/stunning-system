assessing the potential impact tax reform 
following the november elections with the victory donald trump and the 
republican party success maintaining majorities both the house and senate 
many policy experts expect broad based corporate tax reform likely become 
effective starting calendar year tax reform likely happen the key 
question what kind tax reform there are currently two concrete proposals 
donald trump proposal which ran his campaign and the ryan brady 
house gop blueprint the called better way our vision for confident 
america published june this topic particularly relevant for the 
consumer staples space staples manufacturers enjoy relatively few tax breaks 
today and should therefore benefit more relative basis from reduced 
corporate tax rate other sectors 
exhibit consumer staples firms enjoy relatively few tax breaks 
source morgan stanley research 
assuming the gop proposal the base case given that it the most articulated plan 
view the likelihood each the key points follows 
lowering the corporate tax rate under the republican plan from the 
current assign high probability lower corporate tax rate given 
the republican party united this front and there broad based support 
across the business and political community terms the rate assuming political 
compromises see range most likely use our base 
case 
eliminating the deductibility interest expenses believe there high chance 
this proposal implemented way fund the lower corporate tax 
rate even introduced expect phase period measure apply the 
provision prospective debt assign low probability the removal interest 
expense deductibility immediately general expect budget deficits fund 
most the tax policy changes but believe there needs some offset sell 
the plan not fiscally irresponsible interest deductibility our minds the most 
likely funding mechanism for the tax policy changes 
allow repatriation foreign profits after one time tax assign high 
probability this measure given broad based support and because many 
constituencies would benefit this scenario the implementation would benefit 
corporations which could bring back cash the well the government 
which would benefit from the one time tax way fund the lower 
corporate tax rate the labor market would also benefit from more 
investment 
introduction border adjustments see this wild card with low 
probability happening for the following reasons higher prices 
consumers most retailers and some other industries have substantial mix 
imported products under which prices would increase under this plan likely 
resulting much higher prices consumers and regressive tax strong 
opposition from large part the business community particularly retailers and net 
importers the the transition period would extremely complex and costly 
implement potential international repercussion from other countries which 
could perceive the measures tariff their exports violation wto 
regulations which could require the exit the wto the lack concrete 
proposal for how treat border adjustments for financial institutions the 
provision would subsidize pure manufacturers putting them perpetual loss 
position for tax purposes the provision combined with the gop proposal carry 
forward nols indefinitely and increase them interest factor would imply 
that pure domestic manufacturers would never have pay taxes 
economic theory would indicate that exchange rates will adjust for the tax policy 
change potentially negating the impact manufacturing 
allow capital expenditures deducted immediately being depreciated over 
time assign medium high probability this measure occur but see 
less relevant the consumer staples group 
company level putting aside the impact border adjustability the tax policies 
outlined the ryan brady house plan portend significant eps increase across our 
coverage universe based tax rate net the removal interest

repatriation foreign profits 
the house gop blueprint advocates one time deemed repatriation with differential 
rates for cash and noncash assets which could paid ratably over 
eight years the taxpayer election contrast trump has proposed one time 
deemed repatriation accumulated deferred foreign income tax rate 
exhibit the companies that disclose cash outside the and sjm would benefit the 
most from repatriation cash

based each company percentage cash held outside the opportunities for 
repatration within our coverage look relatively modest although four companies our 
coverage sjm mjn and gis disclose holding their cash foreign 
jurisdictions importantly however this only represents material potential benefit 
across our coverage for mjn foreign cash which after applying presumed 
tax would represent the company current market cap additionally 
two companies our coverage also have significant amount foreign earnings have 
been deemed permanently reinvested mdlz and the 
event that the companies faced forced tax tax payment these assets 
would expect any resulting charges treated one time nature and represent 
one time cash flow headwind 
border adjustments 
believe the largest wild card the house republican tax plan the called 
border adjustment mechanism the proposal would exclude imports from deductible 
expenses the expense side and would exclude export sales from taxable income 
the revenue side note that imports would not limited physical imports but 
would include any purchase from person entity outside the companies 
paying royalties foreign subsidiaries while the exact mechanics the proposal have 
not been explained yet clear that companies who are net importers the would 
disproportionally hit significantly border adjustment overall think the 
proposal wild card the gop tax reform and think the chances border 
adjustment pass are relatively low the range 
within the food industry see relatively modest impact from border tax 
adjustments given that the vast majority finished product manufacturing for the 
market takes place domestically one noteworthy exception within our coverage mdlz 
which has recent years invested both based manufacturing upgrades lines 
the future well the construction greenfield manufacturing facility salinas 
mexico which was expected have high efficiency lines operational mid and 
produces significant albeit undisclosed portion the company volume the 
opposite end the spectrum border adjustability results export volume being nontaxable this could drive modest eps tailwinds for companies with higher concentration 
sales canada khc sjm the extent these products are produced part 
within the across all these scenarios however would again note that our 
discussions with tax experts have suggested that border tax adjustments present 
significant practical hurdles which result relatively low likelihood the measure 
ultimately being implemented 
capex deductibility 
finally part the gop tax plan includes provision for immediate deductibility 
capital expenditures rather than the period depreciation over time think this 
less relevant topic for our group given the relatively low capex sales however 
flag that relative beneficiaries based recent capital expenditures could include 
mdlz sales hsy and cpb

industries such beverages and tobacco recent years kraft heinz has taken

capabilities and peer leading access capital emerging the industry logical 
consolidator since acquiring heinz june and kraft july has achieved 
combined cost savings representing combined net sales and 
with its multi year involvement the beer industry appears only the earlymiddle innings longer term consolidation strategy 
outlined below believe the phase large scale industry consolidation could 
occur early however the near term would expect the market remain 
focused wide range potential outcomes providing least temporary downside 
support for valuations across the group addition looking beyond the khc nexus 
expect cag leverage its balance sheet flexibility net debt ebitda with 
initial focus transformative and highly synergistic transactions which could enhance 
the company growth and earnings have knowledge any pending 
transactions and our knowledge the companies have not commented 
potential policy changes under the trump administration could also contribute nearterm dynamics detailed elsewhere this note see high likelihood 
material changes corporate tax code which could include measures such 
lowering the corporate tax rate from eliminating interest deductions 
iii allowing cash repatriation holiday the potential for border tax adjustments 
which could favor domestic manufacturing goods although view this 
measure less likely implemented and higher interest rates due higher 
inflation from fiscal stimulus see these potential changes somewhat mixed from 
standpoint potential changes corporate tax rates interest withholding 
only prospective could incentivize the pursuit near term could 
expectations further rate increases however also view the uncertainty around 
this issue potential hurdle negotiations which could augmented
