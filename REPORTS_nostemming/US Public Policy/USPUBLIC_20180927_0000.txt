unlikely outcomes gaining likelihood red repeat and blue 
sweep near equal footing 
lue house democrats gain control the house but not the senate remains the 
most likely outcome however since published grading the midterms september 
seen evidence emerge favor the blue sweep scenario 
five thirty eight released senate model estimating that the democrats have 
chance winning the senate 
predictwise probability democrats winning the senate increased from 
five thirty eight house model probability that democrats win the house increased 
from while other third party estimates the economist and 
predictwise have stayed relatively the same 
given this new information have updated our third party averages which now show 
equal likelihood the red repeat and blue sweep scenarios

source morgan stanley research five thirty eight the economist predictwise 
why our probabilities reflect better outlook for the 
democrats the senate 
incorporating new model evidence 
first reiterate that the five thirty eight senate model was published after our last 
note the earliest estimate from the model from august and showed 
chance the democrats winning the senate which has increased slightly 
today this shows much greater likelihood than the original predictwise probability 
which has increased chance today given the popularity and prominence 
five thirty eight estimates thought important update our probabilities with 
this new information some this information could feedback loop predictwise 
estimates may have increased match the higher estimate five thirty eight either 
way this appears coalescing around estimate democrats having one third 
chance winning the senate 
senate races have been relatively stable but many are within the margin 
error 
the senate outlook has been relatively stable but includes number very tight races 
that could either way currently four democratic seats are rated cook political 
report toss ups florida indiana missouri and north dakota and four republican 
seats are toss ups arizona nevada tennessee and texas while the outlook has been 
relatively the same some observers may waking the reality that the democrats 
could pick seats get closer the election and these seats have remained tossups 
the lone star exception 
the one race that does appear moving strongly one direction deep the 
heart texas this race started off summer rated solid republican seat 
cook political report moved likely republican february lean republican early 
august and finally toss september political watchers are keeping eye 
this race bellwether for blue wave democrat can win texas likely 
very strong year for democrats across the board 
positioning for the blue sweep 
for investors who want hedge against this outcome think the third party implied 
probabilities this outcome are too low consider the following positioning which could 
sensitive further shifts higher the probability lue sweep outcome 
add ust duration and curve flatteners our view treasury market investors will 
focus whether tax has chance the next congress blue sweep all but 
eliminates that possibility furthermore investors may perceive democrats success 
indicator fiscal contraction the medium term through expiry rollback 
provisions tax reform recommend and ust curve flatteners 
and being long and outright risks could arise the president and 
democrats work together pass infrastructure bill other increased spending 
discussed below 
add risk markets could temporarily price potential escalation trade 
tensions with china although meaningful trade escalation not our base case 
along with weaker usd this could lead reprieve underperformance 
certain countries that are more leveraged the global environment and trade but 
without large idiosyncratic factors could come back cny and idr could benefit 
zar would rally assuming land reform risks are priced while rub offers value 
the near term reassessing the risk additional sanctions after the midterms 
position for pressure key equity sectors pharma telecom healthcare 
services blue sweep would powerful piece evidence that the 
electorate more willing embrace more progressive policies should democrats 
success extend the presidential election while democratic control 
congress and the white house would far from certainty the lue sweep 
should shift the probabilities such outcome higher all else equal that could 
lead near term price pressure sectors that would challenged more 
progressive policies pharma push for prescription drug pricing controls 
healthcare services push for expanded government role healthcare 
telecom reintroduction regulations 
blue sweep key debates 
below explore the key questions clients are asking about policy outcomes lue 
sweep 
would the democrats and the president join together pursue 
fiscal expansion 
infrastructure spending area where the president and democrats interests appear 
overlap could this lead increased deficit spending from this and other programs 
our view not think likely that the president and democrat controlled 
congress join together for unfunded infrastructure spending program think 
spending negotiations raise the spending caps for will ultimately result 
bipartisan deal raise the budget caps line with past increases not outsized 
increase consider 
the minority expect that republicans would reemphasize hawkish deficit 
policies and pressure democrats contain spending discretionary programs 
see the downside fiscal stimulus 
democratic leadership has already proposed pay fors for its infrastructure 
proposal and has signaled its likelihood reinstate pay rules the house 
even blue sweep scenario democrats will not have votes the senate 
they would need use reconciliation circumvent republican opposition and get 
bill the president desk this limits the scope infrastructure bills 
furthermore would require the president reliably working against his party and 
with the opposing party starting early the process 
democrats may want wait and pursue infrastructure part their campaign 
platform for and have higher priorities currently including health care and 
legislative protection for dreamers 
risks that view the president willingness buck his party could decide that 
didn want shoulder the pushback the pay fors for infrastructure plan 
namely the gas tax and against his party work with the democrats democrats 
could see this their only chance get bill passed and jump the chance even 
though they may take heat for increasing the deficit acknowledge that this 
possible but not consider likely 
note that since there has been idea that the president would open 
working with democrats and has not proven true fact seems have been 
acrimonious relationship even when the president has signaled willingness work 
with democrats for instance the daca deal fell apart due lack 
communication see 
would blue sweep bring end the trade conflict with 
china either congress stepping the president being 
forced change his views after loss 
could the trade conflict with china all about the midterms and therefore resolve 
itself one way another after the midterms are over 
our view believe the outcome with regards the trade conflict the same under 
all electoral outcome scenarios both the president and congress will only act 
trade when forced through market reaction drag economic growth 
congress does have the ability challenge the president ability impose the 
section tariffs but there has been little movement towards doing from 
either party and members both parties believe necessary challenge china 
its trade policies 
the administration actions suggest that has serious fundamental disagreement 
with china and believes the effectiveness its actions see trade risk believe 
the hype 
while some read the delay implementing the rate the billion 
round tariffs giving opening make deal before january that can just 
easily interpreted decision preserve escalation but push the impacts 
consumers and businesses until after the midterms and holiday season 
risks that view watching senate races agricultural states democrats are 
able win back the house and senate they may have done the backs 
anti tariff sentiment agricultural and manufacturing areas that rely both access 
markets for exports and low cost intermediate goods from china democrats face tough 
senate races multiple agricultural states north dakota indiana missouri where the 
candidates are speaking out against the trade tension while free trade and protectionist 
views not necessarily align along party lines victories these states suggest farmer 
and manufacturer discontent with trade that could translate into pressure congress 
act sooner than would have otherwise 
would blue sweep differ from other outcomes with respect 
nafta 
clients ask the election has implications for passing nafta through congress 
matters for the likelihood bilateral deal between and mexico without canada 
our view believe that the administration limited the possibility 
congressional pressure and likely congressional procedure from successfully 
pursuing bilateral deal with mexico failure meet the intermediate deadline 
october does not make nafta away the administration not likely able 
terminate nafta and the current deal will remain place while negotiations continue 
risks that view democratic members congress have been more forthright 
saying that they want nafta remain trilateral deal than some republican members 
congress who recently said they are open mexico deal the risk trilateral 
nafta that republicans hold the house and senate red repeat republicans may 
feel pressure from the administration allow bilateral deal voted under the 
current tpa process allow the administration withdraw from current nafta 
both which would need congress approval still think there are enough 
republicans whose states rely trade with canada keep the administration from 
withdrawing and pursuing bilateral deal but think the possibility the administration 
being able pursue this plan action increases with republican congress
