revisiting the policy issues 
since even before the election have monitored four key esg related public policy 
areas play with the new administration energy environment tax reform healthcare 
and inequality the issues have remained the same with few any surprises and 
progress towards policy goals occurring fits and starts with energy and environment 
deregulation the most active 
natural capital energy environment 
rollbacks energy and environmental policy have seen the greatest activity all 
policy topics and these are effectuated not only the white house but also 
individual agencies and congress nevertheless greater activity has not necessarily 
translated into greater clarity policy details rules make their way through the 
process and are often met with public resistance even legal proceedings the multiple 
hurricanes flooding and wildfires drought areas recently serving reminder the 
relevance climate and environment only seem exacerbate the debate 
the latest news out washington the release the fourth national climate 
assessment mandated every four years the global change research act 
there were two parts released the finalized volume consisting the assessment 
the physical science climate change with focus the well draft 
volume containing the technical assessment impacts risks and adaptation the 
finalized december the conclusions the science report are not really 
new but what remarkable that the content seems misaligned with trump 
administration rhetoric the report which was approved federal agencies and led 
noaa notably acknowledges the human contribution climate change this 
assessment concludes based extensive evidence that extremely likely that 
human activities especially emissions greenhouse gases are the dominant cause 
the observed warming since the mid century 
the impacts climate change specifically within the are the main focus for the 
reports including evidence showing that all parts the country have been affected 
whether droughts flooding changing temperatures some new highlights 
appearing the volume draft mention that the previously forecasted impacts are 
moving from theory practice that the concern not just greenhouse gases but also 
atmospheric pollutants and that impacts felt the are also occurring outside 
borders via companies overseas operations and supply chain potential 
political instability and need for humanitarian aid driven climate changes 
what additional progress has the trump administration made 
environment related policy 
the trump administration has been steadily advancing key campaign promises which 
had included saving the coal industry limiting the epa and rolling back climate 
commitments such the clean power plan and the paris climate agreement while 
has not been without pushback recent notable progress has included proposed 
rulemaking the epa the cpp repeal including reduction the social cost 
carbon reevaluation auto efficiency standards doe proposal for ferc consider 
baseload cost recovery and roll back methane rules among many others however 
these largely require lengthy rulemaking processes and response periods that leave 
markets waiting for final details summarize few these key developments 
clean power plan following trump executive order earlier this year ordering review 
the plan the epa has issued notice proposed rulemaking proposing repeal 
the cpp consistent with administrator scott pruitt prior positions taken oklahoma 
attorney general the epa argues that the rule written exceeds the agency 
authority does not commit new rule regulating greenhouse gases will created 
take its place but recall that the epa required mandate regulate greenhouse 
gas pollutant and endangerment public health unless the endangerment 
finding were reversed the rulemaking now under public comment through 
january would expect environmental groups subsequently challenge the repeal 
long the rulemaking process underway and the new repeal rule legal 
proceedings the cpp remains part federal regulation 
social cost carbon part its cpp repeal proposal the epa has also proposed 
reduction the social cost carbon which measures the public harm one ton 
carbon emitted dollar terms and utilized for federal decision making and litigation 
the reduction from ton ton based application higher discount 
rate consideration only domestic impacts rather than global impacts well other 
modifications the calculation the prior estimate has been adopted individual 
states and even foreign countries and may continue used those entities 
vehicle efficiency standards executive order earlier this year trump kicked off 
review the national highway traffics safety administration nhtsa fuelefficiency standards public comment period ending last month again pitted 
environmental and consumer groups well individual states such california 
support the existing standards against automakers requesting revision the 
standards the least automakers are seeking more certainty the marketplace the 
epa now has until april make final determination after reviewing the commentary 
doe proposal grid resiliency the doe issued notice proposed rulemaking that 
would instruct ferc consider helping coal and nuclear generators termed fuel 
secure recover costs for resiliency services the name grid reliability however 
this would likely mean delaying plant retirements and increasing prices for consumers 
now the ball ferc court decide whether implement the doe order which 
must respond before end november because concerns over the impact 
competitiveness markets would seem unlikely that ferc would accept the rule 
written also expect ferc study the topic the value resiliency doe 
defined this speaks the ability the grid remain reliable the face major 
fuel supply disruption issues such inability deliver natural gas power plants 
but such study will require significant time year our view and the results are 
challenging predict 
methane rule redux the interior department considering delay till january 
bureau land management blm rule which would reduce leaking venting and 
flaring methane from drilling and well completion the argument that the 
financial costs oil gas companies are unacceptable and the rule will opened for 
public comment earlier this year the senate made the first opposition the series 
trump environmental policy reversals when voting against the repeal this rule 
solar tariff while not initiated the trump administration another policy 
development came through the international trade commission announcing 
recommendations for remedies trade complaint against solar cell module imports 
the commissioners differed their recommendations but three four centered 
tariff level final decisionmaking authority lies with the white house which can 
adopt the itc recommendation design completely new remedy given this level 
discretion see the final tariff level highly uncertain and difficult predict 
what appear epa policy intentions going forward 
observed early the year trump epa appears performing line with 
expectations hobbled budget cuts and burdened with rulemaking such repeal 
the clean power plan believe its reduced capacity for oversight increases investor 
need monitor environmental risk especially around climate change 
the epa draft strategic plan released last month not surprisingly stays 
true pruitt belief cooperative federalism which allows states determine their 
own applications epa standards mentioned his confirmation hearings and 
expressed oklahoma attorney general before that general the plan appears 
seek maximum certainty consistency and efficiency including acceleration rulemaking 
and permitting the plan indicates that the epa plans encourage investment 
infrastructure projects such water systems note the plan does not mention the 
words climate greenhouse carbon dioxide presumably indicating lack 
priority this compared the tens times related terms appeared the obama era 
epa strategic plan 
pruitt recently conducted few media interviews that may shed additional light his 
priorities particular discussed his recent meetings with industry players whom 
sees partners shaping policy this could potentially serve opportunity for 
businesses have their voices heard particularly those taking action response the 
exit from but this depends which companies pruitt meeting with and 
listening also claims hard air and water polluters citing cleanup 
enforcement against few companies releasing harmful toxic waste additionally pruitt 
mentions planning red team blue team exercise including independent experts 
tasked with challenging climate science 
what next 
continue believe that within the utilities clean energy sector attractive and 
improving renewables economics continue drive strong demand and for the oil gas 
sector benefit the industry primarily via reducing regulatory risk however there 
are certainly nuances the market has yet reflect waiting more details 
fleshed out few upcoming milestones may provide some clarity not 
this week await reaction washington the national climate assessment 
will congress members leverage the impacts being felt their constituents the state 
and local level efforts put the brakes the trump administration agenda 
next week global climate meetings head into the next round cop bonn 
where expect major topic dialogue what with the supposed exit 
from the paris agreement still not know whether and how the will exit the 
agreement there chance that the will either announce its actions 
prepared start renegotiating the terms suggested trump announcement 
exit unlikely however seems there may two competing delegations from 
the the official delegation sent the trump administration well the are 
still coalition cities states and companies 
further out end november await ferc decision the doe proposal 
which could have potential modest positive implications for coal and nuclear power 
december may see lawsuits against the epa for missing its october clean air act 
statutory deadline for smog designation group attorney generals have already 
filed their notice intent potentially initiating more burdensome legal 
proceedings and second half january public comments will close the cpp 
repeal kicking off the next phase which those comments must addressed

tax reform the likely wrap the end given the practical 
implications midterm election campaigning market pricing now largely line with 
our policy expectations thus further optimism for fiscal stimulus should most likely 
faded the process took step forward last week with the release draft legislation 
the chairman the house ways means committee representative kevin brady 
the report public policy brief tax reform still the drawing board nov 
our colleagues michael zezas and todd castagno outline the key takeaways there are 
few areas that would highlight from sustainability perspective 
international tax the relatively high current corporate tax rate the has been 
one the drivers behind corporates shifting profits around between jurisdictions 
take advantage different tax rules globally the draft legislation indicates new 
corporate tax rate just which should help support investment the 
economy though our strategists expect base case addition one time 
favorable repatriation rate has been proposed along with transition territorialstyle system from the current worldwide system one surprise the draft legislation 
though surtax related party transactions with foreign affiliates 
inequality post the announcement speaker the house paul ryan said most people 
half the people this country live paycheck paycheck there lot economic 
anxiety and think just one the key solutions faster economic growth more jobs and 
think the best thing could deliver that tax reform source times some 
the measures proposed the tax legislation include new personal income tax 
brackets changes the deductibility state and local income taxes and property 
taxes plus cap mortgage interest deduction currently our 
strategists believe that the mortgage reform would leave some ownership householders 
mostly starter homes and renter householders better off with more disposable 
income the lower corporate tax rate could also help reduce inequality results 
higher job creation and wage inflation 
healthcare and education financing whilst munis fared relatively well our muni 
strategists believe that the repeal private activity bonds may prevent nonprofit 
hospitals and private universities from issuing tax exempt debt the future

and will take time the most prominent attempts have been the repeated failed repeals 
the affordable care act recently white house officials apparently asked congress 
form bipartisan task force drug pricing our global pharma team views this 
marginal negative for pharma bio and supply chain sector sentiment subsequently 
democrats proposed legislation both the house and senate that would allow 
medicare negotiate drug prices directly with pharma companies given the continued 
stalemate there not much new report for markets 
immigration since early this year the government has initiated immigration reforms 
related visas daca deferred action for childhood arrivals and refugees that 
have for the most part been met with resistance particular the president decision 
end the daca program and his request that congress address the issue through 
legislation has further complicated the legislative agenda some the dreamers will 
become eligible for deportation soon march putting six month timeline the 
need for action democrats have stated that they want stand alone bill before 
december they will attach every must pass bill december republicans the 
other hand would rather address daca after they address tax reform meanwhile 
companies tech and other industries are lobbying for dreamers stay given their 
level employment daca recipients general consumer and retail sectors benefit 
from immigration result greater consumption and larger potential labor pool
