introduction knowing what don know 
continue inundated with questions from clients about the likelihood timing 
size and details tax reform understandably tax reform has the potential 
materially change the valuation profile many financial markets for those who 
asked questions have some good news and some bad news 
first the bad news given the inherent unpredictability policymaking what can 
confidently say about tax reform limited the following 
probably happening 
its boost growth mitigated the more hawkish fed reaction activates 
see all the president paths november 
because the political and economic complexity successful legislative push 
probably necessitates lack publicly available detail until the hour 
deliberations 
hence markets influenced tax policy are likely trade scant and even 
unreliable information while move toward reform this elevates the importance 
sentiment and valuation relative fundamentals the near term 
here the good news think know enough make some educated guesses 
the most commonly asked client questions about tax reform the report that follows 
answer these questions based the base case built our body work 
the topic far see losing interest tax the future while noting the signposts that 
might signal deviations from our envisioned path tax reform 
why will tax reform happen 
tax reform has been the legislative possibility given the best chances success 
see election tax the future september admittedly tax 
reform the size and scope being debated within the republican leadership 
doubtless herculean task one has only look the evidence repeated failures 
congress deliver this issue recent years however think that such evidence 
pales comparison signs suggesting that the government can and will deliver 
reform 
our argument boils down two things motive and opportunity 
motive with republican controlled senate and house president elect trump has 
legislative partners with very similar tax reform blueprints for example speaker paul 
ryan strategic imperative recent years has been tax reform statements the 
principal decision makers about the legislative agenda affirm that this will priority 
are ready hit the ground running deliver elief from this broken tax 
code that costing jobs competitiveness and growth paul ryan 
speaker the 
here tell you that tax reform will occur house republicans are 
going ready move our built for growth tax reform forward make sure 
meet that timeline kevin brady ways and means committee chairman 
the house blueprint and trump tax plan are kissing cousins kevin brady rtx ways and means committee chairman 
tax reform going accomplished and you are going see the fruits 
this for centuries come house majority leader rep kevin mccarthy 
republicans may further motivated the relative political and legislative feasibility 
tax reform discuss the latter below but the former function relatively less 
party unity around issues trade and immigration two other key focus areas the 
trump campaign even repealing the affordable care act schisms have begun 
emerge about the tactic multi year phase hence tax reform could the 
policy proposal with the path least resistance 
opportunity there are several structural reasons and available tactics facilitate tax 
reform the principal one the most obvious republicans who are mostly like minded 
tax reform control both houses congress and the white house this affords them 
the rare opportunity pass legislation without taking democratic voting opposition into 
account discussed previous reports republicans can work around 
potential democratic filibuster the senate they use the rules budget 
reconciliation key players have already indicated that this will the tactic choice 
when discussing the votes needed pass tax reform the house have 
majority and are majoritarian body all need votes and can pass 
something that doesn work like that the senate you know the senate has 
filibuster except for budget reconciliation but here the point for you able 
use reconciliation not have filibuster has deficit neutral and 
have have deficit neutral tax reform speaker paul ryan during fox news 
interview about upcoming trump presidency 
this our intention use every tool we got make progress for the 
american people make good the promises that were made speaker paul 
ryan the use budget reconciliation 
further important note that legislative work completed recent years such 
the tax reform act camp plan have left congress with some already vetted 
tax components that should diminish the amount work they need put 
together workable bill 
course must address another key hurdle tax reform the ideological conflict 
between house republican deficit hawks and trump more tolerant keynesian 
approach deficits delve more deeply into this dynamic and how effects the tax 
reform process the section that follows 
how will the deal get done 
although republicans are demonstrating unity the moment the tax debate makes 
plain new division the party which key understanding how tax reform will 
come together the fiscal hawks the house representatives have reiterated that all 
tax reform must revenue neutral the facto keynesians the trump orbit are 
willing prioritize growth plans over short term deficit concerns need 
given that both groups want see tax reform done the how becomes exercise 
adjusting rules and procedures way that would satisfy the somewhat conflicting 
goals both groups with that mind draw the following conclusions about how 
the deal gets done 
comprehensive approach the high costs corporate tax reform plus the 
individual treatment some business income means that there are more options 
achieve techincally revenue neutral bill addressing corporate and individual 
tax reform together 
trade offs house hawks trump keynesians currently outlined the 
congressional budget modelers are unlikely score the house gop blueprint 
revenue neutral therefore something has give either risk the bill political 
viability closing more tax expenditures the likely preference house deficit 
hawks congress would have authorize higher deficit perhaps the 
preference the trump team given its growth deal making orientation 
the accidental stimulus even the fiscal hawks get what they want 
dynamically scored revenue neutral tax reform still likely net fiscal 
stimulus static basis 
the art the possible makes possible admit possible that republicans 
could fail hold together their coalition around bill that would aggressively 
change the tax code amidst onslaught special interest lobbying however 
think republicans prefer some tax reform none even means loosening their 
fiscal standards practice this could mean the use phase outs and limitations 
tax preference items where possible help deficit hawks produce nearly 
revenue neutral bill dynamic basis even functions facto fiscal 
stimulus the near term 
what the timing for tax reform 
although anytime possible comprehensive reform passing 
our base case which assumes the gop sticks its plan repeal the 
affordable care act first appears that the republicans will prioritize 
repealing the aca ahead tax reform not foresee republicans getting 
easily senate votes either tax reform aca repeal barring full 
repeal the filibuster which possible but not our base case senate 
republicans would have advance both the aca repeal and tax reform via the 
reconciliation process rules permit only one reconciliation bill for each 
revenues spending and debt limit practice think this gives congress the 
opportunity move one major spending legislation for each annual budget 
resolution repealing the aca the top priority that suggests congress would 
act the repeal early provided that congress sticks its april 
budget resolution deadline once done with that reconciliation congress could 
then pursue early budget resolution for the next fiscal year handle 
comprehensive tax reform 
what could delay tax reform the biggest risk our view that deficit hawks 
the republican caucus would become emboldened perhaps their 
overlapping concerns with the nature the aca repeal and push dogmatic 
view the impact tax reform the deficit this could limit the flexibility 
the proposal which later discuss may required satisfy competing 
demands for the bill within the republican party 
fully explain our key conclusions must understand the procedure around 
budget scoring reconciliation the congressional budget act requires that the 
joint committee taxation produce revenue estimates for all tax legislation moreover 
requires that congressional committees use the joint committee taxation jct 
estimates understanding how the joint committee will score tax reform 
informs our view how congress will put together the legislation this normally staid 
function the jct has taken greater investor and political importance following 
rules changes that required the jct begin estimating macroeconomic gdp effects 
certain tax bills although they haven yet scored the house gop blueprint they did 
release advisory score dave camp tax reform act they also scored 
several minor bills related depreciation and their economists published paper 
dynamic scoring the national tax journal moreover the jct has published 
several detailed discussions its models from our reading these materials and 
granted are not tax experts can make few educated guesses about how 
congress would proceed 
reconciliation and tax reform 
doubt democrats will cooperate tax reform especially republicans 
repeal the aca first avoid the filibuster then republicans would likely 
advance the tax reform bill through reconciliation reconciliation technical 
budget process under which certain tax and spending changes can made 
provided they comply with the overall spending and tax levels set the budget 
resolution accordingly the official jct budget scores become important 
basic level dynamic revenue estimate assumes that tax cut tax change 
affects the size gdp which turn changes the amount federal tax revenue 
dynamic score will not show tax cut paying for itself the jct scores have never 
shown this for major tax package best can tell that said dynamic score 
valid way looking the cost tax cuts net any improved economic growth from 
those cuts this important distinction the short term revenue neutral tax 
reform could still function like tax cut the higher revenues from economic growth 
are not assumed take effect until later for most month ahead forecasts then 
there little difference between dynamic stimulus and static stimulus however the 
size the dynamic feedback effects impacts the overall size the tax plan the 
extent that congress actually focused the deficit this leads conclude that 
tax reform should accidental stimulus dynamic scoring would allow congress 
pursue tax reform that satisfies the letter revenue neutrality while providing 
stimulus the near term appeasing both the hawks and the keynesians the process 
why comprehensive more likely than separate personal 
corporate reforms 
the jct noted paper there are relatively few base broadeners tax 
expenditures the corporate side that are not directly related corporate 
investment lee sheppard noted with regards the camp plan 
recent tax notes column because the corporate income tax loaded with 
subsidies the rate could not come down without repeal every known 
corporate income tax subsidy followed invasion individual income tax 
subsidies fact the camp plan probably could have scored better with 
regards gdp growth had not recommended cuts accelerated depreciation 
schedules the jct forecast the camp plan reduce the level business 
capital the cumulative effects the repeal and 
amortization intellectual property begin outweigh the positive incentives 
from reduced rates standard macroeconomic equilibrium growth model 
simulations house gop tax bill writers seem have learned this 
proposing immediate expensing capital investment but the cost immediate 
expensing likely means that the writers will need even more heavily subsidize 
the corporate side limiting tax expenditures the individual side 
however the limits dynamic scoring and budget reconciliation mean lawmakers 
would likely have make the politically difficult choice between higher implied 
deficits and more aggressive than proposed repeals tax preference items consider 
the jct assumptions economic growth doubt the jct dynamic estimate will 
assume tax reform generates more than increase the level gdp versus the 
baseline the tax reform act was scored generate billion revenue

were the house gop blueprint reform business taxes without hampering investment 
strikes feasible that the jct could predict growth perhaps high 
per the camp plan plus from the bonus depreciation plan would nearly there 
would conceivable for argument sake immediate expensing 
outlined the house gop blueprint forecast the jct lead twice much 
growth the bonus depreciation bill this very rough estimated guess course 
that said let take that number for the sake argument and assume that the jct 
scores the house blueprint adding gdp over year window that would 
very roughly higher gdp effect than the camp plan assuming that taxes remain 
constant percentage gdp then consequently also expect dynamic revenues 
roughly higher given that the think tanks static scores the 
house gop blueprint estimate cost between tax foundation and tax 
policy center dynamic score would still require further offsets 
achieve revenue neutral measure over the budget window 
this sets the possibility that further offsets will required even dynamic

hence while the resolution the hawks keynesians debate may not ultimately 
dictate the level implied stimulus may influence how tax preference items are 
treated discuss this more detail further the report but the key tension this 
since tax preference items cost money the need limit eliminate them function 
congress willingness accept higher deficits while republicans acceptance 
higher deficits may seem unlikely point the attitude the president elect and 
his advisors toward near term deficits which more accepting situation where 
reform gets bogged down house members concerns about changes tax 
preference items that are important their constituencies the white house could 
motivated push its partners the house toward authorizing greater deficits the 
budget resolution create more options for tax reform composition and ensure its 
passage number political face saving measures could used bridge the gap 
between the white house and congress facilitating the bill 
look the discussion the following signs that tax preference items may end 
being treated more gently than the house currently proposes 
reframing broadening the tax debate increased use language asking 
constituents focus the full budget impact the republican agenda the

who most impacted border adjustability 
summary points 
the house republican blueprint proposes convert the corporate income 
tax into destination based cash flow taxation system that would border 
adjust not taxing revenues from exports and disallowing deductions for 
the cost imports 
theorized that the policy trade neutral the dollar should appreciate 
offset the border adjustment credit exports and 
corresponding disallowance for imports 
absent full foreign exchange offset border adjustability will benefit net 
exporters and hinder net importers retailers and multinationals with 
international supply chains are particularly exposed 
however any significant usd appreciation will also pressure translated 
revenue and earnings from foreign subsidiaries companies 
proposed mechanism border adjustability will also introduce foreign 
exchange volatility the reported effective tax rate 
believe broad business opposition and trade law concerns pose 
formidable resistance achieving legislation 
most the united states major trading partners utilize vat systems generate 
revenue addition direct taxes such corporate and personal income taxes vat 
tax indirect tax similar national sales consumption tax and thus ultimately 
paid the consumer the taxing jurisdiction the vat tax accrues each stage the 
production process and function input costs less sales price times the vat tax 
rate vat taxes are designed tax consumption within taxing jurisdiction they are 
generally border adjustable for goods imported and exported that means exporters 
receive rebate for any vat taxes incurred their production process while 
corresponding vat tax levied all imported goods and services 
the key feature the committee ways and means tax reform blueprint 
radically transform the current business taxation system destination based cash 
flow system with border adjustability 
destination system the proposal seeks locate the tax incidence the place 
consumption sense converting the business income tax system into 
synthetic consumption tax 
cash flow based system the proposal would remove many the accrual 
accounting structures today code such amortization capital investment 
and would also eliminate most taxation from financing flows this why the house 
blueprint requires immediate capital investment deductions and the near elimination 
interest deductibility 
the blueprint clearly states that the proposed system not vat but 
structurally very similar subtraction based vat system the blueprint proposes 
apply border adjustability the destination based cash flow system 
not taxing the value exported goods and services including intangible rights and 
property 
disallowing deductions for any imported good service including intangible rights 
and property 
the system would apply both foreign and domestic taxpayers thus 
multinationals with international supply chains would incur tax importing goods 
and services into united states this includes rights and fees paid foreign subsidiaries 
that control intellectual property for instance 
some policymakers perceive the united states structurally disadvantaged the 
border adjustability our trading partners vat systems the blueprint states this 
amounts self imposed unilateral penalty exports and self imposed unilateral 
subsidy for imports however many economists disagree economic theory suggests 
that the adjustment imports symmetric with the adjustment exports then the 
system neutral trade and that exchange rates will immediately adjust offset the 
initial impact any border adjustment terms magnitude the dollar theoretically 
would need appreciate for complete offset 
proponents the destination based cash flow system claim its true appeal not 
promote fairer trade policy but rather reduce eliminate aggressive tax planning 
strategies that shift profits low tax jurisdictions thus protecting the tax base 
while the benefits are appealing there are also formidable concerns with this policy 
including 
wto violations the word trade organization wto rules permit border 
adjustability indirect taxes but not direct taxes such income taxes supporters 
the proposal contend the cash flow nature the proposed business tax creates 
economic equivalent indirect tax and thus should comply with wto rules 
however many trade lawyers disagree there are also compliance concerns with 
proposed border adjustment including deductions for domestic labor costs and 
may viewed favoring exports over imports 
business opposition the policy may economically harm net importers and benefit 
net exporters the extent exchange rates not fully adjust offset the border 
adjustments many multinationals have complex multi jursidicational supply chains 
making assessment the tax policy highly uncertain retailers particular have 
voiced opposition the policy proposal and would likely harmed increased 
costs cannot fully passed the consumer recently group consisting 
over industry trade affiliations issued letter senior lawmakers opposing 
border adjustability appreciation the dollar will also result headwind for 
foreign translated reported revenue and profits 
tariff for non corporate entities the proposed mechanism for applying the 
border adjustments works well for taxable business entities but largely 
inapplicable for individuals and non taxpaying entities supplementary system 
taxing tariffing imports acquired these entities and rebating exports will likely 
required otherwise the border adjustment system can gamed and likely 
viewed violation trade rules thus adjustment personal and non profit 
imports will likely viewed unfavorably tariff 
financial services key challenge how the destination based cash flow system 
will apply banks and financial service entities where cash flows are largely 
irrelevant the blueprint provides detail but states the ways and means 
committee developing special rules for financial services developing hybrid tax 
system for banks and financial system crucial extremely complex and likely 
controversial 
losses conceivable that economically profitable net exporter will fail 
generate taxable income perhaps indefinitely the blueprint proposes indefinite 
carry forward losses including compensating return capital maintain the 
time value the losses this may create perception government subsidy 
some economically profitable businesses may pay little federal taxes and 
may even accrue tax benefits the form net operating losses this also creates 
loss trafficking concerns where acquisitions may pursued primarily for valuable 
tax attributes the target 
financial reporting implications 
the blueprint proposal for border adjustability disallowing deductions for imports 
and not taxing exports will also have significant implications the reported income 
tax provision and effective tax rate the dispersion effective tax rates within the 
market and within industries will increase substantially and the reported effective tax 
rate will exposed foreign exchange rate volatility 
bellow provide two examples 
pure importer company that imports its cost sales and resells 
domestically 
pure exporter company that exports its sales and all input costs are 
domestic 
the first column each example simply illustrates the hypothetical income tax and 
financial reporting scenario with rate similar current practice the second 
column illustrates outcome the rate was reduced the third scenario 
adds the border adjustability mechanism imported costs and exported revenues the 
fourth column assumes the dollar appreciates and completely offsets the impact the 
border adjustments note how the reported net income the same scenarios two and 
four 
net importers will have significantly higher reported tax rates even the foreign 
exchange rate were completely offset the economic impact the adjustment the 
adjustment made the income tax provision foreign exchange movements will add 
additional layer volatility exposure the tax expense line the dollar

our pro forma tax provision consists the following factors 
pro forma federal tax provision simply multiply our new federal statutory 
rate assumption etc reported domestic pretax income 
pro forma foreign tax provision take the maximum the prior year foreign 
tax provision and the product our foreign rate minimum assumption foreign rate 
minimum foreign pretax income 
state local provision assume state and local income taxes are unchanged 
and are deductible for federal tax purposes 
non deductible interest adjustment apply interest deductibility limit factor 
gross interest expense and add the tax impact the overall provision given the 
lack disclosure assume all interest based not apply this factor 
financials reits 
the sum these items equals our pro forma total tax provision the total provision 
divided into total pretax income yields our pro forma tax rate this can calculated 
individual aggregate basis believe aggregate industry sector level 
calculation more appropriate diversify away nonrecurring idiosyncratic items that 
impact pretax income the reported tax provision rate 
also limit our model only profitable reporting companies gaap pretax 
income basis unprofitable firms tend have much more extreme and volatile reported 
rates due changes valuation allowance adjustments 
what doesn impact the rate our model 
implicitly assume all tax credits and incentives are eliminated items such the 
credit the domestic manufacturing deduction and tax exempt income are all removed 
applying static rate assumption further adjustments and assumptions are necessary 
investors forsee any these incentives continuing new tax regime 
the house blueprint and the trump campaign propose forms accelerated cost 
recovery such immediate expensing while immediate expensing provides economic 
benefit the incentive does not directly impact the reported effective tax rate due 
deferred tax accounting for instance with current bonus depreciation this why the 
telecommunication sector reports mid effective tax rates but only pays singledigit cash taxes 
also clearly are not modeling behavioral responses tax policy very likely 
that firms will alter their business strategies based the outcome any reform 
legislation for instance firms may choose finance their operations with equity versus 
debt interest deductibility limited not account for this response 
not apply any adjustments real estate investment trusts reits 
last implicitly remove all firm level idiosyncratic items that may impact the effective 
tax rate such settlements non deductible litigation expenses non controlling 
interest and valuation allowance adjustments 
territorial worldwide 
with republican control the three branches government our base case that the 
united states transitions towards territorial style international taxation system 
however president elect trump campaigned worldwide taxation system with 
minimum rate while structurally different approaches the outcomes may similar 
for many multinationals 
today corporations are generally subject tax their worldwide income 
however income earned foreign subsidiaries normally taxed only when profits are 
repatriated back the parent structure commonly referred deferral this 
deferral mechanism creates incentives for firms reinvest and keep foreign generated 
profits abroad temporarily permanently avoid the incidence taxation 
resulting the trapped earnings phenomenon among many multinationals 
territorial system 
pure territorial system income earned foreign jurisdiction would not subject 
tax the united states many investors believe this will the outcome 
republican controlled tax reform however details are important and believe pure 
territorial system unlikely outcome especially border adjustability and the 
destination based cash flow system does not materialize 
the committee ways and means tax reform blueprint proposes structure called 
exemption system where earnings from foreign subsidiaries companies would 
exempted from taxation this system actually fits within worldwide taxation 
system but effectively converts into modern territorial system however 
maintaining overarching worldwide system provides policy flexibility prevent abuse 
and base erosion for instance the republican sponsored tax reform act 
included similar exemption system but would also implement effective minimum 
tax for income derived from intangibles and intellectual property believe 
destination based cash flow system with border adjustability isn component final 
policy then exemption based territorial system will need include similar 
components prevent tax base erosion thus the outcome may similar 
minimum tax rate regime especially for multinationals deriving income from 
intangibles and intellectual property sources 
global minimum tax rate 
president elect donald trump campaign took different route protecting the tax 
base proposing simple global minimum tax rate all worldwide earnings 
president elect trump proposal would also eliminate the deferral mechanism taxing 
all current earnings full this approach similar the obama administration 
budget which proposed global minimum rate the system appealing for its 
simplicity but territorial regime favored congressional republicans 
transition and repatriation 
all policy options seek end today deferral system transition policy required 
for current deferred and untaxed accumulated foreign earnings the house blueprint 
proposes mandatory effective rate for cash backed accumulated earnings and 
president elect trump campaign proposed mandatory tax accumulated 
foreign earnings for more discussion transition and repatriation policy please see 
accounting valuation focus repatriation top investor questions nov 
how will tax preference items impacted 
discussed earlier take seriously the idea that key tax preference items could 
changed this due the ambitious nature the proposals the need fund 
them comply with budget reconciliation rules and the congressional republicans 
distaste for greater deficits thus the legislative path tax reform proposals means 
should take seriously the idea that key tax preference items could changed however 
the need for political compromise accommodate broad array congressional 
members interests means softer approach could also take hold herein discuss 
some the more possible outcomes 
personal tax code 
the personal tax side the house plan has called for the elimination nearly all 
itemized deductions given our prior analysis order scored favorably the joint 
committee that plan might even need more severe dipping into income exclusions 
well yet na failed recognize the pushback such maneuver would 
elicit from special interest groups raising the possibility that republicans could fail 
hold their coalition together support this more draconian approach that case 
alternative plan would needed likely pushed the trump administration since 
would probably require greater implied deficit spending the near term the 
personal side this alternative plan could include limitations itemized deductions and 
possibly exclusions for high income earners opposed full repeal consider the

average itemized 
deduction 
trump plans include limits for high earners the first tax plan his campaign 
proposed limiting itemized deductions and exclusions for high income earners his 
revised plan targeted high dollar cap for joint filers deductions per 
our analysis you need look filers earning above find significant cohort 
with average itemized deductions that high 
the likely treasury secretary has also voiced support for this approach steve mnuchin 
made the following comment cnbc any reductions have upper income taxes 
will offset less deductions that there will absolute tax cut for the upper 
class 
limiting tax preferences for high income earners may politically attractive 
republicans states that voted democrat the presidential election tend have 
higher concentrations high income earners further those states had higher average 
deductions per filer hence using mechanism that limits tax deductions for high 
earners may not offensive trump political base conventional wisdom might 
suggest effectively messaged could also help defend republicans against 
democratic attacks the issue 
what could this mean for investors into detail this our previous work see 
tax the future but there are key takeaways for munis and housing munis yields 
may have adjust higher account for their diminished tax value the exemption for 
muni interest limited trump original plan envisioned limitations the 
deductibility state and local taxes would reduce the pricing power municipalities 
thus challenging the tax plans the state and local sector which are already 
underweight think current valuations have mostly priced these impacts see into 
the fray but caution investors remain vigilant these risks housing the story 
simpler the view our housing strategy team the impact income related 
limitations like the ones described above should quite manageable given that 
mortgage financing plays lesser role determining price dynamics the high end

industry specific tax preferences help fund lower rate 
focus growth preferences that stimulate economic growth are more likely persist 
discussed above the dynamic scoring model allows budgeters include some 
projected growth impact thus offsetting the cost assumed when scored static 
basis therefore think preferences such accelerated immediate cost recovery

interest deductibility play near elimination interest deductibility required 
policymakers pursue destination based cash flow system with border adjustability 
however believe limitation interest deductibility may pursued any reform 
scenario lower tax rate needs funded even under dynamic scoring interest 
deductibility the third largest corporate deduction after wages and cost sales 
billion further policymakers both sides the aisle perceive the code 
favoring debt financed investment over equity financed investment due the 
deductibility interest but not dividends recent partisan and bipartisan reform 
proposals have sought neutralize this bias limiting interest deductibility limiting 
interest deductibility also way recover the costs any tax reform proposal 
policymakers pursue accelerated immediate expensing greatly increases the 
probability that interest deductibility will limited part total the 
combination current policies often results subsidies for debt financed investment 
see election losing interest oct 
will there phase ins and grandfathering 
historical precedent suggests the answer yes 
the name the game broaden the base and lower the rate broadening the base 
requires certain taxpayers give their favorable tax preferences for the common 
good however breaking hard and often demands transition the last major tax 
overhaul the tax reform act contained over special transitions rules 
many industry and even firm specific transition relief was granted for changes 
accelerated depreciation the investment tax credit rehabilitation credits the minimum 
tax net operating losses specific accounting rules municipal bonds pensions and 
insurance fact historical records credit these special transition relief rules crucial 
passing the legislation 
the current code more complex and the objectives are arguably more difficult 
achieve than even the reform believe special transition rules perhaps even 
targeted specific firms will common and consequential they were then 
the main question transition receive regards interest deductibility 
immediate restriction interest deductibility strikes many investors untenable 
investors have also highlighted capital market concerns even deductibility limited 
only new debt share these concerns and believe policy makers will provide 
transition relief order prevent market disfunction for instance perhaps can 
take cue from the proposed american business competitiveness act sponsored 
devin nunes who member the ways and means committee and 
serves president elect trump transition team his legislation would eliminate the 
deductibility interest but also provides ten year transitional phase where 
would disallowed the first year then and 
however while transition rules will required believe this creates increased 
complexity for border adjustability allowing for transitions will certainly cause 
distortions regarding the cash flow principles the system requires for compliance with 
trade agreements border adjustment generally needs symmetric its application 
imports and exports trading partners may have issues prolonged transition rules 
create perceived benefits for exporters
