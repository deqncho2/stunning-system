key takeaways 
although automatic stabilizers have been reliable cushions prior downturns discretionary fiscal stimulus not given 
considering the recently adopted tax reform and spending bills wouldn place high confidence the availability and 
effectiveness discretionary stimulus the next recession consider the following 
tax reform created number economic cliffs incentivizing procyclical corporate behavior that could exacerbate the next 
downturn 
policymakers may less willing approve meaningful stimulus result the deficits caused tax reform deficit 
concerns have halted some stimulus efforts past recessions and there were rating agency alerts the sovereign they 
could exacerbate concerns while would not interpret action the sovereign rating sign credit weakness and 
inflation indicator would worry about its influence policymakers willingness undertake fiscal stimulus the next 
downturn 
further economic studies don suggest that the kind stimulus we experiencing intrinsically extends cycles and masks the 
effect points and hence wouldn relegate our concerns being low probability events

temporary and returns have actually been much better for smaller tax cuts which recent action was not

the treasury market 
sovereignties macro asset classes the expected supply delivered the flow effect but those relative adjustments tend get lost 
daily market noise and any case represent small fraction the

maturity notes 
treasury decides the bill supply depending the residual funding 
needs after coupon supply decided with some degree certainty 
the main guidance from the treasury advisory committee bill 
supply that over time should average the funding 
gap the band for how bill supply would actually end being 
the premise for point that markets are heart discounting

management bill auction sizes 
needs over the next several years substantially reduced discuss how deficit expectations changed over the past year the flattener goes for gold sovereigns section
