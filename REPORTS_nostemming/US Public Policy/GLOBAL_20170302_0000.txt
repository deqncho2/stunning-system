translating the results the presidential election 
into policy that will determine the future the technology sector landscape this report look which 
part technology would impacted these policy 
changes and measure the potential outcomes during the 
presidential campaign candidate trump was less focused 
technology and innovation policy than other matters 
but did provide some details about his position take 
much stronger stance issues such the decline 
manufacturing which linked increasing offshoring 
and import substitution and the need strengthen trade 
enforcement and review business tax benefits the nearterm impact such policy changes should they occur may 
positive for companies and challenging for asia 
although believe the long term implications are more 
negative they may spark trade war that could raise prices for all consumers especially the and could negatively impact growth margins and suppliers exposed 
the globalization trend the last decade this could make 
the global technology sector tougher place invest 
increasing trade barriers has much broader implication for 
the global tech sector the jockeys for improved position 
global trade the technology sector asia will inevitably challenged with countries highly exposed such risks including taiwan 
china south korea and japan seems fair assume that reciprocal tariff more informal purchasing bans would also placed 
products and services entering foreign markets the were 
impose tariffs foreign products bear case increased tariffs 
make very expensive for companies move and sell their products 
around the world and also dampen demand for tech products 
abroad this could play out similar reduced purchases technology goods reaction the government spying allegations furthermore the global technology industry dominated 
companies that depend the existing global trade framework 
move their goods through their international supply chains many 
technology companies make more their revenues overseas 
than within the and many depend non markets like china 
and india their long term growth plans such technology 
firms are potentially most disrupted this scenario which reason 
expect more moderate version protectionism component vendors who derive high revenue selling into asia and vice versa 
would likely see substantial negative impacts this scenario see 
using our economists framework for thinking about the potential 
global semiconductor capital equipment suppliers potential bene

any drastic paradigm shifts the global technology space and think

that improved china trade and bilateral investment relation 
much spare capacity around and will take time rebuild capacity

asymmetric trade appears more likely scenario 
according our economics team where china would not impose the 
across the board tariff all imports from the but instead would 
make selective tariff hikes some sectors employ less transparent punishments than explicit tariff would have relatively less 
impact the technology sector given china significantly larger 
manufacturing exposure for the illustrative tariff scenarios from 
our economics team imposed against major trading 
partners could translate into drag real gdp growth 
after considering the spillover impact investment employment 
and household consumption 
our view worst case scenario full blown trade war would 
see china use equivalent approach and impose the same tariff 
imports from the believe this scenario more likely the 
were impose tariff china think this the worstcase would not only have direct impact china trade but

but the payback over the longer run negative 
grand bargain scenario 
also identify potential upside risk the possibility that the 
government may tone down its rhetoric and negotiate more agreeable trade deals with countries the has major trade deficits with 
mainly china this the best case scenario our view where china 
and the can reach some grand bargain and drop the case tariff 
hikes reduce risks increased trade protectionism policy 
the manufacturing side policy makers china can offer import 
more goods and services from the which could add demand for 
jobs for example policy makers can encourage soes increase 
the purchase software and financial services and loosen 
domestic sales restrictions some products meanwhile china 
could further promote the bilateral investment treaty bit negotiation with the and further open some high value added and less 
politically sensitive service sectors such finance and insurance 
entertainment business services and courier for companies 
which could help boost the service trade between these two countries

this scenario not see any drastic paradigm shifts the 
global technology space and think that improved china 
trade and bilateral investment relationship could achieved 
apple and other tech giants can maintain their product development related work force onshore and keep their product manufacturing supply chains asia think security concerns around data 
traffic could still keep huawei and zte limited their ability sell
