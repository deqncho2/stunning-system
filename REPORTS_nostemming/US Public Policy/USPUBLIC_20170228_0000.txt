complex analysis this exposure guide our industry analysts pro 
exposure idiosyncratic noted some sectors and 
vide estimation operating income imports and exports for 
industries will likely fare better worse than others the 
our north american coverage universe unfortunately estimation 
economic implications will also vary within sectors and indus 
difficult this information not required disclosure 
tries for instance within energy oil producers and oilfield service providers will likely benefit while refiners 
the tables that follow attempt establish ranges for these 
that rely imported oil and lack the ability export would 
variables based our knowledge and interpretation existing disclo 
likely realize modest negative effect see north american 
sure parsed available disclosure and sought clarity and gui 
energy border adjustment tax making energy great again 
dance from management and investor relations teams however 
with tax policy jan 
given the difficulty this analysis few circumstances are only 
able provide contextual commentary the level disclosure 
leaves estimation too uncertain 
companies will adapt important note assuming 
adoption bat companies will evolve and adapt business 
models maximize efficiency and profitability this per 
note current disclosure standards require minimal geographic dis 
haps the truest for business models that leverage high value 
aggregation companies generally must only disclose domestic reve 
intellectual property under the current system firms are 
nues and long lived assets and the same for any other country where 
incentivized domicile intellectual property and develop 
either material unfortunately the disclosure export based rev 
ment functions low tax jurisdictions lower their overall 
enues not required and must estimated companies must also 
tax burden firms that have offshored their intellectual prop 
disclose domestic and foreign pretax income within the tax footnote 
erty may very well the most disadvantaged the short 
use this the basis estimate operating income adjusting 
term intercompany rights and license fees offshore sub 
for domestic net interest expense assumption collectively these 
sidiaries will considered imports and thus nondeductible 
variables help paint broad picture the sources revenues costs 
for income tax purposes however expect these firms will 
and profits 
among the biggest beneficiaries the long run they 
adapt their business models and likely domicile these assets 
also are only providing ranges operating income import 
and activities the united states 
and export estimates for fiscal year baseline thus 
important note additional implications 
supply chains are complex key economic and analytical 
complication that the largest exporters tend the largl elasticity matters importers and exporters direct title 
est importers and vice versa this dynamic complicates 
goods may legally exposed the border tax but may not 
already complex analysis and particularly acute the auto 
bear the full incidence the tax for instance importers 
industry where raw materials intermediate manufacturing 
price inelastic goods and services will likely able pass 
and final goods and services may collectively cross the 
the economic incidence the tax downstream resellers 
border multiple times during the production and sales proc 
directly consumers via higher prices 
ess industries with complex supply chains will also likely 
have more difficulty responding and adapting the policy 
such situations import title will have little economic impli 
the near term 
cation but may have significant income statement presentation effects for instance under bat regime drug distributor that holds the title for imported drugs will require lower 
price from the manufacturer versus the pharmaceutical 
manufacturer imports the drug and sells the distributor 
post import the economics the distributor will likely 
similar either scenario but gross profit and tax rate profiles 
for the distributor may differ dramatically

see overview the proposed destination based cash flow tax 
system for our summary the border tax component the house 
republican proposal most recently updated our legislative views 
public policy reality bites 
why multinationals with intellectual property intensive business models stand 
benefit the most 
proponents the border adjustable destination based cash flow tax dbcft system claim one its most attractive features the elimination current profit shifting techniques that concentrate deductions high tax jurisdictions such the and profits low tax jurisdictions this achieved dbcft system disallowing deductions for imports and interest expense 
however important recognize this assertion holds only situation uniform multilateral adoption unilateral adoption dbcft system will likely increase business tax competition and exacerbate profit shifting incentives the expense non adopting nations multinationals will incentivized domicile high value assets and 
production countries that adopt dbcft systems and export into countries that operate traditional profit based 
origin tax systems 
effect replacing origin based tax profit with dbcft could seen aggressive move the existing 
tax competition game origin based taxes corporate income would continue other countries giving companies 
incentive locate relocate their activities countries with dbcft system this would true irrespective 
the market which the product was destined sold auerbach devereux keen vela auerbach devereux keen vela desination based cash flow taxation oxford university centre for business taxation jan 
edward kleinbard former chief staff the congress joint committee taxation characterized the proposed dbcft system the the newest largest and most efficient tax haven adopted are setting ourselves 
the new luxembourg see discussion and quotations from edward kleinbard the university southern 
california gould school law finley velarde house cash flow tax plan could put difficult position 
tax analyst feb 
the tax foundation recently argued that adopted the united states would rank global business tax competitiveness versus the organization ranking for the united states today pomerleau kyle house gop blueprint 
and international tax competitiveness index tax foundation feb 
based business models are the most mobile and least exposed relative real price differentials for labor and 
production these firms are also likely benefit from incentive polices proposed the house gop blueprint better way therefore not only will based exports not taxed the business level but feasible that 
such exports will net subsidized the united states with the proposed tax system

ford only assembles three models for sale the out total mexico the ford 
fiesta some the ford fusions and lincoln mkz have noted previously these are 
lower mix products and ford doesn necessarily need all this capacity demonstrated 
their cancelling plant mexico earlier this year with elevated days supply 
days for cars including days the ford focus and days the fiesta total models 
have greater content exposure other countries and models have greater 
content exposure mexico however worth noting that higher mix products including 
the which and canada content are manufactured the united states please 
note that the aala data does not break out content from canada included 
content the earnings call highlighted that they are the largest producer vehicles here the us and top exporter and that the modeling done again depends 
what the details are but doesn suggest that our low cash taxes are going change 
due bat 
fcau out models sold the united states fcau assembles all portion 
models mexico canada models have content exposure other countries including with exposure mexico note that what believe the most profitable 
business line for fca jeep which accounts for more than our sotp valuation 
predominantly manufactured the united states and with predominantly content the 
wrangler which estimate fca generates ebit margin and may account for 
fca global profit canada content and only manufactured the united 
states the jeep grand cherokee another substantial contributor fca profit and 
canada content and also solely manufactured the united states the ram pickup another 
important model for fca local content and manufactured both the and mexico 
please note that the aala data does not break out content from canada included 
content the earnings call fca noted that the set economic parameters that 
president trump has raised are overall positive for fca and that the overall net impact 
imports and exports balanced our ability manage both the plants for export 
canada and mexico vice versa have the volume going the other way furthermore they 
specifically called out the relatively high united states content the jeep line saying 
forward are making jeeps for global distribution out the and globalize the 
jeep brand think have possibilities continue improve that position and help our 
overall impact any border tax impact

todd castagno 
summary points 
the house republican blueprint proposes convert the corporate income tax into destination based cash flow taxation system that 
would border adjust not taxing revenues from exports and disallowing deductions for the cost imports 
theorized that the policy trade neutral the dollar should appreciate offset the border adjustment credit 
exports and corresponding disallowance for imports 
absent full foreign exchange offset border adjustability will benefit net exporters and hinder net importers retailers and multination 
als with international supply chains are particularly exposed 
however any significant usd appreciation will also pressure translated revenue and earnings from foreign subsidiaries compa 
nies 
proposed mechanism border adjustability will also introduce foreign exchange volatility the reported effective tax rate 
believe broad business opposition and trade law concerns pose formidable resistance implementing such legislation

cash flow based system the proposal would remove 
many the accrual accounting structures today code 
the gop blueprint clearly states that the proposed system not 
such amortization capital investment and would also 
vat but structurally very similar subtraction based vat 
eliminate most taxation from financing flows this why the 
system the blueprint proposes apply border adjustability 
house blueprint requires immediate capital investment 
deductions and the near elimination interest deductibility 
not taxing the value exported goods and services includ
