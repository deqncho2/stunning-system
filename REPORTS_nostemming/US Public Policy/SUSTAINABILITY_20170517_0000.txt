companies are likely continue their progress monitoring 
conflict minerals amidst uncertainty policy combined 
with recently finalized european regulation 
the may deadline for filing form conflict minerals reports 
approaching amid recent changes sec guidance and further uncertainty 
policy with the trump administration specifically targeting dodd frank and the 
conflict minerals rule expect filing likely move forward 
planned and the number companies providing voluntary independent audits 
within those filings likely continue increase from and 
the meantime the indefinite april sec guidance recommending 
enforcement the conflict minerals rule has come late the process and thus 
unlikely derail the current path ultimately company avoidance potential 
reputational damage well the fulfillment stricter customer demands 
remain strong drivers support conflict minerals audits 
further growing scrutiny from the and other stakeholders likely lessens the 
impact shifts regulation the just finalized regulations that will 
require compliance and some ways are more rigorous than that the 
such the geographical application going beyond only congo and 
adjoining countries include any conflict affected and high risk areas globally 
the regulation provides detailed set obligations for smelters refiners and 
importers fulfill their supply chain due diligence but sanctions for noncompliance are yet determined member states domestic legislation 
provide suggested steps aid covered companies the compliance 
process note that compliance for both and companies could become less 
onerous given they may source from the same suppliers once supplier 
deemed conflict free this benefits all companies that source from them 
the impact corporate governance practices and supply chain monitoring can 
seen not only company balance sheet but also news headlines the 
sectors most exposed conflict minerals their supply chain are 
semiconductors tech hardware and electronic equipment telecoms medical 
devices aerospace autos luxury goods retailers and course metals and 
mining anecdotally there appears progress the ground conflict zones 
more smelters are verified conflict free and awareness the role 
companies grows multiple organizations are watching closely including the 
enough project and development international both which rate companies 
their conflict minerals disclosures and processes

uncertainty policy 
the dodd frank wall street reform act includes section the conflict 
minerals statutory provision requiring the sec promulgate conflict mineral disclosure 
rules which were finalized such was the first year which the sec 
required companies file conflict mineral disclosure reports via form specialized 
disclosure though the requirements apply only reporting companies whose 
products require minerals the regulation impacts thousands other global 
companies who serve suppliers those companies see appendix conflict 
minerals disclosure requirement 
form reporting now its fourth cycle with the coming may deadline 
given recent changes policy what can expected the bottom line that there 
not likely any change course for companies disclosing this year but there are 
many moving parts follow 
first amendment protection following series lawsuits and appeals contesting the 
sec rule since companies not have disclose definitively whether their 
products are drc conflict free not this was deemed the court compelled 
speech which violates first amendment rights that said most the rule was upheld 
and thus the litigation may have provided companies with some relief but did not 
exempt them from filing the form 
lack enforcement following the president inauguration january his 
designated acting sec chairman announced that the standing april sec guidance 
the conflict minerals rule was being reconsidered and comments from the public 
were solicited april the district court entered final judgment the pending lawsuit 
and remanded the sec address identified issues the rulemaking further also 
april the sec division corporation finance recommended against sec enforcement 
action the conflict minerals rule given the uncertainty how the sec would resolve 
those issues democrats have asked for investigation into whether the acting 
chairman had overstepped his meanwhile the new sec chairman has been 
approved and sworn earlier this month but have yet hear his view the issue 
possible repeal the meantime the house financial services committee may 
advanced repeal dodd frank section that embedded the financial 
choice act this has yet voted the full house representatives 
whose passage would subsequently face the potential obstacle senate democrats 
possible executive action add the uncertainty the conflict minerals rule 
reportedly will targeted presidential executive action fact the dodd frank bill 
explicitly gives the president the right suspend the rule for two years would 
the interest national security 
pending consultation finally the state department holding its own 
consultation which activist groups such global witness and amnesty international 
are refusing participate because they believe that the intention weaken the 
existing rule and that the extensive sec comment period earlier this year already 
sufficiently provided answers from various stakeholders 
would surprised the april sec statement any the above changes 
alters company reporting this stage given the proximity the deadline and the fact 
that companies likely had already completed most their processes and 
statements then further from risk management perspective taking this 
opportunity not issue conflict minerals statement amidst uncertainty future 
regulation lack thereof would likely ill advised such move could unnecessarily 
open the company criticism investors other stakeholders 
fact companies have spoken out favor maintaining the conflict minerals rule 
and expressed intention continue reporting even the law changed they claim 
that the regulation has set motion expectations the part both executives and 
consumers for their products eventually conflict free such pressure for supplychain transparency has also nudged companies quell potential abuses and avoid 
reputational damage further evidence this companies outside the sec 
jurisdiction have published conflict minerals reports given that they along with their 
supply chains may indirectly affected the sec rule and their customers may come 
demand such disclosure and compliance going forward there are also network effect 
benefits that can ease compliance for all companies virtue the overlap suppliers 
being audited such that particular supplier can deemed compliant for all 
companies that source from them 
recall from our previous work that the presence conflict minerals company 
supply chain can impact equity valuation two primary ways first the cost 
compliance and providing transparency across the company supply chain and second 
reputational damage conflict minerals are discovered company products even 
cannot reasonably determined that they are conflict free the below example

company reporting progress the 
filings have been made thus far the next two weeks reporting could 
meaningful the number reporting companies drops significantly from previous 
years but the most likely outcome that will non event the status the 
regulation hangs limbo and companies maintain the status quo 
looking back the reporting cycle exhibit companies had 
reason believe their products used conflict minerals completing only reasonable 
country origin inquiry and only seven companies the that voluntarily provided 
independent audits ipsa determined they were conflict free five more came 
dual determination whereby some but not all products were found conflict free 
unsurprisingly company has declared that its products contain drc conflict 
minerals this leaves reporting companies without determination with respect 
their conflict free status even though they are making efforts avoid conflict 
minerals and may have close full audit participation from their suppliers

not surprisingly recent academy management journal article found that the more

further progress can bee seen through the conflict free smelter program the

verified tantalum smelters did not increase but that metal previously had the greatest

new regulations have just been approved europe requiring smelters refiners and

early april just the sec was deciding not enforce its conflict minerals 
rule the european council approved the conflict minerals regulation shortly after 
the european parliament voted adopt its final text march this regulation had been 
the works since through three way negotiation between the european 
commission european council and european parliament along the way the 
commission proposed voluntary self certification scheme focused direct importers 
into the which the parliament had responded with mandatory 
certification for all actors the supply chain whether smelters refiners importers 
even manufacturers 
next steps the regulation set published the official journal the 
european union the coming weeks and will require compliance beginning january 
member states will have enact domestic legislation with their own sanctions 
for non compliance the european commission will required maintain list 
global responsible smelters and refiners which are recognized fulfilling the 
regulation requirements well handbook providing non exhaustive list 
conflict affected and high risk areas 
further details the regulation and comparison the include 
while the specific covered minerals are similarly defined the the scope 
broader includes certain ores concentrates and other forms recycled 
metals are exempt same the 
unlike the covered countries which are limited the drc and adjoining 
countries the coverage includes globally any areas state armed conflict 
fragile post conflict well areas witnessing weak non existent governance 
and security such failed states and widespread and systematic violations 
international law including human rights abuses 
the approach imposes due diligence and disclosure public companies 
reporting the who turn pressure their suppliers submit audits 
whereas the burden the regulation the processing smelters refiners 
and importers into the conduct due diligence sourced from covered 
conflict affected and high risk areas the regulations not include 
manufacturers importers and sellers finished products and components 
transporters and other intermediaries 
the companies covered the regulation must undertake specific set 
obligations with respect supply chain due diligence that include communication

third party audits and disclosure 
the european companies covered this regulation should motivated take action

the law importers whose smelters and refiners are deemed responsible the 
european commission will not required perform third party audits and 
importers who continue work with certain suppliers will required undertake 
burdensome consultation their risk mitigation strategy with government civil society 
and others suggest that the next steps taken covered companies could 
include consideration the following questions

the dodd frank wall street reform act included section the conflict 
minerals statutory provision which mandated that the sec promulgate conflict 
minerals disclosure rules because concerns that the exploitation and trade 
conflict minerals armed groups helping finance conflict the drc region and 
contributing emergency humanitarian crisis fulfilling that mandate the sec 
announced proposed rules and then final rules following the customary 
public comment period 
the sec rule applies only reporting company minerals are necessary 
the functionality production its own products products that has contracted 
manufactured applies then the company must file new form 
specialized disclosure first the company must perform reasonable country 
origin inquiry rcoi answer can determined that the minerals used did not 
originate covered countries drc and adjoining countries then the company 
must disclose that and briefly describe the origin analysis performed arrive this 
conclusion 
the answer the question not definitive yes then the company must proceed 
with further analysis part the rule was overturned the court appeals 
under the first amendment argument against compelled speech following the appeal 
the company need not state that the answer ndeterminable but still must 
disclose the due diligence process which will identify the source and chain 
custody its conflict minerals through conflict minerals report cmr effect the 
presence the cmr company disclosure could indicate that the minerals 
originate covered countries their origin could not determined without the 
company having state that explicitly the cmr required describe the facilities 
used process the minerals question however specific indicators metrics are 
mandated the company claims its products drc conflict free then audit 
required note that minerals sourced from recycled materials scrap are considered 
conflict free 
law change could occur through modification the list subject minerals and 
covered countries whose definition officially controlled the state department 
for instance the state department could expand the list add the country
