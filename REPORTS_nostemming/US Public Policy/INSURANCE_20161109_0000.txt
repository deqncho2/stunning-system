election implications 
insurance 
historically insurance stocks have outperformed 
under republican administrations insurers could 
benefit from policy support for tort reform cyber insurance 
and crop insurance uncertain environment think 
insurance remains relative safe haven 
market uncertainty hinders risk assets near term morgan stanley cross asset 
and election team expects near term uncertainty following yesterday 
surprise outcome presidential elections while longer term markets 
should balance positives from tax stimulus with negatives from trade 
protectionism our macro team expects steeper yield curve due fiscal 
expansion and lower regulatory risks overall outcome could negative for 
financials near term but they could outperform medium term see election 
electing uncertainty 
insurance stocks have historically outperformed post election since 
insurance sector has outperformed composite the most among 
financials see election senate controls key the performance has also been 
the most agnostic leadership under republican administrations insurance 
stocks absolute returns have been and relative outperformance was 
over the last six elections insurance stocks have outperformed the broader 
market out times both the months prior well the months post 
the elections 
insurers could benefit from republicans policy platform republicans 
support capping non economic damages medical malpractice lawsuits which 
could reduce potential liabilities for insurers cyber security key priority and 
republicans prefer free market cyber insurance part the solution 
republicans also support cost effective crop insurance program with speedy 
passage the farm bill the downside the potential repeal obamacare 
could disrupt brokers growth private healthcare exchanges among our 
coverage aon mmc and wltw have the most exposure 
insurance relative safe haven our view the sector defensive 
nature with beta less than one and lower asset leverage duration and 
equity exposure historically outperforms other financial sectors 
volatile environment with ongoing macro uncertainties and potentially lower for 
longer interest rates expect names remain relatively calm port 
storm among insurers remain ifc and nghc
