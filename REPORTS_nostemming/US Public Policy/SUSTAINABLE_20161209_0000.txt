climate change policy reversal continues the 
greatest esg risk resulting from the election with 
president elect trump selection oklahoma 
attorney general pruitt nominee for epa 
administrator the level certainty about the future 
direction environmental policy has increased 
somewhat the epa now unlikely dismantled 
but the move certainly demonstrates trump 
intention and willingness fight the status quo 
epa climate change while reversing clean energy and climate change policies 
still seems lower trump agenda comparison with other election issues 
trade tax appears committed his campaign promises the 
subject 
pruitt history and origin leaves little doubt about the future the clean 
power plan and fossil fuels pruitt has long track record combatting the epa 
and particular the clean power plan suggesting that the legislation will 
stalled the extent legally possible further pruitt comes from oklahoma the 
largest state for natural gas marketed production with nearly the 
total substantial amount political contributions pruitt have originated 
from the energy industry and known have close ties with and 
advocate strongly for that industry such oil and gas will likely find 
increasingly accommodating policy such permitting interstate pipelines 
drilling federal lands 
existing state leadership and clean energy momentum not insignificant 
certain established policies well state level powers should make difficult 
undo some the prior progress such clean energy federalism allows 
states determine their own applications epa standards and states can 
choose exceed them for example with greenhouse gas emissions targets 
clean energy incentives state leadership part the basis for our prior 
conclusion that the outcome the election would not threaten favorable 
renewables economics though risks remain further states have individually 
adopted carbon trading schemes such california and rggi the 
northeast such existing market forces and regulation have led many companies 
already make corresponding long term investments divestments that cannot 
turn dime 
limits presidential and epa administrator powers exist the regulation 
emissions cannot simply dismissed the endangerment finding which

mandates the epa regulate emissions was decided upon the supreme 
court and upheld subsequent cases order reverse the trump 
administration would need sufficient scientific facts and experts refute the 
public endangerment from climate change which expect would case that 
would take quite some time build further reversing previously established 
environmental protections pruitt could open the epa legal suits states 
such the landmark massachussetts epa case industries that are 
support the existing regulations 
what next confirmation hearings will provide insight not only into the 
senate potential concerns about pruitt but course also into his views 
also still await trump pick lead the dept energy

adapted from our prior report post election esg uncertainty nov 
what know about trump view 
climate change one the issues where the two leading party presidential candidates 
had the most clear cut differences opinion one trump stated goals save the 
coal industry and believes government role remove obstacles the 
exploration and production all forms energy has also pledged hamper the 
epa and roll back climate commitments such obama clean power plan and 
the paris climate agreement 
exhibit donald trump and michael pence quotes related clean energy climate change

washington post interview mar 
think there change weather not great believer man made climate change 
williston basin petroleum conference bismarck north dakota may 
will get the bureaucracy out the way innovation can pursue all forms energy this includes renewable 
energies and the technologies the future includes nuclear wind and solar energy but not the exclusion other 
energy the government should not pick winners and losers instead should remove obstacles exploration 
because low cost energy vital our economy need all the above energy strategy including energy efficiency 
but know this indiana pro coal state and must continue oppose the overreaching schemes the epa until bring 
this war coal end state the state address jan 
here day action plan we going rescind all the job destroying obama executive actions including the climate 
action plan and the waters the rule we going save the coal industry and other industries threatened hillary 
these proposed carbon dioxide emissions regulations are bad for indiana they will cost hoosier workers and families 
clinton extremist agenda 
higher electricity rates lost jobs and lost business growth due lack affordable reliable electricity will continue fight 
we going cancel the paris climate agreement and stop all payments tax dollars global warming 
against any regulation from washington that makes more difficult for indiana continue the state that works 
programs 
indystar editorial jun 
second presidential debate oct 
all for alternative forms energy including wind including solar cetera but need much more than wind and 
solar 
there thing called clean coal coal will last for years this country 
source candidate websites political office websites speech transcripts 
what could this mean for stocks 
believe that all sectors are exposed climate change issues whether business 
interruption production impacts raw material costs changes demand but those 
especially vulnerable are energy materials industrials and utilities specific climate 
change policies could target these sectors terms types fuels used efficiency 
requirements pollution standards with trump presidency the likelihood the 
expansion such policies low but the risk climate event related damages remains 
within the utilities clean energy sector generators with significant coal fired 
generation would benefit from reduced environmental regulation while names with 
international exposure such solar panel manufacturers could impacted trade 
restrictions favorable renewables economics will our view result continued growth 
for renewable developers our utilities team expects solar and wind power forecasts are 
largely achievable given the belief that the epa carbon regulation will have 
increasingly marginal impact superseded favorable renewables economics wind and 
solar economics are competitive many parts the this the real driver 
renewables growth rather than potential carbon regulation and the tax credits passed 
the republican controlled congress last year will our view remain place 
further wind power the middle third the now the cheapest resource 
available note also that the florida state ballot vote proposing constitutional 
amendment protecting residents who not produce solar energy from subsidizing 
did not pass that said tax reform could result lower utility rates risk rooftop 
solar economics 
for the oil gas sector trump presidency expected positive for the industry 
primarily via removing deferring potential regulatory risk the ultimate goal 
trump energy strategy appears make the energy independent and drive 
job growth eliminating barriers energy production overall the regulatory 
overhang will likely reduced and permitting delays challenges would likely 
ameliorate especially federal challenges interstate pipeline projects specific proindustry initiatives could also include increasing federal land available for drilling 
further the republican sweep introduced the likelihood that the renewable fuel 
standard rfs will modified which could benefit refiners the rin renewable 
identification number tax reduced 
how this relevant outside the 
the the second largest emitter globally and thus its leadership and 
commitment fighting climate change sends message other nations the oecd 
environmental policy index currently places the position countries 
with respect the stringency its environmental policies the paris climate agreement 
could impacted the election result even indirectly earlier this year heard 
from political expert capital alpha that the agreement considered binding part 
customary international law and therefore there are limitations its revocation 
further apparently because the has already ratified the paris treaty officially 
retreating from its commitment would take four years the has also the last two 
years made bilateral agreements with both china and canada action against climate 
change 
all that said regardless diplomatic considerations inaction existing emissions 
reduction commitments could lead risks direct impact the global climate fact 
regardless the election outcome carbon reduction commitments the and the 
other nearly countries party the paris climate agreement are known 
insufficient meet the agreement well below degree celsius goal thus the climate 
trajectory could likely experience only slight shift result potential trump 
policies policy reversals 
what questions uncertainties remain 
will there changes renewable energy and fossil fuel subsidies still uncertain 
will the paris climate agreement revoked still uncertain 
will obama clean power plan abandoned likely 
could trump planned investment infrastructure spending have positive 
implications for improved system wide resilience energy efficiency and energy 
innovation still uncertain 
will the epa dismantled unlikely
