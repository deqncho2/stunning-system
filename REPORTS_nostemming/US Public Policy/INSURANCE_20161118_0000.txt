what hearing from life 
investors 
implications the election surprise was far the number 
one topic discussion where investors are working through 
implications the sector from market moves potential 
regulatory changes and taxation changes 
election implications higher interest rates and equity markets are clear 
positives although has been offset unfavorable exchange rate moves for 
some how the dol fiduciary rules and dodd frank rules could change subject 
debate although most investors expect some softening last implication 
taxation changes while far from certain similarly viewed positively although 
the impact likely vary meaningfully among the various companies 
tax free build risk more investors appear have noticed that one the 
proposals president elect trump taxation plan the elimination tax free 
build interest life insurance plans for high income earners while 
remains tough say whether this will indeed change any changes could further 
dampen demand for individual life insurance 
ameriprise acquisition appetite with press reports citing ameriprise one 
the final bidders for pioneer investment group have been asked our views 
whether would strategic fit and whether they could fund acquisition 
this size organically while does appear align with their strategic priorities 
funding organically would seem substantial stretch even considering 
their considerable excess capital and free cash flow generation the company has 
commented that looking for acquisitions but has not commented this 
report have knowledge any pending transaction 
metlife right approach lacking substance while investors like the approach 
which metlife taking managing its operations the clear pushback 
received from investors was that the investor day lacked meaningful new 
substance alter their investment view the stock 
prudential how positioned for guidance call are not expecting their 
guidance call roughly month from now meaningful catalyst for the 
stock with our top down analysis likely guidance range 
largely line with current consensus expectations 
other issues and stocks while the potential for lower corporate taxes are 
viewed positively the offset could deferred tax write downs which could 
issue for companies including aig cno and voya with unum investors 
were also asking whether higher interest rates may lead them keep reserve 
discount rates unchanged view unlikely although the magnitude the 
reduction given higher recent rates could less than they were contemplating 
earlier the year

what hearing 
this section provide details what are hearing from investors and our 
views the issues the issues are rank ordered with those issues being discussed the 
most our clients coming first 
election implications and outliers far the key question received from investors 
was reference the implications the surprise election result and where were the 
outliers with respect stock price reaction the implications the election 
results would caution saying are very early the innings and there remains 
considerable uncertainty what potentially will change that said would place 
the potential implications into three overall buckets 
market factors higher interest rates and equity markets should clear positive for 
the more macro sensitive names whereas the strength have seen the dollar 
post the election headwind for companies with larger international operations most 
likely benefit lincoln and voya due rates and markets least likely benefit 
aflac due yen depreciation 
regulatory changes potential roll back dol fiduciary rules and potential softening 
various dodd frank provisions could strong positive for various stocks 
ameriprise stands out the stock most likely impacted dol rules while metlife and 
prudential are the stocks that potentially stand benefit from any changes sifi 
rules 
taxation adjustments reductions corporate tax rates would likely positive for 
most companies although other things equal higher tax payers with little dta 
and more domestically oriented operations stand benefit more this basis the key 
beneficiaries could potentially torchmark and unum while hartford and principal 
would rank relatively poorly

whether there were any surprises believe the stocks generally performed 
according expectations regards the leaders and laggards but the relative order 
other companies such rga outpacing the heavily interest sensitive stocks such 
cno makes less intuitive sense 
deferred taxes potential changes while changes corporate tax rates were 
generally viewed investors less certain election outcome among the investors 
with whom spoke were nonetheless asked which companies potentially could 
face write downs deferred tax assets the three companies that stand out include 
cno financial voya and aig covered kai pan voya case however believe 
investors have not necessarily been reflecting the value their unrecognized tax assets 
the stock price true any reduction the value these assets unlikely 
meaningfully impact the stock rather believe the key driver remains improving the 
return ongoing operations which calculated assuming tax rate 
tax free build risk clearly the potential policy changes have been viewed 
positively investors clearly evident the stock price reaction have seen post 
the transaction that said have also been asked handful accounts whether 
the tax advantaged status life and annuity products could risk the answer 
would appear yes per president elect trump tax reform plan the trump 
plan also phases out the tax exemption life insurance interest for high income earners 
sure this makes the cut terms final tax proposals remains highly uncertain 
but our view something watch when coupled with proposals eliminate 
estate taxes overall demand for individual life insurance has the potential 
meaningfully negatively impacted while individual life insurance not large portion 
total industry earnings still clearly meaningful business line for companies such

ameriprise interest pioneer investment management according reuters 
ameriprise believed one four companies that have made binding bids for 
pioneer investment management which owned italy unicredit the article 
reported valuation range billion which would equate roughly 
billion usd the back these reports received two main questions from 
investors first whether these operations would potentially strategic fit and 
second how could ameriprise fund offering this size

strategic fit the company has stated has interest annuities protection 
oriented acquisitions and has preference for smaller advisors solid cultural fit 
the advisor side with asset management however the company has stated would 
interested filling our global presence with focus europe and asia show 
exhibit related pioneer they are mostly european focused such based 
the limited information available would appear company like pioneer may align with 
their strategic interests 
funding ameriprise currently has just over billion excess capital under their 
calculations which would fall well shy the reported bids cited the press report 
with leverage ratio the company would also appear have 
limited debt capacity although would note management pointed out our recent 
meetings that they compare significantly better when looking cash flow coverage 
measures they also have among the strongest free cash flow generation among 
companies our coverage universe regardless find tough see how 
acquisition this size could executed organically without raising external equity 
hybrid capital 
metlife nothing troubling but lacking substance the feedback from investors who 
attended last week investor day was that the day was too high level largely academic 
nature and provided too few details the key elements their product and 
distribution strategies sure their focus cash flow including appropriate 
returns investment payback periods and lower rate sensitivity all made sense 
however the company only hosts long term investor day focused its strategy 
every four years further the company had delayed this investor day from earlier the 
year leading investors expect sizable announcements their credit they did 
announce sizable new buyback plan but that had already been expected they had 
told investors expect capital management details when they released third quarter 
results accordingly most investors felt the presentation was lacking substantive new 
information that would drive different investment conclusion

prudential what expect from their guidance call while still several weeks off 
december prudential scheduled host its annual guidance call discuss the 
outlook for this leading some investors question where guidance likely 
come out and key factors which are likely influence the guidance range would 
start with normalizing the results for excluding abnormal items and other items 
that deviate from normal trend estimate the core eps for will come 
around this add the influence buybacks but subtract the 
influence the less favorable yen exchange rate which expected hit results 
roughly this would bring this then need add organic 
growth which would estimate that would bring with 
the company typically having spread the range would expect the 
guidance against this the current consensus estimate 
looks reasonable 
unum are reserve discount rate reductions still the table given the 
meaningfully higher interest rates following the election have been asked whether 
management may potentially able avoid reducing its reserve discount rate 
expect the answer but the magnitude the reduction now likely less 
rather than the basis point reduction that were previously expecting now 
appears basis point reduction could more likely sure lot depends 
where interest rates head from here and one week wild moves does not necessarily 
create new normal but clearly higher interest rates positive and helps alleviate 
the concerns least for now
