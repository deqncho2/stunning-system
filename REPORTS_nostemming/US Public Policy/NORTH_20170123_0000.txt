washington energy policy trip 
take aways making energy 
great again 
hosted our annual washington energy policy trip last 
week and exited with two key take aways higher conviction 
that the border tax adjustment will included tax reform 
and lower conviction rfs reform rfs

key take aways our annual washington trip had higher investor interest 
than the last several years with primary interest potential border tax 
adjustment the most material energy impacting policy element 
despite president trump varying statements the border tax provision last 
week left washington believing there was higher probability the border tax 
adjustment will enacted corporate tax reform estimate the street 
expects probability with many macro funds closer and our 
estimate the renewable fuel standard rfs our exiting view was 
moderated and split its refining sector impact the positive expect 
lower renewable volume obligation rvo for the amount 
ethanol biodiesel that must blended into fuels earlier than expected 
march april the negative believe there lower probability that the 
point obligation poo changed contrary consensus other 
conclusions were positive energy yet more moderate see pages 
border adjustment would likely boon for most energy stocks the 
house brady ryan plan reasonable proxy for what expect the house will 
propose reduction the corporate tax rate and the imposition 
border adjustability would boon energy companies see border 
adjustment tax making energy great again with tax policy jan and 
pages the potential border tax adjustment the primary element that 
would significantly impact energy companies because crude oil the single 
largest import into the total value the key 
potential effects for energy include increase the price oil wti 
above the price international oil brent equivalent bbl 
the current front month brent price refiners arbitrage the value cheaper 
crudes increase the price gasoline and all refined products 
gal driven higher costs with modestly negative effect 
gasoline demand increase refined product exports 
current over time due the higher margin under border tax than 
current likely offsetting the lower refining utilization effect moderately 
positive effect natural gas prices canadian gas imports are reduced

key take aways from washington energy policy trip 
our annual washington trip had greater investor interest versus the last several 
years with the primary group focus the potential border tax adjustment the most 
material energy impacting policy element our two day trip covered meetings 
with key house and senate staffers several key energy lobbyists industry trade groups 
and policy experts set against the pre inauguration atmosphere our take aways are 
montage our views and those discerned from our meetings overall the likely 
changes are very constructive for energy companies and oil production growth 
the energy sector faced increasing regulatory headwinds and pressure over the last 
years despite the historic production reversal from the discovery understanding 
unconventional resource expect the regulatory environment will shift from 
challenging stimulating future activity

corporate tax reform and border adjustment tax president trump statements 
varied over the course last week from questioning his support for border 
adjustment tax tuesday wsj noting ryan plan was too complicated clarifying 
the view wednesday thursday axios noting the wsj interview didn totally 
reflect his views accurately and border adjustment certainly something that will 
discussed despite these statements left washington believing there was higher 
probability that border tax adjustment will included corporate tax reform 
believe the street estimates the probability with many macro funds 
and our own estimate further believe little any the price for 
and wti the border adjustment provision there were several key take aways 
legislative opportunity there appeared realization that the power shift 
washington the last election cycle has created opportunity for 
significant legislative changes top legislative priorities include corporate tax rate 
reduction and health care reform some perceived once generation 
opportunity especially given the last major tax reform was believe this 
real and perceived opportunity and expressed political motivation significantly 
increases the probability tax reform 
funding tax cuts both top legislative reform priorities corporate tax and 
healthcare are budget related and require tax revenue neutrality especially since 
potentially moving under budget reconciliation tax bill that reduces corporate 
tax rates and hence federal revenue requires funding year score 
border tax adjustment could add revenue required fund the bill with 
fewer other viable funding options there will likely some dynamic score from 
increased jobs and economic effect from lower tax rate yet the bill would still 
require relatively large ticket funding item secure lower tax rate 
legislative format our meetings indicated expectation that the house likely 
advance tax reform bill via reconciliation which would lower the senate vote 
required from reconciliation legislative process associated with budget 
bills that limits debate the senate effectively removing the senate ability 
filibuster endless debate ending filibuster via cloture which avoided 
reconciliation requires votes full senate the people with whom 
met expect both potential repeal the affordable care act aca and tax reform 
moved the house under reconciliation the legislative vehicles for 
reconciliation will likely the federal budget likely repeal aca and 
federal budget tax bill reconciliation also requires budget neutrality the scored 
period and contains sunset provisions likely years which the budgeting period 
legislative path the house representatives believe there high 
probability passage given significant republican majority and house 
leadership statements ryan brady proposal where paul ryan speaker the 
house the senate will likely the critical fight given smaller republican 
majority seats and likely opposition arkansas republican senators 
walmart headquartered expect the white house will likely sign 
whatever tax bill arrives with overriding objective job creation the white house 
critical selling the bill america the senate elections should influence 
voting favor key trump initiatives our view the senate there are seats 
for election and those seats are held democrats 
republicans and independents further five democratic incumbent seats are 
states that trump won convincingly presidental election montana 
missouri indiana north dakota and west virginia our view those seats for 
election are less inclined oppose key initiatives especially tax reform 
effectively sold the white house facilitating job creation 
expected timing believe that the debate likely commence april after 
legislators complete significant congressional review act cra discussed below 
period draft budget and address potential repeal affordable care act 
house tax bill targeted for april may with senate target before summer recess 
july yet likely slipping conference until the fall with january 
targeted effective date the people with whom met expect some phase period 
various provisions with year period given political election cycle and phase 
periods the changes will also generally match funding 
wto challenge risks questions exist whether ryan brady proposal with the 
border tax adjustment would violate the wto our meetings indicate that 
ryan brady believe compliant given similar effect vat value added tax 
currently utilized many our wto trade partners there wto challenge 
many advisors also noted that these legal challenges move glacial speed and can 
take decades resolve hence not discouraging proposed legislation similar view 
applies nafta 
other alternatives other funding mechanism for corporate tax rate reduction 
other than border tax exist such removal interest rate deduction further 
other tax bills exist such former congressman dave camp tax bill which 
has already been scored and studied different bills theories could emerge from 
senate 
probabilities passage see high probability corporate tax reform lower 
rate and believe the street estimates probability border tax 
adjustment with many macro funds and our own estimate 
further believe little any the price for and wti our estimate 
the border tax adjustment based what expect the house will propose and 
what can pass through the senate funded basis the context the reelection cycle are only given the clear opposition and less predicable 
and reflexive nature politics any event expect speaker house ryan 
bill will first mover and consensus probabilities border tax feature will 
increase over the next months whether not ultimately codified tax 
reform 
renewable fuel standard rfs potential rfs reform was the second priority the 
trip our exiting view was moderated and split positive and negative refining sector 
impact the positive expect lower rvo for earlier than expected march 
april the negative believe there lower probability that poo changed 
contrary consensus first given the busy legislative calendar and split 
refining industry support regarding poo not expect congress will change the rfs 
there are too many other legislative items higher priority health care and 
tax reform alone are heavy lift therefore rfs change would have source from 
within the epa the rvo easier and having completed time april for once 
years would positive would expect rvo under the blend wall 
however believe that pruit confirmed unlikely change poo pragmatically 
harder alter poo administratively given the refining industry split the issue 
and complex change that must drafted studied and analyzed agency 
inherited civil servants that more philosophically opposed many the likely 
changes this administration will propose longer term during the trump administration 
would expect rfs reform given unachievable deadlines are approaching 
requiring statutory reform ultimately expect some industry compromise between 
farmers and refiners levels below the blend wall with cellulosic and biodiesel 
volumes lost corn ethanol and that compromise delivered congress codify 
rfs reform legislation our view rin prices will remain with moderating price 
pressure which expect higher than consensus 
congressional review act cra the congressional review act allows congress 
review rules adopted far back june and overturn them with simple 
majority review must occur largely within the first days new congress president 
obama was very active the last six months his administration for instance the 
senate energy committee has over rules review the first days 
and likely overturning many covering methane emissions caf standards carbon 
considerations this unprecedented volume reviews and will consume significant 
time and energy 
other both keystone assuming reapply and dapl despite last hours 
administration eis are likely approved would expect revisions the 
administrative procedures act early potentially limit future federal agency 
creep and power expansion overall expect less regulatory burden epa 
department interior department energy and other federal agencies yet hard 
quantify specific impact 
border adjustment import tax 
the border adjustment provision that associated with the republican plan 
reduce the corporate tax rate believe corporate tax reform priority 
for the incoming trump presidental administration and with newly elected republican 
and house majorities believe there high likelihood tax reform passage the 
border adjustment becoming more broadly debated and unclear this feature 
its current form will enacted june the house gop proposed its tax 
reform blueprint better way convert the corporate income tax into 
destination based cash flow taxation system where the tax jurisdiction follows the 
location consumption rather than the location production eliminate the 
self imposed export penalty and import subsidy given many its trading partners that 
have value added taxes vats place 
achieve this border adjustment proposed that excludes exports from tax and 
disallows deductions for the cost imports the intent this adjustment combined 
with the lowering corporate taxes from and switching the worldwide 
tax approach territorial system attract domestic investment and halt reverse 
the trend american business moving overseas theorized that the policy trade 
neutral the usd should appreciate offset the border adjustment 
credit exports and corresponding disallowance for import deductions absent full 
foreign exchange offset border adjustability would benefit net exporters and hinder net 
importers retailers and multinationals with international supply chains are particularly 
exposed

what are the potential consequences for energy 
higher domestic crude prices and potentially invert the brent wti spread the 
currently imports mmbpd oil almost all imported refiners who import 
foreign crude for feedstock domestic barrels would have higher value the refiner 
than imported barrels and exported barrels would have more value the producer 
differing amounts the effective tax difference believe there are two ways that 
the value could arbitrage producer exporting the domestic barrel exploit 
the lower tax rate exports largely applies majors the refiner running 
more domestic crudes the expense imports due the tax difference believe 
the range that domestic crude price need move close the arb ranges 
bbl relative international prices with the range reflecting whether the refiner 
imports crude feedstock export product see exhibit below 
the proposed border adjusted tax policy passes believe refiners would 
incentivized shift towards using much domestic crude possible avoid losing 
the tax deductibility feedstock costs holding all else equal estimate domestic 
crude prices would need increase much bbl the point refiners are 
agnostic between using domestic oil imported oil arb closes refiners are also 
incentivized sell product overseas much possible given export revenue will not 
taxable such the high end the aforementioned range potential domestic 
crude movement bbl represents the incremental higher domestic feedstock 
cost exporting refiners will tolerate before the arb closes the end expect some 
sharing this margin between upstream and downstream with the low end 
representing the likely maximum appreciation our view today wti price

the potential net benefit the producer more complicated yet for tax paying 
producer major estimate bbl benefit exporting the reason the benefit 
lower because deductions remain for the exported barrel loe and transportation 
costs other markets bbl for instance gom barrel sold bbl with 
operating cost would worth bbl bbl transport more export 
than domestic sale most are not tax payers given capex spend yet majors are 
and would balancing mechanism the arbitrage also volumetrically limited the 
ability back out imported light crudes currently the ability the existing 
refining system further tilt lighter crude slate given economic incentive and 
lastly production tax paying producers ultimately once all levers are 
maximized crude the premium domestic crudes ends 
higher gasoline prices and potentially higher cracks anticipate the relative higher 
level feedstock cost will eventually passed through the consumer the 
form higher product prices gasoline distillate etc mathematically hold 
refining crack constant increase feed stock cost would translate 
increase product prices hold the crack constant today gasoline and diesel 
prices this translates increase gallon furthermore believe there the 
potential will see higher overall cracks margin product imports are disincentivized 
and refiners will export much possible given the economic benefit drawing down 
domestic product inventories expect higher exports ultimately offset the 
decrease domestic demand from higher prices yet also put downward pressure 
global cracks with higher net supply case for even higher cracks could the 
imported barrel with lower margin sets the price for products

higher activity estimate that bbl increase wti rounded for 
illustrative purposes would accelerate production growth the 
first full year after being implemented our estimate conservatively based 
managements sticking the same level percentage outspend under both base case 
strip and border tax scenarios see further upside volumes higher crude price 
environment improves availability funding beyond that generated organically via 
more even more receptive equity and asset markets accelerated activity should 
flow through greater oil field services demand lifting land drilling day rates 
and pressure pumping prices top the base case strip escalation 
our numbers higher production growth turn should incrementally loosen global 
crude supply demand exerting bearish pressure pricing yet discussion these 
second order implications beyond the scope this note addition expect these 
moderate given the tightness crude balance see for dearth fids 
during downcycle begins reflected offshore production and the market ability 
absorb annual production increases out the during the prior 
upcycle 
inland differentials are likely expand over the long run with higher domestic crude 
prices would anticipate increase activity highlight the permian bakken

the company level could see some negative impact oil price realizations 
relative wti are forced resort trucking oil where gathering not yet 
place most likely the permian and stack however also believe infrastructure 
solutions are easier texas especially with new administration may also see 
widening and more volatile canadian crude differentials are focused wcs and 
sco here refiners shift preference domestic crude sources much they can 
particularly light crude and the return crude production growth combined with 
continued climbing canadian volumes cause takeaway concerns canada reemerge 
canadian crudes are largely price takers would expect downward price action 
clear the markets with canadian light streams potentially being more disadvantaged 
than heavy streams also expect canadian natural gas prices aeco face 
headwinds with wider basis becomes incrementally less competitive 
domestic natural gas production particularly the eastern market chicago dawn 
where already facing market share competition from the marcellus and utica 
usd expected rise but not enough completely neutralize impact our 
strategists believe the border adjustment would likely cause large usd appreciation 
reasonable their view but unlikely fully offset the effects the border 
adjustability provision textbook model would say that usd would immediately 
appreciate offset the full effects border adjustment economically similar 
export subsidy combined with import tariff however the empirical 
breakdown purchasing power parity ppp the short run global supply chains and 
concerns about sharp wto led response will likely limit full usd offset please see

refining impact would less severe than first appears with 
many net beneficiaries 
anticipate for the proposal act near term overhang for refiners until 
there clarity the border adjustment tax proposal has created concern for the 
refining industry many refiners rely imported crude feedstock and the proposed 
policy would remove the ability for the cost those barrels deducted when 
calculating taxable income making those barrels incrementally more expensive pbf 
mpc and psx import the most relative operations our coverage exhibit 
however believe the ultimate impact would not bad first seems 
think there could some potential negative impact the initial adjustment period 
the proposal put place the short term refiners would likely shift towards using 
domestic crude much possible avoid losing the tax deductility feedstock 
costs believe this would bid domestic crude prices the point where refiners are 
agnostic between domestic and imported oil anticipate the higher absolute level 
cost will eventually passed through the consumer the form higher product 
prices gasoline distillate etc mathematically for brent based crack bbl increase crude prices translates gallon increase gas prices holding 
all else equal our view the two determining factors how much refining margins 
would impacted during the transitionary period the time takes for product 
prices correct the new equilibrium the faster the response the less squeeze for 
refiners one may argue this could happen immediately given its policy driven change 
and not gradual market evolution and the product price response not 
immediate the amount and time refiner can shift towards domestic source the 
interim expect more complex refiners less nimble shifting away from 
heavy slates run less optimally the long run higher product prices may have 
negative impact demand which would met with overall lower refining utilization 
rates 
and likely net positive for select few believe the policy proposal exempt 
taxation export revenues would highly incentivize refiners sell their products 
offshore the economics provide strong offset the loss tax deductibility 
imported feedstock and some cases net benefit estimate psx can export 
its production vlo can export with plans increase 
although timing unclear and mpc can export with plans increase this 
exhibit see exhibit the economic advantage exporting 
provides broadly speaking estimate for every barrels crude refiner imports 
they can offset the higher feedstock stock exporting barrels product holding 
all else equal exhibit estimate the potential net effect the border 
adjustability tax policy for each company with their current import trends and known 
export capacity holding all pricing constant and not accounting for the ability shift 
alternate crude sources see psx and vlo potentially experiencing net benefit 
given their respective ability export meaningful amount products pbf tso and 
hfc would face the greatest headwinds given their limited ability export and relative 
use imported crude although higher pricing for imported products may provide 
additional margin cushion offset exhibit layer the impact the proposed 
lower corporate tax and see that when combined and holding all else equal the 
majority refiners would largely come out ahead with these two new tax proposals 
from broader market basis believe the increased incentive export products 
combined with less product being imported into the more expensive would likely 
lead the drawing down domestic product inventories providing offset the 
aforementioned risk domestic demand decrease 
wider differentials over time may emerge with higher domestic crude prices higher 
domestic crude prices may induce production growth leading the potential wider 
inland crude differentials permian and bakken benefiting refiners that are the 
position capture the wider margin while the widening many domestic crude 
differentials should benefit inland refiners are cognizant that the sweet sour 
differential could narrow due the higher level production sweet when opec 
production sour expected decline thus for refiners like mpc who generally run 
meaningful amount sour crude could see less margin capture for the barrels they 
are unable shift domestic source 
impact refining stocks the tax change does happen believe pbf would 
the most vulnerable the potential negative impacts the border adjustment tax 
alone given its merchant refining structure high weight the refining business exhibit 
reliance imported crude feedstock and limited ability currently export product 
although the company looking increasing this side the business already and the 
higher cost import product may provide some margin cushion offset believe 
psx and vlo both potentially may see net benefit given their abilities export 
companies with more diversified business structures would also have less concentration 
risk while the ones with strong mlp midstream exposure would benefit from the higher 
upstream activity and production the long run mpc wnr and unrelated this 
note regulatory changes also expect rfs would provide some positive benefits

crude production mmpbd and its natural gas production bcf into the

through their fixed cost business with every bbl translating into 
additional cash flow paa and kmi would our two picks for playing the potential for 
border tax 
impacts are likely complex and iterative main impact would crude pipelines 
from the basins mentioned that would benefit moving forward volume growth into 
their systems crude pipeline firms that come quickly mind include paa pagp eep

amount additional volume carried for domestic customers would equate the 
amount crude inputs that could shift domestically from heavy light sour sweet

analysis quickly gets considerations light crude export markets most analysis 
assumes higher domestic prices result border tax though there could also
