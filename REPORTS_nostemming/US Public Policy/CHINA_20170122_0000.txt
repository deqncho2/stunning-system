rates following the recent rebound which could lead some renewed nim pressures 
for china banks also the progress the cleanup financial market leverage might 
postponed somewhat 
would not expect monetary policy swing toward over loosening industrial fai 
growth remains lower than gdp growth which would support industrial sector profits 
even the event tariff hike 
however policy makers may choose keep rates low support more stable domestic 
demand that case our macro team estimates that gdp growth would lower 
the imposed tariff which would lead lower demand and lower inflation 
expectations 
addition lower gdp growth the scenario tariff hike would lead slower
