large cap multinationals but like pep with oversold growth

compelling yet despite the sharp recent pullback the group however within 
the group prefer the beverage sector household products attribute 
recent staples underperformance higher interest rates which have removed 
valuation support investors shift into more discretionary sectors with 
potential fiscal stimulus sectors that now have less regulatory risk 
financials health care and the negative impact stronger dollar the

are also positive estee lauder the stock has sold off post weak topline 
results and fears over whether the company can meet its topline target however

the company can achieve albeit below the company guidance believe the

wtw three key geographic markets the germany also view wtw 
longer term guidance and consensus too high through last while potential tax

staples still viewed unattractive despite the post election sell off following the 
recent underperformance consumer staples for the xlp 
the weeks since the november election sentiment appears generally still 
cautious the sector light fundamental headwinds from weak organic sales 
growth with soft trends emerging markets given weak macros and muted growth 
with higher promotion usd strength and sector rotation away from the staples sector 
given higher interest rates and potential fiscal stimulus which should benefit more 
discretionary sectors specifically respondents our recent survey view 
the sector very somewhat unattractive nearly double the respondents who 
view the sector attractive although the net negative positive skew slightly 
lower and more positive than last year agree with this cautious viewpoint given 
weak underlying fundamentals and the potential for negative near term eps revisions 
across the sector with our estimates below consensus for the next fiscal year most 
our coverage universe addition valuation does not look compelling yet with staples 
valuation merely close longer term averages the although actually still 
slightly above long term averages our belief that staples consensus estimates are too 
high and consensus estimates are too low with fiscal stimulus valid

key point staples group not attractive despite pullback 
prefer beverages hpc 
staples group does not look compelling here 
post the election donald trump the staples group has substantially underperformed 
the with the xlp off increase making one the 
worst performing sectors attribute this higher interest rates which has removed 
valuation support for staples investor interest more discretionary sectors with 
potential fiscal stimulus sectors that now have less regulatory risk and the 
impact stronger dollar the multinational staples group post this group 
underperformance are getting more questions the staples group attractive 
here our answer for three primary reasons the staples group underperformance since trump election looks appropriate based the move interest 
rates highlight below underlying staples fundamentals remain weak with 
muted organic sales growth emerging markets with weak macros and softer 
developed market trends the promotional environment ramps particularly the 
expect weak organic sales across most our group given these factors with 
reported eps downside topline weakness margin pressure with greater competitive 
spending and pressure still don view valuation attractive here post the 
staples group pullback while the surface looks like staples valuation now equal 
its relative valuation its year history the using consensus estimates 
would note that consensus looks too high about three quarter our 
staples coverage and consensus estimates are likely low fiscal stimulus 
drives improved economy thus staples valuation still does not look compelling 
exhibit consumer staples sector has been one the worst performing sectors since the 
election 
source thomson reuters morgan stanley research 
key point staples sell off post election higher rates looks reasonable 
staples valuations have experienced sharp contraction from peak levels post trump 
election reflecting both short term cyclical rotation and expectation longer term 
outflows rising rate environment consumer staples stocks rated significantly 
over the past decade with ntm valuations expanding from trough levels 
late july despite emerging headwinds secular growth valuation 
had been driven number factors both macro the rotation toward staples 
bond proxy light low interest rates fundamental increased focus cost 
efficiency and strategic increasing and portfolio restructuring however since the 
presidential election staples stocks experienced sharp sell off with the sector 
underperforming the bps due cyclical rotation out higher dividend 
rate sensitive sectors response the steepening yield curve staples and utilities 
have been the two worst performing sectors following this sell off staples 
has contracted from prior the election and now trading line with 
its year historical premium the 
our key point this initial move consistent with the sector historical correlation 
with treasury yields and appears have appropriately priced expectations for 
rate increases staples relative valuation the during the past three years 
has been strongly correlated treasury yields correlation the sector 
viewed bond proxy particular over the last five years staples offered average 
dividend yield representing bps spread the year treasury yield the 
combination low interest rates staples activity and pervasive self help 
initiatives contributed the sector reaching peak relative valuation the 
mid premium the historical average when analyzing the 
historical correlation the sector sell off the last month consistent with the 
bps move the year treasury yield meaning the valuation compression 
appropriate based recent sector correlations said another way staples current 
relative valuation essentially consistent with levels implied historical regression 
versus treasury yields

key point estimating the potential impact possible tax 
reform staples 
note the section below largely drawn from our recent note can tax reform make 
staples great again 
following the november elections with the victory donald trump and the 
republican party success maintaining majorities both the house and senate many 
policy experts expect broad based corporate tax reform likely become 
effective starting calendar year tax reform likely happen the key 
question what kind tax reform there are currently two concrete proposals 
donald trump proposal which ran his campaign and the ryan brady 
house gop blueprint the called better way our vision for confident 
america published june the following section examine the key points 
each plan 
donald trump plan while lacking many details donald trump website here 
includes some key points his business tax plan 
reduce the corporate tax rate from and eliminate the corporate 
alternative minimum tax rate 
deemed repatriation corporate profits held offshore one time tax rate 
eliminate most corporate tax expenditures except for the research and 
development credit 
firms engaged manufacturing the may elect expense capital investment 
and lose the deductibility corporate interest expense election once made can 
revoked only within the first years election revoked returns for prior 
years would need amended show revised status after years the election 
irrevocable 
note there border adjustability component trump plan his website 
despite his commentary advocating for tariffs penalties imports during his 
campaign trail 
the ryan brady blueprint june the gop under the initiative 
speaker the house paul ryan and rep kevin brady published the tax blueprint 
called better way our vision for confident america the document lays out the 
following proposals 
reduce the corporate tax rate from and eliminate the corporate 
alternative minimum tax rate 
deemed repatriation corporate profits held offshore accumulated foreign 
earnings will subject tax the extent held cash cash 
equivalents and otherwise will subject tax 
the immediate deductibility capital expenditures 
eliminate deductibility net interest expense 
net operating losses nols will allowed carried forward indefinitely and 
will increased interest factor that compensates for inflation and real 
return capital maintain the value amounts that are carried forward 
preserve the last first out lifo method accounting 
move toward destination basis tax system territorial tax system under 
destination basis approach tax jurisdiction follows the location consumption 
rather than the location production 
the gop proposal would introduce border adjustments way pay for the 
proposed reduction tax rates the proposal would exclude imports from 
deductible expenses the expense side and would exclude export sales from 
taxable income the revenue side 
assuming the gop proposal the base case given that it the most articulated plan 
view the likelihood each the key points follows 
lowering the corporate tax rate from the current assign high 
probability lower corporate tax rate given the republican party united 
this front and there broad based support across the business and political 
community terms the rate assuming political compromises see range 
most likely use our base case 
eliminating the deductibility interest expenses believe there high 
chance this proposal implemented way fund the lower 
corporate tax rate even introduced expect phase period measure 
apply the provision prospective debt assign low probability the removal 
interest expense deductibility immediately general expect budget deficits 
fund most the tax policy changes but believe there needs some 
offset sell the plan not fiscally irresponsible interest deductibility our 
minds the most likely funding mechanism for the tax policy changes 
allowing repatriation foreign profits after one time tax assign high 
probability this measure given broad based support and because many 
constituencies would benefit this scenario the implementation would benefit 
corporations which could bring back cash the well the government 
which would benefit from the one time tax way fund the lower 
corporate tax rate the labor market would also benefit from more 
investment 
introduction border adjustments see this wild card with lower 
probability only for the reasons described below 
summarize our base case tax reform expectation includes lower corporate tax 
rate financed repatriation foreign profits after one time tax the 
removal interest rate deductibility with phase period and increase the 
budget deficit also expect the immediate expensing capital expenditure although 
believe this topic will less relevant the consumer staples group 
terms the border adjustability proposal which included the ryan brady 
blueprint better way our vision for confident america there are few key 
reasons why the tax could occur but also many reasons our base case expectation for 
fairly low probability the measure being implemented 
the favorable side the implementation border tax should taken seriously 
given currently the brady ryan blueprint proposal and republicans 
control the house senate presidency would like implement some type policy 
boost manufacturing 
however still see only probability the border adjustability proposal 
ultimately occurring for the following reasons limiting concerns 
higher prices consumers most retailers and some other industries have 
substantial mix imported products under which prices would increase under 
this plan likely resulting much higher prices consumers and regressive tax 
strong opposition from large part the business community particularly 
retailers and net importers the reported the wall street journal link 
david french senior vice president for government relations the national retail 
federation stated that retailers are very concerned about practical effect the 
border adjustment provision profits jobs and operation addition philip 
ellender president government and public affairs for koch companies public 
sector llc issued statement december link saying the proposed border 
tax adjustment will distort the market increase consumer prices and create 
uneven playing field for companies and consumers alike and adding the long term 
consequences the economy and the american consumer could devastating 
the transition period would extremely complex and costly implement 
changes the manufacturing base could staggering companies have set 
their manufacturing base for decades much different system 
potential international repercussion from other countries which could perceive 
the measures tariff their exports response could mostly negate the aim 
the plan boost manufacturing 
violation wto regulations which could require the exit the wto the 
wto generally allows consumption based taxes indirect taxes border 
adjusted but does not allow income based taxes border adjusted 
result corporate tax system even post the gop proposed changes likely not 
eligible for border adjustment treatment according current wto rules 
adjustment rates economic theory would indicate that exchange rates will 
adjust for the tax policy change potentially negating the impact 
manufacturing 
the lack concrete proposal for how treat border adjustments for financial 
institutions the business model most financial institutions based the free 
flow capital therefore introducting border adjustments cross border 
financial transactions could put jeopardy the entire financial services business 
model but the same time excluding the financial sector could viewed 
preferential treatment currently there has not been concrete proposal how 
the border adjustment provision would apply financial institutions 
the provision would subsidize pure manufacturers putting them 
perpetual loss position for tax purposes the provision combined with the gop 
proposal carry forward nols indefinitely and increase them interest 
factor would imply that pure domestic manufacturers would never have pay 
taxes 
who benefits from tax reform 
the sector level tax reform particularly important the consumer space given 
staples companies average enjoy relatively few tax breaks today and therefore 
should benefit more relative basis from reduced corporate rate other 
sectors

potential impact changes interest deductibility 
under the gop tax reform companies would not allowed deduct interest 
expenses for tax purposes providing important source revenue generation help 
partially offset the higher deficit associated with lower corporate tax rates importantly 
existing republican tax plans have generally indicated that such change would 
phased over much years and would apply all debt not only prospective 
debt however for simplicity sake have assumed all once impact across our 
respective coverages this would disproportionally hurt highly levered companies our 
coverage such wtw with net debt ebitda 
believe limitation interest deductibility may pursued any reform scenario 
lower tax rate needs funded partially order argue some fiscal discipline 
even though assume budget deficits increase interest deductibility the third 
largest corporate deduction after wages and cost sales billion irs soi tax 
stats corporation complete report further policymakers both sides the 
aisle perceive the code favoring debt financed investment over equity financed 
investment due the deductibility interest but not dividends 
important note this change will likely phased the last major tax overhaul 
the tax reform act contained over special transitions rules many industryand even firm specific for instance perhaps can take cue from the proposed 
american business competitiveness act sponsored devin nunes who 
member the ways and means committee and serves president elect trump

repatriation foreign profits 
donald trump has proposed one time deemed repatriation accumulated deferred 
foreign income tax rate contrast the house gop blueprint advocates onetime deemed repatriation with differential rates for cash and noncash assets 
which could paid ratably over eight years the taxpayer election thus 
looked percentage cash held outside the per disclosures identify 
companies that would most benefit from repatriation foreign cash 
within beverage and hpc companies general carry significant their total cash

border adjustments 
believe the largest wild card the house republican tax plan the called 
border adjustment mechanism the proposal would exclude imports from deductible 
expenses the expense side and would exclude export sales from taxable income 
the revenue side note that imports would not limited physical imports but 
would include any purchase from person entity outside the companies 
paying royalties foreign subsidiaries while the exact mechanics the proposal have 
not been explained yet clear that companies who are net importers the would 
disproportionally hit significantly border adjustment overall think the 
proposal wild card the gop tax reform and think the chances border 
adjustment pass are the range 
border adjustability vat 
most the united states major trading partners utilize vat systems generate 
revenue addition direct taxes such corporate and personal income taxes vat 
tax indirect tax similar national sales consumption tax and thus ultimately 
paid the consumer the taxing jurisdiction the vat tax accrues each stage the 
production process and function input costs less sales price times the vat tax 
rate vat taxes are designed tax consumption within taxing jurisdiction they are 
generally border adjustable for goods imported and exported that means exporters 
receive rebate for any vat taxes incurred their production process while 
corresponding vat tax levied all imported goods and services 
the key feature the gop tax reform blueprint radically transform the current 
business taxation system destination based cash flow system with border 
adjustability 
destination system the proposal seeks locate the tax incidence the place 
consumption sense converting the business income tax system into 
synthetic consumption tax 
cash flow based system the proposal would remove many the accrual 
accounting structures today code such amortization capital investment 
and would also eliminate most taxation from financing flows this why the house 
blueprint requires immediate capital investment deductions and the near 
elimination interest deductibility 
the gop blueprint clearly states that the proposed system not vat but 
structurally very similar subtraction based vat system the blueprint proposes 
apply border adjustability the destination based cash flow system 
not taxing the value exported goods and services including intangible rights and 
property 
disallowing deductions for any imported good service including intangible rights 
and property 
the system would apply both foreign and domestic taxpayers thus 
multinationals with international supply chains would incur tax importing goods 
and services into united states this includes rights and fees paid foreign subsidiaries 
that control intellectual property for instance 
who would most impacted 
beverages hpc see the highest risk stz given their beer portfolio 
ballast point imported from mexico beer total profit with largely 
fixed manufacturing base due the nature the product mexican imports must 
produced mexico also see risk nwl and elf given both companies 
revenue stream supported imported products almost all elf and 
nwl however risk here mitigated partially given their imported products are 
largely sourced through third parties almost all elf nwl and thus each 
company could reconfigure much their footprint third parties fairly easily 
although this would higher cost the biggest potential beneficiaries our coverage 
include bfb with jack daniel total volume production and other smaller 
brands woodford reserve occurring the and exported internationally slightly 
offset imported vodka and tequila epc should also benefit given believe they 
are net exporter products outside the with their razor blades and feminine 
care manufacturing base used supply international markets 
net are not overly concerned the border adjustability proposal given the low 
probability ultimately occurring and that the stocks seemed have already more 
than adjusted the probability implementation addition stz case pricing 
power could negate much the pressure from border adjustments and nwl and elf 
could reconfigure third party manufacturing mitigate much but certainly not all 
the impact 
mapping out the border adjustability impact stz start caveat our stz 
analysis below given few public details how the concept border adjustability 
would implemented practically speaking let alone the question would 
included any sort tax reform package nonetheless assuming implemented 
base case scenario see more modest eps impact our fiscal eps 
estimate eps impact bear case scenario the three key drivers

either the profit dollar the profit margin from stz price increase our analysis

eps tailwind our base case assumes price increase which would boost eps 
regarding elasticity note that based monthly scanner data for stz beer

the change volume evidenced squared correlation coefficient 
however this situation would unique given the magnitude the step change
