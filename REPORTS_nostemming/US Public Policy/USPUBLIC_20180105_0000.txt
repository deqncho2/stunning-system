slimmer majority looming elections limit legislative 
potential even progress doesn materialize the debate 
impacts investors setting the stakes for midterms the 
policy path further near term catalysts exist 
regulation trade where the president has discretion 
for investors the policy outlook more about 
defining and reacting the post midterms policy 
path its potential impacts the economy key 
sectors the republican agenda features both fiscally 
expansionary infrastructure and contractionary 
entitlement reform policies have low 
expectations for implementing that agenda 
substantial way this year however the debate about 
those policies and the outcome the midterm elections could tell lot about 
the policy path and how may affect the economy and investors given 
the forward looking nature markets must therefore watch and study 
these policies closely 
timing challenge busy congressional list ahead broader policy 
initiatives upon their return congress will need focus securing 
bipartisan spending cap deal funding appropriations beyond when 
current funding runs out january raising the debt limit negotiating 
daca fix before march reauthorizing chip fisa and the national flood 
insurance program 
fiscal policy neutral outlook given the push pull infrastructure 
entitlements expect investors will focus intently the economic 
implications infrastructure policy given the adminstration indication its 
size yet early details suggest much smaller fiscal package hence until 
have more information the incremental size and incentives the 
administration proposal think investors should not get too excited about its 
stimulus potential and political prospects fiscal enthusiasm should further 
tempered republicans appear gain momentum entitlement spending 
reform though skeptical this initiative will find sufficient political support 
ahead the midterms 
regulation benefits financials likely but most sectors will still wait our 
key observation remains unchanged while many sectors have potential positive 
catalysts the horizon pharma telecom power refining few are reliable

infrastructure elusive bipartisanship 
the administration has repeatedly said wants focus passing infrastructure bill 
the white house has announced plans release detailed legislative principles 
infrastructure investment early january serve building blocks for congress 
write infrastructure bill the hill but they have also increasingly 
mentioned other priorities mentioned further below 
president trump recently cited the deadly amtrak crash washington state all 
the more reason why must start immediately fixing the infrastructure the 
united states politico 
congress does decide pursue infrastructure bill would likely require least 
democratic votes the senate pass because both parties have interest 
improving infrastructure could secure bipartisan support however without plan 
details impossible know whether there could enough votes given 
disagreements within and across party lines 
hence our base case that will not see stimulative infrastructure plan ahead 
the midterm elections consider the following 
reconciliation insufficient vehicle for infrastructure spending meaning 
democratic votes are needed unlike tax reform the reconciliation process doesn 
offer capacity achieve the broad goals the white house infrastructure bill 
because reconciliation cannot used raise the level spending above 
budgetary caps hence cover the reported outlay from the program 
reconciliation would require spending cuts this would quite difficult given 
republicans own internal disagreement the level and makeup 
medicare medicaid reform further several potential infrastructure items may not 
comply with the byrd rule particularly they are aimed changing the regulatory 
environment around infrastructure spending finally using reconciliation would 
require passing budget resolution easy feat given disagreements 
among republicans budget priorities 
democratic votes may harder acquire than seems disagreements the 
details infrastructure package can run along party lines democrats want 
preserve davis bacon labor protections and environmental protections cut 
across them reflecting urban rural divide rural states are wary publicprivate partnership model because their projects not have easy revenue 
stream and cities are eager for transit investment financing the program another 
challenge democrats are unlikely want cut existing federal spending while 
republicans are unlikely raise the gas tax although the administration has 
signaled its support for raising 
republicans have their own internal challenge the return the deficit hawks 
while deficit hawks the house and senate agreed increase the deficit 
cutting taxes those same hawks are often opposed increases government 
spending not paid for other cuts consider senator rand paul recent defense 
this tax reform vote citing that tax cuts people keeping more their 
money are never the problem the problem spending when comes 
reducing the deficit senator rand paul twitter hence possible view 
passing tax reform exacerbating the issue taking away the option use the 
gains from taxing repatriated earnings pay for infrastructure senate majority 
leader mitch mcconnell has said wants avoid trillion dollar stimulus 
huffington post and other republican members congress have said 
that with raising the gas tax being nonstarter for many republicans payfors will 
real challenge the hill 
not clear the policy would stimulus this point may easily cleared 
when detailed plan released but for now based what been reported there 
are some important questions that need answering before able judge 
whether the infrastructure proposal could meaningful stimulus and market 
catalyst while the white house plan reported infrastructure plan 
worth noting that the federal outlay reportedly envisioned that plan 
over years politico addition that funding appears 
triggered only when there state local and private partner working with the 
federal government covering roughly the cost providing the remaining 
bloomberg that leaves with two important questions 
the federal outlay replacing top existing programs the 
government already has similar programs and this policy simply their reengineering 
then the near term economic implications may minor 
what conditions will the federal government put this money reportedly the 
white house wants shift responsibility for infrastructure funding state and local 
authorities incentivizing utilizing sustainable funding sources bloomberg this 
would also theory get more infrastructure built establishing new increased 
funding sources yet the plan contains too many conditions may lead 
underwhelming adoption this program state elected officials and their voters may 
want preserve their own flexibility about tolls and fees rather than risk the 
unpopularity pre set fee increases and choose through muni market other 
financing 
can congress must list become vehicle for incremental 
spending 
upon return congress will immediately turn their list must items 
first the list negotiating overall cap levels for defense and non defense 
spending and then extending the current continuing resolution past its current 
expiration date january allow the appropriations committees time 
write appropriations bills match the spending levels congress then needs 
pass those appropriations bills and likely start the process over again for 
addition congress needs raise the debt ceiling determine daca fix that 
program expiration march reauthorize chip fisa and the national flood 
insurance program all this needs done through bipartisan negotiation 
with democrats 
republican leadership could they wanted secure infrastructure win before 
the midterms negotiate increase infrastructure spending rider any 
these other bills imagine this would smaller number and not extending 
past one two years but there opportunity see some increased spending 
for infrastructure these deals are negotiated 
entitlement reform fiscal contraction abstraction 
while specific proposal available the president and republican leaders have 
pointed entitlement reform priority because policy changes are not allowed 
under reconciliation true reform would likely require regular order simple program 
cuts could accomplished under reconciliation under budget resolution but 
would likely politically challenging before the midterms 
the wall street journal reported trump has repeatedly said interested 
kick starting debate around means testing social programs with allies seeing 
significant political rewards from taking the issue even without clear cut goal 
wall street journal 
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said the administration will 
provide details its plans overhaul welfare the first few weeks 
reuters 
paul winfree former white house domestic policy council deputy director said 
draft executive order has been prepared for president trump sign laying out 
broad principles for overhaul some all the dozens federal assistance 
programs both sending message federal agencies change regulations and 
capitol hill undertake legislative changes wall street journal 
speaker paul ryan said wanted tackle entitlement reform next year with 
focus the health care entitlements and also work changing the welfare 
system house ways and means chairman kevin brady also said that welfare 
reform was next the hill 
such efforts executed would appear fiscally contractionary cutting against 
the deficit expansion the recently completed tax reform and contrasting with 
infrastructure policy initiatives yet think the risk will remain the abstract for 
consider 
true reform would require regular order and spending cuts would difficult 
election year 
the proposed cuts medicaid the american health care act ahca were 
large part why that bill did not pass the senate even though only required 
votes therefore think republicans would have similar difficulties passing cuts 
federal health programs especially election year and they needed 
democratic votes 
democrats oppose changes eligibility pointing out that welfare already has work 
requirements and that exceptions those are usually for the elderly disabled and 
children wall street journal 
even more targeted reform perhaps more stringent work requirements for 
snap tanf were somehow adopted acquiring democratic votes enable this 
would probably limit potential reduction dollars the program 
welfare reform entitlement reform they are very different 
undertakings 
with detailed plan yet available not know the president and members 
congress are referring changes the multiple assistance programs that are 
commonly referred welfare temporary assistance needy families 
tanf supplemental nutritional assistance program snap known food 
stamps low income home energy assistance program liheap winter heating 
assistance etc which have different requirements and are run different 
federal and state agencies the administration could make progress through 
the rulemaking process specifically allowing individual states make changes 
requirements those changes are allowed under existing law but the 
legislative path more uncertain for example snap authorized through the 
farm bill and often paired with farm subsidies political calculus ensure 
that neither one those programs eliminated states cities that not 
value the programs would welfare reform upset that careful balance 
unclear and points the complexity these programs 
the other hand reform entitlements social security medicare and 
medicaid notoriously hard accomplish because the political importance 
those programs especially election year social security cannot 
changed reconciliation and medicare has already gone through changes 
part the affordable care act and mentioned above medicaid survived 
potential cuts earlier this year would tough political lift address those 
health care trouble with the vote count 
the president has also mentioned that wants congress revisit health care 
when the individual mandate being repealed that means obamacare being 
repealed have essentially repealed obamacare and will come with 
something much better president trump during cabinet meeting after the tax 
bill passed the hill 
submitting plans healthcare plans infrastructure and plans 
welfare reform which desperately needed this country soon after taxes the 
president said november reuters 
however think full repeal and replace unlikely consider 
january the senate republicans lose seat their majority doug jones 
alabama meaning they can only lose two republicans the vice president would 
the tiebreaker all votes and they lost the ahca vote vulnerable house 
republicans will also find tough vote for election year given the 
unpopularity the ahca 
the tax cut and jobs act repealed the individual mandate this both changes the 
make any potential legislation losing potential payfor and means that 
republicans may more likely declare victory dismantling large part 
the affordable care act aca and not need revisit 
bipartisan coalition urging congress pass the alexander murray bill which 
would fund the csr cost sharing reduction payments for insurance companies for 
two years and make other changes the aca again congress able pass 
this bill could declared enough victory not need revisit repeal and 
replace then again the house may not able pass alexander murray due 
conservative opposition 
the president may also choose fall back the logic that the aca was 
effectively repealed part tax reform which rescinded the individual mandate 
starting previewed this logic after tax reform was passed saying 
when the individual mandate being repealed that means obamacare being 
repealed the hill

midterm elections impact thought exercise divided 
government 
key takeaways 
while too early predict with any certainty seems that favorable 
environment could developing for democrats prospects the midterms 
and hence increases the possibility divided government outcome 
our early read that divided government would likely mean gridlock but 
keeps the door open for fiscal expansion 
republicans maintain control both houses congress policy progress 
more possible but less predictable and potentially neutral given that the 
republicans stated agenda has mix initiatives that our view could 
create both fiscal easing and contraction 
trade and regulatory themes should less affected given executive 
discretion these areas 
although key markets could react fiscal expansion themes polls 
continue favor democrats reserve judgment until have polling and 
platform data which judge the policy and political efficacy such 
efforts 
midterm elections will held tuesday november but because election cycles 
start with primaries the spring texas and illinois have primaries march and many 
other states follow may and june and many races will hotly contested the 
election season will last for most the year while too early for precise predictions 
experts have outlined the following early takeaways which appear favor divided 
government outcome

the popular vote points take control the house and larry sabato the

thought exercise what would democratic congress mean for 
the legislative agenda 
too early tell what the election season will focus and therefore what kind 
mandate either republicans democrats will claim when they enter the 
congress much this will depend the tenor the election the agenda each party 
runs and the need react unforeseen issues and there always chance that 
the election not about issues all but instead could simply seen referendum 
the president and administration 
caveats aside hypothesize about what various election outcomes might mean for 
the policy agenda this may useful explaining how politics may influence 
markets throughout certain electoral outcomes more less likely the year 
progresses 
republicans hold the line this scenario electoral maps and lower number 
contested senate races provide enough advantage offset the president 
lackluster approval ratings republicans then signal intent continue their 
work infrastructure and entitlement reform this holds the potential 
both substantial fiscal contraction entitlement reform and expansion 
infrastructure but also potential net neutral impact hence lean against 
the suggestion that there could big market swings either direction 
higher lower ust yields fiscal expansion contraction themes 
democratic gridlock this scenario democrats are able gain control least 
one chamber but the white house and congress remain entrenched positions 
the result substantive legislative progress similar divided government 
outcomes the later obama and bush years 
democratic detente this scenario democrats gain control least one 
chamber and find perhaps surprisingly white house willing negotiate key 
policy details that enable forward movement issues broad bipartisan 
agreement the most likely candidate infrastructure spending which then gets 
real bipartisan effort 
democratic win would likely take prospective spending cuts off the table while 
keeping hopes fiscal expansion alive however wouldn yet get optimistic about 
fiscal expansion for one there too much time left and not yet enough data 
feel confident about democratic win second far too early tell how treat the 
probability fiscal expansion hopes based democratic win and therefore how 
guide investors data come early this year supporting such outcome expect 
able provide more specific guidance the year progresses both parties outline 
their platforms and can assess the political viability and policy efficacy each

can the lame duck fiscal game changer doubt but 
watch the budget process 
one increasingly common question from clients whether not aspects the 
current legislative agenda could enacted toward the end democrats 
win control one chamber congress the theory that republicancontrolled congress could rush finish work more partisan policy measures 
like entitlement cuts lame duck session november december ahead 
ceding control january 
can offer specific insight into how likely this besides noting that likely 
only possibility enabling legislation for using budget reconciliation already 
place before the election said differently only entertain the notion that 
major legislative change fiscal otherwise could pushed through 
republicans have already readied budget resolution that has clear party 
support and includes the relevant reconciliation instructions
