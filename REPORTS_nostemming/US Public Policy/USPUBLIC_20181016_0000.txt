implications waning odds blue sweep 
our last update midterms what goes blue september explored 
the implications lue sweep which while remaining unlikely was rising 
probability however recent weeks weaker polls for democrats senate races 
suggest the lue sweep has become less likely consider 
the five thirty eight senate model showed chance the republicans 
winning the senate september and now shows chance 
predictwise probability democrats winning the senate decreased from 
september currently 
the other hand according five thirty eight republicans chances winning 
the house have decreased since published grading the midterms september 
the probability currently 
this drives two practical implications for investors 
the base case divided government increasingly the most likely case with 
limited ramifications for markets weaker polling for democrats senate races 
shifts some the probability back the base case lue house democrats 
take control the house republicans keep control the senate detailed 
our note covering our investment framework for the election see grading the 
midterms expect this outcome would have the most limited impact for markets 
mostly holds the trajectory fiscal trade and regulatory policy the status 
quo 
get familiar with tax reform the fiscal expansion policy debate probably 
not going away based our conversations with clients investors have been more 
focused evaluating the lue sweep outcome this understandable given 
would represent the most substantial break with the current policy trajectory 
yet third party models suggest chance republicans maintain some level 
congressional control that suggests fiscal policy would remain key policy 
variable for markets while the most likely outcome argued fiscal 
expansion good gets for now lue house scenario yields fiscal stasis 
the red repeat republicans keep control both chambers outcome would 
open the door more tax cut stimulus

key fixed income market impacts 
key equity views 
source morgan stanley research five thirty eight the economist predictwise probabilities october 
why have republicans pulled ahead the senate race and not 
the house race 
margin for victory small that pulling ahead few key races makes 
difference 
when last published the five thirty eight probability democrats winning the 
senate was and today the probability what happened 
democrats standing the polls have decreased few key traditionally red states 
indiana missouri tennessee and north dakota but have improved purple blue 
states ohio florida arizona and new jersey the whole this means that democrats 
can longer win all the toss races win the majority they would also have 
pick least one the four races that they rate lean republican likely 
republican which looks increasingly out reach cook political report recently 
published senate rankings update that said two things are happening that often 
happen the final weeks election cycle few races become more competitive 
while others recede safer columns for the party holding the seats and because the 
margin the republicans hold over the democrats the senate small 
changes the close races can have large impact the overall odds 
very possible for the impact the supreme court confirmation play out 
differently the house races and senate races 
the question have heard most often from clients over the past two weeks what 
will the impact the supreme court nomination the midterms specifically for 
turnout each party there appears clear answer this question the polls and 
one may not appear before election day however concede that this issue may 
more acutely felt the race for senate control given the characteristics the seats 
contention all house seats are for reelection and many key vulnerable races for 
republicans exist traditionally democratic states districts which voted for 
democrats recent history addition the traditional swing districts however the 
senate the most vulnerable democratic seats are states that voted for president 
trump hence possible that the supreme court debate recent weeks 
could increase voter turnout both sides but with benefits accruing more 
democrats the house and republicans the senate 
key races watch 
appears that north dakota moving solidly into the republican column with recent 
polls showing heidi heitkamp challenger kevin cramer percentage points 
unclear whether this related her vote the supreme court nomination 
however heitkamp won very close race and personally popular the state 
polling starts move back toward the democrats this state could mean that the 
slight upswing momentum that published about three weeks ago could back 
also keeping eye texas cook political report still ranks the texas race 
toss but five thirty eight ranks lean republican and some recent polls have 
indicated that cruz ahead double digits but caution that all these races have 
their own dynamics and may not reflect broader trend 
positioning for red repeat 
for investors who want hedge against this outcome think the third party implied 
probabilities this outcome are too low consider the following positioning that could 
sensitive further shifts higher the probability red repeat 
long equity vol equities may initially rally tax fade due expected fed 
reaction while our initial framework characterized red repeat neutral 
outcome for the emphasize that there more nuanced reaction 
function this outcome increased probabilities thereof red repeat would 
bring expectations tax cut expansion that could support risk assets the near 
term particularly given recent price action and declines investor risk taking 
sentiment see bonds can diversify what can yet this outcome would 
probably reinforce the administration trade policy approach while putting 
pressure the fed shade more hawkish greater near term growth and 
inflation pressure resulting tightening would increase end cycle concerns 
undermining risk assets our cross asset team sees value positioning for such 
swings through being long equity vol per its cova methodology see what 
cheap and diversifies key risk earnings growth remain strong sustaining 
the rally for longer 
weakness the potential for stronger usd and increased leeway for further 
trade escalation would likely weigh risk appetite already cheap valuations 
would likely protect parts yet think asia would still risk due 
trade linkages and previous strong equity inflows our global strategy team 
suggests short krw sgd twd with php idr and inr also vulnerable the risk 
its negative view asia the event further trade escalation from the 
would greater willingness among governments asia broker deal swift 
deal would limit the weakness and potentially spark rally for local markets 
asia 
long ust ois any post election underperformance our view 
treasury market investors will focus whether tax has chance the next 
congress under red repeat think investors would expect higher deficits than 
before which could place mild degree upward pressure treasury yields 
could see yields rise maximum the intermediate sector the yield 
curve would likely underperform initially higher deficit expectations the 
weighted average supply increase would the sector our interest rates 
strategy team suggests fading that underperformance purchasing usts 
ois rates the reduction treasury supply expects due early end 
balance sheet normalization should more than reverse the move the main risk 
the trade would that the fed continues normalizing its balance sheet beyond 
red repeat key debates for investors 
below explore the key questions clients are asking about policy outcomes red 
repeat 
what the deficit treasury market impact expected from tax 
per the table below which created from the congressional budget office baseline 
scenario and its alternative fiscal scenario tax could add another about 
billion the cumulative year deficit gdp ratio per our analysis 
discussed academics and treasury issuance such increase the cumulative year 
deficit gdp ratio would worth longer dated forward treasury yields forward year yields 
the republicans kept control both the house and senate could see 
yields rise maximum with the intermediate sector the yield curve 
underperforming investors price more treasury supply the year sector the 
extent that investors already place some probability the republicans maintaining 
both the house and senate the movement higher yields would likely even less 
than likewise the democrats take control the house while the republicans 
maintain control the senate think yields would biased lower given that any 
probability investors placed the republicans maintaining control both houses 
would have taken zero

wouldn republican control actually mean fiscal contraction 
through entitlement reform 
our view don think there political appetite washington for entitlement reform 
even republicans hold the house and senate 
the biggest hurdle passing entitlement reform senate math republicans are 
not likely attain seats and reconciliation rules forbid using the procedure 
make changes social security 
believe that republicans may try repeal the affordable care act again 
and therefore make cuts medicaid but not think that would ultimately 
successful given that the same dynamics and public opposition exist 
republicans want change rules regarding welfare programs make those 
programs harder qualify for however many those changes are happening 
the state level and spending these programs overall much lower than the 
spending the big entitlements and therefore unlikely have significant 
effect future deficits 
speaker paul ryan has been leading the rhetoric charge for reforming entitlements 
but retiring from congress after this term 
risks our view the biggest risk our view unexpected recession followed 
push for fiscal responsibility like saw and while discretionary spending 
was brought down through series actions neither party was able pass 
entitlement reform then however the debt has worsened since then and maybe there 
would more successful push toward entitlement reform the future
