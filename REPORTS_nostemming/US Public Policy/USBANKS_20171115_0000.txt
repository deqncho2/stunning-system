bipartisan agreement lift sifi threshold positive for banks under bil 
the senate bill proposed senate banking committee chairman mike crapo 
has nine democratic sponsors would effectively remove the sifi threshold 
for banks under bil freeing them understand from the increased 
regulatory burdens the ccar exam arbitrary limits capital return 
compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio and the filing living will even 
the bill doesn pass until early slightly modified think there 
high probability that some form sifi relief will pass within the next year 
what might banks they are not considered sifi the most likely answer 
that bank managements could get much more active returning capital 
shareholders through additional share buybacks the average ratio the 
non advanced approach banks between and bil assets well 
above the roughly that believe more appropriate long term target for 
the group banks may also choose increase their dividend payouts currently 
estimated although suspect most banks would likely max 
out around implying limited incremental capital usage accelerate balance 
sheet growth less likely our view some combination all three 
buybacks though would have the greatest near term impact our forward 
eps estimates secondary benefit not being classified sifi that banks 
may also able reduce certain regulatory expenses which could also drive 
higher eps estimates although the extent which these costs savings would 
reinvested into the business unclear 
let accelerate buybacks what does mean for eps estimates who benefits 
who doesn based our analysis below estimate banks with bil 
assets could see and increase eps with the largest 
increase cma where eps could theoretically increase followed 
cit and zion and respectively banks with bil assets 
would see much smaller and average increase not 
only they begin buying back stock one year later than the smaller banks but 
several the larger banks are already running very close our target 
already exhibit for example estimate fitb will have ratio

our current base case implying only needs buyback enough stock 
bring its capital ratio down bps compared roughly bps for 
comerica banks that get the least eps benefit order from 
would sti ally and dfs see exhibits 
the details our accelerating buyback analysis the senate bill would 
effectively immediately remove the sifi designation for banks under bil 
total assets whereas for the bil banks the threshold removed 
months although the fed can retain sifi designations remove them earlier 
assume the sub bil banks complete their previously agreed upon ccar 
payouts through and then accelerate buybacks beginning order 
bring their ratios down the end for the over bil 
banks assume they through one more ccar process 
change our existing buyback assumptions next year which already assume 
greater capital return flexibility and begin more aggressive buyback program 
again bringing their ratios down within the subsequent six 
quarters for dfs and syf use and minimum ratio 
respectively while exclude axp and ntrs with assets bil and 
bil given they are advanced approaches banks and could still classified 
sifi irrespective their size 
more ccar for the smaller banks positive but there are still risks the 
biggest risk that banks take more conservative approach with capital return 
than the street might expect and choose not accelerate buybacks 
meaningful way citizens has previously said much and keycorp reiterated 
just yesterday that its capital return goals would not change even were not 
subject ccar course there are some banks like cit with 
which are likely more aggressive with capital return than others 
but not all banks will benefit the same our analysis represents bull case 
scenario are optimistic that capital flexibility will lead better capital 
allocation decisions broadly speaking but are not changing our eps 
estimates until get better clarity out both congress and the individual
