republican sweep less 
regulation lower taxes 
have been saying the trump turns the base scenario 
net positive for financials for banks less regulation 
lower taxes outweigh policy uncertainty lower interest 
deductibility money centers cards benefit most from easing 
regulation higher capital return most positive for syf 
potentially easing regulation the biggest positive 
trump was voted promise reduce regulation 
for banks this could mean moratorium new 
regulation dismantling certain aspects the doddfrank act dfa two new fed governors and 
possibly new chair and weaker cfpb 
making the stress test more predictable and allowing 
banks hug their minimum capital requirements 
more closely could release significant amounts 
excess capital estimate the large cap banks have billion excess

corporate and personal tax rates should drive both consumption and investment 
spend turn improving demand for credit and loan growth higher 
infrastructure spend with its multiplier effect should boost gdp which turn 
would also drive loan demand industrials higher growth could most 
positive for cma key fhn fitb and cfr repeal obamacare could 
positive for small businesses and the potential replacement obamacare with 
health savings accounts would benefit wbs given its large hsa business lower 
personal tax rates would positive for wealth managers bac wfc jpm

steepening yield curve would drive higher nim conservatively only 
baking one rate hike between now and year end higher rates drives 
eps parallel shift that all drops the bottom line adds median 
eps for large cap banks and eps for midcap banks

more than offset the negative impact lower interest deductions worst this 
would only revenue neutral for the government but see low probability 
that outcome credit card companies like syf dfs and axp appear best 
positioned interest deductibility reduced since interest consumer loans 
already not tax deductible and thus not impacted this potential change more 
our detailed note the subject here 
policy uncertainty tail risk recognize uncertainty the trump policy 
agenda could drive tail risk particularly geopolitical and trade risk the degree 
that the trump vote catalyzes more exits the upcoming italian and french 
elections the threat breakup tail risk for the money centers 
additionally could have some headline risk glass steagall trump 
suggested bringing this back the republican platform however this does not 
seem view that all house financial committee republicans share 
idea which comes with risk economic growth reinstating glass steagall 
would likely cost the affected banks least between additional 
expenses split more here the extent that significant policy uncertainty 
drives flight safe assets and brings down long end rates bank nim could
