released monday night focuses repealing many taxes associated with the 
current law and moving from government subsidies pay for insurance 
tax credits for those who purchase their own insurance the bill halts medicaid 
expansion and shifts medicaid funding from open ended entitlement 
per capita cap the proposal would also eliminate the requirement that 
employers offer coverage and impose premium people who let their 
coverage lapse the congressional budget office cbo has yet score the bill 
analysts are still uncertain the cost and how many people the plan would 
cover 
starting point for negotiations with the senate the proposed legislation 
needs votes pass the senate republican seats four republican 
senators rob portman shelley moore capito cory gardner 
and lisa murkowski have expressed concerns over the bill medicaid 
funding freeze all four senators hail from states that have expanded 
medicaid and warn that the proposal does not meet the test stability for 
current medicaid enrollees other republican senators have expressed concerns 
over the cost the new plan and view the bill starting point for 
negotiations 
cbo scoring the next step the cbo has not yet evaluated the cost the new 
bill which repeals the aca tax penalties for people without insurance starting 
cbo scoring important assessing whether republican fiscal hawks 
will back the legislation but could take few weeks suggesting longer markup

immediate some had feared muni hospitals may look appealing investors 
seeing yield 
medicaid lots compromise but better than the bear case the draft 
legislation includes path medicaid expansion pre implementation 
per capita funding post with stability fund and continued federal 
matching for states that have already expanded while less desirable for insurers 
with high medicaid exposure and facilities than aca policies the proposal can 
seen modest positive versus the bear case eliminating expansion with 
funding system based block grants the bill moves through the senate the 
question remains what will give conservative legislators will likely 
concerned with snowballing medicaid costs while democrats may worry about 
timing gaps and lapses coverage 
exchanges there enough lure insurers back one the drivers timing 
the house bill offer insurers visibility exchange market stability for 
encourage them come back not leave the proposed legislation 
includes market stabilization funding mechanism eliminates the individual 
mandate replacing with surcharge for those who fail maintain 
continuous coverage and widens the gap between the most generous and least 
generous plan from while maintaining guaranteed issue and coverage 
parents plan age eligibility and funding remain key questions 
particularly with move predominantly age based tax credit system with 
income caps which democrats may fear will lead lower overall covered lives 
versus the current subsidy system 
mention drug pricing did not expect see drug pricing language 
this proposal and await commentary from president trump and legislative 
developments from congress the bill also does not include targeted structural 
reforms changes part dual eligibles which could proposed later 
although president trump has said wants lower drug prices are not 
aware any proposals that have the broad based republican support needed 
pass both the senate and house plus reconciliation order sent the 
president signed into law bipartisan drug pricing measures could 
incorporated later part negotiations get the bill passed 
the house gop bill looks benign positive for devices see little reason 
expect absolute slowdown device growth coverage commitments and 
limited near term funding holes suggest only limited impacts utilization and 
capex see repeal and replace looks benign positive for devices following 
aca implementation the group acceleration has been relatively consistent 
with the prior years ahead aca bps organic growth acceleration 
each year from see utilization great wide open debate our dec 
alphawise survey supports this view respondents expected both inpatient 
and outpatient growth additionally concerns around funding shocks 
were addressed commitment maintain funding states that expanded 
medicaid through january suggests meaningful disruption hospital 
spending acknowledge uncertainty can pushback hospital spending but note 
stability hospital capex environment heighten levels growth 
marked the ninth consecutive quarter where our survey respondents expected 
greater than growth and only respondents expect delays
