free trade focus great deal debate continues around the impact 
potential protectionist foreign trade policy largely focused mexico and china 
are not position weigh specific policy routes and outcomes but 
can offer contingent commentary 
trade with china the biggest risk and weighs both suppliers and oems 
china represents both very significant source demand firms make lot 
money there and very significant source supply firms make lot 
products there any adverse outcome for free trade between the and china 
would significant negative most oems and suppliers would highlight 
having significant exposure chinese profit total and cash 
flow total fca has the least exposure china amongst the 
ford the middle but has higher exposure production mexico and was 
criticized president trump during the campaign for upcoming plant opening 
mexico trump potus does repeal nafta that could reduce 
competitiveness vehicles produced mexico 
what may less obvious investors the exposure suppliers

over the years increased content local manufacturers the chinese

global implications 
china 
limited immediate impact china oems chinese oems including both domestic and 
brands have high exposure the chinese market and limited export exposure the 
market such expect immediate impact chinese oems from potential 
tariff hikes the longer term brand jvs china such saic and changan 
ford could face negative impact from the potential trade war between china and 
however given the high localization rate these two brands china don 
expect material impact their margins 
names with production sites under our coverage include minth fuyao 
and huayu which each has about revenue exposure 
america minth has plant north michigan for trim production while 
investors might concerned about impact its mexico plant mainly focus local 
market for nissan and ford huayu now has production capacity after acquiring jci 
global business fuyao just finished the construction new dayton ohio plant for auto 
glass production part the company effort stepping global supplier 
trade policies could adversely affect chinese auto suppliers too chinese auto parts 
suppliers have been increasingly exporting the given cost advantage although 
implementation such tariff hikes may not immediate the suppliers with the highest 
exposure the market would most risk given chinese exporters limited 
ability absorb the shock from higher tariffs assume that any potential changes 
tariffs would largely passed through export prices given that still believe 
globalization will critical drive auto part name above industry growth the names 
have more diversified market exposure strong customer franchise 
collaboratively accommodate the potential policy changes and established production 
site the would ride out the turmoil better see also china autos auto parts 
election implications for china auto parts stocks nov 
europe 
after the somewhat surprisingly positive market reaction the election result 
ask what impact the result could have european autos any although policy focus 
remains uncertain from most the debate somewhat clearer from the pre election 
headlines and debates what the key areas difference going forward could 
would focus the following key debates 
usd think the resilience the usd and dxy yesterday may have been one 
the catalysts for the stock market rally euro and yen could the weaker currencies 
the usd our global strategist remains bullish usd see here and stronger usd 
would help global exporters into the including autos and especially bmw and 
daimler japanese oems were strongly overnight the yen has fallen 
cny seems that with china maintaining stable cny against basket global 
currencies then stronger usd almost automatically leads lower cny the usd 
already cny back multi year lows auto oems have more exposure 
cny than usd these days given local production potential for more tense trade 
relations between and china could also impact cny 
gbp not obviously political angle but seems gbp was the only major currency 
outperform usd yesterday relative strength gbp versus euro helps the european 
oem exporters including peugeot and bmw see autos shared mobility 
risks for oct 
rates sell off ust continues pushing rates and steepening the yield curve the 
market focuses december rate rise the and investors question the 
potential relationship between trump and fed chief yellen higher rates historically 
have supported cyclical trades have seen but tough see this 
fundamentally positive for the autos some stage higher rates will impact negatively 
credit availability and credit performance further impacting sector profitability 
remember believe marginal changes credit cost availability are key driver not 
just auto demand but also global oem profitability see autos auto parts global 
insight credit dependency jan and european autos auto parts autos 
and credit explaining the circularity feb 
trade tariffs nafta campaign rhetoric obviously highlighted trump more 
protectionist stance for the with potential for negotiation major trade treaties 
such nafta with many industrials and auto oems opting for mexican production 
recent years trade tariffs with mexico could real risk the mexican production 
base although short term peso weakness has been significant cost help 
seems too early take strong view but european oems most exposed mexican 
production are with large plant for exports directly renault through nissan 
mexican production exposure and daimler which has mexican truck production 
exposure 
trade tariffs china again campaign rhetoric focused the trading relationship with 
china tough know how this pans out seems unlikely that aggressive tariffs 
sanctions are possible given the inter dependence both countries trading imports 
and exports see china autos auto parts election implications for china auto 
parts stocks nov 
fiscal stimulus seems many construction related stocks the reacted well 
anticipation greater fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending again details are 
limited but seems this could boost the economy starting volvo and 
daimler through construction equipment and trucks may the moist obvious 
beneficiaries 
environmental policy trump views environmental policy and initial epa 
appointee appear indicate marked change direction and has talked about 
reversing some recent moves this regard again actual policies are known but 
coal stocks reacted very favourably yesterday this regard possible that 
current very stringent cafe standards the may negotiated relaxed taking 
some pressure off technology risks for oems the other hand global oem strategies 
are not going change for the alone and seems the emissions discussion still 
one way debate whatever the speed the reductions 
corporate taxation president elect trump team have talked much lower 
corporate tax rates from one the highest tax regimes the world today with talk 
taxes falling whilst believe there may budget limitations and 
implications that could stop such moves any reduction tax rates would obviously 
push earnings higher similarly possible trump may try negotiate way 
for corporates repatriate large proportion current off shore deposits further 
boosting the economy and liquidity the economy and pushing usd 
personal taxation trump campaigned lowering taxes and tax rates obviously 
any reductions federal tax rates would boost personal income and disposable 
incomes will important see where those tax reductions fall before assess 
how this will impact total spending autos demand volume and mix terms 
maybe small positive 
doj settlement ceo matthias mueller said interview bloomberg 
yesterday there small risk that the election could delay eventual settlement 
conclusion the diesel gate situation again little evidence here 
japan oems 
protectionist trade policies between the and japan and between japan and mexico 
pose negative earnings risk the japanese auto oems six japanese oems business 
the subaru mazda and mitsubishi motor and together hold 
market share all the oems except mitsubishi motor also have production facilities 
north american region 
north american production ratio nap ratio japanese oems around 
assume the nap are produced plants the while are produced the 
plants canada and mexico and respectively 
roughly sales the region are mainly exported from japan japanese oems 
currently pay tariff the rate goes would likely negative for japanese 
oems sales the very least for profitability 
potential impacts mexico trade policy nissan has its nap production 
mexico even considering their large market share mexico think nissan relies more 
mexican production than any other japanese auto oem mazda and honda also have 
production facilities mexico while subaru has production facilities mexico 
forex moves are key usd jpy bounced back sharply for now six yen moved 
significantly usd overnight but bounced back where stands now however 
there good short term countermeasure for sudden currency movements for auto 
oems estimate every yen swing usd jpy affects roughly profit not 
insignificant impact 
gas guzzlers again mix shift could positive for japanese oems but relatively 
speaking would negative for japanese oems bigger carts and trucks tend yield 
higher profit margins for oems including japanese ones but given that the beauty and 
attraction japanese cars should product quality and fuel economy relatively 
speaking might negatively affect japanese oems share prices 
among the toyota and honda are better position nissan among mid caps 
subaru are better position mazda simply due the difference the reliance 
mexico think toyota would the best position focus the potential hike 
the tariff honda the better position comparing other two names among midcaps think subaru better position than mazda given that subaru only relies 
production while mazda has relatively large plant mexico 
are emerging markets safer short term yes but are not sure the 
medium long term isuzu and hino small truck specialists have lower profit exposure 
and north american region share prices those two names sharply bounced 
back think that those two names would outperform the auto oems the short 
term 
japan auto parts 
the yen appreciates against the dollar our strategy team view that 
the dollar still likely strengthen and the yen weaken the medium longer term 
this would raise concerns over denso and keihin who are relatively sensitive changes 
the jpy usd however most japanese auto parts firms that have announced 
results over the past two weeks assume believe the short term 
earnings shortfall risk from the yen appreciation will limited addition 
currently think few firms will change their strategy the ratio domestic overseas 
production 
mexico the mexican peso has declined sharply which likely lead improved 
profitability for mexican output and export businesses the short term but the 
shifts tougher stance toward mexico renegotiates nafta and steps duties 
imports from mexico would expect impact firms with production bases 
mexico toyota boshoku and takata have mexico operations handling labor intensive 
production processes and then supplying the while koito exports items produced 
the mexican plant clients plants southern and the nissan motor plant 
mexico that calsonic and unipres deliver exports the 
tpp stagnation the japan and other parties had been pushing tpp forward but the 
spread protectionism could pose headwinds for free trade foster local production 
for local consumption however japanese parts and tire makers had been moving 
toward local materials sourcing use local suppliers creation local jobs their 
plants etc hopes for the elimination tariffs parts exports the were not 
all that high begin with and thus think any negative impact from possible 
stagnation tpp proceedings would limited 
sluggish demand increased uncertainty casts concern over personal spending and 
immigration restrictions could also result drag consumption that were 
happen would expect this impact names with high sales gearing the 
such denso keihin toyoda gosei and bridgestone 
see also our november note implications the auto parts industry from trump 
victory the presidential election 
india 
bharat forge positive which exports components the truck market and oil gas 
sector would benefit from pick infrastructure spending the united states 
which forms bhfc sales 
tata motors neutral market forms around jlr sales more favorable tax 
rates for wealthy americans could positive the margin for high end range rover 
jlr models any delay passing more stringent fuel economy rules also works 
favor traditional oems such tata motors 
motherson need monitor the company has production base mexico any 
change mexico trade pact could have adverse impact that plant profitability 
the facility contribution current earnings limited but important driver 
future growth 
korea 
protectionist trade policies pose negative earnings risk for the korean auto oems 
hyundai and kia total retail sales the were and units implying 
and its total sales respectively this would also more negative for kia 
motors which recently ramped units capacity mexico 
the krw depreciation anticipated the morgan stanley economics team could 
partially offset this negative impact 
investor sentiment korean autos could turn more positive relative positioning 
korean japanese auto companies the relative yen appreciation holds and 
hyundai motor group seen behind development the market could think that 
the potentially lower slower penetration evs should allow the group catch 
the race 
oems suppliers less advantageous policies could weaken parts suppliers 
growth outlook triggering valuation premium gradually erode the oems
