overview 
think the environment for the life insurers has significantly improved and that 
the surge stock prices has been justified with still solid upside potential names 
including voya and ameriprise higher interest rates have mitigated tail risks that 
earlier the year weighed heavily sentiment concerns surrounding the regulatory 
burden have lifted and there could meaningful earnings upside should corporate 
taxation reform progress reflecting these factors are significantly increasing our 
price targets across the board that said have already seen considerable price moves 
many these stocks while still see solid upside potential voya and 
ameriprise which remain our top picks with overweight ratings recommend 
investors take some profits prudential and lincoln which are downgrading 
equal weight valuation 
while the group had been out favor for most the year have seen dramatic 
reversal post the election specifically the industry has appreciated post election 
more than erasing prior underperformance and driving year date performance 
well ahead the gain for the 
despite the speed and magnitude the rally our analysis suggests fully justified 
following the post election surge valuations have recovered but the group still 
trading only the market multiple based our analysis this not out line 
with the historical averages specifically completed analysis looking the 
relative valuation the industry the market different interest rate environments 
when the year treasury rate falls the range the sector has historically 
traded which slightly above the current level 
further this based current estimates should corporate taxation reform proceed 
could potentially see earnings estimates meaningfully rise specifically estimate 
after tax earnings rise although with wide variation between the various names 
our estimate reflects expected scaling back elimination the dividend received 
deduction which serves reduce the effective tax rates well below the statutory rate 
for many companies the net result that companies with large separate account 
balances typically associated with variable annuities and retirement operations would 
see substantially less benefit than others more heavily oriented toward traditional 
insurance

this strong performance was odds with what most expected the consensus view 
prior the election was that trump presidency would create substantial uncertainty 
driving equity markets lower one the higher beta sectors this had the potential 
weigh heavily the group but with the republicans sweeping the house senate and 
presidency now appears there are improved odds substantive changes being made 
several areas including policies invigorate growth which could trigger some 
reflation soften the regulatory burden and revamp the taxation system all these 
could positive for all financials but particularly the life insurers discuss later 
the report 
would also note that the performance among the individual stocks has differed

what the election means for the industry 
from our perspective the implications the election can broken down into three 
overall categories macro developments potential regulatory changes and potential 
taxation changes aggregate would consider each these developments 
positive although there are some offsets and the impact differs meaningfully between 
the stocks 
macro changes 
starting first with the macro environment the moves have seen across various 
markets have aggregate been positive specifically higher interest rates have been 
substantial contributor the outperformance the strength equity markets have also 
provided boost while currency moves have been partial offset

looking first interest rates have seen rapid and substantial move higher long 
term interest rates one the larger fears investors had with the sector earlier the 
year was the scenario lower for longer environment for long term interest rates 
this has the potential trigger strain terms earnings growth new investments 
are put work yield below the portfolio yield also raises the concern that 
assumptions underlying various balance sheet items may need reset triggering 
sizable charges reflecting these items the sector overall has demonstrated very tight 
correlation with long term interest rates which was one the key factors why the 
sector was out favor toward the middle the year when the surprise brexit vote 
drove yields globally substantially lower 
the aftermath the election the year treasury yield has surged higher increasing 
basis points following this move interest rates have now increased year over year 
which only short few months ago would have seemed highly unlikely while still 
see new money yields running below average portfolio yields for most the names 
our coverage universe the resultant drag forward operating earnings should 
mitigated only average down from when the year treasury was 
perhaps more importantly believe the risk charges related actuarial 
reviews and year end cash flow testing have meaningfully declined which should 
positive for sentiment and impact the multiples investors are willing pay 
among the various companies those with greater exposure longer duration products 
such long term care and who rely more heavily interest income source 
earnings are likely the key beneficiaries our view the more interest sensitive 
companies include lincoln voya unum metlife and cno financial while those with 
less sensitivity include torchmark aflac and ameriprise

the degree international exposure among the life insurers also differs meaningfully 
among the various stocks aflac clearly outlier with its earnings from japan 
although other companies including prudential rga and metlife also have sizable 
offshore operations contrast there are several stocks who are purely domestic 
including cno financial lincoln and torchmark show exhibit 
regulatory changes 
the second possible area change revolves around softening the regulatory 
environment this stage there little terms concrete proposals and exactly how 
the overall environment could change remains somewhat speculative nature that 
said less onerous regulatory environment has the potential emerge meaningful 
positive development for the life insurance sector 
the first area regulation watch the department labor fiduciary standards 
these recently developed standards mandate that financial advisors act the clients 
best interest when dealing with retirement accounts called qualified accounts 
while none the companies cover disagree with the intention these rules they 
disagree with practical workings which require advisors sign contract with 
clients which referred the best interest contract given this contract clients will 
have the right private action including possibly joining large number classaction lawsuits which could drive meaningfully higher litigation costs across the 
industry industry groups have been arguing this provision has overstepped the 
jurisdiction the dol and would prefer any dispute handled individually through 
arbitration 
how the dol fiduciary rules are likely change this point remains tough gauge 
although most the contacts with whom speak share the view that the most likely 
outcome that these rules will delayed and reworked with april being the 
date which these rules are due come into effect the new administration would 
have take action relatively quickly delay implementation 
among the companies ameriprise given its sizable financial advisory business the 
company most impacted while other companies with variable annuity operations where 
the sales outlook was question could also benefit that said believe several 
the trends including the move toward fee based accounts passive over active 
investments and the elimination fees were trends occurring independently from 
the dol rules while implementation the rules may have accelerated these trends 
see them continuing nonetheless 
the second area potential regulatory reform surrounds the dodd frank act under 
this law several nonbank companies including aig metlife and prudential were 
designated systemically important metlife fought its designation the courts and 
won although fsoc appealed with ruling likely toward the beginning next year 
how the dodd frank rules may potentially changed again remains unclear although 
there the potential they may less burdensome the best case insurers may 
avoid this designation altogether the federal reserve still the process 
developing capital standards for the life insurers unclear whether the increased 
capital burden would have placed these companies competitive disadvantage but 
our view the stocks still traded discount reflect this uncertainty should these 
rules softened this discount could reduced eliminated 
corporate taxation changes 
the third potential implication the election potential changes taxation 
specifically the trump administration has outlined broad proposals reduce the 
corporate tax rate either based his plan under broader house plan 
this stage assessing the chances tax cut remains challenging but our view 
has the potential positive development for the industry 
would note though that lot depends the details other areas like dividend 
received deductions which has often been discussed area that may revised 
could subject change currently stands life insurers can claim deduction for 
dividends they receive from separate account balances these deductions often serve 
significantly reduce the effective tax rate from the statutory level there could 
also host other changes although unclear this point what impact this 
could have the industry

given the substantial and rapid changes the stock prices many the life insurers 
the natural question whether these moves have seen have been too much too 
fast our view the answer arriving this conclusion important keep 
mind that the sector overall prior the election was trading levels that were 
depressed relative historical averages show exhibit the sector has 
typically traded level around the market multiple measured the 
the aftermath the financial services crisis while prior the financials crisis 
was around immediately prior the crisis the sector was trading which 
would consider depressed level 
moreover given the strong correlation the life insurers interest rates the group 
tends trade higher multiples relative the market when interest rates are higher 
prove this point have gone back over time and examined the average price 
earnings relative the market different interest rates environments specifically 
looked the relative valuation different year treasury yield bands starting from

what this analysis shows that the current relative valuation the group not out 
line with what would expect given the move have seen interest rates least 
historically the group has tended trade the market multiple when year 
treasury rates were between against this the current market multiple 
seems broadly line 
further there are arguments suggest perhaps should trading above historical 
averages the current consensus estimates are likely somewhat stale and not reflect 
the improved macro environment based where the markets are currently would 
estimate streetwide estimates would need move higher roughly given the 
recent moves have seen various macro drivers 
further the relatively low historical multiples the stocks part reflect the highly 
regulated nature the industry and the risk further tightening rules across the 
industry negatively impacting future returns given the results the election there are 
arguments made that this regulatory discount should decline although until 
specific proposals are outlined remains difficult gauge the impact 
assessing the blue sky potential 
while several the potential changes this point remain somewhat speculative 
nature have attempted assess how estimates may potentially change under the 
assumption that corporate taxes are revised our base assumptions are that dividend 
received deductions are eliminated municipal and other tax advantages investments 
are fully taxed and the corporate tax rate based earnings are reduced

note however that for some companies such cno and voya the tax rates they 
use show their earnings are assumed for the purpose reporting gaap earnings and 
bear little resemblance actual taxes paid due the existence large deferred tax 
assets accordingly these companies would facing relatively significant write off

clearly the aftermath the election have seen significant moves the stock 
prices leading several investors question whether there are potential outliers 
answer this question first mark the estimates market calculate the revised 
premium discount each stock trading relative its peers and contrast this 
historical averages note however that some cases there could solid reasons 
for the stock have deviated from its historical average for example with ameriprise 
the stock multiple over the past year had been heavily influenced dol fiduciary 
standard concerns with those concerns dissipating feel justified that the 
multiple has improved 
first marking our estimates market will make revisions the end the 
quarter but based moves have seen thus far would generally expect 
estimates move modestly higher average the positive side higher interest rates 
the main factor see benefiting the group while equity markets have also 
appreciated more than the had previously modeled offsetting factors have been 
adverse currency moves while also expect less buyback accretion given the 
significantly stronger stock prices the aftermath the election
