from impact investment standpoint expect that two key

framework place and effectively measuring and reporting 
opportunity funds can provide interesting alternative for 
the impact being created opportunity funds will likely appeal

some these inequalities and foster greater inclusive growth 
growth that more fairly distributed across these regions the alternative rising inequality can limit underlying growth and spending
