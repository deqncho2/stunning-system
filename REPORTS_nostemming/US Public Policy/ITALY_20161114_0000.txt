exhibit uncertain projections point winning 
referendum model probability yes winning 
average probability 
referendum confidence vote the two chambers the italian parliament 
currently the same thing and have agree the same text every single 
piece legislation thus making the process rather lengthy and inefficient the 
italians are voting constitutional reform that eliminates the senate when 
comes approving the budget and granting confidence the government thus 
streamlining policy decision making reality the referendum mostly seen 
confidence vote for against prime minister matteo renzi 
odds skewed towards there just about probability that the yes 
camp wins and therefore manages push through this key reform our view 
extracting the probability for the reform pass trivial exercise however 
the dispersion possible outcomes narrowing and converging towards the 
more bearish predictions the evidence from polls surveys voter intentions 
and predictive models fact pointing more marked defeat for renzi 
though looking the situation the ground that looks too bearish 
what renzi loses with two different electoral rules the two chambers 
parliament won have early election right away more likely transition 
government come out with new electoral rules diffuse rather than 
concentrate power will take year more thus leading close the 
next scheduled election which the protest parties are unlikely win 
outright therefore while italian markets may continue underperform the 
ecb backstop likely hold 
what renzi wins with large share undecided voters this outcome 
possible though not probable for now should happen would mean 
renewed support for reforms upside surprise relative market expectations 
yet this outcome may also allow the five star movement grab more power 
any future election while the italians would rather stay the currency union 
and referendum this topic illegal anyway even small shift the 
probability this outcome may affect asset prices negatively 
strategy hedging europe believe very little referendum risk premium exists 
most assets and strategic hedges that work even after the referendum 
are cheap like the following order preference buy eurostoxx puts 
contingent weaker eur buy protection itraxx main cdx iii buy 
eurusd puts buy itraxx main payer spreads short btps european

understanding the referendum 
what you get out this note 
our insight report the referendum sets the political scene goes through the macro 
backdrop and your reference guide our medium term macro views italy 
assigned chance the yes camp winning see italy referendum the five star 
question september our subsequent video update didn signal any material 
change either direction 
what this idea piece focus more the short term outlook taking more 
tactical angle want refresh our probability models and think more specifically 
about timing outcome and implications this key event for the italian economy and 
markets our goal for this research note help clients understand what the best 
way hedge the referendum risk 
what the italians are actually voting 
what the vote about the two chambers parliament currently the same thing 
takes long time pass legislation after bill voted one chamber then goes 
the other where usually amended and talking about millions 
amendments some cases the chambers have agree the same text the 
process goes and with back and forth between the two known the shuttle 
the constitutional reform streamlines policy making elevating the chamber 
deputies makes the only one voting confidence the government and approving 
the budget smaller senate would remain mostly consultative chamber and 
vote any future constitutional change 
what the vote really about mostly seen confidence vote for against prime 
minister matteo renzi 
why there referendum the constitutional reform the course its 
parliamentary approval fell short the two thirds majority for immediately 
enacted article the italian constitution says referendum required the vote 
outcome binding and given that constitutional matter has quorum 
the question our translation something like you approve the text the 
constitutional bill regarding measures overcome the bicameral system reduce the 
number members parliament contain the cost the public administration eliminate 
the national council for the economy and labour market and revise chapter part 
the constitution approved parliament and published april 
the small print the constitutional reform not just about the senate also redefines 
the competences the state and the regions eliminates the provinces second level 
territorial subdivision and shuts down the national council for economics and labour 
consultative body experts and representatives the major trade unions business 
lobbies professional associations and ngos 
will the yes camp win lose 
odds point defeat 
quant approach says that yes camp trailing way behind the probability implied 
the average the last ten referendum polls suggests that the constitutional reform 
will likely rejected with very high probability more than our predictive 
models point less decisively towards victory for with probability 
depending the model specification and economic variables included this still high 
number perhaps way too high the political situation more nuanced than that 
stick our own subjective assessment relative our perception the ground 
this seems excessively bearish thus believe that our probability that the 
reform doesn pass and therefore that does closer reflection what going 
reality put differently the negative case that the reform fails approved 
remains our base case though the yes camp isn trailing much behind 
there are two main methodologies calculate these probabilities 
surveys voter intentions extract the probability winning from polls the 
referendum and adjust for accuracy looking the margin error sample size 
predictive models project from past referendum outcomes and popularity 
parties favour against the status quo also looking economic conditions 
one thought the technicalities information past referendums limited 
overcome this issue data scarcity matched the percentage point lead yes 
over with the differential popularity between the political parties that were 
supporting change previous popular votes and those favour keeping the status 
quo referendum results and party support are correlated then used linear 
probability models with the estimated yes lead explanatory variable 
estimate the chances yes winning also augmenting the basic model with economic 
indicators such house prices the unemployment rate 
exhibit declining chance approving the reform

both methodologies have pros and cons this doesn mean that they useless rather 
means that they should intended more one many inputs going into broader 
analysis not the only input their key strengths and weaknesses are 
polls the referendum itself are more direct and timely one was conducted 
after the election however they cover just short time horizon and show that 
even few weeks prior this key vote very large share italians remains 
undecided which makes their prediction less powerful 
the predictive models too are based thin sample past referendums along 
with the popularity the main political parties over time they can account for 
the changes the italian political system has gone through over the years and the 
constitutional referendum looks kind unique seems more like 
confidence vote the prime minister however they fit the data very well 
what could make difference 
there are only three weeks left before the referendum the road for the yes camp 
win looks uphill but with many voters still undecided perhaps one third the total 
even more not obvious that renzi will necessarily lose here what could 
perhaps change the probability 
not about looks the referendum has been turned into some sort 
confidence vote against the government trying make less personal and 
more about the reform itself the probability for the yes camp win may well rise 
indeed renzi longer says that necessarily resign loses 
find more sponsors one our models indicates that past referendums voters 
have tended follow the indications the political party they identify themselves 
with but only most renzi democratic party supports the reform while 
most other large parties are against 
jobs and housing another our models shows that voters care about the 
market value their homes and look the overall economy thorough their own 
experience the labour market the macro outlook can obviously change quickly 
but credible announcement extra fiscal expansion may help the yes camp

what if 
the camp wins the reform isn approved 
bad but manageable outcome our view with two different electoral rules the 
two chambers parliament won have early election right away more likely 
transition government figure out new electoral rules renzi may lead 
probably technocrat will take year more thus leading close the 
next scheduled election spring set date yet the protest parties are unlikely 
win outright this means that euro exit risk doesn rise the italians want stay 
anyway and the ecb backstop will likely continue hold for the sovereign and 
corporate debt markets the banks are the weak link our view 
particular 
these new electoral rules are unlikely concentrate more power fewer hands 
the referendum rejection would mean that the italians don favour this option 
rather they likely diffuse power 
protest party five star movement won gain absolute control therefore the 
ecb should remain effective backstop and italy should remain idiosyncratic 
risk albeit rather important one and may have negative effect especially 
the banking system the ecb doesn buy bank shares and bonds currently 
reform italy should progress slowly including fix the banks the economy and 
its markets should underperform there may some contagion the 
periphery but spain should outperform given strong growth and less political risk 
transition government early election should the referendum lost italy process 
institutional reform will likely come halt unlikely that any election could 
bring political stability with two very different electoral laws the two chambers 
parliament hence transition government will have come with new electoral 
rules before election will probably take least year not more the italians 
are likely vote earlier than late 
five star movement won take power protest parties can only win absolute 
majority the chamber deputies the constitutional reform which they oppose 
approved but that would vote confidence for mainstream parties which 
therefore may better the next election the reform rejected conversely 
party will win outright the senate any new system unlikely devise rules leading 
large parliamentary majorities 
focus banks not govies past episodes political volatility suggest that the 
sovereign market does reacts negatively and did this episode too yet and large 
one wouldn say that seen significant contagion other peripherals the ecb 
backstop where place government and corporate bond markets seems have held 
this leaves italy vulnerable banking system the main stress point scenario 
strong political fallout there monetary policy backstop 
how can this become systemic risk there were prospects for the protest parties 
win outright the markets may think that they may try pull out the euro this may 
test the ecb backstop more forcefully probably the sovereign market too and again 
especially the banks the italians are pro euro though and referendum the euro 
illegal the protest parties would have win big majorities then change the 
constitution which may require referendum and finally win euro membership 
referendum the bar for this happen high 
euro exit losing the referendum would further delay urgently needed economic 
public finance and banking system reforms which have far been quite difficult 
implement even under the pro business agenda renzinomics expect period 
uncertainty which would negatively affect sentiment and activity but not period 
instability deep lead the protest parties take power within the next months 
and mean italy perceived being the brink exiting the currency union which the 
italians don support anyway 
exhibit majority italians pro euro 
are you for aganist european monetary union 
with the euro the single currency 
ire nld bel fin ger fra aut por spa gre ita swe 
for 
against 
don know 
not even euro referendum article the italian constitution 
doesn allow referendum international treaties such the 
the euro the bar for leaving high and the chain 
events much longer than say for the leave the italy 
eurosceptic party would have win election with 
absolute majority and then set motion the exit process after 
having changed the constitution with two thirds majority both 
chambers just absolute majority followed referendum 
eurozone membership indissolubly linked membership 
leaving the would also automatically mean leaving the emu 
but again the polls suggest that the majority italians would 
rather stay the euro than leave 
source european commission eurobarometer spring morgan stanley research 
the yes camp wins the reform approved 
good sign that reforms pay off think the approval the constitutional 
amendments would mark the continuation the reform process and would convey 
the message that structural change can and perhaps will happen yet clear 
economy doesn grow just because faster easier legislate course this just 
precondition regain competitiveness and boost productivity italy would still need 
engineer profound restructuring its real fabric along with the public finances and 
the financial system while this happens happens the economy likely stay weak 
but risks protest party setting the policy agenda would diminish while extra 
downside growth would materialise the upside likely quite limited 
second dose renzinomics the constitutional referendum largely seen vote 
confidence government policy and the prime minister this means that victory for 
the yes camp would point renewed support for renzi who would continue 
implement structural reform measures but also fiscal stimulus until the next scheduled 
election expect more efforts sort out the weakest lenders complete 
the civil justice and public administration reforms and also second wave labour 
market reforms this scenario expect the mainstream parties start doing 
better the polls thus reducing the risk that the five star movement does actually win 
absolute majority the chamber deputies 
the risk that protest party five star movement wins the next election this 
course just conjecture this stage that yes vote means that renzi 
approval about pick makes lot sense far however the indication that 
emerges from the main surveys voter intentions national ballot that has 
happen though historically national votes have tended happen rather 
frequently italy that even though renzi pro reform democratic party would 
win the first round may defeated the five star movement the second round 
though its lead very small and within the polls margin error 
new electoral law does deliver winner the previous electoral law was based 
proportional system was very hard win absolute majority given many political 
parties parliament governments were often short lived and snap elections quite 
frequent but part its programme institutional reforms the current government 
has managed get parliamentary approval for new rules the political game what 
new that there now two round system designed identify winner for sure even 
though aspects this law are being challenged court the majority premium 
the winning party rather than coalition and the political parties are negotiating possible 
changes here how works 
first round vote for single party any party passes threshold which 
wouldn expect based the latest polls attributed minimum seats 
out absolute majority 
second round party able pass the threshold voters then choose 
between the two parties that got most votes the first round the party winning 
the second round attributed seats 
but not necessarily market friendly one markets seem suspect that may also 
facilitate the victory least principle anti euro protest party the polls say 
that renzi democratic party may well take the highest percentage votes the 
first round but hypothetically may narrowly lose against the five star movement 
should they both the second round better that the reform doesn pass 
prevent the protest parties take power don think logic suggests that this 
referendum truly seen confidence vote then passing the reform sign 
support for mainstream parties but logic isn the only main thing politics
