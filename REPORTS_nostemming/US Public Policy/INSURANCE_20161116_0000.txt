yesterday hosted our annual insurance corporate access 
day where election implications for the group were clear 
focus while rate moves and potential regulatory changes look 
positive for all financials the life insurers would appear 
the larger beneficiaries 
michael phillips 
life positive potential implications from election with the life insurers having 
rallied substantially the aftermath the election consequences the 
election was clearly one the main areas discussion with management most 
obviously higher interest rates were viewed key positive alleviating pressure 
the group this was particularly the case unum where reserve discount 
rate reductions may lesser magnitude than previously contemplated 
management relates regulatory changes while the new administration 
expected more positive for the space exactly what will change for 
areas such the dol fiduciary rules remains unclear last reductions 
corporate tax rates could also potentially provide meaningful boost although 
remains seen whether there are any meaningful offsets 
but also watchful negative consequences adverse currency moves remain 
challenge for unum aflac and lesser extent ameriprise are also likely 
see less buyback related accretion although none the companies are 
necessarily looking pull back from buyback plans near term companies with 
deferred tax assets dta could see the value those assets diminish are 
also watchful any sales disruption from changes the affordable care act 
for group insurance providers although most management teams expect any 
disruption meaningfully less than saw when was initially introduced 
tax reform key focus for investors the potential reduction corporate 
tax rate from will benefit most companies however 
domestic companies should larger beneficiaries global peers among our 
coverage pgr all bro trv and nghc have the most premium revenue 
exposure the while bro pgr wrb and all have the highest tax rates 
global should also benefit but with smaller upside the negative side 
the potential reduction dta could impact book value for some insurers 
aig has dta its balance sheet lower taxes could also make domestic 
more competitive pricing 
rising interest rates short term pain but long term gain for insurers since 
the election year yield has risen historically stocks 
have underperformed rising year yield periods the value bond 
portfolio negatively impacted investors rotate out into life insurers 
and banks and rising inflation causes concerns claim liabilities however

aflac mixed prospects 
the overall implications the election for aflac are somewhat unclear terms 
the challenges facing the company there are several obvious factors since the election 
the dollar has appreciated meaningfully against the japanese yen which will place 
pressure future eps every yen move currently equates around eps 
the move over the last week other things equal should drive future eps lower second 
parallel shift higher rates relative japan would drive higher hedge costs 
assets invested the supporting yen liabilities which further headwind the 
earnings prospects 
exhibit earnings breakdown 
the positive side however reduction the corporate tax rates has the 
potential positive aflac currently pays more the than they japan which 
may reverse the future the extent that the rate declines would beneficial 
their overall tax rate that said they may benefit less than some their peers given 
significantly higher portion their earnings are derived from japan where they would 
still subject higher taxes

another area that more difficult determine what impact health care reform may 
have their operations the uncertainty surrounding how healthcare may change 
near term could lead confusion which turn could pressure sales that said longer 
term would appear unlikely that the trend toward higher deductible healthcare plans 
likely reverse which means there still substantial need for the supplemental 
policies they provide 
ameriprise potential easing regulatory tail risk 
one the companies most impacted the new dol fiduciary standards the 
company clearly stands out potentially one the key beneficiaries that said this 
point there little clarity what anything likely change accordingly 
management appropriately our view acting status quo with their 
preparation plans even the new rules were not proceed many the steps they 
have undertaken including migrating fee based accounts narrowing the product lines 
available through their advice platforms and eliminating fees would proceed 
nonetheless 
that said the rules were delayed changed canceled the upside the 
company could substantial the key risk from the new rules was the lack 
enforcement capabilities which the dol addressed through creating the new best 
interest contract and the associated private right action for clients who believe this 
contract had been breached this turn led considerable concern over future 
litigation risk the potential elimination what many consider substantial tail risk 
associated with this litigation would doubt key positive 
exhibit effective tax rate 
corp tax rate 
corp tax rate 
outside regulatory changes the company may stand benefit from lower corporate 
taxes that said the company already has relatively low effective tax rate reflecting 
dividend received deductions low income housing credits and foreign tax credits 
these deductions and credits were scaled back eliminated much the benefit from 
lower corporate tax rates could mitigated

there was also considerable talk about their acquisition appetite relates the 
advisor market management preference would for smaller deals where there was 
strong cultural fit they also have interest growing their protection and annuity 
exposure relates asset management however they would willing consider 
larger acquisition especially where expands their geographic footprint unlike the 
both europe and asia have seen less fee pressure and are generally viewed more 
attractive markets 
management also discussed some the areas investor frustration with the stock 
first with property casualty they feel they have made solid progress improving the 
overall outlook for these operations although there lag before the pricing actions 
will evident the earnings second they highlighted that they renegotiated 
additional protection with respect their long term care reinsurance exposure

with the regulatory framework for property casualty insurers less likely 
meaningfully change most the potential impact from the election results reflect 
what could happen with corporate tax rates the positive side the elimination the 
alternative minimum tax rate would positive would clearly any reduction 
overall corporate tax rates that said the company would also likely facing 
diminished value associated with its still substantial billion net operating losses 
nol where reduction the corporate tax rate would drive write down the 
associated deferred tax asset any reduction the corporate tax rate would likely drive 
them hold fewer municipal bonds 
outside the corporate tax rate the rise interest rates positive for all financial 
institutions their fixed block business which there roughly billion aum 
would benefit most with virtually the entire block already contractual minimums 
back when year treasury rates were below they were also facing the prospect 
having put additional asset adequacy charges against this book given the 
improvement the rates post the election that risk has been meaningfully mitigated 
last they also see reported book values benefitting with potential reduction the 
tax offset unrealized gains bonds the investment portfolio providing boost 
although our view most investors life insurance stocks tend net this out 
outside election implications there was also talk about the overall outlook for 
mergers and acquisitions periods uncertainty they would expect overall activity 
across the industry somewhat lower that said interest blocks like talcott could 
benefit from higher interest rates 
unum rates alleviate pressures 
for unum the key positive from the recent market moves interest rates given the 
move higher the year treasury rate the company may not forced reduce the 
reserve discount rate much they previously envisaged now appears 
basis point reduction more likely rather than the basis points that was 
previously the cards which makes more likely that see benefit ratios group 
income protection toward the lower end their guidance range 
further the rise the long end the yield curve also reduces the pressure 
recalibrate lower future interest rate assumptions backing their long term care block 
business where previously investors were concerned over reduction year end 
which now looks less likely 
that said there could other implications election will need see how the 
affordable care act altered and whether this drives any sales disruption similar 
what saw with its introduction rising interest rates could also further pressure the 
british pound relative the dollar which has the potential pressure earnings 
from its operations 
capital management which has been key driver growth unlikely meaningfully 
change although there are number moving pieces the positive side statutory 
earnings have been running ahead expectations while contributions its long term 
care captive and operations are likely mitigated due recent rate moves 
these factors would argue for some upside potential capital management that said 
given the surge have seen stock prices the same dollar amount buybacks less 
accretive than was lower prices 
the company also has the opportunity securitize its individual disability block 
business free incremental capital back the company completed 
million reserve financing which has now paid down roughly million that said 
this does not appear high priority for the company the near term rather 
appears the company would like position reduce its long term care 
exposure although current interest rates transactions near term remain unlikely 
last there change competitive environment which management has warned has 
deteriorated the margin especially their core market which they classify 
lives less they are finding more aggressive pricing from their competitors which 
the margin could impact near term sales and ultimately premium growth rates that 
said they have been willing sacrifice top line growth and maintain margins which 
would agree makes the most sense from shareholder perspective

major themes included organic growth margins investments acquisition opportunities

and line with management expectations higher exposure offsets pricing 
pressure hurricane matthew flooding related revenues could offset some 
carriers pull back from certain program business while bro expects very modest 
declines its peer leading margin the near term due lower contingent commissions 
and higher spending fully expects margins remain historical levels 
over the long run current spending will give one agency interface platform 
compared the myriad current platforms that have been place for quite while 
among the benefits the spending include more efficient review potential 
acquisition targets management not concerned about the company ability replace 
legacy systems acquisition opportunities have not waned

corporate tax rates given its higher proportion income that emanates from the
