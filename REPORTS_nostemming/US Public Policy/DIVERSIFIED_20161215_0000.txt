unregulated power generation expect both these drivers 
reverse with higher natural gas prices rising interest

constructive backdrop for the group with our upgrade driven 
four key themes 
higher commodity prices unregulated power generation positively levered 
higher gas coal and lesser extent oil prices the natural gas side our 
forecast mmbtu and mmbtu compares favorably 
average prices and above current forwards our refreshed 
analysis the marcellus utica region which has seen gas prices significantly 
discounted relative henry hub over the last several years due infrastructure 
bottlenecks also points higher local prices and thus narrower differentials 
versus henry hub see this dynamic positive for the pjm midatlantic power market which sits directly top the marcellus utica region 
lastly while see long term structural headwinds for thermal coal forecast 
and long term prices above levels this dynamic positive for power 
prices coal heavy markets particularly pjm and miso midwest 
attractive valuations strategic optionality result year date 
underperformance merchant power valuations are now very attractive our view 
most stocks the sector now reflect long term gas prices below mmbtu 
terminal level which unrealistically bearish our view and well below the 
forward curve from cash flow standpoint many are now reflecting sustainable 
free cash flow equity yields the range for some pure play 
independent power producers and diversified utilities see strategic action 
potential path unlock value private valuations for merchant power assets 
particularly natural gas plants are material premium those currently implied 
the public market 
tax reform could improve earnings and cash flow expect tax reform 
key focus and expect reduction federal corporate tax rates the 
most likely outcome diversified utilities and ipps are beneficiaries lower taxes 
would improve earnings and cash flow for the unregulated businesses many 
stocks the group this contrasts regulated utility peers which are unlikely 
see sustainable positive benefit from lower taxes 
rising interest rates while rising interest rates are negative driver for regulated 
utility valuation see the trend positive for unregulated power generation 
key headwind across all deregulated power markets has been low cost 
construction new gas power plants theme that supported the availability 
low cost financing higher interest rates increase the revenue requirement for

tax reform 
expect tax reform key focus and expect reduction federal 
corporate tax rates the most likely outcome diversified utilities and ipps are 
beneficiaries lower taxes would improve earnings and cash flow for the 
unregulated businesses many stocks the group this contrasts regulated utility 
peers which are unlikely see sustainable positive benefit from lower taxes 
key elements republican tax reform proposals focus three elements 
republican tax reform proposals that would have important implications for utilities 
and merchant power companies reduction the corporate income tax rate from 
the specific rate varies across the proposals elimination 
the deductibility interest expense for tax purposes which would implemented 
exchange for full and immediate expensing capex note that currently 
unclear whether the latter two provisions may elective mandatory for all 
industries based our dialogue with numerous parties believe reduction the 
corporate tax rate has the highest chance being passed while expensing all capex and 
eliminating the interest deduction are likely face heightened pushback from 
lawmakers given the widespread ramifications these policies would have across 
numerous industries 
diversified utilities and ipps generally positioned favorably relative regulated 
utilities tax reform scenario our estimates for hypothetical regulated utility 
with nol that would shield the utility from paying taxes for years reduction 
the tax rate would reduce cash flows during the nol usage period the tax 
benefits are passed through utility customers while the annual earnings growth 
would rise the other hand profitable unregulated operations will benefit 
directly from the decrease the corporate tax rate and this benefit does not get passed 
through customers several business model qualities maximize these benefits for 
diversified utility high percentage positive unregulated earnings small 
nonexistent nol positions and minimal non utility debt companies with large 
unregulated losses high parent interest expenses and large existing nol benefit less 
some cases are worse off from the tax reform proposals 
diversified utility company impacts the following table examine the potential 
impact tax reform proposals the diversified utilities under our coverage the first 
two columns represent the eps and ffo impact reduction corporate tax rates

eps represents change from implementing reduction corporate tax rate 
only 
ffo reduction lowered customer rates accounts for the cash impact from 
reduced utility customer rates from lower taxes well the cash impact the 
consolidated eps change lower tax rates will reduce pre tax income for regulated utilities 
the utility nol position hence not cash taxpayer this will also reduce cash 
flow this assumes that the benefit lower taxes passed through customers which 
may not necessarily the case given various rate case stay out provisions among 
utilities 
eps loss from interest isolates the impact losing interest deductibility 
tax shield assume this loss offset rates for all utility debt and that the net impact 
shareholders would driven non utility debt 
consolidated eps impact combines reduction tax rate and loss interest 
deductibility 
ffo reduction with capex fully expensed reflects the total change cash

pseg peg low levels debt meaningful non utility earnings contribution from 
pseg power and existing cash tax appetite make peg likely potential beneficiary 
the house tax reform plan the corporate tax rate were reduced from 
this alone would accretive peg earnings and ffo would increase 
our estimates the loss interest deductibility the other hand would lower 
earnings per share therefore when consolidating the changes see 
earnings accretion from cash flow standpoint including the net impact lower tax 
rate and the loss deductibility interest coupled with the ability expense capex 
for tax purposes peg would see boost ffo cash flow from operations the 
largest potential beneficiary within our coverage 
dominion large unregulated earnings contribution offsets relatively high level 
non utility debt peers the corporate tax rate were reduced estimate 
would see benefit eps and benefit ffo the loss interest 
deductibility however would drive partially offsetting eps decrease net 
both reform provisions were implemented estimate would see eps benefit 
and positive impact ffo 
most negatively impacted 
firstenergy high levels parent unregulated debt well sizeable nol 
which becomes less valuable corporate tax rates are reduced reduction the 
corporate tax rate would result decrease eps and reduction ffo and 
the loss interest deductibility would lead further drop eps our 
estimates both reform provisions were implemented lower tax rate and the loss 
interest deductibility coupled with the ability expense capex for tax purposes 
estimate would see negative impact eps and negative impact ffo 
note that there are few potential offsets for the company has committed 
exiting the unregulated merchant business which contributes the eps drag 
from the corporate tax rate cut additionally the company realizes cash inflows from 
asset sales its unregulated aes subsidiary this cash could used pay down 
parent debt another contributor the eps drag 
entergy etr above average parent earnings drag with very limited eps the 
merchant business entergy wholesale commodities ewc reduction the corporate 
tax rate would result decrease eps and reduction ffo and the loss 
interest deductibility would lead further drop eps our estimates both 
reform provisions were implemented estimate etr would see negative impact 
eps and negative impact ffo 
tax reform impact the ipps modest positive post nol usage see several 
impacts merchant power companies arising from reduction the corporate income 
tax rate first reduction the corporate tax rate would impact gaap net income 
and eps the near term for the merchant power stocks however ebitda and free 
cash flow fcf are the preferred metrics used evaluate these companies 
not see this eps impact meaningful the value the nol the ipps each have 
sizeable nol positions and will pay limited cash taxes over the next years during the 
period nol usage the impact tax rate reduction should neutral these firms 
and the time period over which the nol will used should unchanged this 
because the nol shields the same amount pre tax income from taxes regardless 
what the tax rate that income and pre tax income would unchanged beyond 
the period nol usage the ipps will see higher free cash flow lower tax rate cpn 
and dyn have nol balances that are likely shield them from paying significant cash 
taxes for years our estimates the tangible impact cash flows will not 
realized for long period time nrg nol position lasts through mid our 
estimates the impact post the nol usage period sooner the basis terminal
