executive summary 
forecast the energy storage market will grow 
more quickly than the consensus expectation increasing penetration renewable power generation significantly disrupting peak and non peak power demand particularly regulated states the rapid growth solar supply has resulted substantially lower midday power 
demand net solar power being produced causing 
record excess power supply some markets the anticipated near medium term growth wind power supply 
expected result similar disruption overnight 
power demand given that wind production typically 
strongest night see exhibit for example power 
demand duck graph expect storage grow rapidly 
the near term balance interday supply imbalances 
tive benefits are typically much greater than the benefit single 
customer receives utilities can effectively factor the collective benefits into their investment decisions for example energy storage 
reduces systemwide outages lowers power prices and more fully 
utilizes grid infrastructure all benefits that accrue every customer 
these types collective benefits are the very types that utilities are 
well positioned pursue 
key regulatory issue will affect the size the storage market

could nearly double the issue relates whether utilities can

why does energy storage depress power prices and margins for 
power plants energy storage will release stored power during periods high demand early evening and early morning when power 
prices are their highest storage effectively provides low cost 
source power eliminating the need for the highest cost least efficient conventional power plant

approach assessing the benefits customers from the deploy 
there little understanding the approach utilities will take

ests looking across the found that the collective benefits

the brattle report benefits energy storage are classified the

following broad categories 
the california duck curve shows that net demand for power falls 
dramatically midday solar reduces the need for power from the 
margins that the energy storage system itself can realize 
grid energy storage can redirect excess solar power the evening 
arbitraging the difference between peak and off peak power pri 
peak demand period 
ces well providing market driven grid stability services typically 
known ancillary services the brattle group found that the margin from this category benefits was generally insufficient its 
own justify widespread energy storage deployment 
collective grid benefits for all customers not just the owner 
the energy storage system including lower grid outages lower systemwide power prices and lower required grid expenditures through 
avoided power plant investment and greater utilization grid infrastructure such transmission lines based these benefits brattle

potential for storage ercot texas and adapts this 
approach important differences regional power market 
dynamics define the addressable market the deployment level which there incremental net benefit customers from deploying additional storage the point 
which incremental costs exceed incremental benefits the 
brattle group found that the optimal battery deployment 
size ercot was assuming round trip efficiency and hour discharge with merchant benefit 
approximately year this merchant benefit however 
does not capture the total system wide benefits storage 
which include power savings reliability and transmission 
distribution functions brattle estimated that these non merchant benefits represent total benefits for our 
calculations quantify non merchant benefits ercot

ercot our representative market arrive approximate merchant value benefit for each independent system operator iso 
most markets merchant value was equal the total 
customer benefits importantly the merchant value alone not high

summer california time use rates can higher during peak

some geographies some point the future this may tangible 
rate kwh 
risk opportunity depending your perspective for many years 
believe other business models will prevail not all which displace 
the utility grid but instead enable the utility grid continue sup 
port the increased growth renewables our view the two most 
prevalent approaches will utility driven approach which 
utilities deploy storage and earn regulated return capital 
deployed way enable the growth renewables and defer 
transmission distribution projects and customer driven 
approach which solar customers reduce their peak power usage 
resulting many cases significant utility bill savings discuss

the following are two approaches that can taken which storage 
developers deploying storage deregulated markets provide grid 
serves shave the peak

solar storage under this approach solar customers would use 
low price hours not economically feasible even under very aggres 
storage means reducing demand for power from the grid dur

does not perfectly coincide with peak periods demand for power 
the utility driven approach are sensing significant degree 
and because power prices during peak periods are often many multi

periods rather than purchase incremental power from the utility 
into its decision invest storage and this scope benefits 
very high rates this approach not only reduces costly energy pur 
think much broader than the scope any other business model 
chases but can also reduce customer demand charge demand

the key regulatory driver 
storage deregulated markets 
key regulatory issue will affect the size the storage 
market depending the outcome our addressable 
market forecast could nearly double the issue relates 
whether utilities can deploy storage deregulated competitive power markets which comprise the 
addressable storage market this question whether 
utilities can deploy storage effect competitive 
power generator currently under review the federal regulator ferc while believe utilities will not 
permitted deploy significant amounts storage 
deregulated markets are wrong the addressable 
market for storage will much larger potentially 
additional gwh increase the addressable 
market 
concerned that the policy statement while nominally limited 
storage resources could read reflect the commission views 
about the impact multiple payment streams market pricing 
more generally thus implicating broader regional discussions 
state policy initiatives and their interaction with competitive markets 
these issues which are currently being discussed several rto isos 
and their stakeholders will require careful and holistic consideration 
ensure that policy advancements can achieved while the benefits 
competition are preserved for customers

the policy statement summarily dismisses concerns regarding the
