risk from the north and from 
the south 
risks rising protectionism and higher rates are 
important mexico but when the dust settles the risks and 
challenges from within are likely important mexico lack 
plan and rising political polarization could affect the risk 
premium more than mexican eps 
what next for mexico the mexican market has come off terms 
since the elections last week the decline from the usdmxn rate 
the mxn now trading close the weaker end the band discussed dara 
blume our latam strategist interest rates have increased north 
both mxn and however remain underweight mexico latam 
context and continue suggest only selective addition mexico risk like 
the banks industrials and materials companies that benefit from lower mxn 
higher rates mexbol likely remain range bound for some time due global 
factors such reflation challenges trade and rising risks from within mexico 
argue this note mexico challenged not just risks nafta rising 
political fragmentation along the current lines economic divisions could the 
next challenge the investment narrative and risk premium even the dust 
settles from the nafta controversy 
the implications for mexico from the specter rising protectionism aren 
just economic could also play into the hand populists home mexico 
has plan for the potential shock from withdrawal from nafta the 
risk nafta could increase political polarization limiting the benefits from 
trade export focused northern states but polarization has already been rising 
period when expanding manufacturing has been key driver the economy 
why because the states least influenced nafta the south and with the 
smallest manufacturing presence are the ones with the most skepticism towards 
free trade and globalization these states generate gdp capita that only 
the level northern mexico and growth less than half the longterm average mexico political fragmentation nationwide but the antiestablishment vote very regional the bipolar economy increasingly evident 
bipolar political environment

growth according our global exposure guide mexican companies generate 
their revenues from abroad latam canada china and 
row compared brazilian corporates generating roughly their 
revenues outside their home country see global exposure guide may 
even within mexico listed companies have only moderate exposure

what have called the risk from the north the specter rising protectionism 
has dominated the mexican narrative recent months and should continue 
following the election result move the erect trade barriers would 
potentially deal severe blow mexico economic model undermining its ability 
generate the growth needed improve the welfare its population see nafta 
vista does rising protectionism challenge mexico investment narrative and economic 
model july following the results the election the debate over 
mexico outlook should shift towards gauging the materiality the risk from the 
north our macro team believes that the republican president would able 
make good his threat withdraw from nafta chooses although they think the 
constitutionality such action could challenged court trade policy area 
where the executive has the potential act unilaterally without congressional 
approval least the short term see election electing uncertainty 
november 
where invest probably too early construct portfolios positioned for changing 
political scenarios but the debate could kicked off sooner than usual particularly 
trade barriers arise the aftermath the election would opt for names with 
structural growth stories such gmexico femsa mexichem santander while the 
overall mexican stock market could suffer especially domestic stocks manufacturing 
exporters and interest sensitive stocks explored our nafta vista report and 
the following note precious metals and tourism could benefit depending how 
implemented ban gas exports mexico would have the most negative impact 
ienova ban natural gas exports would also have very detrimental 
implications for mexico industrial and electricity models 
what watch currently there second round voting elections for mexican 
president the current president won with the votes but given political 
fragmentation and independent candidates for the first time the threshold for 
victory could far lower the congress currently evaluating proposal 
amend the constitution allowing for second round case the winner the first 
round fails reach threshold the national electoral institute ine has 
established the deadline make any changes the election related legislation 
may

another important challenge for mexico the risk from within the risk from within 
boils down the prospect that growing political divide mexico could challenge the 
country status quo and investment narrative which anchored three main pillars 
responsible fiscal policy independent central bank and free trade shift towards 
populism our view something that mexico can ill afford importantly think this 
risk from within likely more relevant given the current election outcome 
which has opened the door for policy transformation rather than just incremental 
change and particular the tail risk nafta vista were materialize 
the focus and relevance the risk from within seems poised increase while 
mexico presidential contest still year and half away the outcome this year 
gubernatorial election already points toward more fragmented and uncertain political 
landscape the recent election voters who are dissatisfied with the current 
administration moved away from mainstream parties see exhibit turn this growing 
fragmentation coupled with rules allowing independents run for president for the 
exhibit more fragmented political scene 
first time and the incumbent low popularity means that the percentage vote 
threshold for becoming president could much lower 
than the past increasing the odds that mexico could end 
with fringe leader who could undermine the three pillars

the economic backdrop and local policy initiatives should 
determine the extent which the risk from within becomes 
critical factor for investment decisions via its potential impact 
the country risk premium the fallout from rising protectionism 
our view would play squarely into the hands populist forces 
mexico the shock from protectionism would likely lead 
weakening today supportive consumer backdrop thereby 
undermining the case made the center right parties that recent 
reforms have made households better off see exhibit 
similarly protectionism would hurt the wealthier northern states 
disproportionately where voters heavily favor center right 
parties however policymakers have important card they could 
use mitigate the risk from within reform that establishes 
second round for the presidential election approved this 
would severely limit the ability any fringe political force gain 
the presidency our view 
accordingly framework for assessing the risk from within 
should important tool for all mexico watchers this 
report examine evidence that the political divide widening 
and how the structure mexico economy could aggravate this 
divide then identify the main economic and policy factors 
monitor ahead forthcoming mexico elections both the key 
state races mid and the presidential contest even 
shift towards populism ultimately averted mexico may 
heading towards more fragmented voter base representing 
key challenge for the next administration 
some mexico watchers have argued that proactive diplomacy could the solution but 
the local electoral cycle likely limit the extent such efforts our view 
mexico first attempt take the initiative inviting the republican candidate 
august did not have the intended result leading the resignation the most powerful 
cabinet member and decline the executive popularity moreover any efforts 
proactively offer concessions the such some modest tariff adjustments 
paying for increased border security any other demand would likely highlighted 
the populist and anti reform camps ahead important gubernatorial elections 
mid and then the presidential contest year later 
believe that the more fragmented political field that followed the mid 
elections combined with the election cycle suggest that prospects mexico political 
class reaching consensus such unpopular matters rather slim that leaves 
policymakers facing difficult trade off between domestic campaign imperatives and 
efforts work together with the new administration order prevent legislation 
that goes against mexico interests 
the economic cum political divide 
key takeaways 
the economic divide will play key role the political divide risks nafta 
which have increased after the election outcome could exacerbate political 
polarization polarization has already been rising period when expanding 
manufacturing has been the key economic driver the economy fact the states 
least affected nafta the south with the lowest degree manufacturing 
activity seem the ones with the most scepticism towards 
polarization more likely affect mexico risk premium than earnings growth 
according our global exposure guide mexican companies generate their 
revenues from abroad latam canada china and row 
compared brazilian corporates generating their revenues outside their 
home country see global exposure guide may also within mexico 
listed companies have only moderate exposure the south later this report 
show the lower penetration lending the south and our latam retail 
analyst franco abelardo recently published mexico retail atlas introducing 
interactive map which shows that most retailers with exception chedraui 
have limited exposure the south and 
where invest with mexico watchers still digesting the outcome the 
election and waiting calibrate their portfolios potential policy shift 
probably too early construct portfolios positioned for changing political 
scenarios mexico but the debate could kicked off sooner than usual 
would opt for names with structural growth stories including gmexico femsa 
santander mexico and mexichem amid the risks from the north expect the 
overall mexican market suffer especially domestic stocks manufacturing 
exporters and interest sensitive stocks precious metals and tourism could benefit 
depending how implemented gas exports mexico are banned 
think ienova would top the list stocks that would feel negative impact ban 
natural gas exports would also have very detrimental implications for

can mexico tricolor and bipolar economy challenged new political divide 
most mexico watchers would agree that the economic divide between the wealthier 
north and lagging south has been long standing issue and already priced the 
country risk premium however widening political divide could challenge the 
country investment narrative anchored around three main pillars responsible fiscal 
policy independent central bank and free trade see mexico fiscal transition and the 
risk slippery slopes february think risks from political polarization 
which could demand higher risk premium may increase should the path towards the 
election play into the hands the populists discuss further this report 
will monitor three key variables see how this playing out 
two factors could accelerate the political divide resurgence protectionism 
the what have referred nafta vista could impair mexico ability 
deliver better conditions for its population and consequently raise the chances 
win for the far left moreover hard landing for the consumer happy hour 
consumer hangover could add existing dissatisfaction with the direction the 
economy and political leadership 
one factor could mitigate the political divide allowing second round for 
presidential elections could reduce the risk that candidate could win the election 
with only marginal support practice this could create facto duopoly 
power for the established center and right parties 
exhibit more fragmented political scene 
note others include votes for smaller parties and protest votes source ine state electoral colleges 
morgan stanley research 
there evidence political divide already while 
acknowledge local elections often bear limited resemblance 
the presidential contest think voting patterns the recent 
state elections provide early read the change the political 
landscape our analysis shows increasingly fragmented 
political scene which the far left morena party has gained 
share especially the south and good share voters are 
unwilling vote for mainstream parties the share protest 
voters votes cast the recent state elections see grey 
box below could represent important tie breaker especially 
the proposal add second round presidential elections 
not approved 
what our read from recent state elections 
mid out states held governorship elections the right wing 
party pan took seven the alone and alliance with the prd left wing 
largely the expense the ruling party which lost handful states where 
had been power for over eight decades while the pan and pan prd were 
winners the state elections voting patterns tell different story our take 
that was much defeat for the status quo and that broadens the range 
potential outcomes moreover highlight that mexico does not have 
second round for presidential elections president pena nieto epn won with 
the votes ahead left wing challenger lopez obrador amlo with 
political fragmentation increases the required threshold 
become president could decline further under the current election process 
our analysis looks the share votes cast the recent june election where 
governors were elected relative when these same states held 
similar election from this perspective none the three large parties pri pan 
and prd gained share the pot cast votes instead far left morena took 
million votes this year the party was not established until the 
gains morena raise the share pure left wing parties prd morena 
this year from roughly moreover the results show that the 
share people unwilling vote for the mainstream political choices including 
votes for smaller parties protest votes rose from 
why focus these three factors nafta vista consumer hangover and 
second round elections acknowledge there are other factors that will shape the 
path toward the presidential election and that the near term cabinet 
appointments and the political agenda the are dominating mexico watchers 
attention however seen other parts the world polarization the political 
landscape could ultimately change the long standing narrative mexico focus 
these three factors think they will key terms balancing aggravating the 
polarization the factors that think could aggravate the political polarization 
nafta vista and consumer hangover tap into two existing gaps north versus south 
and consumer versus economic performance 
the north south divide show further this note the northern states 
mexico can seen clear example paul rosenstein rodan big push theory 
with nafta playing important role the region economic development there 
clear evidence deeply rooted manufacturing ecosystem the north and 
center mexico meanwhile the south has lagged across the board the divide can 
traced back what have called the tricolor economy the north has been 
home most the country green export focused competitive manufacturing 
economy while the south has been more exposed the red inefficient stateowned economy think more protectionist stance from the nafta 
vista scenario would become headwind for the green economy and therefore 
for the country economic performance undermining support for openness and 
increasing discontent among the population which could play into the hands 
populism 
the consumer economy divide while less legacy issue today consumer 
confidence shows historically wide divide between upbeat perceptions 
household situation compared deeply depressed view the country outlook 
looking ahead several factors point downside risks confidence and the sofar resilient consumer growth dynamic see mexico taking stock the consumer 
may first the new administration follows through with its pledge 
renegotiate trade agreements will add drag already sluggish 
manufacturing sector that has been important job creator inflation already 
the rise from low base further peso weakness means pressure from tradables 
should persist government spending and fixed investment particular set 
decline and general uncertainty about the policy direction the could 
postpone hiring and investment decisions including some linked key reforms 
such energy why highlight this because are concerned that even with 
today favorable consumer backdrop political fragmentation already evident 
worsening the consumer backdrop would undermine the ability the centerright the political spectrum persuade the population that reforms have made 
them better off likely playing into the anti reform rhetoric from the left

potential second round elections would mitigating variable would reduce 
the risk presidential winner with marginal support could occur amid 
fragmented political scene congress has until may make any changes the 
election legislation the senate set evaluate the initiative calling for second round 
elections the event candidate achieves absolute majority the first round 
recent comments from the executive however suggest limited momentum within the 
administration for such measure any case think the end game could ultimately
