trump turned the base healthcare one 
the sectors most exposed the election 
outcome heading into the election examined 
potential policy levers across four election scenarios 
see what stake for healthcare are 
now two weeks post the trump turned the base 
scenario trump wins presidency with republican 
house and senate playing out and see significant 
issues that may addressed over the coming months 
which will impact our healthcare coverage see 
key policy issues for healthcare 
has healthcare been risked heading into the election healthcare had underperformed the pts largely reflecting 
fears over drug pricing exchange risk and utilization headwinds while 
healthcare has only seen modest recovery bps the two weeks 
following the election subsector performance does reflect investor perception 
modest risking specifically companies that historically benefitted from 
gross price inflation underperformed the pts pharma biotech 
distributors and pbms but have outperformed the market the two weeks 
following the election the reverse true for equipment supplies continue 
see great deal uncertainty little known about how trump 
administration will address the drug pricing debate what aca may replaced 
with that said trump presidency does leave more positive biotech 
pharma and distributors see upgrade action prevent drug price inflation 
appears less likely medical devices and tools remain more insulated 
there bit more clarity around trump plan for tax reform and repatriation 
trump tax plan includes lowering the corporate income tax from 
while number healthcare subsectors stand benefit the more 
domestically dependent industries such hospitals mcos and services are 
likely benefit more relative internationally diversified industries such 
major pharma large cap biotech and tools trump has also proposed one time 
repatriation tax accumulated profits foreign subsidiaries and 
taxing future profits foreign subsidiaries annually earned the main 
beneficiaries from such repatriation tax would include major pharma large cap 
biotech and large cap medical devices 
would like acknowledge the policy insights provided our fixedincome colleagues michael zezas and mark schmidt see electing

key policy issues for healthcare 
drug pricing 
drug price inflation has been the key controversy weighing healthcare stocks 
companies that historically benefitted from gross price inflation underperformed 
the from ranging from large cap pharma down 
election day biotech down spec pharma down generics 
down drug distributors down and pbms down over concerns that 
clinton presidency would either require drug companies self regulate avoid 
blame shame create more transparency that would lower inflation levels from 
low teens mid single digits 
trump presidency and republican sweep likely remove the overhang while the new 
administration healthcare agenda still short details the topic drug pricing has 
not surfaced either the public discussion healthcare policy since the election 
the healthcare section the trump transition website focused aca and think 
the new administration less likely prioritize drug inflation its long list 
domestic agenda items moreover while escalating drug costs have become bipartisan 
issue over the last months previous congressional calls for action were led house 
and senate democrats and think are less likely picked republicans who 
traditionally oppose government intervention into market pricing note that elect 
and transition team leader mike pence hails from indiana where eli lilly 
headquartered and one the largest employers the state trump and pence have 
highlighted indiana relatively strong jobs and economic growth during pence term 
governor might expected not advocate intervention what could viewed 
part indiana successful growth story and potentially model for other states 
trump the campaign trail 
drug pricing when comes time negotiate the cost drugs are going 
negotiate like crazy 
the pharmaceutical industry they have fantastic lobby they take care 
all the senators the congressmen 
new hhs cms heads and part demo final rule are key signposts conversations 
with our contacts suggest paul ryan june proposal the republican 
healthcare blueprint the proposal addresses the need lower overall healthcare 
costs but does not point specifically regulation drug pricing and highlights the 
medicare part program success benchmark for other initiatives lower 
medicare costs the program would adopt the competitive structure proven successful 
medicare part the prescription drug benefit ensure affordability through marketbased competition related biopharma the plan more focused streamlining 
clinical trials and reforming the fda drug approval process that said ultimately the 
hhs secretary will key setting the tone and agenda the short list for hhs 
secretary includes republicans bobby jindal and tom price and biopharma executive 
rich bagger last but not least the part demo when proposed march was 
initially viewed back door for regulating drug pricing however are within the 
day window from inauguration the publication the final rule most likely 
delayed until the new administration takes office when and the final rule published 
and how watered down will from proposal should provide insight the potential 
role cms the management drug pricing 
key state ballot defeats further marginalize drug pricing debate from the public stage 
the two healthcare ballot initiatives that failed pass this election were amendment 
colorado which would have created coloradocare single payer system for 
the state paid with additional income tax and proposition california which 
would have tied state agency drug prices those paid the department 
veteran affairs proposal the pharmaceutical lobby spent approximately 
campaign against these failures could further support deprioritization the drug 
pricing agenda washington 
aca medicaid 
the prospect repeal the aca under republican administration will remain 
overhang for hospitals and medicaid mcos however replacement should look 
retain gains insurance coverage following the medicaid mcos and hospitals repeal 
the aca would most negative for the services space due declines utilization 
and lesser extent pharma and biotech see limited disruption for med tech and 
life science tools under the repeal replace scenario trump has vowed repeal and 
replace the affordable care act part his broader healthcare agenda although 
trump specific plan light details promotes medicaid block grants the sale 
insurance across state lines and allowing individuals deduct insurance premiums 
from their taxes 
under full repeal the aca the cbo estimates uptick uninsured 
which view bear case scenario given the political ramifications clawing back 
insurance coverage from lower income americans note that while the gop 
favor clawing back medicaid expansion funding all states continue think that 
rolling back expansion the states that have already expanded which includes elect 
gov mike pence own state indiana unlikely with respect the commercial 
market think that rather than scrapping the existing marketplace infrastructure the 
gop will elect pursue reforms such age based tax credits looser underwriting 
restrictions such widening the age bands and increased adoption hsa 
healthcare savings accounts ease the tax burden paying for healthcare for 
individuals 
exhibit cbo estimates the repeal aca effects insurance coverage 
source congressional budget office morgan stanley research 
while scale back the aca expected adversely impact hospitals there may 
offsets medicare base payment amounts revert those used under prior law 
recall the hospitals were targeted one the major sources funding for 
healthcare reform with the cbo estimating billion savings over years there 
were several statutes that impacted the hospitals which effected medicare base 
payment the most significant were medicare productivity and market basket 
adjustments billion over years medicare disproportionate share hospital 
dsh payments billion medicaid dsh payments billion readmission 
reduction program billion and hospital acquired conditions penalties 
billion 
result these cuts the base payment amounts which medicare payment 
updates will apply are well below what they would have been under prior law while 
unclear whether the base amounts would adjusted upward repealing the aca may 
require medicare revert those used under prior law but the department health 
and human services hhs would need decide how calculate those payments once 
the law repealed fact the cbo estimates that the majority direct spending for 
medicare under aca repeal scenario about billion estimated billion 
would stem from repealing provisions the aca that imposed reductions payment 
rates slowed increases payment rates relative prior law for services covered 
under parts and medicare 
relatively greater leniency fewer limitations 
within healthcare would likely see greater leniency under president trump given 
our reading the party platforms specifically the republican party platform does not 
contain explicit antitrust enforcement language but rather mentions privatization 
themes that said note that the republican platform makes explicit mention cost 
transparency including ensure vigorous competition healthcare and because cost 
awareness the best guard against over utilization will promote price transparency 
consumers can know the cost treatments before they agree them 
while managed care mergers have captured headlines healthcare overall 
intensive sector historically pharma has been the most driven 
subindustry within healthcare while not believe this would see slowdown 
note that medtech and tools are recently seeing increased activity and its six 
pending deals represent enterprise value pharma pending deals 
see exhibit 
given recent news flow suggesting the doj will pursue litigation prevent both 
transactions due anticompetitive concerns anthem cigna and aetna humana are 
likely most exposed medtech tools rank next considering significant pending 
transactions within this group see limited risks under trump presidency for 
ftc doj enforcement action note that abbott jude has received second 
request 
within pharma and biotech see deal risks low but likely deal specific there are 
several smaller pending deals with less disruption broad patient base that said 
given sensitivities around healthcare costs from both parties see deals that could 
result rising drug prices likely incrementally more exposed

corporate tax reform and repatriation 
corporate tax reform more likely incremental than drastic morgan stanley 
research strategists believe that the base case corporate tax reform outcomes would 
biased toward the status quo and incrementalism policy changes that said 
plan watch potentially impactful changes the areas corporate tax rate cutting 
and repatriation incentives 
lower statutory corporate tax rate proposed trump trump plan includes lowering 
the corporate income tax from clinton had plans for corporate tax rate 
reduction potential beneficiaries while number healthcare subsectors stand 
benefit from lower tax rates believe that more domestically dependent 
industries such facilities managed care and all services are likely benefit 
more relative more internationally diversified industries such major pharma and 
large cap biotech given the former profit base the the latter 
geographically diversified profit pools which already benefit from lower corporate 
tax rates 
repatriation with one time tax seems likely trump has proposed one time deemed 
mandatory repatriation tax accumulated profits foreign subsidiaries 
and taxing future profits foreign subsidiaries annually earned the morgan stanley 
strategy team estimated that there trillion accumulated profits offshore with 
that sitting within the tech and pharma sectors potential beneficiaries 
believe that major pharma and large cap biotech are likely see large benefits relative 
other industries given the magnitude their offshore profit and cash relative

nih funding 
for nih funding still see improved outlook view the outlook for nih 
funding largely unchanged post election congressional support for the nih and 
medical research funding more broadly strong and bipartisan arguably muting the 
importance the presidential election leadership from both parties was solidly 
favor restoring funding the nih after the sequester induced pullback and 
this support likely continues under trump who has record supporting broad 
range medical research efforts his personal life 
trump record shows has helped raise money for variety cancer groups 
including susan komen the prostate cancer foundation and the lustgarten 
foundation for pancreatic cancer research separately the donald trump foundation 
has supported groups working range high profile disease initiatives stressedbudget scenario trump relatively greater focus infrastructure and defense 
compared healthcare may result nih funding being put the backburner trump 
has indicated would consider cuts the environmental protection agency epa 
support efforts views more urgent but has not suggested research funding 
target 
the backdrop for nih funding healthy with bipartisan support our view that nih 
funding likely remain uptrend continuing the improving trajectory 
the last year outside balanced budget scenario where broad spending constraints 
emerge june the senate appropriations committee approved the first labor hhs bill 
since including second for and incremental increases funding 
increase for the nih following the increase approved december the 
increase the nih budget for was the largest years outside the 
stimulus and was actually larger than the budget increase requested president 
obama between and funding was modest downtrend 
exhibit nih budget increases constrained budget impasse any budget would progress

more recently discussions related the century cures act suggest the 
incremental nih funding associated with the broadly popular provision could high 
both democratic senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and republican 
house speaker paul ryan have noted since the election that passage cures 
legislation high priority the increase would take the nih budget roughly 
including over for alzheimer research and for president obama 
precision medicine initiative near term congress may pass stopgap bill that would 
keep funding flat until march before potential increase making any real benefit the 
life science tools space unlikely emerge until mid key congressional players 
have indicated their aim set pattern sustainable and regular increases for the 
nih budget citing broad constituent support

delivering package offsets enable second consecutive step nih funding

meaningful threats trump position statement mentioned remov ing barriers entry 
into free markets for drug providers that offer safe reliable and cheaper products 
though the pharmaceutical industry the private sector drug companies provide 
public service allowing consumers access imported safe and dependable drugs from 
overseas will bring more options consumers 
tax reform and cash access may increase benefiting broader biopharma major

would lower the corporate tax and provide one time deemed mandatory 
repatriation with tax rate for biotech this positions amgen and gilead gain 
access cash and could significantly lower biogen tax rate biogen the

medical device companies are generally insulated from election risk relative other 
healthcare sectors they are insulated from major debates surrounding drug pricing 
and lessor extent aca while the mechanisms control medical device pricing 
and utilization may tightening through accountable care initiatives such bundling 
and accountable care organizations acos the direct election links are modest and 
loosely derivative while republican leaning government may more pro business 
with more limited government controls bending the cost curve and controlling 
healthcare costs still inevitable imperative elections have not historically been 
major driver device performance and continue see improving fundamentals 
across the medical device sector including mitigating pricing pressure improving 
approval cadence economy easing mco utilization pressures and greater acuity this 
unlikely change materially even with fears around aca wind down 
the single biggest healthcare variable following trump victory will around 
repealing replacing aca and devices are only derivatively exposed have stated 
prior reports see multiple factors that have driven device acceleration over the 
last several years and following aca the group acceleration has been relatively 
consistent with the prior years ahead aca our january utilization report 
discussed that our coverage has seen bps organic growth acceleration each 
year from and even following the slowdown seen the sector pace 
for bps acceleration data from our previous hospital surveys 
potentially show impact inpatient and outpatient volumes have ticked since 
the start however would note that the economy likely has played large 
role acuity also worth considering our survey work has shown acuity levels are 
among the highest levels have seen years and whether this related adverse 
selection within exchanges worth monitoring recall pointed out greater 
slowdown among implanters higher acuity procedures than among suppliers our 
recent report eps season rather misremember see the device inflection and 
not waiting exhale devices for additional information 
names exposed hospital capex will focus for investors our recent hospital 
survey suggested that the election cycle did not impact hospital purchasing patterns 
during but that could all change following the trump victory the consensus view 
was that clinton would win while our survey and results have shown consistent 
strength the hospital capex environment over the past two years uncertainty around 
where healthcare reform heading does have the potential cause hospitals push 
off certain investments which risk for capex exposed medical device names key 
stocks within our coverage with large exposure capex include stryker hill rom 
hologic and intuitive surgical intuitive and hologic are likely less exposed intuitive 
has not historically followed traditional capital cycles and hologic consumable

secondary debates will revolve around device tax repeal and cash repatriation 
given strong bipartisan support for device tax repeal and the current two year 
suspension already place the odds are good for tailwind for device eps 
noted our prior work the suspension the device tax was average eps 
boost for for device companies our coverage while acknowledge that the

drug pricing fears have subsided but this was not the critical debate for the pharma 
channel tools the surface election related relief for biopharma clear positive 
for tools the specter tougher pricing trends clinton presidency fades and drug 
pricing referendum efforts california were unsuccessful our enthusiasm this point 
was short lived after the election the results our recent pharma lab survey called 
for slowdown see pharma lab survey still believe those companies 
emphasizing consumables and the market are well positioned namely tmo and 
qgen see surveys about tmo between the intuitive appeal trump more handsoff approach biopharma relative clinton and weaker capital spending from 
pharma labs see next year potentially mixed for the pharma end market 
budget agreement alone would positive this environment see support for 
nih research funding strong and bipartisan and see nothing the trump agenda 
that presents risk this view recent commentary from both the republican speaker 
the house and democrat senate majority leader illustrate the breadth positive 
sentiment believe recent pressure academic spending equipment largely 
tied weakness nih funding releases amidst the current continuing resolution 
framework washington that precedes budget agreement and not symptomatic 
any longer lived structural issues our recent academic lab survey supports this view 
with the outlook for labs looking incrementally brighter bifurcation 
emerges between the and european funding environments see global academic 
survey passage budget could enable funding releases and equipment purchase 
recovery 
the largest fundamental impact from the republican sweep could pressure the 
aca which could impact utilization and spending the diagnostics channel 
republican efforts repeal the aca recent years occurred environment where 
obama veto made legislative efforts unlikely become reality the near term 
see reform more likely than outright repeal full repeal would present risk 
backlash from voters who gained coverage under the aca that said are 
incrementally more attuned the risk slower utilization trends and slower hospital 
capital spending growth given utilization metrics from certain hospital 
operators have been trending lower with hca suggesting inpatient demand trends were 
moderating recall hospital spend critical debate for the diagnostics 
channel see diagnostic markets which drives tools spend could see this 
utilization risk materialize the diagnostics channel for qgen dhr and lesser 
extent tmo and ilmn regardless any aca risk and action fund alter the
