president trump has announced that the united states will withdraw from the 
paris climate accord added that will begin negotiations enter either 
the paris accord entirely new transaction terms that are fair the united 
states its businesses its workers its people its tax payers would expect this 
long process though with other countries unlikely agree more 
attractive terms for the world second largest emitter greenhouse gases 
devin mcdermott 
our view remains that despite this announcement the climate trajectory 
largely unchanged given that current country commitments are insufficient 
meet the stated goal acknowledge the possible risk that other countries 
could follow suit withdrawing from the agreement but none have voiced this 
yet while europe and china are doubling down fact trump decision appears 
divergence from what many companies and investors have been signaling 
lately further reiterate our view that most sectors are currently driven 
economics and technology rather than policy 
exit from the agreement will take several years because the has already 
ratified the paris agreement officially retreating from its commitment would take 
four years unless the were exit altogether the parent treaty 
establishing the unfccc which presumably would void obligations both 
agreements one year unclear which option trump weighing upon exiting 
the agreement the will joining only nicaragua and syria and leaving 
signatory parties the lurch note that these are the only two climate 
convention member states not sign nicaragua because believed the 
agreement did not far enough remaining voluntary and syria for the 
obvious reason its ongoing civil war 
penalty remain agreement was intentionally designed not 
have legal enforcement countries commitments order allow the 
accept the agreement without vote the senate this means that trump 
could theory have done nothing paris and still rolled back environmental 
policies this would suggest other motives the administration making 
statement unequivocally against the paris agreement likely appease 
support base opposed remaining neutral taking action 
republicans warned that not exiting would put risk two letters trump 
from elected officials last week were support the withdrawal one from

attorneys general and another from senators among their arguments against 
staying the pact was that would open the country litigation risk 
commitments were not kept 
withdrawal could damage negotiations with other countries most countries 
favor the paris accord and they have made known they will not view exit 
favorably potentially thorny issue consider the bilateral agreements 
action against climate change that the made the last couple years with 
china and canada unclear whether the administration intends walk away 
from those well 
payments the green climate fund stop the obama administration 
pushed through the contributions committed the green 
climate fund which have been locked however the other will not 
forthcoming this isn surprise though given funding was earmarked the 
recent budget proposal 
climate trajectory largely unchanged either way our view regardless 
trump policies carbon reduction commitments the and the other nearly 
countries party the paris climate agreement are known insufficient 
meet the agreement well below degree celsius goal thus the climate 
trajectory likely experience only slight shift result trump policies 
policy reversals the would challenged meet its ndc target 
reduction below levels with the reduction corporate average 
fuel economy cafe standards the positive side however renewables and 
natural gas generation have been growing rapidly displacing coal 
noted economics are still driving not regulation our energy 
commodities team fundamental analysis power generation economics shows 
that longer term coal cannot compete with natural gas renewables even 
unsubsidized basis recent report here they cut the coal burn 
forecast and now see only modest year over year improvement with 
majority gains lost due ongoing competition from gas and growing 
renewables 
the rate change solar and wind economics picking think more 
rapidly than investors appreciate with nearly price reduction solar 
panels over just years and wind power with all cost windier 
portions the that that the all revenue needed for new gasfired plant kwh just this month tucson electric power tep 
arizonan utility signed year contract with nextera buy energy what 
reportedly the lowest price for solar achieved the date below 
kwh wind has already achieved all costs kwh 
with tax credits and nextera expects wind kwh product 
even without tax credits early next decade this progress largely driven 
improvements wind turbine technology taller tower design and wider rotor 
diameters which could drive net capacity factors nearly 
reactions and potential reactions from countries companies and 
investors 
some countries may want follow exit there may developing 
countries that are glad for excuse exit the agreement due the burden 
they perceive will cause them however note that during 
negotiations countries agreed not only hold the temperature increase well 
below but also pursue efforts limit above pre industrial 
levels the mention the more ambitious target was actually bargaining 
chip bring more countries into the agreement rather than fewer 
while other countries take this opportunity step response rising 
global climate concerns since the election many countries have doubled 
down their climate change rhetoric and are not echoing the shifting stance 
the carbon european foreign ministers have committed raising 
awareness among partners and reinvigorating global alliances climate 
policies including bilateral meetings with canada china india and iran some 
argue that china could take the renewable energy lead from the and play 
critical role the paris climate agreement continues along its current path 
three years coal consumption declines and shutting small inefficient coal 
mines 
even individual states have been spurred into action recent days the 
california senate has proposed series bills ranging from accelerating 
renewable energy targets keeping landmark federal environmental laws such 
the clean air act and the clean water act enforceable under state law even 
were they eliminated these bills are part viewed insurance against 
federal action this follows the senate recently rejecting the repeal 
limits methane emissions from oil and gas drilling amid what was growing 
string recent environmental policy reversals this was the first fail 
companies have been stepping too arguing for competitiveness group 
large public companies and ceos signed two recent letters urging president 
trump remain the paris climate agreement for reasons competitiveness 
job creation and business risk management these follow hundreds others 
including from energy and coal companies which had started early 
last fall after the election 
last but not least investors are speaking recent agms shareholders 
have been particularly outspoken climate related proposals just yesterday 
exxonmobil shareholders making votes voted against management 
recommendation and favor the company reporting its climate progress
