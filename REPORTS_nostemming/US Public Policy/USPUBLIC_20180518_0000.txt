there scant time for deal and new decision 
points risk factors are quickly coming into play 
house speaker paul ryan politico had 
argued for may deadline for getting new 
nafta deal done based the notion that 
congress needs days between formal deal 
announcement and vote while still believe there 
are few weeks wiggle room the usitc can 
deliver quick post deal report now clear that new political decision points 
have been brought into scope the announcement deal happens later than 
late may early june then the midterm election outcome becomes factor 
the current congress would not have the opportunity vote nafta the 
mexico election july comes into play with the new administration coming 
into office december and potentially putting their own stamp deal 
both situations changes power raise execution risks and possible delays 
regardless these variables key content challenges remain factoring into 
execution risk and the waning chances completed nafta 
our view nafta should survive but don get complacent resolution 
unlikely before execution risks remain created decision tree 
based key decision points that lead groupings outcomes deal 
deal limbo withdrawal 
from this framework discern key points for investors 
expect deal delayed but done fully completed nafta 
more likely than not but completion likely delayed into line 
with our base case from january see nafta can still make deal 
january 
substantial execution risks remain but worst case outcomes unlikely 
while still see withdrawal unlikely there still meaningful risk 
negotiation limbo persisting beyond given the variety issues 
still negotiated this creates substantial uncertainty for all parties 
election risks now key variable given execution risks and resulting

delays outcomes from the midterm elections and mexico presidential 
election take new importance investors 
time isn your side longer delay sign that disagreements are 
intractable perhaps due shifting political dynamics both sides hence higher probability that the withdraws 
investment takeaway uncertain status quo already the price 
market pricing the tail events done withdrawal are the only potential market movers around nafta our view see 
some downside risks for mxn and cad the short run the market 
continues expect deal the weeks come against our expectation 
later deal potentially signed however the worst case scenario 
seems have been avoided the prospects nafta termination 
appear very unlikely this point the other hand the most bullish 
outcome one which the parties agree something relatively soon but 
reaction should somewhat limited pricing already reflects similar 
scenario 
mexico equities much like the best and worst case outcomes 
that matter equities with those outcomes carrying lower probability 
default our current stance equal weight within larger latam 
portfolio 
what timeline 
now critical for investors understand how the calendar around the nafta 
approval process works that because the formal announcement new agreement 
isn the end the process but rather the beginning fresh one and the longer 
takes for that process begin the more likely that fresh risks shifting political 
preferences the and mexico via their elections get brought into scope 
the nafta approval timeline 
while there some flexibility the timeline the administration accounting for 
days before implementation bill can introduced congress negotiators must 
notify congress days before their intent sign agreement and within those 
days days before the deal signed the text must final and then the 
international trade commission itc has days issue report the deal within 
those days the legal text the agreement must finalized days before 
submitting the bill congress days from may november which means 
that hypothetically congress could introduce the bill and pass quickly the lame 
duck session after the midterm elections however there some room push the 
timeline back both introduce the bill later december the itc report that 
due finished earlier than expected however acknowledge that regardless the 
timing agreement the timeline very tight for passage calendar 
exhibit what the timeline for congressional approval nafta

example let assume that the ustr had notified congress may their 
intent enter into agreement 
may days august the earliest that the could sign the nafta 
agreement 
august days september assuming zero days pass between 
submitting the final legal text congress and the itc report completed 
days september the earliest the implementing bill could sent congress 
august days november assuming the itc takes the full days 
the report the implementation bill could sent congress november 
legislative days between september and december house days 
session days senate days 
congress has maximum session days pass implementation bill under tpa 
course congress could move faster than the allowed time and the two houses are 
allowed act concurrently however any timeline already assumes that congress 
moves quickly and does not use all the allowed session days 
some press reports have indicated that the deal may narrowed down only include 
changes that can made the president and not need change the 
implementing law passed congress additionally reports have said that lighthizer 
has considered withdrawing from nafta order force congress hand approve 
the newly renegotiated deal however based lighthizer recent comments about 
needing congressional approval not think either those are likely 
congress unlikely vote make tpa expire july but 
would affect the congressional process 
the executive branch using trade promotion authority tpa granted 
congress negotiate the deal tpa will automatically extended beyond july 
unless denied vote congress before then any agreement entered into 
before tpa expires the case that congress did vote discontinue the 
authority would still considered under the tpa process 
however because the administration cannot enter into agreement until 
days after has notified congress his intent there not enough time 
remaining for the president use current tpa authority tpa must continue 
beyond july again congress only has not take action let renew 
order for the implementing bill follow the expedited procedure through 
congress tpa advantageous because allows congress vote with simple 
majority the senate and the deal cannot amended tpa expires and 
congress intends still consider the implementing bill the bill would travel 
through congress under regular order meaning members could offer 
amendments there would time limitation for passage and the bill would 
require super majority the senate 
our view the most likely issue affect tpa the investor state dispute 
settlement provisions the negotiation instructions included tpa 
congress stated that trade agreements should provide meaningful procedures for 
resolving investment disputes congress does not think that the agreement 
reflects their objectives they can adopt procedural disapproval resolution 
pdr disallow using the expedited procedure pass the implementing bill but 
because canada and mexico both oppose changing the isds provisions believe 
ultimately this will negotiated congress satisfaction for more the tpa 
process see nafta can still make deal january 
initial agreement timing impacts execution risks 
while our base case that the negotiations continue into extending the timeline 
complete deal does raise execution risk explain the section below the

decision points what drives uncertainty 
elections 
with the days left complete deal waning the outcome the november 
midterm elections come into play deal completed the next few weeks 
possible that the current congress could vote the lame duck session the time 
november and december after the election but before the new session begins not 
the implementing deal will voted the next congress which will start during the 
first week january 
although too early predict the midterm election outcomes democrats currently 
hold advantage the generic ballot polls and many observers believe they could 
take control the house five thirty eight taking control the senate 
considered more difficult trade issues not necessarily fall along party lines 
congress there are pro trade democrats and democrats representing areas that would 
suffer the withdrew from nafta however democrats may have issues with some 
aspects the deal they are not their liking the deal not complete yet 
influence the way the administration negotiates also democratic speaker would have 
the power bring the bill the floor not however republicans may keep the 
house but would still have different makeup and potentially smaller majority 
lighthizer said that was not necessarily concerned that there would different 
political makeup congress but did say that having new congress could 
make harder pass the deal the new congress will have its own priorities and 
they substantially different they not going happy with whatever 
opinion because was negotiated with lot input from the previous congress said 
lighthizer wall street journal 
mexico elections 
mexico the midst electoral process that could influence the timing 
nafta deal even jeopardize the success ongoing negotiations altogether the 
nafta talks are taking place during the current administration final half year office 
mexico will hold national elections july which will followed long transition 
period for the executive running through december september for congress 
july voters will decide between platforms consistent with policy continuity and 
options that seem offer alternative path the latter what dub plan 
finding support from the current frontrunner who has offered deliver meaningful 
changes economy policy accordingly the specter possible changes after december 
mexican policy priorities areas relevant nafta wages energy protection 
well the negotiating teams creates strong incentives for current officials reach 
consensus short order 
while candidates platforms remain vague all leading presidential contestants have 
made comments support for nafta minor criticisms nafta from least one 
candidate have not focused the benefits free trade the industrial link the 
per but rather view that nafta may not have lived its promise bringing 
prosperity all mexico without doubt nafta contributed marked 
improvement central and northern mexico thanks the rise its competitive 
export focused manufacturing base contrast southern parts the country were 
left behind the criticism more about the need for greater redistribution and thus 
fiscal policy one rather than about the merits openness and trade second nafta 
and the relationship with the not seem among the issues that matter 
voters most whom tend support the treaty least show indifference instead 
topics such corruption insecurity and the economy top the list voters concerns 
the race 
the july date often perceived investors red line for mexican negotiators 
yet that view seems misplaced our view the main relevance talks lingering past 
may has with challenges presented the timeline for congressional approval 
the rather than from mexico side any deal reached this year would have 
ratified mexico new senate whose first ordinary session starts september vote 
favor nafta the new senate argue would give the deal sense 
legitimacy even approved during the transition period that runs through december 
fact mexico became the first country ratify the tpp comfortable majority 
votes favor against late april none the main candidates censured the 
move with criticism coming mostly from some industries that are more exposed asian 
competition such shoes and textiles 
unlike the long timeline required for congressional approval mexico the process 
more flexible while there are specific time limits understand that negotiators 
tend frequent contact with relevant committee members turn that could 
help speed the approval process once passed the committee level the treaty 
would head the senate floor the current president importantly could send the 
nafta agreement congress preferred initiative two per session are 
allowed which has discussed and voted maximum days accordingly 
would not expect there issues for the senate ratify revised nafta and for the 
president sign before december nafta worth highlighting viewed favorably 
most mexicans 
absence finalized treaty december could increase risks delays from the 
mexico side our view new administration mexico may attempt take ownership 
the nafta narrative adding its own set priorities the risk delays 
however depends the outcome july vote victory traditional party would 
point continuity policy objectives similar scenario when even before 
taking office the current administration successfully collaborated with the incumbent 
approve labor reform yet even under win plan advocate still assign low 
probability scenario that leads delays forces negotiations back square one 
mentioned above all candidates have spoken favorably nafta moreover 
apparent policy priorities such rethink the future opening the energy sector 
more expansionary fiscal stance attempts increase wages would not effectively 
constrained nafta deal our view the executive can stop oil auctions and decide 
the direction the state oil company for example large changes the minimum wage 
have observed the past two years little over cumulative would not 
require nafta legislation move forward accordingly assign greater probability 
scenario under which new administration attempts make cosmetic changes 
order put his stamp the deal rather than one which forces parties restart the 
entire process 
given the importance nafta the mexican narrative legislators are attempting 
increase the required threshold modify including any potential attempt 
terminate international treaties late april senators from the ruling party unveiled 
initiative aimed modifying the constitution that any changes treaties would need 
two thirds majority the text specified that nafta matter national security for 
all three nations and that higher vote threshold would shield and other treaties 
well from the excessive impulse determined group currently the 
constitution does not specify whether the ratifying international treaties requires 
supermajority default the approval has been done via simple majorities and 
quorum least two thirds senators without going into the merits setting 
higher bar for congressional approval the timing the initiative seems aimed 
creating barrier the ability the next administration undermine nafta and 
more broadly mexico commitment trade openness

canada role 
robert rosener 
canadian government officials not appear hurry rush deal 
nafta arguing that bad deal would worse than deal all moreover the 
next federal election not until late there near term constraint 
incentivizing policymakers into accelerated timeline and the policymakers 
currently leading the trade negotiations will likely remain place throughout the 
entirety the negotiations 
procedurally canada should have easier time approving deal trade 
negotiators will have consulted with provincial governments and relevant leaders 
and the canadian parliament controlled the same party prime minister 
trudeau making very likely that parliament will approve final deal 
the timeline for nafta deal does get dragged into our base case 
the key consequence will for monetary policy longer timeline for nafta 
settlement would serve reinforce our expectations for very shallow and 
cautious path for rate hikes from the bank canada boc the boc has said that 
nafta related uncertainty already reducing investment and export growth 
the boc april monetary policy report estimated that uncertainty around trade 
policy reduced the level business investment and would reduce 
investment much the end likewise the boc estimated 
that exports were reduced result trade policy uncertainty 
and would reduced much the end this one reason 
why policymakers are maintaining accommodative monetary policy stance and 
raising rates only very gradually and cautiously

stretched reach something before the mexican elections july with recent

our base case does not differ substantially from market consensus

two reasons why markets have not been trading the election actively history 
suggests see mexico mxn trading politics are prospects early deal that would 
play against short mxn positions ahead the election and cost carry clear 
breach the soft deadlines and the acknowledgement the authorities that they are
