adjustability 
address joint session congress last night the 
president the united states highlighted priorities his 
administration while details remain outstanding expected 
believe policy highlights leave the option for border 
adjustability the table 
how will the level the playing field president trump indicated effort 
seek significant reduction the corporate tax rate noting that the current tax 
structure the taxes american companies one the highest rates the 
world putting domestic companies disadvantage international peers 
commentary around leveling the playing field suggested addressing tariffs and 
taxes placed companies attempting export goods and services outside 
the country indications budget neutrality how initiatives would paid 
for were not included the commentary tax policy not yet fully defined 
however while continue see odds stacked against border adjustable tax 
bat plan comments last night not rule out border adjustability leaving 
options and overhang open our view 
why border adjustability risk for services using the house republican 
etter way tax blueprint guide adoption border adjustable tax system 
may disallow the deductibility goods and services sourced from outside the 
country for companies within our coverage estimate that this could 
potentially inflate taxable income billions dollars for companies where 
these costs lose their status deductible expenses the impact border 
adjustment could outweigh anticipated cut corporate tax rate expected 
tailwinds for more detail potential risks benefits our coverage from 
tax reform please refer the global foundation note published last week 
legislative risks bat underappreciated but visa reform manageable 
who the best and least well positioned vendors with greater exposure 
higher value strategic consulting agile development processes are better 
positioned our view offset the potential impact bat across 
vendors with exposure services believe ibm covered katy huberty 
and csc are best positioned while seen indian heritage vendors such 
ctsh most risk vendors with intellectual property outside the may 
able adjust cost structure bringing back onshore and those with exports 
may have offsets however traditional outsourcing vendors may struggle 
adjust with meaningful offshore labor costs and lack export revenue 
offset costs sourced from outside the country
