metals mining call 
how new commerce head 
could benefit steel 
president trump secretary commerce nominee wilbur 
ross indicated willingness self initiate trade cases his 
confirmation hearing last week think this along with his 
other policy stances could tailwind for the steel industry 
self initiating trade cases would new focus wilbur ross president trump 
nominee for secretary commerce had his confirmation hearing last week 
called for policies promoting pro sensible trade and taking strong action against 
countries that break rules notably said would willing self initiate 
trade cases and highlighted the steel and aluminum industries segments that 
deserve attention believes occasionally initiating strategic cases will 
send message that the doc getting more serious about these issues while 
accelerating the process additionally would reduce the time process cases 
not granting extensions alleged dumpers who refuse cooperate with the 
investigations and stated would not look very kindly those deliberately 
delaying cases also noted that would allocate more personnel and that 
starting cases the doc would more important activity then has been 
historically 
other key benefits steel could come from crackdown duty 
circumvention the use shell companies the importer record veteran 
the steel industry ross well aware the intricacies trade cases and 
the problems that china overcapacity has caused the industry along with selfinitiating cases ross would want take actions that ensure countervailing 
duties are collected and that shell companies can used evade them this 
would make cases more effective our opinion traders would have greater 
concern over financial risk once case initiated additionally the new 
administration could encourage more aggressive approach the vietnam 
circumvention case and the section case against china positive ruling 
either could benefit the average price steel coming into the separately 
president trump nominee for ustr robert lighthizer also has steel 
background has been working lawyer representing the steel industry 
trade cases for years 
our view think that the import price steel sets the price the and 
that any trade action that raises the price imported steel would lead 
increased domestic pricing which would clearly benefit steel companies 
under our coverage assume new policies will lead premium over 
the landed duty free cost and according our mid cycle valuations the 
premium not yet priced into the stocks
