midterms update base consolidation 
since last publishing october seen further evidence our base case 
playing out third party averages have increased from chance our 
blue house scenario democrats take the house and republicans maintain their 
majority the senate although our base case looking more likely critical note 
that there combined one third probability something other than divided 
government see what goes blue and red reflections 
what driving the base case democrats continue show approximately 
percentage point lead the generic ballot they also exhibited strong fundraising 
results across large number house races the five thirty eight house classic model 
now estimates that they have chance winning the house increase over 
percentage points from the first time published september 
the senate there has been some movement individual races yet that movement 
has moved toward republicans some cases and toward democrats others hence 
the overall probabilities have held about steady the five thirty eight senate model 
shows that republicans have chance holding the senate the implication 
these polls that nationwide democratic enthusiasm likely not enough save all 
their vulnerable seats and pick seats target states

voters will choose their governor states this year polls indicate that more 
governorships will swing the democratic party hence received number 
questions what policy changes expect think that gubernatorial races 
isolation matter very little muni credit since the budget process complex 
negotiation led the state legislature this general lesson applies specific issuers 
well for example can group many gubernatorial races this cycle into two buckets 
that might matter muni credit medicaid expanders and budget repairers both 
cases the fixes that the new governors may want employ face meaningful legislative 
barriers hence the election outcome not clear catalyst for muni credit and 
investors interested either medicaid infrastructure expansion 
medicaid expanders democratic gubernatorial candidates florida georgia and 
wisconsin are campaigning expanding medicaid expansion does not seem likely 
however barring upsets state assembly races right now republicans have majorities 
all three state legislatures 
budget repairers investors are closely watching races illinois and connecticut given 
each state long standing budget problems both states face the challenge how 
pay for decades unpaid pension expense these problems developed over numerous 
political administrations they cannot fixed either mathematically legally 
single governor term the national conference state legislatures does not 
categorize the legislatures illinois and connecticut low pay small staff instead 
both have semi professional legislators and moderate size professional legislative 
staff our view this makes the governor office less central the budget process 
and extension makes the governor less important muni credit quality

and florida caution against inferring too much from tax related ballot initiatives
